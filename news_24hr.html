The newly created Pakistan Land Port Authority will act as a central platform for coordinating between multiple border management agencies. Its mandate includes facilitating the smooth movement of goods and passengers across land ports, reducing delays, and ensuring more efficient trade flows.
With this development, Pakistan becomes the third country in South Asia, after Bangladesh and India, to establish a dedicated land port authority.
The authority will introduce a robust mechanism to coordinate effectively with border management agencies, streamline trade facilitation, and enhance cross-border connectivity. It will also play a vital role in meeting Pakistan’s obligations under international agreements and conventions.
 
 

The establishment of the Pakistan Land Port Authority marks a significant step towards strengthening the country’s regional trade integration, improving border management, and enhancing economic connectivity with neighbouring countries.
Change in 11th NFC
In another significant development, President Asif Ali Zardari has approved a change in the constitution of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC).
According to the Presi­dency, the change became necessary after the government of Balochistan revised its nomination, recommending Mahfooz Ali Khan as its non-ex officio member in the 11th NFC.
The president accorded approval to this nomination, superseding the earlier approval.
The Balochistan government earlier withdrew the nomination of Farmanullah Khan, former CEO of the Balochistan Investment Board, and instead nominated Mahfooz Ali Khan to represent the province in the NFC.
This will be Mahfooz Ali Khan’s fourth term representing Balochis­tan in the NFC, as he has previously represented the province in the 5th, 6th and 7th NFCs.
He also held significant roles in the provincial government, including serving as an additional secretary and secretary of finance for six years. He retired as a Grade-21 officer in 2014 after serving as Balochistan’s secretary of finance.
In addition, he has held key positions such as Accounts General of Balochistan, Controller Military Accounts, and Director General of the National Institute of Manage­ment (NIM) Balochistan.
Petroleum Bill
President Zardari has also asse­nted to the Petroleum (Amendment) Bill, 2025, as passed by parliament.
The Act strengthens measures against smuggling and illegal operation of petrol pumps.
It empowers deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, and customs authorities to confiscate illegal petroleum products and vehicles, introduces IT-based tracking, and enhances penalties for violations.
The legislation is expected to modernise petroleum sector regulation, improve transparency, and strengthen the government’s effor­­ts against smuggling and tax evasion.
Besides, the president has also given his assent to the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025, as passed by parliament.

• Transport alliance urges Punjab administrations to install diversion signs for container trucks
• Fertiliser shipments via flood-hit river corridors suspended
• Movement on highways still smooth
• Onion, potato supplies to Karachi decline
KARACHI: As various goods for import, export, and local consumption continue to move smoothly on motorways and highways, goods’ transporters have claimed that the ravaging floods in Punjab are causing delays on other routes.
They said shipments from the port city of Karachi to different parts of Punjab, as well as consignments arriving from Punjab to Karachi, are being delayed.
All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance President Nisar Hussain Jafri said that over the last three days, the supply chain has faced delays of two to three days. He added that excluding motorway routes, shipments of goods (both import and export items) from Karachi to various areas of Punjab usually take two to three days under normal conditions. The same time is spent on the return of empty or loaded containers from Punjab.
He said goods carriers are facing problems as the city governments in various areas of Punjab have not displayed diversion signs for container trucks. As a result, carriers often reach points where they cannot proceed further. He urged the administrations to install diversion signs to save diesel and time.
‘Fertiliser supply via flood-hit areas suspended’
Executive Director of the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council (FMPAC), retired Brig Shershah Malik, said shipments passing through flood-affected areas such as Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab had almost been suspended. However, the fertiliser movement on motorways and highways was still smooth, but “if floods prolong, fertiliser movement and consumption will definitely be impacted.
“In the next two to three days, floods will cross Multan and on Sept 6, 2025, will enter Sindh. After that, the actual ground situation will become clear,” he said.
He added that shipments to sales points in river corridors and across the rivers had been suspended, though fertiliser application in those areas had also stopped. Hence, there was no immediate chance of shortage in flood-affected regions.
President of the Falahi Anjuman Wholesale Vegetable Market, Super Highway, New Subzi Mandi, Haji Shahjehan, said onion supply from Balochistan and potato supply from cold storages had declined in Karachi due to rains and floods. Oil Companies Advi­sory Council (OCAC) Secretary General Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi said he had not yet noticed any disruption in oil supplies to the upcountry. “I do not know what will happen in the next couple of days,” he added.
Pakistan Pharm­aceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) Chai­rman Tauqeer-ul-Haq said that so far there had been no reports of supply disruption and that the supply of medical goods was continuing normally.
‘Floods pose risk to agri output’
Mohammad Shahroz of Insight Securities said recent flooding in KP and Punjab posed risks to agricultural output and supply chains, which could reignite supply-side inflationary pressures. “It is important to safeguard the nascent stabilisation and strengthen the economic base before shifting gears to growth,” he added.
He estimated headline inflation at 4.1pc for Aug 2025 compared to 9.6pc in the same month last year and 4.1pc in July 2025. On a month-on-month basis, inflation is expected to rise 0.4pc due to higher food prices, though this has been partly offset by lower electricity charges and declining LPG prices.

Sources said militants ambushed Bara Rifles’ 163 Wing in Upper Dir’s Barawal tehsil, leading to a fierce exchange of fire. The checkpost, which is a few hundred metres from the Afghanistan border, was initially overrun by the militants, but they were later repulsed by local volunteers who also joined the fight.
At least three soldiers laid down their lives, while three sustained injuries and moved to a nearby hospital. There were also reports of militant casualties as well, but it could not be confirmed.
The incident comes at a time of heightened militant activity in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s border districts, where security personnel and civilians have increasingly come under attack in recent weeks, rai­sing concerns among residents about the deteriorating law and order situation.
In Kohat’s Lachi tehsil, a police patrol came under fire, leading to the death of one policeman and injuries to two others. In a subsequent search operation, the police gunned down three militants. The identification process of the murdered militants was in progress, the police said.
He added that an operation was in progress to round up the injured militants while intense fighting with the militants was going on in the Paya area near the Hangu border.
In a separate attack in Mohmand, a police constable and two sustained injuries when militants attacked a post in the Pandiali tehsil on Saturday. DPO Ikramullah said that the attack occurred during a search operation in the Dawezai area of Pandiali tehsil. He said Constable Mohammad Arif was martyred in the attack, while constables Hayat and Ibrar were injured.
 
 

Sources said that the police and security forces continued a search and strike operation in different areas of Mohmand district, during which several suspected hideouts were destroyed.
Three killed in IBO
Separately, the security forces killed three terrorists, including a key commander, in an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Loni area of Kulachi tehsil in Dera Ismail Khan.
According to the military’s media wing, the operation was launched following credible intelligence regarding the presence of militants in the area. During an intense exchange of fire, three militants were killed while a cache of arms and ammunition was also recovered from their possession.

• Authorities execute controlled breaches along Chenab River to save critical barrages, bridges, and major urban centres
• Urban flooding in KP areas leaves neighbourhoods submerged; minor dies in Peshawar
• Ghizer district faces increased flood risk due to glacier melt, PMD issues alert
LAHORE/ PESHAWAR / GILGIT: While severe flooding in Sutlej, Ravi, and Chenab rivers prompted mass evacuations across Punjab, the situation aggravated due to a renewed spell of downpour and a barrage breach in India, leaving Sindh to revise flood displacement estimate, now projecting over 1.65 million people at risk along both banks of the Indus River.
In the country’s northern parts, glacier melting threatened further floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Ghizer district as per Met Office warning and some Khyber Pakhtunkhwa areas, including Peshawar, recorded urban flooding amid heavy rains.
Authorities in Punjab are grappling with what they call an unprecedented hydrological crisis, as the Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) and Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) report dangerously high water levels across key river sites, with several nearing or exceeding critical levels.
Millions of residents in low-lying areas of Punjab are being relocated as authorities struggle to manage what officials describe as an unprecedented hydrological crisis.
The combined inflow from the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers continues to pose a severe threat to downstream regions, including Multan and Muzaffargarh. The flows from the three rivers are now halfway through Punjab.
 
 

At 6:30pm, the water levels have risen to 524.20 feet, dangerously close to the critical threshold of 526 feet at the Rivaz Bridge on the Chenab River.
Water flow
According to the FFD data as of 12am on Sunday, the water flow at Marala and Khanki headworks on the Chenab River was 95,152 cusecs and 229,100 cusecs, respectively.
Qadirabad Headworks was steady at 203,862 cusecs, and so was Trimmu Headworks at 184,108 cusecs.
The Ravi River is also exhibiting alarming trends. Balloki Headworks was steady at an extremely high volume of 211,395 cusecs, while the flow at Shahdara was falling and stood at 90,500 cusecs. Jassar was also steady at 95,580 cusecs while Sidhnai was rising at 30,481 cusecs.
The Sutlej River continues to flow at exceptionally high levels. Ganda Sing Wala was steady at 253,068 cusecs, Sulemanki Headworks at 154,219 cusecs and Islam Headworks at 68,058 cusecs. Panjnad Headworks was rising at 73,166 cusecs.
On the Indus River, the outflow was recorded at 344,723 cusecs at Guddu Barrage, 256,660 at Sukkur Barrage and 236,223 at Kotri Barrage — all being in the “low flood” category.
Dykes breached
In a high-stakes operation to manage an unprecedented flood wave, provincial authorities were executing controlled breaches of protective dykes along the Chenab River at several locations. The strategy was followed to sacrifice thousands of acres of land to save critical barrages, bridges, and major urban centres in Jhang, Hafizabad, Sheikhupura, Nankana, and Kasur.
Around 850,000 cusecs of water were expected to reach Trimmu Barrage on Saturday night, and a controlled breach of the protective dyke was planned to save the headworks if the water levels exceed its capacity.
The authorities also installed ammunition in two flood dykes near Rangpur and Head Muhammad Wala, in case the flow increased to threaten Multan and Muzaffargarh within a day or two.
Speaking to the media, Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia warned that very high to exceptionally high floods will continue in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers until Sept 3.
According to the Flood For­eca­sting Division, under the influence of a monsoon low over north Madhya Pradesh, heavy to very heavy rainfall with extremely heavy falls is expected over the upper catchments of the Sutlej, Bias and Ravi rivers from Sept 2-3.
Mr Kathia said that an exceptionally high flood level will continue in the Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala, while the Chenab at Trimmu is expected to attain an exceptionally high flood level during Saturday night. He said that the Chenab at Panjnad is expected to attain a very high flood level on Sep 3.
The PDMA chief said floodwaters in Punjab’s rivers right now would meet at Head Panjnad on the night of Sept 4. “It will have a total intensity of 875,000-925,000 cusecs,” he said while speaking to the media.
He forecasted that the waters would then reach the Guddu barrage on Sept 6, with a high intensity of 975,000 to 1,050,000 cusecs due to possible rains.
He said that the floodwaters at Ganda Singh Wala on the Sutlej River right now would reach Head Sulemanki in the next 24-36 hours and “achieve a peak”. Water flow would increase at Head Islam near Vehari in the next 48-55 hours.
Noting that there had been more rain, Mr Kathia said more water flows had entered from India into the Chenab River, leading to a medium-level flood at Marala.
Meanwhile, evacuations in low-lying areas of Pindi Bhattian, Chiniot, Hafizabad, Alipur Chatha, Jhang, Sillanwali, Athara Hazari, Rungpur, Khanewal, Kabirwala, Multan, Shujaabad, Jalalpur Pirwala and Muzaffargarh are ongoing.
Multan Commissioner Aamir Karim Khan said that as many as 261,747 people were evacuated from the division, including 238,419 from Multan, 2,307 from Vehari, 17,068 from Khanewal and 3,953 from Lodhran. As many as 255,538 cattle were also evacuated.
The daily flood situation report, submitted to South Punjab Additional Chief Secretary and seen by Dawn, states that 478,270 people were affected and 514,434 acres of cropland were damaged due to flood in Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur divisions due to flood in Indus and Sutlej rivers. Over 267,683 acres of land were lost due to flooding in the Indus River in the DG Khan division.
Over 383,000 people and 140,000 livestock were evacuated, and 507 relief camps were established after a flood alert in the Chenab River.
1.65m people in Sindh at risk
Meanwhile, the Sindh government has revised its earlier assessment on potential displacement due to floods, now estimating that over 1.65 million people living on both the right and left banks of the Indus River are at risk.
Just a day earlier, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority informed Sindh’s chief minister that more than 52,000 families could face displacement due to high water flows.
However, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, speaking at a press conference on Saturday, revised the figure, stating that the displacement risk could affect over 273,000 families, with 1,651 villages and 167 union councils at risk. He assured the public that the government was fully prepared to respond.
Also on Saturday, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah was assured that all the barrages were under control and that all necessary safety measures had been implemented.
Flooding in Peshawar
According to the PMD, the provincial capital received 41 millimetres of rain, whereas heavy rainfall in the catchment areas in Khyber district also swelled the Budni and other nullahs, submerging low-lying areas along Warsak Road, Safia Town, Regi Model Town and Nasir Bagh.
Rain waters entered several houses in these areas, forcing the residents to leave their homes for safer places.
Rescue 1122 said that a roof collapse in the Nahaqi area on Charsadda Road left a minor girl dead, while a wall collapse in the Faqir Killay area of Warsak Road left a person injured.
 
 

Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said that rescuers evacuated 300 individuals to safety. He said that the operations engaged over 280 rescue personnel equipped with water rescue vans, disaster-response vehicles, fire engines and ambulances.
He said that relief efforts focused heavily on vulnerable regions, inc­luding Nasir Bagh Road, Warsak Road and Budhni. “Rescue teams utilised rubber boats to safely evacuate elderly citizens, women, and children, prioritising their protection. Loudspeaker announcements along water channels were made to ad­­­vise people to stay vigilant and ta­­­ke precautionary measures,” he said.
Besides, he said that water levels at Budhni Nullah along Charsadda Road were gradually declining. Rescue 1122 teams have also been deployed in the Mian Gujar area.
KP’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority said that Budni nullah recorded medium-level floods after the rains. Water level in the nullah at Darmangi was recorded at 11,900 cusecs while Pir Bala stood at 9,000 cusecs.
In Khyber district, flash floods washed away a portion of the road in Jamrud as the region received torrential rains early on Saturday morning, suspending traffic on the Peshawar-Torkham Highway for several hours.
The road blockade also affected the integration of the returning Afghan nationals for nearly six hours at Torkham, as most vehicles carrying the Afghan returnees got stranded on the road at Katta Kushtha, where a portion of the road collapsed in gushing floodwaters.
The excessive rains and resulting floods in most water channels in Landi Kotal, Jamrud and Bara caused damage to houses, warehouses, shops and kiosks and swept away a motor car and damaging the boundary wall of a cricket academy in Bara.
Meanwhile, around two dozen students trapped in a flooded watercourse were rescued in the Lakki Marwat district on Saturday.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur directed officials to remain in the field until rescue and relief operations are complete and ensure the continuous presence of emergency teams until conditions return to normal.
According to the PMD, Cherat received 165mm of rain over the past 24 hours, while Kakul received 54mm, Peshawar 41mm, Balakot 14mm, Malam Jabba 10mm, Bannu 5mm, and Dera Ismail Khan 4mm.
Ghizer faces rising flood risk
The Provincial Emergency Operation Centre issued a “Risk of Excessive Glacier Melt in Ghizer” alert, stating that the temperature at the Darkut station in Yasin Valley had reached 35 degrees Celsius.
The PMD warned that this soaring temperature could lead to excessive glacier melt in the upper areas of Ghizer, heightening the risk of glacial floods, flash floods in streams and nullahs and potential inundation of low-lying settlements.
Resident Gul Sher told Dawn that people in these villages are living in tents without basic necessities. “We have no access to drinking water and our children’s education has been severely affected as schools have been damaged and roads to these institutions are blocked,” he said.

The tri-series of Twenty20 international matches is to tune up for the Asia Cup and features Pakistan, the UAE and Afghanistan. Each team will play the others twice, giving all sides at least four matches before the top two teams qualify for the final, scheduled on September 7.
Pakistan batted first after skipper Salman Agha won the toss and set a target of 208 for the UAE.
 






The UAE only managed to make 176 runs.
Salman had hit an unbeaten half-century and fast bowler Haris Rauf grabbed four wickets as Pakistan upstaged Afghanistan by 39 runs in the tri-series opener on Friday. Salman hit a 36-ball 53 not out with three sixes and as many boundaries, which lifted Pakistan to a solid 182-7 in their 20 overs.
Haris took 4-31 while fellow pacer Shaheen Afridi claimed 2-21, while spinners Mohammad Nawaz (2-23) and Sufiyan Muq­eem (2-25) dismissed Afghanistan for 143 in 19.5 overs before a noisy capacity 16,000 crowd at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.</p><small>2025-08-30 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/302241594ad60b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938474/trump-scraps-india-visit-for-quad-summit-amid-deteriorating-ties-report' target='_blank'><strong>Trump scraps India visit for Quad summit amid deteriorating ties: report</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump has scrapped plans to attend an upcoming summit of the ‘Quad’ grouping in India amid deteriorating ties between Washington and New Delhi, US newspaper The New York Times (NYT) reported on Saturday.
Relations between the two countries have plummeted, with 50 per cent levies on many Indian imports into the US taking effect this week as punishment for New Delhi’s massive purchases of Russian oil; a part of US efforts to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
 
 

As ties between both nations deteriorate, NYT reported on Saturday that the breakdown in relations was caused after a phone call on June 17.
“After telling [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi that he would travel to India later this year for the Quad summit, Mr Trump no longer has plans to visit in the fall, according to people familiar with the president’s schedule,” the NYT reported, citing “interviews with more than a dozen people in Washington and New Delhi”.
The NYT mentioned how Trump’s repeated claims about having ended the recent brief conflict between India and Pakistan reportedly “infuriated” Modi. The paper added that the dispute “dates back more than 75 years and is far deeper and more complicated than Mr Trump was making it out to be”.
India blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence, triggering a military escalation. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
“During a phone call on June 17, Mr Trump brought it up again, saying how proud he was of ending the military escalation,” the NYT reported.
“He mentioned that Pakistan was going to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize, an honour for which he had been openly campaigning. The not-so-subtle implication, according to people familiar with the call, was that Mr Modi should do the same.”
It added that the “bristled” Indian premier told Trump that American involvement had nothing to do with the ceasefire and the conflict had been settled directly between India and Pakistan.
“Mr Trump largely brushed off Mr Modi’s comments, but the disagreement — and Mr Modi’s refusal to engage on the Nobel — has played an outsize role in the souring relationship between the two leaders, whose once-close ties go back to Mr Trump’s first term,” the report reads, adding that the two leaders have not spoken since the June 17 phone conversation and Trump has only doubled down on taking credit for the ceasefire.
Amid this dispute, India has grown closer to Beijing and Moscow. Modi is currently in Tianjin, China, for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s Council of Heads of State summit, where he is expected to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“At its core, the story of Mr Trump and Mr Modi is about two brash, populist leaders with big egos and authoritarian tendencies, and the web of loyalties that help keep both men in power,” the NYT reported.
“But it is also the tale of an American president with his eye on a Nobel Prize, running smack into the immovable third rail of Indian politics: the conflict with Pakistan.”
Bloomberg reported earlier this month that Modi turned down an invitation from Trump to visit the White House after a G7 meeting in Canada, over concerns that he would set up a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was visiting the US at the time.
Reporting the same, NYT said: “Modi declined an invitation from Mr Trump to stop by Washington before he flew home. His officials were scandalised that Mr Trump might try to force their leader into a handshake with Pakistan’s army chief, who had also been invited to the White House for lunch around the same time. It was another clear sign, a senior Indian official said, that Mr Trump cared little for the complexity of their issue or the sensitivities and history around it.”
 
 

The COAS carried out two visits to the US. The first, in June, saw him meet Trump at the White House for luncheon, making him the first sitting army chief to do so.
The field marshal termed his second visit to the US in just one-and-a-half months a “new dimension” in ties between Washington and Islamabad. During this trip, the COAS engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora.
Pakistan and the US also finalised a trade deal at the start of August, lowering tariffs to 19pc from the previously announced 29pc and helping develop Pakistan’s oil reserves while trade talks between the US and India have stalled.</p><small>2025-08-30 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/302105073b9c955.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938470/prime-minister-of-yemens-houthi-government-killed-in-israeli-strike-media-report' target='_blank'><strong>Prime minister of Yemen’s Houthi government killed in Israeli strike: media report</strong></a><br><p>The prime minister of Yemen’s Houthi government and several other ministers were killed in an Israeli strike on the capital Sanaa, the news agency run by the group said on Saturday, citing a statement by the head of the Houthi Supreme Political Council, Mahdi al-Mashat.
A number of others were wounded in the strike, carried out on Thursday, it said without providing details.
Israel said on Friday that the airstrike had targeted the Iran-aligned group’s chief of staff, defence minister and other senior officials and that it was verifying the outcome.
 






The Houthi-run news agency ran a statement from the defence minister shortly after it confirmed the prime minister’s death and quoted him as saying the group was ready to confront Israel.
The statement did not mention Thursday’s airstrike and it was unclear if it was made before or after the attack.
Ahmad Ghaleb al-Rahwi became prime minister nearly a year ago, but the de facto leader of the government was his deputy, Mohamed Moftah, who was assigned on Saturday to carry out the prime minister’s duties.
Rahwi was seen largely as a figurehead who was not part of the inner circle of the Houthi leadership.
The Israeli military said its fighter jets had struck a compound in the Sanaa area where senior Houthi figures had gathered, describing the attack as a “complex operation” made possible by intelligence-gathering and air superiority.
On Thursday, Israeli security sources said the targets had been various locations where a large number of senior Houthi officials had gathered to watch a televised speech recorded by leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi.
The Iran-aligned Houthis have attacked vessels in the Red Sea in what they describe as acts of solidarity with the Palestinians in Gaza. They have also fired missiles towards Israel, most of which have been intercepted. Israel has responded with strikes on Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, including the vital Hodeidah port.
“We remain steadfast in our genuine position of supporting and standing with the people of Gaza, and in building and developing the capabilities of our armed forces to confront all challenges and dangers,” Mahdi al-Mashat’s statement said.</p><small>2025-08-30 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/30165810b26f8f0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938378/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-tianjin-for-sco-summit-modi-touches-down-in-china-after-7-year-gap' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in Tianjin for SCO summit; Modi touches down in China after 7-year gap</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Saturday he looked forward to meeting Chinese President Xi Jinping along with other world leaders as he arrived in China to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also touched down on his first visit after a seven-year gap.
The SCO summit, to be held in the northern port city of China’s Tianjin on Sunday and Monday, will gather more than 20 world leaders in a powerful show of Global South solidarity, including Russian President Vladimir Putin. The SCO comprises China, India, Russia, Pakistan, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Another 16 countries are affiliated as observers or “dialogue partners”.
PM Shehbaz arrived in Tianjin with Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar.
 






Terming his visit “historic”, PM Shehbaz said on X today: “I look forward to meeting H.E. President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to further build upon our bilateral ties with China, our All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partner, as well as with other key countries of the region […]”
The premier expressed his aim to “enhance regional cooperation, strengthen multilateralism, and advance shared goals for peace and prosperity”.
 






According to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO) today, the premier is leading a delegation from Pakistan to participate in the SCO’s Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit from August 31 to September 1.
“The SCO CHS Summit will bring together heads of state and government from SCO member states, including Pakistan, Belarus, China, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan,” the statement read.
Leaders from Mongolia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Nepal, Turkiye, Egypt, the Maldives, Myanmar and others, as well as the chief of the United Nations and heads of various regional and international organisations, will also attend as part of the expanded format.
“At the SCO CHS Summit, Prime Minister Sharif will present Pakistan’s perspectives on pressing regional and global issues, highlighting strategies to strengthen the SCO’s role in fostering regional cooperation and stability,” the FO stated.
 






PM Shehbaz is slated to reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to promoting multilateralism, enhancing regional security and advancing sustainable development, the FO said. He is also expected to have bilateral meetings with other SCO leaders and invited members to “strengthen diplomatic relations”.
On the engagements in China, the FO said the prime minister would hold meetings with President Xi and Premier Li Qiang “during which multifaceted dimensions of Pakistan-China bilateral cooperation would be discussed”.
“He would also attend the military parade with President Xi and other world leaders being held in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World’s Anti-Fascist War,” the FO added.
PM Shehbaz, as per the statement, would “interact with reputed Chinese businessmen and corporate executives to discuss bilateral trade, economic and investment ties”. He would also address a Pakistan-China B2B Investment Conference in Beijing.
The statement highlighted that the visit was a part of leadership-level exchanges between the two countries.
“It manifests the importance attached by the two countries to further deepen their All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, reaffirm support on issues of respective core interests, advance Phase-II of CPEC and maintain regular communication on important regional and global developments,” FO said.
 






Ahead of Pakistan’s participation in the summit, FM Dar also posted on X, saying: “Pakistan’s all-weather strategic partnership with China is anchored in trust and strategic alignment. We value President Xi’s leadership and initiatives such as the Belt and Road, and the Global Development, Security & Civilisation Initiatives, which continue to transform economies and strengthen regional integration.”
He added: “The SCO has become a pivotal Eurasian platform, advancing cooperation in security, trade, energy, connectivity, and culture under the principles of mutual trust and shared development.”
In today’s multipolar world, FM Dar said, the SCO’s role in promoting multilateralism, stability, and inclusive growth is more vital than ever.
 






Leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia have been invited to the 25th SCO Heads of State Council.
Last week, the government said that PM Shehbaz’s visit to China will mark the formal launch of the second phase of the China­-Pakistan Economic Corr­idor (CPEC-II), focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.
“Prime minister’s upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC Phase-II, with both sides expected to set clear priorities and agree on tangible, measurable outcomes,” an official announcement had said, quoting Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, focal person on the multi-billion-dollar bilateral initiative.
In July, the two countries decided to form technical working groups to explore and implement projects focusing on high-yield cotton seed development, advanced water-saving irrigation technologies, and modern farming techniques.
Modi’s visit after 7-year break
Modi also arrived in Tianjin on his first visit to China since 2018, coming straight after a trip to Japan, which pledged to invest $68 billion in India.
 






China and India, the world’s two most populous nations, are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia and fought a deadly border clash in 2020.
A thaw began last October when Modi met with President Xi for the first time in five years at a summit in Russia.
Xi began welcoming leaders, including Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Egyptian Premier Moustafa Madbouly.
Russian President Vladimir Putin is also due to arrive in Tianjin ahead of the summit.
China and Russia have used the SCO — sometimes touted as a counter to the Western-dominated Nato military alliance — to deepen ties with Central Asian states.
Other leaders, including Iranian and Turkish presidents Masoud Pezeshkian and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, will also attend the bloc’s largest meeting since its founding in 2001.
Multiple bilateral meetings are expected to be held on the sidelines of the summit.
The Kremlin said on Friday that Putin will discuss the Ukraine conflict with Erdogan on Monday.
Turkiye has hosted three rounds of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine this year that have failed to break the deadlock over how to end the conflict, triggered when Moscow launched its invasion of its pro-European neighbour in February 2022.
Putin will also meet with his Iranian counterpart Pezeshkian to discuss Tehran’s nuclear programme on Monday, a meeting that comes as Iran faces fresh Western pressure.
Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, triggered a “snapback” mechanism on Thursday to reinstate UN sanctions on Iran for failing to comply with commitments made in a 2015 deal over its nuclear programme.
Russia’s foreign ministry warned that the reimposition of sanctions against Iran risked “irreparable consequences”.
Tehran and Moscow have been bolstering political, military and economic ties over the past decade as Russia drifted away from the West.

It was the second time this year she has had to flee, after abandoning her home during cross-border fighting between India and Pakistan in May.
“How many times do we need to evacuate now?” the 30-year-old mother said, her husband away ferrying their 10 cows to higher ground on a boat. “We lost out on so much during the war like school days for the children, and now the water is forcing us out again. Trouble is trouble.”

Shama’s ordeal is echoed across flood-hit Kasur, where families say they are exhausted by repeated displacements within months, first from the fighting, now from nature.
“The floods started earlier this month and only got worse,” said 27-year-old mother Bibi Zubaida, who lives with seven relatives in a three-bedroom house opposite a mosque that now broadcasts evacuation calls.
From the mosque loudspeakers, usually reserved for the call to prayer, came a different message: boats were ready for anyone who wanted to leave.
“When you live here, you choose to live with the threat of war and the threat of floods. Where does one go?” Zubaida said.
Kasur lies just a few kilometres from the Indian border. From their rooftops and rescue boats, residents said they could see Indian checkposts across the horizon, a reminder of how closely their fate is tied to decisions made on the other side.

The nations share rivers that were regulated for more than six decades under the Indus Waters Treaty. That agreement was suspended by India earlier this year, following the shooting of 26 people by militants that New Delhi said were backed by Islamabad, which Pakistan denies.
That attack triggered brief but intense cross-border battles between the nuclear-armed neighbours, driving villagers like Shama from their homes.
Then came the monsoon, and the rivers turned to flood.
On narrow wooden boats, families balanced motorcycles, belongings, and bleating goats alongside their children, as rescue workers steered them through fields now turned into rivers.
Rescue worker Muhammad Arsalan said many villagers hesitated to evacuate.
“People don’t always want to leave because they’re scared of thieves stealing what they’re leaving behind. They’re reluctant because they’ve done it so many times already,” said Arsalan, who has ferried more than 1,500 people to safety by boat in recent days.
“They love their goats and sheep, and sometimes refuse to leave without them,” he added, pausing to clear leaves stuck in the motor before restarting another run.
The Punjab provincial disaster management authority said flows in the Sutlej River at Ganda Singh Wala were the highest in decades, after a breach at an Indian barrage. At least 28 deaths have been reported so far, with water pushing further south through Punjab and threatening new areas.

In India, cloud bursts in Ramban and Mahore regions of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir killed 10 people. Pakistani officials said the crisis was worsened by India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, halting the decades-old exchange of river data.
Islamabad also accused India of releasing large volumes of water without adequate warning.
“If the treaty was in operation, we could have managed the impact better,” Pakistan’s Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told Reuters on Friday.
India has denied deliberately flooding Pakistan. It has blamed incessant monsoon rains and said it issued multiple flood alerts. Two gates of the Madhopur barrage on the Ravi River were damaged by surging water, Indian officials said.
Farmers say the deluge has wrecked their livelihoods. “Thirteen of my 15 acres are gone,” said Muhammad Amjad, a rice and vegetable grower. “Women and children are mainly evacuated. Men stay behind to guard whats left.”
The back-to-back displacements have underscored the vulnerability of communities straddling Pakistan’s volatile eastern border.
Officials warn the crisis could worsen as climate change intensifies monsoons and cross-border river disputes strain disaster planning.
“I’ve seen many floods, but they are coming too often now,” said Nawabuddin, a 74-year-old landowner, recalling the most memorable floods he witnessed in his lifetime — 1988, 2023 and now this one.
“We don’t want war, we don’t want excess water. We just want to live,” said Zubaida, whose newly renovated home and farmland now lie underwater.

Pakistan’s seafood exports rose to $465 million in FY25, reflecting a 13.4 per cent increase in value and an 8pc growth in quantity compared to last year, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) in July.
According to a press release by the maritime ministry, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) classified all Pakistani fisheries listed on its List of Foreign Fisheries as “comparable” under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA).
“This classification confirms that Pakistan’s fisheries meet US standards for protecting marine mammals from incidental mortality and serious injury during fishing operations,” Chaudhry was quoted as saying.
The MMPA required fisheries to “minimise marine mammal bycatch, adopt conservation practices, and sustainably operate measures” for supporting healthier marine ecosystems, the press release read.
“The decision reflects international recognition of the quality of Pakistan’s seafood and will provide long-term stability to the sector,” the minister said.
“The extension is expected to bolster our position in the global seafood market, securing access to one of the world’s largest seafood importers,” he added.
The maritime ministry further said that the current seafood earnings were about $2 per kilogramme in the global market, noting that “with this international endorsement of compliance, the price is projected to rise, potentially opening new markets in Europe and the Gulf.”
It stated that Pakistan exported 242,484 metric tons of seafood products worth $489.2 million at an average of $2 per kilogramme. “The same export volume next year could generate nearly $600 million.”
Chaudhry called the successful submission of a comprehensive compliance dossier to NOAA “a critical milestone”. “This acceptance validates Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to regulate its commercial fisheries, uphold sustainable fishing practices, and align with international environmental standards,” he added.
The minister highlighted that the approval was “vital” to protect multi-million-dollar seafood exports to the US market and enhance the country’s reputation for responsible and sustainable fisheries management. Chaudhry also emphasised “strengthening protective measures for marine mammal populations” to ensure the long-term health of marine biodiversity.
Earlier this month, the Ministry of Commerce noted that Pakistan’s exporters were poised to gain a significant competitive advantage in the US market after the government successfully negotiated a reduction in reciprocal tariffs — from 29pc to 19pc — the lowest rate in the region.
Commerce Minister Jam Kamal had said the revised tariff structure presents a timely opportunity to boost exports and appreciated the coordinated efforts of the government’s economic team, along with private sector support, in achieving this milestone.</p><small>2025-08-30 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3016362667262ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938440/new-250-visa-fee-risks-deepening-us-travel-slump' target='_blank'><strong>New $250 visa fee risks deepening US travel slump</strong></a><br><p>A new $250 “visa integrity fee” imposed on travellers to the United States risks piling more pressure on the struggling travel industry, as overseas arrivals continue to fall due to President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration and hostility to many foreign countries.
Overseas travel to the US fell 3.1 per cent year-on-year in July to 19.2 million visitors, according to US government data. It was the fifth month of decline this year, defying expectations that 2025 would see annual inbound visitors finally surpass the pre-pandemic level of 79.4m.
 
 

The new visa fee, set to go into effect on October 1, adds an additional hurdle for travellers from non-visa waiver countries such as Mexico, Argentina, India, Brazil and China. The extra charge raises the total visa cost to $442, one of the highest visitor fees in the world, according to the US Travel Association, a membership organisation.
“Any friction we add to the traveller experience is going to cut travel volumes by some amount,” said Gabe Rizzi, President of Altour, a global travel management company. “As the summer ends, this will become a more pressing issue, and we’ll have to factor the fees into travel budgets and documentation.”
International visitor spending in the US is projected to fall below $169 billion this year, down from $181bn in 2024, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.
The visa fee reinforces a bleak perception of the US under Trump, whose immigration policies, cuts to foreign aid and sweeping tariffs have eroded America’s appeal as a destination — even with major events such as the 2026 FIFA World Cup and Los Angeles 2028 Olympics on the horizon.
The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed government regulation that aims to tighten the duration of visas for students, cultural exchange visitors and members of the media.
In early August, the administration said the US could require bonds of up to $15,000 for some tourist and business visas under a pilot programme effective August 20 that will last for approximately a year, in an effort to crack down on visitors overstaying their visas.
Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics consultancy, forecast in December 2024 that overseas travel to the US in 2025 would increase more than 10pc year-over-year. Instead, it is on track to fall 3pc, said Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics.
“We see it as a sustained setback, and we anticipate much of it is in place throughout the administration,” Ryan said.
Hardest hit
The newest visa fee is likely to hit hardest in Central and South American countries that have been a rare bright spot for US travel this year.
As of May, travel from Mexico to the US was up nearly 14pc in 2025, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office.
Arrivals from Argentina rose 20pc and from Brazil 4.6pc year-to-date. Overall, travel from Central America grew 3pc and from South America 0.7pc, compared with a decline of 2.3pc from Western Europe.

In China, arrivals have remained muted since the pandemic, with July numbers still 53pc below 2019 levels. The visa fee also threatens travel from India, where visits are down 2.4pc so far this year, driven by a near 18pc drop in students.
For some, the rise in fees will be absorbed as just another cost in an already expensive trip to the US.
“The US has always been selective about its visitors. If your financial standing isn’t up to par, getting a visa is tough anyway,“ said Su Shu, founder of Chinese firm Moment Travel in Chengdu.
As foreign visitors face higher entry fees, US travellers worry about stricter requirements being imposed abroad, said James Kitchen, travel agent and owner of Seas 2 Day & Travel.
“Travellers have expressed concern around reciprocal fees that may be imposed in the coming months,” Kitchen said.</p><small>2025-08-30 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621089-geo-news-team-assaulted-during-faisalabad-flood-coverage' target='_blank'><strong>Geo News team assaulted during Faisalabad flood coverage</strong></a><br><p>

Southeast Asia’s biggest economy was rocked by protests in major cities including the capital Jakarta on Friday after footage spread of a motorcycle taxi driver being run over by a police tactical vehicle in earlier rallies against low wages and financial perks for lawmakers.
Protests in Makassar, the biggest city on the eastern island of Sulawesi, descended into chaos outside the provincial and local city council buildings, which were both set on fire as demonstrators hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails.
Three people were killed as a result of the fire at the Makassar city council, its secretary Rahmat Mappatoba told AFP.
“They were trapped in the burning building,” he said, accusing protesters of igniting the blaze.
“Usually during a demonstration, protesters only throw rocks or burn a tyre in front of the office. They never stormed into the building or burned it.”
Two workers at the city council died at the scene and a third person, a civil servant, died in hospital.
At least four people were injured in the fire and were being treated at hospital, Rahmat added.
Hundreds of people were seen in footage posted by local media cheering and clapping as fire engulfed the building on Friday with few security forces in sight.
One man was heard shouting: “There are people upstairs!”
In footage verified by AFP, smouldering debris was seen falling from the roof of the city council building surrounded by palm trees as charred cars flickered with flames.
Inside protesters lit several fires as parts of the building collapsed, while others smashed glass and chanted “revolution”.
By Saturday, the building appeared to be a blacked-out wreck, with dozens of charred cars around it, as a crowd of locals turned up to inspect the scene, footage broadcast by local media showed.
Other images showed the South Sulawesi provincial council building ablaze overnight. Protesters had tried to knock down the gate and storm the building.
Makassar and South Sulawesi police did not immediately respond to AFP’s requests for comments.
Prabowo test
In Jakarta on Friday, hundreds massed outside the headquarters of the elite Mobile Brigade Corp (Brimob) paramilitary police unit they blamed for motorcycle gig driver Affan Kurniawan’s death the day before.
Protesters threw firecrackers as police responded with tear gas.
One group of demonstrators tried to tear down the gates of the unit, long accused of heavy-handed tactics, and pulled a sign from the building’s facade.
Police said they had detained seven officers for questioning in connection with Affan’s death.
The protests were the biggest and most violent of Prabowo Subianto’s presidency, a key test for the leader less than a year into his rule.
He has urged calm, and ordered an investigation into the driver’s death and that the officers involved be held accountable.
In a message posted on Instagram on Friday, Prabowo said the government was “committed to guaranteeing the livelihood” of the driver’s family, posting images with them at their home.
“In situations like this, I urge the public to remain calm and to trust the government that I lead,” he wrote on a post on X.
 






He has pledged fast, state-driven growth but has already faced protests for widespread government budget cuts to fund his populist policies including a billion-dollar free meal programme.
Protests this week have spread to other major cities, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java, and Medan in North Sumatra province.</p><small>2025-08-30 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3015214955f6b91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938419/one-policeman-martyred-3-terrorists-killed-in-kohat-shootout' target='_blank'><strong>One policeman martyred, 3 terrorists killed in Kohat shootout</strong></a><br><p>At least one policeman was martyred and three terrorists were killed in a firing incident in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district, police said on Saturday.
According to Regional Police Officer Kohat Abbas Majeed Marwat, “One policeman was martyred and two others were injured in an operation against terrorists.”
He said, “Three terrorists have been killed and several others injured as police retaliated [against terrorists] in the mountains of Darmalak.” An operation is underway to arrest the injured terrorists, the official added.
“We will not let the sacrifices of our martyrs go in vain and our war against terrorism will continue.”
Earlier today, a statement from the Rescue 1122 read, “A tragic incident of firing on a police vehicle took place near the Darmalak police post in Kohat.”
As a result of the firing, one policeman was martyred on the spot and two policemen were injured, the statement said, adding that the injured officials were taken to Kohat District Headquarters Hospital.
Recent terrorist attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
Earlier this month, two Federal Constabulary personnel were martyred and 18 others were injured in a terrorist attack in KP’s Hangu district.
On August 14, five cops were martyred and another eight left injured as militants attacked police checkpoints at different locations across KP, including Peshawar, Upper Dir and Lower Dir.
Three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department in Bannu district in July.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-08-30 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621072-sindh-fears-over-16m-people-at-risk-amid-flood-threat' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh fears over 1.6m people at risk amid flood threat</strong></a><br><p>

The 11th NFC was constituted on August 22 to prepare a new award for sharing federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces.
Chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the NFC includes four provincial finance ministers and four non-statutory members, one from each province.
Its inaugural session, however, was postponed on the request of the Sindh government “due to the impending flood situation”.
As per the statement released today, the change became necessary after the “Government of Balochistan revised its nomination, recommending Mahfooz Ali Khan as its non ex-officio member in the 11th NFC”.
The statement added that the president has given the nod to this nomination, superseding the earlier approval.
The terms of reference set under clause 2 of Article 160 require the 11th NFC to distribute between the federation and provinces the net proceeds of five major tax categories as explained in clause 3 of Article 160.
These include: taxes on income (including corporation tax but excluding salaries paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund); taxes on the sale and purchase of imported, exported, produced, manufactured, or consumed goods; export duties on cotton and other duties as specified by the president; excise duties; and any other taxes specified by the president.
The notification for the 11th NFC also mandates recommendations on grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provinces, and on the exercise of borrowing powers by both tiers of government.
The new NFC is further tasked with considering sharing of expenditures incurred, or to be incurred, by the federation in respect of matters falling within the provinces’ domain; expenditures on trans-national issues; and financial responsibility for national projects to be shared by both the Centre and provinces.
This apparently indicates the Centre’s intention to push for provincial contributions toward natural calamities, horizontal health programmes, major dams, highways, and motorways. The federal government has also been advocating for an end to population-based incentives, replacing them with social sector performance, along with activation of local governments.
The NFC will also determine grants-in-aid from the Centre to the provinces, set borrowing powers and conditions for both, and assess resources required to meet expenditures of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and the newly merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (erstwhile Fata).</p><small>2025-08-30 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3012554201aede8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938410/lahore-atc-sends-imran-khans-triathlete-nephew-shahrez-to-jail-on-14-day-judicial-remand' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC sends Imran Khan’s triathlete nephew Shahrez to jail on 14-day judicial remand</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Saturday sent PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shahrez Khan to jail on judicial remand in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023 riots.

Advocate Rana Mudassar Umer and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja appeared as Shahrez’s counsel, while Imtiaz Ahmad Sipra was present as the prosecutor.
 
 

Sipra sought a further 30-day physical custody of Shahrez, while Umer urged the court to discharge his client from the case. Judge Gill denied the police’s request and ordered that Shahrez be sent to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.
“A cane has been recovered from the suspect’s possession,” the officer told the court, adding that Shahrez’s photogrammetry test had been conducted as well.
“Further investigation of the incident needs to be completed. Hence, further remand may be given,” Sipra said. He further said that Shahrez’s social media accounts also need to be verified, according to today’s court order, seen by Dawn.com.
Meanwhile, Advocate Umer filed a bail plea for Shahrez before the ATC. “No recovery of any kind was done from the suspect. The investigation has been completed,” the petition contended.
Terming Shahrez’s arrest “illegal”, the plea requested the court to order the triathlete’s release.
‘In Chitral on May 9’
Shahrez’s lawyers submitted photocopies of affidavits of seven people who either travelled with him or were residing at Chitral on May 9, according to the court order.
“Learned defence counsels representing the accused during the course of arguments have tendered some photographs, affidavits as well as detail of foreign trips of the accused,” the court order noted, adding that the defence lawyers had argued that Shahrez was not in Lahore from May 7 to May 12, 2023 but in Chitral.

According to the order, the investigating officer was asked whether he had considered the evidence, to which he replied that the documents were presented at about 12am, hence he could not verify or investigate them.
“This court is of the view that verification of social media accounts, air travel history and participation of the accused in international sports events could easily be verified and searched out through Google, social media and newspapers, etc, without taking into custody of the accused on physical remand.”
Judge Gill directed that Shahrez be presented before the court on September 13, and ordered the IO to submit the charge sheet by then.
During the hearing, Advocate Umer contended that the suspect was not present in Lahore on May 9, 2023 but was with family and friends in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chitral.
“The statement of the hotel manager where he stayed is also available,” Umer said.
“The suspect has been involved in this [case] because he is the PTI founder’s nephew,” the lawyer claimed. He added that no statement of Shahrez’s inclusion in the case was part of the record.
“Aleema Khan raises her voice for the PTI founder’s release. Aleema Khan’s son has been arrested to silence her voice,” Umer contended.
Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan have expressed their concerns over the arrests of Shahrez and Shershah, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
 
 

Shahrez’s wife has said her husband was in Chitral with her family on May 9, 2023, sharing purported pictures from the trip. At the same time, the PTI has challenged a video being shared of Shahrez, stating it was from the party’s public meeting in Kahna held on Sept 21, 2024, not from the 2023 riots.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests last week, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-08-30 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621044-war-then-water-punjab-border-villagers-face-back-to-back-evacuations' target='_blank'><strong>War then water: Punjab's border villagers face back-to-back evacuations</strong></a><br><p>

The 50 per cent levies on many Indian imports into the United States took effect this week as punishment for New Delhi’s massive purchases of Russian oil, part of US efforts to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
Since his return to the White House this year, US President Donald Trump has wielded tariffs as a wide-ranging policy tool, with the levies upending global trade.
Speaking at a construction industry event in New Delhi on Friday, Goyal said India was “always ready if anyone wants to have a free trade agreement with us”.
But, the trade minister added, India “will neither bow down nor ever appear weak”. “We will continue to move together and capture new markets.”
 
 

The latest tariffs salvo from Trump has strained US-India ties, with New Delhi earlier criticising the levies as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.
Trade talks between the two countries have stumbled over agriculture and dairy markets.
Trump wants greater US access, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is determined to shield India’s farmers, a huge voter bloc.
The US was India’s top export destination in 2024, with shipments worth $87.3 billion.
But analysts have cautioned that a 50pc duty is akin to a trade embargo and is likely to harm smaller firms.
Exporters of textiles, seafood and jewelry have already reported cancelled US orders and losses to rivals such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, raising fears of heavy job cuts.
Goyal said the government would be coming out with several measures in the coming days to support every sector and boost exports.
“I can say with confidence that India’s exports this year will exceed 2024-25 numbers,” he said.</p><small>2025-08-30 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621032-pro-ttp-elements-present-in-afghan-govt-says-dpm-ishaq-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pro-TTP elements present in Afghan govt: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

After hearing prosecutor Irfana Qadri, complainant counsel Bahzad Akbar and defence side, Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Zahoor Chandio, who was also the presiding officer of the Gender-Based Violence Court (South), found Muhammad Ramzan guilty of throwing acid on his sister Sughra after she refused to give up her share in the inheritance property to her brother.  
“This case involves a heinous crime, specifically targeting a woman with acid, an act that causes lifelong physical and psychological trauma. Such offences are not merely crimes against an individual but are a scourge on society and an affront to public policy,” the judge observed.  
The court also handed down additional sentences; two years’ imprisonment for injuring with a knife to the victim and four years each for attacking her sons — Naeem and Waseem — who had rushed to rescue their mother.  
The court also imposed a total compensation of Rs450,000 for injuring the victims.  
According to the state prosecutor, in November 2022 the victim had gone to her brother’s house in Manzoor Colony, where he (the accused) threw acid on her. However, she managed to escape and ran to a nearby house, but the accused chased her and again attacked her and her sons with a knife.  
The prosecutor further stated that the accused had lost his share of the inheritance in gambling and was putting pressure on his sister to hand over her share to him, and over her refusal, he threw acid on her.  
In its order, the court noted that the accused in his statement claimed innocence and denied the allegations.  
However, it added that the accused failed to provide any alternative version of the events or offer any plausible explanation for the injuries sustained by the victims.

This alarming situation has exposed serious lapses on the part of the Prisons Department and the Punjab Aids Control Programme (PACP).
Adiala has been in the headlines lately as former PM Imran Khan is also incarcerated there. However, it must be kept in mind that Mr Khan is kept in isolation and is not allowed to mingle with other inmates.
The prison is currently very overcrowded as well, housing 4,337 prisoners against its authorised capacity of 1,994.

PACP report reveals there are 645 infected individuals in Punjab’s 43 prisons; some of them are already receiving anti-retroviral therapy

The presence of such a large number of HIV-infected prisoners poses a grave risk to the health and lives of other inmates if immediate measures are not taken to curb the transmission of the virus.
 
 

Medical experts explain that HIV attacks the body’s immune system, and remains incurable.
“Once you contract the infection, your body cannot get rid of it. However, there are medicines that can control HIV and prevent complications. Everyone diagnosed with HIV should be placed on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART),” one medical expert said.
They expressed serious concern that if a high-profile prison like Adiala is struggling to contain the rapid spread of HIV/Aids, the situation in other jails could be even worse.
Numbers
The PACP report sheds light on the number of prisoners suffering from HIV/Aids across the province. It reveals that the number of HIV-positive inmates in all of Punjab’s 43 prisons has reached 645, with the highest number of cases being reported from Adiala Jail, where 148 inmates have tested positive for HIV.
According to official figures, 83 inmates were tested positive for the HIV/Aids in District Jail Lahore (also known as Camp Jail), followed by 37 in Central Jail Faisalabad, and 27 each in Central Jail Lahore (also known as Kot Lakhpat prison) and Central Jail Gujranwala.
 
 

In the remaining 38 prisons of Punjab, the combined number of HIV-positive inmates stands at 323. An official privy to the development claimed that several HIV-positive inmates were facing an interruption in the provision of medicines in the jails.
As per the PACP protocols, after screening process, jail authorities shift the suspected HIV patient to the ART centre of the district concerned, where the inmate undergoes further testing to confirmation the diagnosis.
It repeats tests using elaborate methods, and after confirmation that the inmate has tested positive, it shifts them back to prison, where the programme provides them with medicines for a three-month period.
PACP teams normally visit jails and perform screening of all inmates every six months or so.
Alarming situation
The HIV/Aids outbreak in the jails of Punjab, particularly, in Adiala, has caused alarm among PACP authorities.
This was evident from an official correspondence, wherein the PACP head immediately activated all the ART Centres established under the programme.
“All ART Centres shall undertake fortnightly visits to jails within their respective districts to ascertain the total number of HIV-positive patients registered from the jail and the number of those presently receiving Anti-Retroviral Therapy,” reads a letter issued by PACP Project Director Dr Summaira Ashraf.
She emphasised that the centres must ensure all registered jail patients continue to receive treatment without interruption and any gaps, deficiencies or challenges observed during the visit must be clearly identified and reported.
Talking to Dawn, Punjab Inspector General (Prisons) Mian Farooq Nazeer said the PACP had taken over responsibility of screening all new inmates for various diseases, including HIV/Aids and hepatitis B and C, a couple of years ago.
Following the guidelines, the programme was to provide kits at the health facilities of each jail where the prisoners were tested for chronic diseases, adding that jail doctors would then perform tests on the patients under the programme’s guidelines. However, he maintained that his department had nothing to do with the screening of inmates entering or leaving prisons.

• Fund’s ‘Diagnosis Report’ flags poor prioritisation, delays, cost overruns as major shortcomings
• NHA told to start M-6 work by October or face parliamentary action
ISLAMABAD: The government has restricted financing for new projects under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) to just two per cent for the current year, in line with conditions of the ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
This was disclosed by Planning and Development Secretary Awais Manzur Sumra while briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development, which met under the chairmanship of Senator Quratulain Marri.
Mr Sumra said the IMF had demanded that new development projects be limited to 10pc of the PSDP to maintain fiscal discipline, given the already large and longstanding project portfolio.
Accordingly, the government decided to prioritise ongoing projects of national importance for early completion, allocating only 2pc of PSDP funds for new schemes in the current budget. He said 2,518 projects worth Rs344 billion were completed or closed down in this process.
The secretary informed the committee that the IMF had also sent a questionnaire covering multiple areas, including Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and Public Investment Management (PIM), which were directly linked to the Planning Commission. Pakistan submitted the completed questionnaire on March 20, 2025.
While discussing the IMF’s Diagnosis Report, it was revealed that the lender had pointed out weak project prioritisation, frequent delays, cost overruns, and inadequate protection of funds for approved projects as major shortcomings. The committee chair stressed that, in line with its earlier recommendations, ongoing projects should be completed before new ones are taken up.
On the panel’s previous recommendations, Mr Sumra said the standing committee had made 22 proposals, some of which had been implemented while others remained under consideration. The committee demanded a detailed compliance report on projects recommended by senators, but the ministry sought more time. The chair directed that the relevant ministries be called to the next meeting to present their reports.
 
 

Mr Sumra also briefed the committee on the Intelligent Project Automation System (iPAS), designed to streamline development processes by integrating systems, improving budget detail, and automating budget releases.
Two major projects
The National Highway Authority (NHA) presented updates on two major projects — the Sukkur-Hyderabad-Karachi Motorway (M-6) and Karachi-Quetta-Chaman Road (N-25).
The committee members were informed that the M-6 comprises five sections between Hyderabad and Sukkur. In the first phase, the Noushehroferoz-Ranipur and Ranipur-Sukkur sections were being prioritised, with formal approvals expected in September 2025.
The committee was told that the Islamic Development Bank would fund two sections of M-6, while negotiations with the Saudi Development Fund and Opec Fund for International Development were underway. A delegation from the Saudi Development Fund is scheduled to visit Pakistan in October.
On the Karachi-Hyderabad (M-10) Motorway, the committee was informed that the six-lane, 168km-long project had a preliminary estimated cost of Rs254bn, with final estimates to be determined after detailed design and commercial feasibility. It will be included in next year’s PSDP.
The committee chairperson expressed strong concern over NHA’s performance on the M-6 project, noting that the authority had already lost four months and was now seeking another four to finalise decisions under the PPP model. She directed the NHA to ensure work on the project begins by October 2025, warning that if the deadline was missed, the matter would be referred to the upper house of parliament for intervention.
She also instructed that the Economic Affairs Division and other relevant departments be called to the next meeting to brief the committee on measures for timely implementation.

The middle section of Madhopur barra­­ge, which spans the Ravi River in India, was washed away by surging water, the Reu­ters news agency reported, referring to video broadcast by Indian media a day earlier.
Pakistani officials said that this damage unleashed an uncontrolled flow across the border, flooding some parts of Lahore on Friday.
 
 

An Indian government source, while confirming that two gates of Madhopur barrage had broken, denied there had been any deliberate attempt to flood Pakistan.
Indian authorities say they are trying to stem the flow on the Ravi, despite the damage to the barrage, and the flow was being controlled by the Ranjit Sagar Dam upst­ream, Reuters quoted a source as saying.
The official claimed that India was doing whatever it could, blaming incessant rain for causing the flood.

LAHORE: In an unprecedented flood crisis, the Punjab government has initiated controlled breaches of key flood bunds to divert surging waters from the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers, as all three major rivers overflowed simultaneously for the first time in the country’s history.
With 855,000 cusecs expected to reach Head Trimmu within 24 hours, authorities have evacuated over 429,000 residents, deploying explosives and breaching embankments to protect urban centres from catastrophic flooding.
Torrential monsoon rains ravaged both Pakistan and India this week, with further heavy downpours forecast for this weekend.
Bunds near Athara Hazari in Jhang district were breached to relieve pressure on Head Trimmu, situated downstream of the confluence of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers.
To prevent inundation of Jhang city, the Rivaz Bridge flood bund was breached, and residents from adjacent villages were evacuated. Explosives were deployed near Rungpur and Sher Shah bunds to divert water away from Head Muhammad Wala, where a surge of up to 800,000 cusecs is anticipated.
“There was no other way to drain the water,” Relief Commissioner Nabil Javed said, defending the drastic measures. “We are deploying all available resources and machinery to protect lives and infrastructure.”
Explosives were also deployed, with dynamite installed near the Rungpur and Sher Shah bunds to strategically divert water from Head Muhammad Wala.
Data released by Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Friday revealed that flows were predominantly steady with a notable improvement at Rivaz Bridge on the Chenab River, where the water level is now holding steady at 521.9 feet against the critical gauge of 526 feet.
However, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a flood warning for the Chenab River at Head Marala. As a precautionary measure, the NDMA sent out alerts via SMS to mobile phone users. The authority warned of a high flood risk at Marala, Khanki and Qadirabad headworks, urging residents in these areas to remain prepared for any emergency situation.
 






Water flow
On Friday, Marala and Khanki headworks were steady at 109,540 and 174,472 cusecs, respectively, while Qadirabad Headworks was at 175,272 cusecs and falling.
Chiniot Bridge remained at a very high but steady 855,000 cusecs, and Trimmu Headworks was steady at 128,215 cusecs.
Conditions on the Ravi River were mixed; Head Jassar was steady at 82,140 cusecs, and Ravi Syphon was falling at 160,515 cusecs. Shahdara was steady at 159,847 cusecs; however, Balloki Headworks continued to rise, reaching 180,520 cusecs. Sidhnai Headworks remained steady at 29,278 cusecs.
The Sutlej River was showing incre­a­sed activity at its upstream point, with Ganda Singh Wala rising at 385,569 cus­ecs. Downstream, Sule­­manki Headworks was steady at 138,058 cusecs, and Islam Headworks was steady at 60,814 cusecs.

20 lives lost, millions affected
According to PDMA data, over 1.46 million people in 1,769 mouzas have been affected due to extremely high floods in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers, with a total of 20 lives lost.
The government has evacuated over 429,177 people, of whom 3,565 were living in 365 relief camps, and 300,174 cattle were transported to safety.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the Sutlej River is facing the worst flooding since 1955. He said that the catastrophic inflow of water is a result of a dam breach in India, and it is increasing the threat to Kasur.
 


In 1955, more than 2,000 people lost their lives and crops were devastated in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) due to heavy floods caused by monsoon rains. Those floods also impacted 15 million people in Sindh and parts of India.
“We have been compelled to deliberately breach the embankment to save Ka­­s­ur city from devastation due to unprecedented water flow,” Mr Kathia said.
He said the crisis is widespread and evolving rapidly. “The Sutlej is not the only concern; the Chenab and Ravi rivers are also overflowing, marking the first time in Pakistan’s history that three major rivers have flooded simultaneously,” he added.
The PDMA chief termed it a “historic flood situation”, particularly noting the severe impact at Qadirabad Headworks.
Communities living downstream were bracing for impact, and water is expected to reach Sidhnai Headworks within 36 hours, while Okara, Sahiwal and Pakpattan remain on high alert.
Around 40 to 45 villages were already inundated in Mandi Bahauddin before the water receded back into the river. He said that 28 people lost their lives so far, though timely rescue operations have mitigated further casualties.
He said that evacuations in vulnerable areas continued, including those near Trimmu, where water levels are rising steadily. “The area downstream of Trimmu may not withstand this pressure,” Mr Kathia warned, though he expressed hope that damage could be minimised.
A statement from the PDMA has said the ninth spell of monsoon rains began, as heavy rains were forecasted till Sept 2.
The rains were predicted in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Okara, Sahiwal, Kasur, Jhang, Sargodha, Mianwali, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan and Rajanpur, the PDMA spokesperson said.
Arrangements in Multan
Earlier, National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) Chairman Shahryar Sultan and Multan Commissioner Amir Kareem Khan visited the Head Muhammad Wala breaching section and Bund Bosan to review the flood management arrangements.
Mr Khan briefed about the current flood situation and the measures being taken to mitigate potential risks.
He said that a flood surge of up to 800,000 cusecs is expected in the Chenab River within the next two days. “The Head Muhammad Wala Road will be breached if Multan city faces any threat. The final decision will be made by the technical committee of the Irrigation Department.”
He said that over 119,715 people have so far been safely relocated across the division and a total of 84 relief camps have been set up. He said that uninterrupted provision of meals and medical care is being ensured in all relief camps, while arrangements have also been made for the supply of fodder and water for livestock.
