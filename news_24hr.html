On the face of it, it is a declarative pact, containing a commitment to collective defence in the spirit of Nato’s Article 5, from where the accord borrows language regarding an attack on one partner being considered aggression against both.
Beneath the surface, however, there is deliberate ambiguity about the scope of this agreement, which implies strategic signalling.
The obvious signal is that Riyadh believes US security guarantees are no longer the sole hedge for its defence, and that it is prepared to institutionalise its own deterrence.
What is public is short and formal. The official statement gave only a brief description, saying the agreement aims “to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression.”

Riyadh will look to benefit from ‘operational and symbolic bite’ of Pakistan’s military capabilities

That measured phrasing is a diplomatic curtain, but conversations behind it have been anything but modest. Because the written text is opaque and probably deliberately ambiguous, the debate that followed — especially among Western experts — focused first and foremost on one explosive possibility — does this pact imply a Pakistani nuclear umbrella for Saudi Arabia?
One senior Saudi official, when asked by Western media whether the pact might obligate Pakistan to provide such a guarantee, bluntly said, “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.”
Saudi commentators amplified the implication on television. Political analyst Muneef Al-Harbi said, “All available military means on both sides will be used if needed… Nothing is excluded, even deterrent means.”
 
 

Those observations fuel speculation about the existence of an itemised nuclear-sharing clause because they show what Riyadh’s own media ecosystem and public intellectuals believe the agreement is meant to achieve.
Speculation in western circles notwithstanding, Pakistan’s position on the nuclear deterrent is very clear; Islamabad was obliged to develop nuclear capability for self-defence and deterrence and it is intended solely for safeguarding the country’s own sovereignty and territorial integrity, not for extension to other states.
Western reaction
Even so, the immediate reaction from Washington likely is likely to be alarm, tempered by a degree of calculation.
As Christopher Clary, a scholar at the Stimson Centre, told Dawn, “The US is not enemies with either Pakistan or Saudi Arabia, but it would likely view any explicit nuclear-sharing arrangement with concern.”
Nuclear sharing and extended deterrence, in his view, are much harder in practice than in theory, so only time will tell what stipulations the pact actually entails. Whatever the eventual reality, the accord has already shifted the political conversation. Ambiguity it seems, is also a form of deterrence.
The Saudi side has also been quite explicit about the more conventional building blocks of the pact.
As Jamal Al-Harbi, the press attaché at the Saudi embassy in Islamabad, wrote in Arab News: “The newly signed agreement aims to expand military cooperation on multiple levels. Key elements include joint military exercises to improve operational readiness and interoperability, intelligence sharing to counter emerging threats, particularly terrorism and cross-border insurgencies.”
“Additionally, it includes defence industry collaboration, with potential for technology transfer and co-production of military equipment, as well as capacity building and training, building on the longstanding tradition of Pakistani military personnel working with Saudi forces. There is potential for mutually beneficial industrial partnerships in emerging security fields such as cybersecurity, drone technology, and space-based defence systems.”
Put plainly, the pact is not merely a rhetorical shield.
If the partners follow through with joint planning, interoperability standards, intelligence fusion, and defence-industrial links, the result would be the most significant re-architecture of Gulf security since the US basing network was built after 1990.
Whether it becomes an integrated command and operational reality with rotational deployments, pre-negotiated contingency plans, and shared logistics will determine whether this is a heavyweight security alliance or an expensive piece of theater.
Treaty or agreement?
The document’s label — an “agreement” rather than a “treaty” — has yielded an argument about legal force.
Ahmer Bilal Soofi, President of the Research Society of International Law, told Dawn that the Vienna Convention provides a simple test: Article 2 defines a treaty as “an international agreement concluded between States in written form and governed by international law … whatever its particular designation.”
By that standard, form and substance matter more than the label. If the parties intend binding commitments and write them down, the instrument acquires the legal character of a treaty regardless of what a headline calls it.
Who does it aim to deter?
Timing explains a lot. The signing followed high-profile Israeli strikes in Doha and comes amid a broader sense in Gulf capitals that the United States may not be the automatic guarantor it once was. Riyadh’s public posture is that the pact is not aimed at any single state; privately, the message is unmistakable.
Whatever the primary object of Riyadh’s deterrence; be it Tehran, Tel Aviv, or a broader effort to project power into contested theatres, the pact may well reshape the balance of power in the Middle East — especially because Pakistan’s conventional and nuclear capabilities carry symbolic as well as operational bite.
That symbolism cuts both ways. For Islamabad, the pact cements Pakistan’s claim to be more than a regional player. For Riyadh, it validates a strategy of strategic hedging maintaining American ties while deepening relations with Islamabad, China, and Russia.
To quote Muneef Al-Harbi: “Saudi Arabia doesn’t replace one strategic partner with another. It expands its partnerships: with the West, with China, with Russia. Agreement with Pakistan fits this pattern.”
The India problem
The new alignment could also put Riyadh in an awkward position with New Delhi. India has worked steadily to cultivate Riyadh for energy, trade, and diplomatic support and would not welcome an explicit security tether between its principal energy supplier and its strategic rival.
New Delhi’s public line on the signing of the agreement is that it will “study the implications.” This captures Delhi’s dilemma about how to preserve commercial ties without neglecting a shifting security calculus that may
now require defensive reassessments. “In South Asia, it may heighten India’s caution in dealing with Pakistan,” the Saudi embassy’s media attaché warned.
An ‘Islamic Nato’?
This is something which has long been theorised. Past Saudi efforts, like the 2015 Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, proved more symbolic than operational.
But the latest pact is different precisely because it ties the language of collective defence to concrete cooperation.
Brig Faisal Al-Hamad suggested: “Right now, it’s bilateral, but don’t forget Saudi Arabia already has a joint defence pact with the GCC. Adding Pakistan makes seven countries. We may soon see this expand. At the very least, it’s the strongest step yet toward an Islamic strategic alliance.”
Muneef Al-Harbi went further, arguing that “This pact reshapes regional security — it may not stop at just Riyadh and Islamabad. Other countries may join this Saudi-Pakistani track.”
Whether Egypt, Turkey, or others sign on will turn on politics, prestige, and whether capitals prefer loose security webs or binding commitments.

Opposition leaders and critics have alleged multiple times that voting in the world’s largest democracy has been undermined by targeted manipulation of electoral rolls. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has denied all charges.
But in his latest broadside, 55-year-old Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi accused the ECI of withholding key data that could help identify those accused of tampering with electoral rolls.
He accused ECI chief Gyanesh Kumar of “protecting the people who are destroying and attacking the constitution”.
The ECI called the accusations “incorrect” and “baseless”, saying that it had itself filed a police complaint against “certain unsuccessful attempts” to delete voters from rolls.
Gandhi on Thursday unveiled what he called “100 per cent proof” of an attempt to delete thousands of voters in Karnataka state using automated software. He said the ECI had refused to share technical data sought by investigators examining an alleged operation targeting Congress-leaning areas.
The Karnataka criminal investigation department has asked the ECI “18 times in 18 months,” he alleged. “And they are not giving it.”
The allegations come ahead of elections expected in October or November in Bihar, India’s third-most populous state with at least 130 million people.
The opposition alleged the ECI had embarked on a “mass disenfranchisement” exercise, after it gave voters in the state just weeks to prove their citizenship, requiring documents that few possess in a registration revamp.

Though defence ties between Islamabad and Riyadh go back to at least the 1960s, and Pakistani troops have been stationed in the kingdom during various periods, the fresh pact strengthens earlier agreements, and most importantly, reiterates the principle that “aggression against either country shall be considered aggression against both”.
While the defence deal was reportedly being discussed over the past few years, timing is everything, and the fact that it was inked mere days after the Israeli attack on Qatar has not gone unnoticed globally. The Gulf Arabs, including Saudi Arabia, have seemingly come to the realisation that despite their deep ties with the US, America is unlikely to come to their defence. Hence they are now exploring other options. Pakistan, which maintains excellent ties with the Gulf monarchies, and which has a battle-tested military, appears to be a natural partner.
However, some questions remain. For one, the situation in the subcontinent remains volatile. While the Saudis may have friendly ties with New Delhi, will Riyadh help defend Pakistan if India attacks this country again? These queries need clear answers, especially when India has refused to rule out further aggression against Pakistan. Reacting to the development, the Indian external affairs ministry has said it is “[studying] the implications” of the deal.
 
 

Yet the importance of the Pak-Saudi defence pact cannot be overstated, and it is without doubt a diplomatic and geopolitical victory for Pakistan. Hopefully, the pact will deepen the already cordial ties between both states.
It is also possible that other Gulf states may sign similar pacts with Pakistan in future. While bilateral defence ties should be pursued by Pakistan, looking at the bigger picture, especially where the collective security of the wider Middle East is concerned, there is still a void.
Here, the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition, founded in 2015 and headed by former army chief Raheel Sharif, can be repurposed for collective defence of the Muslim world. Currently, the 43-member body is underutilised. If it were expanded to include Iran and other Muslim states not currently members, it could send a strong message to Israel, which is arguably the biggest current security threat to the Palestinians as well as the larger Muslim and Arab world. Redefining the coalition’s aims could help end the genocide in Gaza, and prevent further attacks by the Zionist state on regional countries.
The infrastructure of a ‘Muslim Nato’ already exists; all that remains is opening its doors to all Muslim states, and strengthening mutual defence capabilities. Such a coalition could also serve as a warning to states hostile to Pakistan to think twice before launching further attacks.

• Gazans flee bombardment, head south on foot, in vehicles and on donkey carts
• 85 Palestinians killed in strikes, gunfire; Israeli loses four soldiers
GAZA CITY: Israeli tanks and jets pounded Gaza City, the target of a major ground offensive, on Thursday, prompting Palestinians to flee south, where the Israeli military announced the deaths of four soldiers.
AFP journalists and witnesses saw a steady stream of Gazans heading south on foot, in vehicles and on donkey carts — their meagre belongings piled high.
“There is artillery fire, air strikes, quadcopter and drone gunfire. The bombing never stops,” said Aya Ahmed, 32, sheltering with 13 relatives in Gaza City.
“The world doesn’t understand what is happening. They (Israel) want us to evacuate south — but where will we live? There are no tents, no transport, no money.”
Palestinians say the cost of a ride to the south has soared, in some cases topping $1,000.
“The situation is indescribable — crowds everywhere, the sound of explosions, women and men crying and screaming as they walked while carrying their belongings,” said Shadi Jawad, 47, describing his family’s ordeal as they fled their home on Wednesday.
The offensive has sparked international outrage, with the territory already devastated by the war and the Gaza City area gripped by a UN-declared famine. It comes ahead of a planned move by several countries, including France and Britain, to recognise a Palestinian state later this month at the UN.
Israeli tanks were advancing on Thursday in two Gaza City areas that are gateways to the city centre, while internet and phone lines were cut off across the Gaza Strip, a sign that ground operations were likely to further escalate imminently.
Israeli forces control Gaza City’s eastern suburbs and in recent days have been pounding the Sheikh Radwan and Tel Al-Hawa areas, from where they would be positioned to advance on central and western areas where most of the population is sheltering.
“We are scared, but what can we do?” said Bassam Al-Qanou, a displaced man sheltering with around 30 family members in one of countless ragged improvised tent camps along the city’s beach.
At least 85 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli strikes or gunfire across the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours, most in Gaza City, according to the territory’s health ministry.
Later on Thursday, the Israeli military said four of its soldiers had been killed using an explosive device in Rafah, in southern Gaza.

Speaking at the Sindh Amn March organised by his party in Karachi, the Maulana said there could be no state within a state, but if a solution through dialogue was proposed, then it should be entertained by the authorities.
He, however, said no one had the right to take the law into their own hands. “It’s unacceptable for someone to carry guns, climb mountains and kill whoever they want calling it ‘Jihad’,” he said.
Besides the JUI-F leader, the PTI has also opposed military operations, particularly in KP, where terrorism has seen a spike after the Taliban government came to power in Afghanistan. Recently, PTI chief Imran Khan had also told his party’s chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur in KP to oppose the move.
Maulana Fazl appreciated the defence pact between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. He termed it a positive development for regional stability and a step towards greater unity in the Muslim world.
“We urge both nations to utilise this agreement not just for bilateral gains but for the collective benefit of the Islamic world. This accord should be made effective for the whole Muslim Ummah,” he said.

Climate change is hitting hard, manifesting in new weather patterns including cloudbursts. Sudden torrential rainfall, which continues relentlessly, can literally move mountains. This phenomenon was observed in many places in the northern parts of the country. The gushing water sweeps away boulders, trees, soil and everything else in its way, including houses, vehicles and livestock. Witnessing the aftermath of one such cataclysmic event in Qadir Nagar in Buner was an unforgettable experience, as was meeting an old man there who had lost 31 members of his family in the Aug 15 cloudburst.
The people’s suffering during the floods is manifold, immediate and long-term, direct and indirect. Suddenly, everything is washed away, sometimes even loved ones, and, in many cases, livelihoods. They are uprooted from their homes and communities; they get separated from their loved ones, and there is no longer any social support network. As a result, they undergo extreme mental stress and, in many cases, suffer physically.
Hence, any emergency response during the flood season has a healthcare component. In order to organise a suitable healthcare response, it is important to understand what afflicts people most frequently during the floods.
In general, there are five groups of medical and healthcare problems during the floods, and healthcare provision should be planned accordingly.

Five groups of healthcare problems are observed during floods.

The first set of problems is seen immediately after the onset of the floods. These challenges are of an acute nature and require an immediate medical response. They include mild to serious injuries, which are caused by people struggling to save themselves from drowning, hypothermia due to prolonged submergence in water, injuries due to the collapse of buildings and infrastructure, and snakebites. All this requires first aid and shifting the more seriously injured to the appropriate health facilities. Some of them may require minor or even major surgeries.
The second group follows the first, ie, the spread of waterborne diseases, including but not limited to diarrhoea (especially among children), cholera, typhoid and hepatitis E. Malaria and dengue also spread during this time due to stagnant pools of water. Allergic skin rashes and scabies are common as well. The provision of safe drinking water and food is critical not only for hydration and nutritional purposes but also to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases. Along with that, hand washing, sanitation and other infection prevention and control measures should be promoted among the people.
With an increasing number of environmental samples testing positive for poliovirus and the growing number of polio cases in the north, there is a need to carry out special polio vaccination campaigns in the flood-affected areas as and when possible. Under unsanitary conditions, poliovirus can contaminate food and water. Likewise, the cholera vaccination should be considered to control likely outbreaks. An outbreak of measles must also be anticipated in camps.
The third group is composed of flood-affected people whose healthcare has often been ignored. These people were already suffering from chronic health conditions. Their healthcare is further disrupted due to the flood emergency. Chronic conditions, or non-communicable diseases, usually require lifelong treatment. Diabetes, in particular, needs to be mentioned. Insulin and other antidiabetic medicines are a lifeline for patients with diabetes. Likewise, patients of blood pressure, with chronic respiratory problems, require medications to be continued.
The fourth group of problems consists of mental health issues, which make up another, often ignored, and, unfortunately, stigmatised category. The stress of loss causes anxiety and depression. Mental health support to the flood-affected must be planned as part of the medical response and should not be an afterthought or relegated to non-essential care. Trained mental health professionals should be part of the medical team. Post-traumatic stress disorder is the most commonly occurring condition, and must be handled with care.
The fifth category consists of vulnerable groups and their special needs. Pregnant women, young children, old women and men, and persons with disabilities — all require special and prioritised attention to their condition and needs in times of emergency.
 
 

These five sets of problems can guide the selection of medicines and other medical supplies and composition of the healthcare teams — including those with mental health training.
A well-meaning but ill-informed healthcare response as part of the overall emergency response can be insufficient, even counterproductive. It is not just about providing medicines doled out by laymen to unsuspecting people, who may only suffer their side effects. Planning healthcare for the flood-affected people requires not only medical (curative) services but also equally important preventive, promotive and rehabilitative health services.
Indiscriminate medicine donations by families and pharmaceutical companies can sometimes create more problems than they solve. There is a lot of international experience of bad medical donations during times of emergency, which cannot be used. Eventually, they have to be disposed of, which is also a challenge.
The WHO has developed, and has been supplying, a number of standard emergency health kits. Over the years, the agency has improved these kits, learning from emergency experiences around the world. Of special relevance is their Interagency Emergency Health Kit, which can serve the medical needs of 10,000 people for three months. Another one is the Cholera Kit-2020, which can serve the needs of 100 patients. There is much to learn from the contents of these kits in order to organise medical supplies. There is a lot of literature available on this on the WHO’s website and in its publications.
The most difficult part of the response is helping people get back on their feet and restart their lives. By that time, all early responders have gone back. The floods are no longer breaking news for the media. People have a long walk ahead to resettle themselves as they were before the floods began — often without help and in depressing loneliness. Relief should include recovery.

• 2024 was the third straight year with widespread glacier loss across all regions
ISLAMABAD: The water cycle has become increasingly erratic and extreme, swinging between deluge and drought, according to a new report from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), which highlights the cascading impacts of too much or too little water on economies and society.
The State of Global Water Resources report, released by WMO on Thursday, says only about one-third of the global river basins had “normal” conditions in 2024. The rest were either above or below normal — the sixth consecutive year of clear imbalance.
The year 2024 was the third straight year with widespread glacier loss across all regions. Many small-glacier regions have already reached or are about to pass the so-called peak water point — when a glacier’s melting reaches its maximum annual runoff, after which this decreases due to glacier shrinkage.
Since the 1990s, ice loss has been increasing in almost all regions, and it has considerably accelerated since 2000. This is mostly due to regions consistently presenting larger summer melt than winter accumulation after the 1990s. In 2024, glaciers lost 450 Gt of water, which is equivalent to 1.2mm of contribution to global mean sea-level rise.
“Water sustains our societies, powers our economies and anchors our ecosystems. And yet the world’s water resources are under growing pressure and – at the same time — more extreme water-related hazards are having an increasing impact on lives and livelihoods,” said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.
An estimated 3.6 billion people face inadequate access to water at least a month per year and this is expected to increase to more than 5 billion by 2050, according to UN Water, and the world falling far short of Sustainable Development Goal 6 on water and sanitation.
According to the report, in the past six years only about one-third of the global river catchment area had normal discharge conditions compared to the 1991-2020 average. This means that two-thirds have too much or too little water, reflecting the increasingly erratic hydrological cycle.
In 2024, deviations of river discharge from normal conditions occurred in approximately 60 per cent of the global catchment area. In the past six years only about one-third of the global catchment area was under normal discharge conditions when compared to the 1991–2020 average.
 
 

In 2024, above- to much-above-normal discharge conditions prevailed across Central and Northern Europe and parts of Asia, including Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.
Major basins such as the Danube, Ganges, Godavari and Indus experienced above- to much-above-normal conditions.  The analysis of groundwater levels includes data from a total of 37, 406 groundwater monitoring stations across 47 countries.
Groundwater levels vary locally due to aquifer heterogeneity and human influences like pumping; still, larger-scale regional trends were observed. In 2024, 38 per cent of studied stations had normal groundwater levels; 25 per cent were below- or much-below-normal and 37 per cent were above- or much-above-normal.
In 2024 river discharge exhibited deviations from normal conditions in approximately 60pc of the global catchment area. With respect to the historical period, the year 2024 was characterised by drier-than-normal conditions in approximately 30pc of the area globally, while conditions in approximately 30pc were normal and in another 30pc they were above normal. In 2024, at the global scale, a smaller basin area was under dry conditions than in 2023, while the basin area under wetter-than-normal conditions almost doubled.

• Aleem says motorway surrounded by floodwater on both sides
• Over 4.7m people affected, death toll rises to 119 in Punjab floods
• NDMA warns of more rains, thunderstorms across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab
KARACHI: The Pakistan Meteo­rological Department (PMD) said on Thursday that water levels at the Guddu and Sukkur barrages on the Indus River were showing a falling trend.
According to PMD data shared on X at around 4pm, the Guddu Barrage recorded an inflow of 485,185 cusecs and an outflow of 456,964 cusecs. At Sukkur Barrage, inflows stood at 547,505 cusecs with an outflow of 495,925 cusecs, compared to a high flood level recorded on Wednesday night.
While Indus levels ease, the Sutlej River continues to rise, threatening urban localities in Jalalpur Pirwala, Multan district. Thousands of residents from villages including Inayatpur, Dhundhowala, Noraja Bhutta, Bait Channa, Peeplan and Khan Bela have already been displaced.
Authorities have shifted people to camps established along Gillani Road as floodwaters submerge vast areas of Lodhran and Bahawalpur, forming a large lake between the Motorway and Gillani Road.
Officials confirmed the government is weighing a plan to breach the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M-5) to divert floodwaters and protect Jalalpur Pirwala.
“A section of 25-30 kilometres has already sustained partial damage and will take up to six months to rebuild,” a senior district official told Dawn on condition of anonymity. The official said water had surrounded the motorway on both sides and damaged the road at five to six points.
He said that a decision was taken at a high-level meeting to breach  the motorway to give passage to Sutlej River water to enter the Chenab  River near Jalalpur city.
Earlier, seven controlled breaches were carried out at Sutlej dykes to prevent floodwaters from entering Jalalpur Pirwala city, but these inundated kutcha areas in Multan, Lodhran and Bahawalpur districts.
Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan visited Jalalpur Pirwala and reviewed flood damage to Motorway M-5.
He directed officials to protect Jalalpur Pirwala city and ensured that public safety remained the government’s top priority. He said that floodwaters had spread up to 20 kilometres on both sides of the motorway.
Mr Aleem said that although creating controlled breaches in M-5 was a difficult decision, safeguarding the lives and property of citizens takes precedence.
 
 

The minister said the National Highway Authority was working in tandem with the Punjab government to protect Jalalpur Pirwala and would fully support all decisions taken by the provincial government.
He stressed the importance of building protective embankments and called upon the Irrigation Department and other institutions to fulfil their responsibilities to avert such disasters in the future.
Relief efforts and toll
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed said the floods had so far affected more than 4.7 million people across 4,700 mouzas in the province. He said 329 relief camps, 425 medical camps and 367 veterinary camps were operational, with 2.6 million people and nearly 2.1m livestock evacuated to safety.
Mr Javed said the flood-related death toll had risen to 119 after another casualty was reported on Thursday.
River situation
A PDMA river flow report also confirmed on Thursday that the water level was rising in the Sutlej River at different points.
On the Chenab River, flows were stable with Marala Headworks reporting 51,154 cusecs, Khanki Headworks at 47,710 cusecs, Qadirabad Headworks at 49,943 cusecs and the Chiniot Bridge at 47,835 cusecs.
The Rivaz Bridge level was steady at 516.90 feet. At Trimmu Headworks, the flow was 79,767 cusecs and steady.
The water level at Head Muhammad Wala was last reported at 409 feet and was steady, though further readings were unattainable due to water levels dropping below the gauge.
Similarly, at Sher Shah Bridge, the level was steady at 387.50 feet, with subsequent measurements also unavailable for the same reason. The flow at Panjnad Headworks was steady at 140,742 cusecs.
On the Ravi River, conditions were similarly steady with a flow of 10,709 cusecs at Jassar, 9,899 cusecs at Ravi Syphon, and 9,613 cusecs at Shahdara. Balloki Headworks reported 26,985 cusecs, and Sidhnai Headworks was at 16,095 cusecs, both holding steady.
For the Sutlej River, flows remained stable at Ganda Singh Wala at 98,165 cusecs while rising at Sulemanki Headworks at 81,245 cusecs, Islam Headworks at 68,537 cusecs, and Mailsi Syphon at 62,554 cusecs.
Additionally, the Chachran Bridge gauge on the Indus River upstream of Guddu was steady at 296.4 feet, with the Guddu Barrage reporting a steady flow of 485,185 cusecs.
Rain forecast
Meanwhile, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Thursday forecast rain and thunderstorms across much of the country over the next 48 hours.
In a post on X, the authority warned that over the next two days, “rain with thunder is expected in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujarat, Gujranwala and Lahore Division, with intermittent rain also likely in Peshawar, Kohat, Bannu, Sargodha, Faisalabad and Zhob”.
“Due to rainfall in the upper regions of the rivers, there is a risk of increased flow in mountain streams,” the post added.

He made these remarks in a TV show hosted by Gharidah Farooqi. Rana Sana, who is also the PM’s aide on political affairs, said the BISP could not be continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be completely revamped.
The PML-N leader suggested ‘Benazir Rozgar Scheme’ or ‘Hunarmand Scheme’ would be a more effective way to provide skills and employment opportunities to its beneficiaries instead of a monthly stipend. He said the matter would be discussed in parliament, adding that even some PPP leaders were also in agreement with this proposal.
He claimed the federal government has been spending a huge chunk of money on the BISP, which he believed to be inappropriate due to the current fiscal crunch. Rana Sanaullah said BISP should not be used to help flood victims as its ‘true spirit’ required that the programme help people achieve self-sufficiency instead of merely providing financial assistance.
A BISP official told Dawn that the PM’s aide had made this statement in his personal capacity and no such proposal was being discussed at present.
On the other hand, the BISP, at a meeting, reviewed plans for a secure, transparent, and accessible payment system for beneficiaries.
 
 

The initiative aims to make financial assistance more secure, transparent, and easily accessible for millions of BISP beneficiaries across Pakistan, said a statement on Thursday.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman has repeatedly urged the government to extend BISP to nearly three million flood-affected families immediately. A similar demand has been expressed by PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and other prominent party leaders.

• Focus on Middle East may affect scheduled Trump-Shehbaz meeting
• PM heads to London, will attend UN moot on two-state solution
WASHINGTON: With world leaders expected to converge on New York for the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly, the escalating crises in Gaza and Qatar are reshaping global diplomatic priorities, with significant implications for Pakistan’s engagement with the United States.
In addition to his address at the General Assembly, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is also expected to take part in the high-level international conference for the ‘Peaceful Sett­lement of the Question of Pales­tine and the Imple­men­tation of the Two-State Solution’.
The conference, which will take place on Monday, would require the Pakistani delegation to hold close consultations with Arab and Muslim leaders during the UNGA.
At a news briefing this week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres noted that the 80th UNGA was meeting “in turbulent — even uncharted — waters”.
 
 

The UN chief pointed out that nearly 150 heads of state and government, alongside thousands of officials and diplomats, will participate in this “World Cup of diplomacy” that begins in New York on Monday.
“Palestine is going to be the huge elephant [in the room] in this session of the General Assembly,” said Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour, while explaining how this issue will keep the world leaders busy.
US veto and resolution
On Thursday, Washington reverted to its usual ways as it vetoed a draft Security Council resolution, which would have demanded an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, as well as calling on Israel to lift all restrictions on aid deliveries into the besieged Palestinian enclave.
The text, drafted by the elected 10 members of the 15-member council, would also have demanded the immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all prisoners held in Gaza.
It received 14 votes in favour, but the US used its veto power for a sixth time to come to Israel’s aid.
In a rare move last week, the US had backed a Security Council statement condemning recent strikes on Qatar, though the text did not mention Israel was responsible.
 
 

In another surprising development, Senate Democrats introduced a resolution calling for the US to extend recognition to the Palestinian state.
Although the measure is unlikely to pass the chamber where President Donald Trump’s Repu­blicans have a 53-47 majority, the resolution urges US recognition of a demilitarised Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.
Democrat Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who is leading the effort, said in a statement: “America has a responsibility to lead, and the time to act is now.”
Rescheduled
Islamabad’s proactive stance in condemning the Israeli airstrike on Qatar and its subsequent diplomatic engagements have elevated its profile within the Muslim world, with the recent signing of a mutual defence accord with Saudi Arabia further enhancing its significance in regional security discussions.
In addition, the shifting focus of the UNGA in the wake of Israel’s belligerent actions is also expected to impact meetings scheduled to be held on the sidelines of the summit, as those are now expected to be dominated by hectic diplomacy by Middle Eastern actors. Amidst all this, diplomatic sources in Washington suggested that a proposed meeting between US President Donald Trump and PM Shehbaz Sharif may have to be rescheduled.
While the White House is still interested in the meeting, the intensifying crises in Gaza and Qatar may necessitate a shift in focus, sources said.
President Trump is expected to engage with Israeli and Arab leaders during the UNGA. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already announced that he is meeting President Trump at the White House on Sept. 29, soon after Trump’s consultations with world leaders at the UNGA.
This may mean that the Shehbaz-Trump interaction is confined to the sidelines of the assembly session in New York. Embassy sources, however, say that Islamabad would prefer a full-fledged meeting at the White House, to address bilateral and regional issues.
Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, who has previously met President Trump at the White House, is also expected to accompany PM Shehbaz.
PM in London
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif arrived in London on Thursday for meetings with senior British officials, ahead of his US trip.
According to sources, the prime minister will remain in London until Sept 21. During his stay, he is scheduled to hold meetings with senior officials and address a gathering of Pakistanis organised by the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation.
Before landing in London, the premier made a stopover in Geneva to meet his elder brother, Nawaz Sharif.
The elder Sharif had arrived in Geneva four days ago for medical treatment, accompanied by his son, Hassan Nawaz, and his physician, Dr Adnan.
PM Shehbaz is expected to travel to London on Monday to join the prime minister and his delegation, which includes Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and the prime minister’s special assistant, Tariq Fatemi.

• Two FC men injured in Kalat grenade attack
• Suicide bomber strikes convoy near Kech
QUETTA: At least six people lost their lives in a powerful bomb explosion in the border town of Chaman, a suicide bomber targeted a convoy in Kech district, while security forces killed four militants in Khuzdar during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) on Thursday.
Separately, four people, including two Frontier Corps officials, were injured in a grenade attack and firing by unknown armed men in the Mangochar area of Kalat division late in the evening.
Officials said the Chaman blast ripped through a crowded taxi stand near the Pak-Afghan border in the evening, killing four people instantly and injuring two others. The wounded later succumbed to their injuries, raising the death toll to six.
“The explosion took place near makeshift shops,” Assistant Commissioner Chaman Imtiaz Baloch told Dawn. Police and Levies forces rushed to the scene and shifted the dead and injured to the district hospital.
“The blast left bodies mangled and body parts scattered,” eyewitness Asghar Achakzai, a local reporter, told Dawn by phone.
Police said initial investigations suggested explosives had been planted outside the shops at the taxi stand.
 
 

The Balochistan Home Depart­ment confirmed the casualties and ordered an inquiry into the incident.
It asked citizens to cooperate with investigation officials, stressing that the culprits would be brought to justice.
Kech suicide attack
Meanwhile, a convoy travelling from Gwadar to Turbat came under attack in the Dasht-i-Kuddan area of Kech district, around 60 kilometres from Turbat.
Officials said gunmen opened fire on the convoy before a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden pickup into one of the buses.
There was no official word from the local administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) about the incident. It was not immediately clear whether anyone had been killed or injured.
The banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack.
Khuzdar operation
Separately, the military’s media wing said on Thursday that security forces killed four militants linked to the “Indian proxy” group Fitna al-Hindustan during an intelligence-based operation in Khuzdar.
“During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a statement. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the site, it added.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said.
Thursday’s attacks come amid a surge in militant activity across Balochistan.
Earlier this week, five militants were killed in Khuzdar. Last week, four militants were also killed during an IBO in Mastung, according to ISPR.
A day earlier, two police stations and a Levies post were targeted in Sherani district, leaving one poli­ce­­man martyred and two Levies personnel injured.

• Aleema says she’ll visit Supreme Court today to inquire about ‘outcome’
• Ex-PM urges CJP to intervene to fix his pending petitions, requests ‘justice in real time’
ISLAMABAD: As PTI leader Imran Khan has been in jail for more than two years, his lawyer Latif Khosa on Thursday approached Chief Justice Yahya Afridi with a letter from the former prime minister detailing his hardships in jail and requesting the swift scheduling of his pending cases.
Mr Khosa handed over the letter to the top judge in a meeting that lasted for more than an hour and later told media persons that the CJP had assured a “positive response” to their plight within 24 hours and also asked them to move a proper application in this regard.
To deliver the letter ‘Denial of Justice and Fundamental Rights — A Call to the Supreme Court’, Mr Khosa had arrived with Aleema Khan, Javed Hashmi and other PTI leaders, but the rest were briefly stopped by the police at the entrance of the Supreme Court. However, they were subsequently allowed to enter the premises and they waited there till the conclusion of the meeting between the CJP and Mr Khosa.
After the meeting, Mr Khosa told reporters that the CJP attentively listened to them and assured them that a policy of presenting any arrested person within 24 hours would be ensured.
Mr Khosa said the CJP had sought the ex-premier’s complaints regarding the conditions in jail in writing and assured that his grievances would be addressed and responded to within 24 hours, Dawn.com reported. He said, “We will inform you about whatever happens in [the next] 24 hours.”
Mr Khosa said he had also expressed “our reservations” about the judiciary to the chief justice and raised the matter of jail reforms. “The CJP has sought suggestions over jail reforms,” he said.
Aleema Khan, the sister of Imran Khan who flanked the lawyer during the media interaction, announced they would return to the apex court on Friday to learn about the outcome of the letter penned by Imran Khan.
‘Door of justice’
In his message to the CJP, the former prime minister claimed the “doors of justice remain closed to him and his wife” and he had to endure “continuous solitary confinement”. The PTI lea­der said he had been facing 300 “politically motivated cases” and requested the CJP for an immediate hearing of his pending petitions before all courts. He also demanded medical treatment facilities for his spouse Bushra Bibi and phone calls to his sons as mandated by the jail manual. “Her health continues to deteriorate, yet her doctor is barred from examining her, let alone provide any treatment,” he said in the letter.
According to the PTI chief, thousands of the party’s supporters were in jail and many, including his nephew, were subjected to military trials in violation of the constitutional protections.
His letter also mentioned the ‘leaked’ Commonwealth report on the Feb 8 elections and said the PTI’s mandate was “stolen overnight”. The letter claimed that the 26th Amendment had been used as a tool to sanctify this mandate theft, while petitions challenging it rem­ained unheard in the apex court.
The letter alleged that the Islamabad High Court chief justice deliberately refused to fix his Al-Qadir Trust – the £190m corruption case – and Toshakhana appeals.
The IHC top judge has allegedly fully abandoned impartiality and reduced the high court to a facilitator of an “unjust and tyrannical campaign” against him and those associated with him. He urged the CJP to direct Justice Sarfraz Dogar to fix critical petitions, including in the Al-Qadir Trust case.
The letter also alluded to the hanging of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Bhutto was hanged in a prison in Rawalpindi on April 4, 1979, whereas the Supreme Court held in 2024 that fair trial and due process requirements were not met. “Just­ice in its truest sense must happen in real time, pyrrhic justice occurs 44 years later,” the letter said.
“I, as Patron-In-Chief of Pakist­an’s largest political party; seek only what the Constitution guarantees: justice, dignity, and equality before law,” the letter said.

Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday.
Talking more about the deal in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ and whether more Arab nations could become part of it, Asif said: “I cannot prematurely answer this, but I will definitely say the doors are not closed.”
Asif said he had always called for a similar arrangement like Nato since there was greater vulnerability for Pakistan, pointing to the history of the region in the last 40-50 years.
“I think it is a fundamental right of the countries and people here, particularly the Muslim population, to together defend their region, countries and nations.”
He said there was no clause in the agreement that ruled out the entry of any other nation or that Pakistan could not sign a similar agreement with anyone else.
 
 

Asked about whether Pakistan’s nuclear assets were also up for use under the agreement, Asif said: “What we have, our capabilities, will absolutely be available under this pact. But let me say, since Pakistan has become a nuclear state, never has anyone challenged our status of being a responsible nuclear power.”
Asif said Pakistan had always offered its nuclear facilities for inspection and never committed any violation. He added that this is in contrast to Israel, which had not allowed any inspection.
Questioned about whether any attack on one country would lead to the involvement of the other and vice versa, the minister said: “Yes, absolutely. There is no doubt in this.”
He said neither Pakistan nor Saudi Arabia had named or conditioned the implementation of the defence deal with any specific country. “It is an umbrella that has been provided by both sides, that, if there is aggression against any side from any side, it will be jointly defended against and responded to.”
Asif clarified it was not an “aggressive pact” but a defensive arrangement, similar to that of Nato.
He added that Pakistan had also been involved in training Saudi forces for quite a while and the recent development was only a formalised “extension” of all that, adding that it was a positive thing.
“If there is aggression, whether against Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, we will jointly defend against it.”
He said Pakistan had always had talks on the issue with Saudi Arabia, saying the former had always had a large military and air force contingent present in the latter for many decades.
“I think that [pre-existing] relationship has been more defined now and that understanding has been given the form of a defence agreement. This is embedded in the history of our military cooperation and our brotherly relationship with Saudi Arabia.”
Asif also said the protection of the holy Islamic sites in Saudi Arabia was also a matter of a “sacred duty” for Pakistan.
 
 

Questioned about whether the United States was taken into confidence on the matter, Asif said he felt there was no ground or justification for any other third party to be involved in the development.
“This agreement will not be a hegemonic arrangement but a defensive arrangement … we don’t have any plans to conquer territory or attack anyone. But our fundamental right can’t be denied to us and we exercised that yesterday.”
He reiterated that Pakistan could also pursue similar arrangements with other countries.
‘Afghanistan is a hostile country’
To a question about terrorist attacks on security forces, Asif reiterated that Afghan soil is being used to stage acts of terrorism in Pakistan.
“We were swept into two wars in Afghanistan. The US, on both occasions, left the region and we are still dealing with the consequences, be it the Taliban, the TTP (Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan), the BLA (Balochistan Liberation Army) or anyone else,” Asif said, referring to the Soviet-Afghan War of the 1980s and the US-led International Security Assistance Force mission after 2001.
“People embrace martyrdom daily; this liability emerged due to those two wars,” he added. “The Kabul government is not innocent in this, I am being categorical. Through these people, we are being blackmailed by them.
“I say with no ambiguity: Afghanistan is a hostile country.”
The defence minister added that Afghanistan was the last country to recognise Pakistan and that discussions on terrorism went nowhere.
When asked if Arab states would act in response to Afghan aggression, Asif encouraged it.
“I would not be against it, but how many times have we been there? They are involved in our politics as well, with a party I will not name,” he stated. “This party advocates for these people who have our children’s blood on their hands.
“This is a subject Pakistan should be clear on, and we are very clear.”
Defence deal
According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.
The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure, when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram.
In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms.
In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges.
 
 

The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella, though finer details of the agreement were not made public.
For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider.
For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting the Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time.
Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkiye and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses.
Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represented Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.</p><small>2025-09-18 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624412-pakistans-global-relevance-rising-says-anwar-ul-haq-kakar-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's global relevance rising, says Anwar ul-Haq Kakar in London</strong></a><br><p>

Chaman District Police Officer Abdullah Cheema told Dawn.com that the explosion occurred near a taxi stand in the Pak-Afghan border area of ​​Chaman.
“Five people killed and one injured in the explosion near a vehicle,” he said, adding that police and rescue teams were dispatched to the spot.
A statement from the Balochistan Home Department said it ordered an investigation into the incident.
“The scene of the incident has been surrounded by forces. Levies and other law enforcement agencies are present at the scene. The process of collecting evidence and investigation is underway,” it said, adding that a probe was underway to find out the nature and reasons of the explosion.
The government also appealed to the public to avoid rumours and cooperate with law enforcement agencies.
 
 

There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks in Balochistan as of late.
Yesterday, two police stations and a Levies station had also come under attack in Balochistan’s Sherani district. In those attacks, a policeman was martyred and two Levies personnel were injured.
Earlier this month, at least five people were killed and 29 were injured in a blast at a rally of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.

SEBI began investigating Adani Group companies, including Adani Ports, Adani Power and Adani Enterprises, in 2023 after Hindenburg accused them of using tax havens and failing to disclose transactions between related parties.
While the conglomerate denied wrongdoing, the accusations led to a $150-billion sell-off of the group’s stock. The shares have since recovered.
“SEBI has reaffirmed what we have always maintained, that the Hindenburg claims were baseless. Transparency and integrity have always defined the Adani Group,” Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group, said on X.
 






In January, Hindenburg Research founder Nathan Anderson announced he would disband the firm, citing the immense workload. Reuters has reached out to the firm and its founder’s last known email addresses.
Short-sellers like Anderson bet against companies they believe have accounting issues, mismanagement or fraud, which they find usually after a long period of investigation.
 
 

The regulator had investigated the Adani conglomerate, its founders, offshore funds that invested in the company on 24 separate sets of violations, including insider trading, stock price manipulation and non-disclosure of related-party transactions.
SEBI said that the transactions between Adani group companies and companies flagged by Hindenburg could not be called related-party transactions and therefore did not violate regulatory norms on disclosures or constitute market manipulation.
In its report in January 2023, Hindenburg had alleged that Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd, Adani Power Ltd and Adani Enterprises Ltd had structured transactions with three other unrelated companies in a manner to conceal that they were actually between connected parties and ought to have been disclosed to investors.
The regulator dismissed these allegations and said that, according to SEBI rules, these transactions did not happen between connected entities and hence did not require disclosures or the consent of minority investors.
The transactions happened in between April 2012 and March 2021 and SEBI had widened the ambit of disclosures of transactions between connected entities in 2022 and cannot apply its rules retroactively, the regulator noted.
Indian authorities charge Anil Ambani with loan fraud
India’s federal investigating agency said on Thursday it filed charge sheets in cases connected to “fraudulent” transactions between tycoon Anil Ambani’s companies, Yes Bank and firms owned by the lender’s former top boss.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) said that Yes Bank invested over 50 billion Indian rupees ($567.21 million) in two Ambani-controlled companies in 2017, with approval from the bank’s former CEO Rana Kapoor, despite rating agencies flagging financial risks.
The agency alleged that the funds were later siphoned off, demonstrating a systematic diversion of public money.
CBI said that Kapoor “abused” his position to channel Yes Bank’s funds into financially troubled Ambani group firms, which in return extended concessional loans to companies linked to Kapoor’s family.
The arrangement resulted in a loss of 27.97 billion Indian rupees ($317.29m) to Yes Bank and led to unlawful gains for Ambani’s firms and the companies linked to Kapoor’s family, CBI said.
Anil Ambani’s spokesperson and Rana Kapoor did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.</p><small>2025-09-18 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/182038326849ea6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942988/trump-says-us-seeking-control-of-bagram-air-base-given-up-in-afghanistan-withdrawal' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US seeking control of Bagram air base given up in Afghanistan withdrawal</strong></a><br><p>The United States is trying to get Bagram air base in Afghanistan back, President Donald Trump said on Thursday during a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
Trump is on an official state visit to the UK — his second state trip to Britain — where he signed a technology agreement with Starmer earlier today.
“We’re trying to get it back,” Trump said, referring to Bagram. “It’s one of the biggest airbases in the world; we gave it to them for nothing. We’re trying to get it back.
“One of the reasons we want the base, as you know, is it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.”
 


Bagram Air Base served as the linchpin for US operations in the rugged country, where the long war against the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies was fought with air strikes and resupply missions from the airfield.
 
 

The historic Soviet-built airstrip was the main base for American forces in Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, attacks, up until their 2021 withdrawal, which led to a takeover by the Afghan Taliban.
In July 2021, all US and Nato troops left Afghanistan’s biggest air base, signalling the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the country after two decades of war.
A week after the US withdrawal, Bagram buzzed again with activity as Afghan forces settled into the vast premises, complete with its runways, barracks, control towers and hospital.
Trump, Starmer sign tech deal to seal ‘unbreakable bond’
Before the joint presser, Trump and Starmer signed a huge tech deal, which the British PM hailed as “the biggest investment package of its kind in British history by a country mile”.
Britain’s work in wooing the unpredictable Trump on his second state visit seemed to have paid off as he and Starmer signed the partnership, boosting ties in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear energy.

Trump said the deal was “very big”, and added of US relations with key Nato ally Britain that, “It’s an unbreakable bond we have regardless of what we’re doing today.”
The deal comes on the back of pledges of £150 billion ($205bn) of investment into the UK from American giants, including Microsoft, Google and Blackstone.
Trump disagrees with UK on recognising Palestinian state
Continuing the press conference, Trump said he disagreed with Starmer over recognising a Palestinian state, speaking following their bilateral meeting.
“I have a disagreement with the prime minister on that score, one of our few disagreements, actually,” Trump said in response to a question during the press conference.
Meanwhile, Starmer said he and Trump agreed on the ultimate aim of peace in the region.
“We absolutely agree on the need for peace and a road map, because the situation in Gaza is intolerable,” he said.

When pressed about reports he was waiting for Trump to leave the country before formally recognising a Palestinian state this weekend, Starmer said: “I made my position clear at the end of July as to the timing, which has got nothing to do with this state visit.
“I’ve discussed it with the president, as you would expect, amongst two leaders who respect each other and like each other and want to bring about a better solution in the best way that we can,” he added.</p><small>2025-09-18 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/18135739b80fda2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942890/ihc-division-bench-suspends-justice-babar-sattars-order-directing-removal-of-pta-chairman' target='_blank'><strong>IHC division bench suspends Justice Babar Sattar’s order directing removal of PTA chairman</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad High Court (IHC) division bench on Thursday suspended an earlier order for the removal of retired Major-General Hafeezur Rehman from his post as the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s (PTA) chairperson.
The bench, comprising Justices Muhammad Asif and Inaam Ameen Minhas, had taken up Rehman’s intra-court appeal against the earlier ruling, issued by Justice Babar Sattar on Tuesday, which had ordered the PTA chief’s removal over his “illegal” appointment to the position.
In his order, on a plea filed by digital rights activist Usama Khilji in 2023, Justice Sattar had ruled that the creation of a post for Member (Administration) in the PTA, and the subsequent appointment of Rehman as PTA chairman, were “unconstitutional, illegal and void ab initio”.
His decision had been challenged by Rehman within hours of it being announced.
Today, Advocate Qasim Wadud appeared as the counsel for the PTA chairman, while Additional Attorney General (AAG) Salman Mansoor also presented his arguments.
At the outset of the hearing, Mansoor contended that “relief which was not even sought in the petition had been granted” in Justice Sattar’s order.
“Neither were the rules challenged nor was a notice issued to the attorney general. Issuing a notice to the attorney general was necessary,” he argued.
The AAG further argued that a request not sought in a petition could not be considered under Article 199 (jurisdiction of high court) of the Constitution.
“The court itself stated that the entire argument was not complete yet,” Mansoor claimed.
Addressing the PTA chairman’s lawyer, Justice Asif remarked, “You were given enough opportunity.”
 
 

Wadud then came to the rostrum and said, “It was questioned in the writ petition that the appointment of PTA chairman could not be made [as] the vacancy was wrongly advertised.
“[But] the rules had been changed and the [federal] cabinet had given the approval, following which the appointment was made,” he contended.
“The rules had been amended on March 25, [2023], after which the petition was filed,” the counsel added.
The court subsequently suspended the previous IHC ruling that ordered the immediate removal of the PTA chairman.
Recruitment process ‘suffered fr­om malice in law’
The earlier judgement by Justice Sattar pointed out that the advertisement for the post, issued on March 28, 2023, had been published at a time when no such position legally existed. Later amendments to the PTA Appointment Rules in May 2023 were deemed insufficient to regularise the appointment process.
Justice Sattar observed that the recruitment process “suffered fr­om malice in law” and appeared to have been tailored to accommodate a specific individual. The prescription of a higher age limit of 61 years for the post, compared with 57 years for other members, was cit­ed as further proof of malafide intent.
The court had further held that the appointment of the retired army officer as PTA chairman without a transparent and objective selection process was “illegal, irrational and unsustainable in the eyes of law”.
The judge had ordered that the senior-most serving PTA member would temporarily assume the charge of the office of PTA chairman till such time as the federal government appointed a regular chairman.</p><small>2025-09-18 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624392-blast-at-chaman-border-taxi-stand-kills-five-injures-three' target='_blank'><strong>Blast at Chaman border taxi stand kills five, injures three</strong></a><br><p>

The decision was taken during a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) in Islamabad, chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, according to a press release from the Finance Division.
The press release stated that the railways ministry submitted a summary on rail development and bridge financing agreements with the Reko Diq Mining Company, to provide $390m for laying a 1,350-kilometre railway track to transport large volumes of export material from mines in Balochistan.
“The ECC approved the proposal and directed the Ministry of Railways to share both agreement documents with the Finance Division for appraisal,” the press release read.
“It further instructed the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Finance to submit an update to the ECC by March next year on the execution and implementation of the project.”
Additionally, the ECC reviewed a summary from the petroleum ministry regarding approvals for agreements and financial commitments to fund the Reko Diq project, the press release read.
The ECC approved the proposed final terms of the agreements, with instructions that any material deviations in the final execution forms, determined by the project’s legal and financial consultants and certified by the mining company, would be brought back to the committee for approval.
According to the press release, Aurangzeb said, “The ECC’s approvals signify the government’s firm commitment to moving ahead with this landmark project, which has the potential to transform the economic landscape of Balochistan and generate far-reaching benefits for the people of Pakistan.
“The Reko Diq project will not only unlock one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper-gold deposits but also catalyse job creation, infrastructure development, and long-term socio-economic uplift across the region.”
In March this year, a formal feasibility study confirmed more than $60 billion worth of copper and gold reserves at the Reko Diq copper mine at prevailing prices, prompting state-owned Oil and Gas Development Com­pany, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd and Government Holdings (Pvt) Ltd to increase funding commitments to the mining company to $1.9bn.
In August, Reuters reported that the Asian Development Bank would provide a $410m financing package to help develop Pakistan’s Reko Diq copper mine, which Barrick Gold, a global gold mining company, would operate.</p><small>2025-09-18 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/18191822d272f88.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942976/appraiser-alleges-pressured-into-undervaluing-jewellery-set-in-toshakhana-2-reference' target='_blank'><strong>Appraiser alleges ‘pressured’ into undervaluing jewellery set in Toshakhana-2 reference</strong></a><br><p>Fresh witness statements have come to light in relation to the Toshakhana-2 case on a Bulgari jewellery set against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, alleging that the appraiser was pressured into undervaluing the ornaments.
The development comes three days after a special judge central completed the cross-examination of the two key witnesses, an appraiser named Sohaib Abbasi and the former prime minister’s personal secretary, Inamullah Shah, in an over six-hour-long proceeding inside Adiala Jail.
The case pertains to Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi retaining an expensive Bulgari jewellery set gifted by the Saudi royal family — including a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings — at a low price, causing significant loss to the exchequer.
One of the witnesses, Sohaib Abbasi, confessed to undervaluing the Bulgari set at Rs5 million. He did so under the pressure of Imran Khan’s former personal secretary, Inamullah Shah, he claimed. Shah is the other key witness who has testified in the case.
In his testimony, Abbasi said that he was “handed over the responsibility of the assessment of the set on May 25, 2022 by the Section Officer of [the] Cabinet Division.”
Abbasi went on to say that Shah visited him and told him “that the two accused facing trial want to retain the jewellery set”, demanding that the assessment should be upto Rs5m.
Abbasi alleged that he was told by Shah that he would be blacklisted from every government department if he refused to cooperate, so he undervalued the jewellery set and submitted a false report.
Abbasi said that he joined the investigation on May 23, 2024 and requested a pardon in the case for undervaluing the jewellery set.
Shah confirmed the allegation, stating that, “I asked Sohaib Abbasi to make [an] undervalued assessment (of the set) and he agreed to that,” adding that he remained in Abbasi’s office for 30-45 minutes during his visit for the jewellery set under question.
The copies of both testimonies are available with Dawn.com.
Shah also told the court that he was receiving double salaries while working for PTI and the government at the same time. In his testimony, he said, “I was appointed Comptroller of the PM house [from] 2019 to 2021,” but then Shah reveals that, “In that very time, I was also receiving salary additionally from PTI Central Secretariat.”
As per Shah’s testimony, he was removed from his post in the same year, not because of receiving double salary, but “due to Bushra Bibi’s disapproval”. Shah believed that Bushra Bibi suspected Shah’s brother of having close ties with former PTI leader Jahangir Tareen.
In July last year, an Islamabad court prohibited the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from pursuing the Toshakhana reference against Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, transferring the case to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) court.
The case was transferred to a Special Judge Central, who will also decide on Imran and Bushra Bibi’s bail applications.
Imran Khan, imprisoned since August 2023, is currently serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case, along with his wife. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.</p><small>2025-09-18 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/181914493b29647.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942975/india-says-analysing-implications-of-pak-saudi-mutual-defence-pact-for-national-security' target='_blank'><strong>India says analysing ‘implications’ of Pak-Saudi mutual defence pact for national security</strong></a><br><p>India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said on Thursday that it was analysing the “implications” of the recent mutual defence deal between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia for its own national security.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday.
A military confrontation between India and Pakistan recently occurred in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
In a statement issued on today’s development, the Indian MEA said: “We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability. The government remains committed to protecting India’s national interests and ensuring comprehensive national security in all domains.”
It added that the Indian government was already aware that the development, which it said “formalises a long-standing arrangement between the two countries”, was under consideration.
 






Pakistan and India have fought three major wars since the two countries were carved out of British colonial India in 1947.
After they both acquired nuclear weapons in the late 1990s, their conflicts have been more limited in scale because of the danger of nuclear assets coming into play.
According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.
The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure, when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram.
In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms.
In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges.
The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella, though finer details of the agreement were not made public.
For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider.
For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting the Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time.
Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkiye and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses.
Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represented Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.</p><small>2025-09-18 14:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1819035802e1b8f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942974/may-take-4-5-five-weeks-to-restore-undersea-internet-cables-it-secretary-responds-to-slow-speed-query' target='_blank'><strong>‘May take 4-5 five weeks to restore undersea internet cables’: IT secretary responds to slow speed query</strong></a><br><p>Information and Technology (IT) Secretary Zarrar Hasham said on Thursday that restoring damaged undersea internet cables may take four to five weeks.
During a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication today while responding to a query raised by member Sadiq Memon over the slow internet and disruptions, the IT secretary replied that multiple cables had been cut off the coast of Yemen, affecting internet services.
“Not only one or two cables have been cut, but between four and five,” Hasham told the meeting at Islamabad’s IT Park. “The issue is serious considering the situation in Yemen. Two cables coming to Pakistan have been affected.”
The secretary added that bandwidth had been shifted to alternative networks.
“Repairing the cables may take four to five weeks,” he said, adding that special boats would be required to perform the repairs.
Memon remarked that it It is being said that three new cables are coming.”
“If three new cables are coming, then why are there still internet issues?” he added.
The IT secretary replied in the affirmative.
“Three more cables are coming in the next 12 to 18 months, which will provide connectivity to Pakistan from Europe,” Hasham stated.
“Agreements have been made to bring these three cables to Pakistan.”
This is not the first time that damage to undersea internet cables has affected services in Pakistan.
Earlier this month, Pakistan Telecommunications Limited (PTCL) announced that cuts to submarine internet cables in Saudi waters may impact internet services in the country during peak hours, adding that the damage impacted the partial bandwidth capacity SMW4 (South Asia-Middle East-West Asia) and IMEWE (India-Middle East-Western Europe) networks.
Internet users across Pakistan complained of slow internet and hindered access to services throughout 2024. On January 3 this year, PTCL said teams were “diligently” working to resolve the matter of disruptions faced by users after a fault in the AAE-1 subsea internet cable connecting Pakistan slowed down the network speed in the country.
On January 16, PTCL announced that internet services were “now fully operational” after the complete restoration of the Asia-Africa-Europe-1 (AAE-1) undersea internet cable.</p><small>2025-09-18 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624374-doors-of-justice-remain-closed-to-me-imran-khan-tells-cjp-in-letter' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan writes to CJP, says 'doors of justice remain closed to me'</strong></a><br><p>

PM Shehbaz reached Riyadh for a day-long visit yesterday where he and Crown Prince Salman signed the ’Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ at the Al-Yamamah Palace in the Saudi capital.
“Deeply touched by the heart warming welcome, accorded to me by my dear brother HRH (His Royal Highness) Prince Mohammed bin Salman, crown prince and prime minister of Saudi Arabia, on my official visit to Riyadh.
“From the unprecedented escort provided to my aircraft by the Royal Saudi air force jets to the smartly turned out guard of the Saudi armed forces, this welcome reception speaks volumes about the abiding love and mutual respect between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” he said in a post on X.
 






The premier shared that his “most cordial talks” with the crown prince covered a wide range of issues, reviewing regional challenges and enhancing bilateral cooperation“.
“I deeply admire HRH’s vision and leadership that he provides to the Muslim world,” he said, adding that on the bilateral front, he “greatly values” the Saudi crown prince’s “consistent support and his keen interest” in expanding Saudi investments, trade and business ties between Islamabad and Riyadh.
“It is my fervent prayer that Pakistan [and] Saudi Arabia’s friendship continues to flourish and attain new heights of glory. Inshallah! (God willing),” PM Shehbaz said.
PM Shehbaz left for London today after concluding his visit to Riyadh.
 






Defence agreement
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
Wednesday’s agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades.
The announcement was made in a joint statement by Islamabad and Riyadh. The statement said the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”.
“[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details.
Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”.
The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries.
Official Saudi media outlets also carried reports of the signing ceremony, but they offered no further details about the accord or its provisions.
Cooperation between the two states in the area of defence dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure, when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram.
In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms.
Currently the number of Pakistani soldiers deployed in the kingdom is estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000 troops, providing operational, technical and training help to the Saudi military, according to a Reuters report. That includes assistance to the Saudi air and land forces, the report said.
In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges.
The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella though finer details of the agreement were not made public.

The Israeli attack targeting Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time.
Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded.
Today, Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkey and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses.
Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represents Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.
Question of nuclear weapons
Asked whether Pakistan would now be obliged to provide Saudi Arabia with a nuclear umbrella, a senior Saudi official told Reuters: “This is a comprehensive defensive agreement that encompasses all military means.”
The agreement was the culmination of years of discussions, the Saudi official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said when asked about the timing of the deal. “This is not a response to specific countries or specific events but an institutionalisation of long-standing and deep cooperation between our two countries,” the official added.
Pakistan has previously maintained that its nuclear weapons are only aimed, as a deterrent, against India, and its missiles are designed with a range to hit anywhere to its east in India.
The senior Saudi official acknowledged the need to balance relations with Pakistan and India, also a nuclear power.
“Our relationship with India is more robust than it has ever been. We will continue to grow this relationship and seek to contribute to regional peace whichever way we can.”

Fentanyl precursors refer to the basic or parent chemicals that form fentanyl, a leading cause of US overdose deaths.
The statement from the embassy did not name the people affected, but a spokesperson said they were Indian nationals.
Indian government officials have been closely cooperating with US counterparts to combat the challenge of drug trafficking, the US embassy added in its statement.
 






India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the US visa measures.
 
 

US President Donald Trump, whose punitive 50 per cent tariffs on Indian imports hurt bilateral ties, has previously imposed additional levies on imports from China, Mexico and Canada, saying they facilitated the flow of fentanyl into the US.
In a statement to the US Congress this week, Trump listed India as one of 23 major drug transit or illicit drug-producing countries, though he added the presence of any country on the list was not necessarily a reflection of its government’s counter-drug efforts.</p><small>2025-09-18 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624338-pakistan-as-net-security-provider-for-arabian-peninsula' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan as 'net security provider' for Arabian peninsula</strong></a><br><p>

In the letter dated September 16, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Imran expressed grievances over several matters, including the conditions he has been kept in inside jail,  and urged CJP Afridi to direct the Islamabad High Court to fix some “critical petitions” that had been “hanging in the doldrums” for hearing.
The petitions he was referring to pertain to Toshakhana and Al Qadir Trust cases.
Speaking to the media after delivering Imran’s letter, Khosa said the CJP had sought the ex-premier’s complaints regarding the conditions in jail in writing and assured that his grievances would be addressed and responded to within 24 hours.
He said, “We will inform you about whatever happens in [the next] 24 hours.”
Khosa said he had also expressed “our reservations” about the judiciary to the chief justice and raised the matter of jail reforms.
“The CJP has sought suggestions over jail reforms,” he said.
Earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum had reached the court with the PTI founder’s letter, where she was reportedly barred from meeting the CJP by police. Khosa was later allowed access to the chief justice.
The letter
Imran began his letter with complaints about jail conditions, saying: “For over 772 days, from a cage measuring 9 x 11, from a dungeon of enforced silence, isolation and incommunicado, I have endured continued solitary confinement … All access to books and newspapers has been denied to me.”
“Meetings with my lawyers and family are “arbitrarily cancelled at the whims and wishes of one man”, Imran claimed, referring to the army chief.
He also alleged that his sons were barred from talking to him on phone and political workers were also not allowed to see him.
“It is not lawful imprisonment since its inception; it is only calculated psychological torture, crafted to break my will … It is an ongoing assault on the  Constitution, the rule of law and the democratic future of my beloved homeland, Pakistan,” he continued.
The PTI founder also complained of “inhuman and degrading treatment” being meted out to his wife, Bushra Bibi, in jail, alleging that she was being denied medical treatment and access to books and television.
He pointed out that superior courts have held that “female prisoners are entitled to leniency through bail as a matter of right”.
Yet, in Bushra Bibi’s case, “this principle has been suspended”, he said.
The former premier then went on highlight that “thousands of my supporters and party workers continue to languish in jails” and had been “abducted, beaten and subjected to military trials in flagrant violation of constitutional protections”.
He also expressed grievances with regards to the “political victimisation” of his family members.
“Courts that should stand as guardians of liberty have been weaponised to dismantle Pakistan’s largest political party,” the further said.
Imran maintained that his PTI secured a “landslide victory” in last year’s general elections “despite the brutal tactics, the suppression of all bold voices, despite my own imprisonment”.
“Yet, the mandate of the people was stolen overnight, turning democracy into [a] farce and the Constitution into a casualty. The same has been sanctioned and rubber-stamped by the leaked report of Commonwealth 2024,” he wrote.
Although the Comm­on­wealth Observer Group’s (COG) report on Pakistan has yet to be officially released, news outlet Drop Site News claimed that the group had “buried their report” after finding those polls to be riddled with problems.
Imran further said that “the so-called 26th Constitutional Amendment has been used as a tool to sanctify this electoral dacoity, while petitions challenging it lie unheard in your (CJP’s) court”.
CJP Afridi had ignored a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full apex court, according to minutes of the communication exchange between the chief justice and two senior SC judges.
Imran also wrote about the allegedly “questionable conduct of the Islamabad High Court under its chief justice, a byproduct of the 26th Amendment; Justice Sarfaraz Dogar, who deliberately refuses to fix my Al-Qadir trust petitions and the Toshakhana revision petitions”.
 
 

“He has fully abandoned impartiality and reduced Islamabad High Court to a facilitator of unjust and tyrannical campaign against me and those associated with me,” Imran alleged. “I remind him to fulfil his oath, instead of hiding behind frivolous ‘policy reasons’ to justify not hearing my petitions.”
He then urged the CJP to direct the IHC to fix the aforementioned petitions for hearing. He added, “I, as the patron-in-chief of Pakistan’s largest political party, seeks only what the Constitution guarantees: justice, dignity and equality before law. I therefore request immediate hearings of the pending petitions before all courts. Allow all telephone calls to my sons as mandated by the jail manual, grant access to Bushra Bibi’s doctors for her medical treatment, and ultimately restore judicial independence of the judiciary in Pakistan.”
Imran concluded his letter, saying: “The courage of the verdicts you inscribe in the book of this nation’s destiny will go down in history … I urge Your Lordship to uphold the oath of your office and show the people that the Supreme Court of Pakistan remains their final refuge of justice.”</p><small>2025-09-18 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/181335216b23658.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942892/4-india-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-balochistans-khuzdar-during-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 ‘India-sponsored’ terrorists killed in Balochistan’s Khuzdar during IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Four terrorists “belonging to Indian proxy” were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
“On September 17 2025, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in the Khuzdar district of Balochistan, on reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR statement said that during the operation, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location”, adding that “after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from slain terrorists, the ISPR said.
The terrorists were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”, it added.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area,” the statement read.
“Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” it added.
A day ago, the ISPR had issued another statement, saying that the armed forces had eliminated five “Indian sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Khuzdar earlier this week.
Yesterday, two police stations and a Levies station had also come under attack in Balochistan’s Sherani district. In those attacks, a policeman was martyred and two Levies personnel were injured.
On September 12, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung.</p><small>2025-09-18 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624318-karachi-jeweller-stripped-of-rs12m-after-gold-sale' target='_blank'><strong>Big-money heist: Karachi jeweller stripped of Rs12m after gold sale</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan beat United Arab Emirates in their final Group A game on Wednesday to advance to the Super Fours stage, where they will also play two teams from Group B in a round robin format.
Bilateral cricket between India and Pakistan has been suspended since 2013, and they play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
“We are ready, we are ready for any challenge,” Salman said after their 41-run victory against UAE.
“We just want to play good cricket. If we play good cricket, like we have played in the last few months, I think we’ll be good against any side.”
Fakhar Zaman made 50, but Pakistan’s frontline batters disappointed against the UAE’s modest attack, with opener Saim Ayub falling for his third successive duck in the tournament.
Salman acknowledged they had to bat better.
“We got the job done, but we still need to improve our batting in the middle order,” Salman said.
“That’s been a concern and something we need to work on.”
India had cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Pakistan last weekend in the first cricket match between the sides since a four-day military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
 
 

While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end. India skipper Suryakumar Yadav dedicated their victory to the armed forces back home, which was seen as politicisation of the game.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match.
The matter was settled after the PCB said ahead of yesterday’s match that Pycroft had apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts over a controversy during the recent Pakistan-India match.
India and Pakistan could meet for a third time at the tournament if they both reach the September 28 final.</p><small>2025-09-18 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624290-pakistan-iaea-ink-pact-to-boost-peaceful-nuclear-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, IAEA ink pact to boost peaceful nuclear cooperation</strong></a><br><p>
