Most seats fell vacant after the disqualification of PTI lawmakers convicted for their alleged involvement in the May 9, 2023 violent riots following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.
The six NA constituencies where polling is taking place include one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, NA-18 (Haripur), and the rest in Punjab — NA-96 (Faisalabad), NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-129 (Lahore), NA-143 (Sahiwal) and NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan).
The seven Punjab Assembly constituencies where by-polls are being held are PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), PP-98 (Faisalabad), PP-115 (Faisalabad), PP-116 (Faisalabad), PP-203 (Sahiwal) and PP-269 (Muzaffargarh).
Lahore
In NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), the seat fell vacant following the death of former Punjab governor and PTI stalwart Mian Muhammad Azhar. His grandson Chaudhry Arsalan is now contesting the by-poll, while the PML-N has fielded Hafiz Mian Muhammad Noman.
The PTI alleged that ballot paper books received by the presiding officers at a station were less than the number of books issued to them. However, an official pointed out that the serial numbers mentioned in the form confirmed that 18 ballot books had been issued.
Absconding PTI leader Hammad Azhar, in a post on X, shared the Form-36 (“Packing Invoice” containing the quantity of ballot paper books) of polling station No.330, Government Model Girls High School, Samanabad.
The Form-36 stated that 18 ballot paper books, from serial No.5179 to 7194 and each containing 100 ballots, had been issued. However, the presiding officer encircled the number 18, overwrote 15 with a pen and signed the form. The ballot books were meant for a female polling station with 1,716 registered voters.
However, an official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said it was a typographic error as the number of ballot books issued to the polling station was 15, confirmed by the serial number from 5179-5194.
 






PML-N’s Rana Mashhood Ahmad, head of Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, cast his vote at the Pak Angel School polling station in Union Council 100, APP reported.
He said, “Every vote given to Hafiz Mian Muhammad Nauman is a guarantee of fair and strong mandate to advance the journey of public service, transparent leadership and sustainable development.”

 






Faisalabad
Faisalabad is witnessing elections on two NA seats, NA-96 and NA-104, and three provincial seats — PP-98, PP-115 and PP-116.
In NA-96, the PML-N has fielded Muhammad Bilal Badar Chaudhry, brother of Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry.
 


In NA-104, the PML-N has nominated Daniyal Ahmed, who is contesting against three independent candidates. Ahmed previously contested the elections and lost to Sahibzada Hamid Raza, who secured 132,655 votes. Ahmed is the son of former NA opposition leader Raja Riaz.
 






In PP-98, the party has nominated Azad Ali Tabbasum, who is contesting against nine independent candidates. The party had not nominated any candidate in this constituency in the 2024 elections, backing instead the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) candidate Muhammad Ajmal, who was runner-up to PTI-backed Junaid Afzal Sahi.
In PP-115, the ruling party’s candidate Muhammad Tahir Pervez is facing three independents and an Awami Justice Party Pakistan (AJPP) candidate. Pervez also contested the 2024 polls and remained runner-up to PTI-backed Shahid Javed.
In PP-116, the PML-N has nominated Ahmed Shaharyar, the son-in-law of Senator Rana Sanaullah. He is contesting against five independents and a Pakistan Nazriyati Party (PNP) candidate. In the 2024 polls, Shaharyar was runner-up with 52,517 votes.
More than 6,500 security personnel were deployed at 1,240 polling stations established in the five constituencies, APP quoted a police spokesman as saying. The stations included 64 of Category-A, 610 of Category-B and 566 stations of Category-C..
All independent candidates of the five constituencies have claimed that they are being backed by the PTI leadership. It is pertinent to mention that the PTI has announced the boycott of these by-elections, except for those in Haripur and Lahore.
The PML-N is likely to win all five seats up thanks to the PTI’s official boycott, the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) being in no condition to contest due to the recent ban on it, and the PPP fielding no candidate.
Dera Ghazi Khan
In NA-185 (DG Khan-II), PPP’s Dost Muhammad Khosa and the PML-N’s Mehmood Qadir Khan Leghari are among the key candidates.
The seat had fallen vacant after the disqualification of PTI’s Zartaj Gul. Leghari, a sitting MPA, is a self-made businessman, not directly related to the family of late former president Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari.
NA-185 is one of the three NA constituencies in the district and encompasses populous urban areas, according to the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen).
 






A total of 226 polling stations with 860 booths have been set up, including 434 male and 426 female booths, APP reported. The constituency has 418,310 registered voters, comprising 222,392 men and 195,918 women.
According to the district administration, four polling stations have been declared highly sensitive, 53 sensitive, and 169 normal due to security concerns.
Haripur
While the PTI had announced an official boycott of most by-elections, it is contesting on Haripur’s NA-18 seat left vacant after the disqualification of former NA opposition leader Omar Ayub.
The PTI leader’s wife, Shehrnaz Omar Ayub, is now contesting the seat and will face PML-N’s Babar Nawaz and PPP’s Irum Fatima Turk. PTI-backed Shehrnaz is contesting an election for the first time.
 


Polling is underway peacefully with no poll-related violence reported from across the constituency, which spans about 1,726 square kilometres.
While the turnout remained poor between 8am and 12pm due to the cold winter weather, there was a sudden increase in voters showing up at polling stations after 12pm, a Dawn correspondent reported.
A total of 753,944 registered voters, comprising 392,339 male and 361,605 female voters, are expected to cast their ballots, according to the ECP.
APP reported that 602 polling stations have been established across the constituency. Of these, 462 polling stations have been declared normal, 100 sensitive, and 40 highly sensitive. The ECP has deployed 4,414 polling staff to manage the electoral process.

Babar, who had earlier served as MNA during 2015-2018, has won the support of his party leaders, including Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s husband, retired Captain Safdar Awan.
According to observers, Haripur’s political landscape remains dominated by patronage rather than ideology. Not a single woman in the district’s history could ever make it to the provincial or the National Assembly in a direct election.
Sahiwal
For NA-143, PML-N has fielded Muhammad Tufail Jutt against independent candidate Zarrar Akbar Choudhary.
 






In PP-203, the PML-N’s Muhammad Hanif Jutt, brother of Muhammad Tufail Jutt, is contesting against independent candidate Sardar Falak Sher Dogar.
Sargodha
From PP-73, the PML-N has fielded Mian Sultan Ali Ranjha as its candidate.
 






Mianwali
In Mianwali’s PP-87, the PML-N has fielded Ali Haider Noor Khan as its candidate.
 






Muzaffargarh
In PP-269 of Muzaffargarh, Mian Alamdar Qureshi is contesting as the PPP’s candidate.
Polling at the Karam Dad polling station was “paused for a few minutes” following clashes between two parties, the spokesperson for the election commissioner of Punjab said in a statement.
“However, later on, law enforcement agencies confirmed that the polling had resumed after a short break,” the spokesperson said.
Security personnel deployed
According to the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) code of conduct for the armed forces, troops will be deployed outside polling stations declared “most sensitive” and will remain in quick-response mode at the remaining stations as third-tier responders.
The personnel have been directed to perform duties strictly in accordance with Article 245 of the Constitution, the law and the mandate assigned to the armed forces to assist the election regulator.
While stationed outside selected polling stations, they have been instructed to focus solely on ensuring a secure environment, complying with all relevant laws, and maintaining public confidence by safeguarding voters and preserving law and order throughout the polling process.
They have been barred from preventing any eligible voter from entering a polling station, except in cases involving weapons, explosives, prohibited items or attempts to incite violence or threaten national security.
In Punjab, where by-elections for 12 of the 13 vacant seats are taking place, more than 20,000 police personnel have been deployed for security in the province’s national and provincial constituencies.
In a post on X, the Punjab police said it was on “high alert”. It asserted there was “zero tolerance” for the violation of the ECP’s code of conduct, restrictions under Section 144, and the ban on arms.
 






“The polling process is being continuously monitored from the Central Police Office, the Safe City Authority, and the control and monitoring rooms of districts,” the police said.
Noting that the police had the full assistance of the Rangers and the army, Punjab police chief Dr Usman Anwar said, “All formations, including the Dolphin Squad, Special Branch and CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department), are being employed for the elections’ security.”

In a joint statement, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) affirmed that it was their two-decade-old demand that the FCC should be established with equal representation of the provinces for hearing constitutional and political matters, so that general public cases could be decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in a timely manner.
The statement was jointly issued by PBC Vice Chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nasrullah Warriach and SCBA President Haroonur Rashid.
 
 

According to the statement, the FCC will strengthen the federation. It said the premier bodies were watching carefully the entire process, including the appointment of judges, and would express their concerns and grievances, when needed, through decisions and resolutions of the general houses of both bodies. The statement said that the PBC and the SCBA always stood for upholding the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the supremacy of institutions, and adherence to the Constitution.
The statement also expressed regret over certain political factions within the legal community aimed at creating chaos and division among lawyers, just to achieve their ulterior political motives and promote their political agenda. They often issue statements aimed at sabotaging the democratic system of the country, it claimed.
“We strongly reject and condemn such statements issued by the non-elected people and assure that their futile exercise will soon be rendered ineffective,” the statement said.
“We, the elected representatives, want to make it explicitly clear that the PBC and SCBA, being apex bodies of the legal fraternity, were only supposed to issue statements on behalf of the ins­titutions on national issues,” it stressed.

Reuters was not able to establish the exact timing or scope of the new operations, nor whether US President Donald Trump had made a final decision to act.
Reports of looming action have proliferated in recent weeks as the US military has deployed forces to the Caribbean amid worsening relations with Venezuela.
Two of the US officials said covert operations would likely be the first part of the new action against Maduro. All four officials quoted in this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of impending action by the United States.
The Pentagon referred questions to the White House. The CIA declined to comment. A senior administration official on Saturday did not rule anything out regarding Venezuela.
“President Trump is prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country and to bring those responsible to justice,” said the official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The Trump administration has been weighing Venezuela-related options to combat what it has portrayed as Maduro’s role in supplying illegal drugs that have killed Americans. He has denied having any links to the illegal drug trade.
Two US officials told Reuters the options under consideration included attempting to overthrow Maduro.
Maduro, in power since 2013, has contended that Trump seeks to oust him and that Venezuelan citizens and the military will resist any such attempt.
The Venezuelan president, who will celebrate his 63rd birthday on Sunday, appeared on Saturday night at Caracas’ main theatre for the premiere of a television series based on his life.
A military buildup in the Caribbean has been underway for months, and Trump has authorised covert CIA operations in Venezuela.
The US Federal Aviation Administration on Friday warned major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela and urged them to exercise caution.
Three international airlines cancelled flights departing from Venezuela on Saturday after the FAA warning.
The United States plans on Monday to designate the Cartel de los Soles a foreign terrorist organisation for its alleged role in importing illegal drugs into the United States, officials said. The Trump administration has accused Maduro of leading Cartel de los Soles, which he denies.
Hegseth: New options after terrorist designation
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said last week that the terrorist designation “brings a whole bunch of new options to the United States.”
Trump has said the upcoming designation would allow the United States to strike Maduro’s assets and infrastructure in Venezuela, but he also has indicated a willingness to potentially pursue talks in hopes of a diplomatic solution.
Two US officials acknowledged conversations between Caracas and Washington. It was unclear whether those conversations could impact the timing or scale of the US operations.
The US Navy’s largest aircraft carrier, the Gerald R. Ford, arrived in the Caribbean on November 16 with its strike group, joining at least seven other warships, a nuclear submarine and F-35 aircraft.
US forces in the region so far have focused on counter-narcotics operations, even though the assembled firepower far outweighs anything needed for them.
US troops have carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, killing at least 83 people.
Human rights groups have condemned the strikes as illegal extrajudicial killings of civilians, and some US allies have expressed growing concerns that Washington may be violating international law.
Washington in August doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro’s arrest to $50 million.
The US military dwarfs Venezuela’s, which is debilitated by a lack of training, low wages and deteriorating equipment. Some unit commanders have been forced to negotiate with local food producers to feed their troops because government supplies fall short, Reuters has reported.
That reality has led Maduro’s government to consider alternative strategies in the event of a US invasion, including possibly a guerrilla-style response, which the government has termed “prolonged resistance” and mentioned in broadcasts on state television.
This approach would involve small military units at more than 280 locations carrying out acts of sabotage and other guerrilla tactics, Reuters has reported, citing sources and years-old planning documents.</p><small>2025-11-23 07:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/231136438f62c9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956865/tejas-crash-dampens-export-hopes-for-indian-fighter-jet' target='_blank'><strong>Tejas crash dampens export hopes for Indian fighter jet</strong></a><br><p>The crash of India’s Tejas fighter in front of global arms buyers at the Dubai Airshow is the latest blow to a key national trophy, leaving the jet reliant on Indian military orders to sustain its role as a showcase of home-built defence technology.
The cause of Friday’s crash was not immediately known but it capped a week of jockeying for influence at the event, attended by India’s arch-rival Pakistan six months after the neighbouring foes faced off in the world’s largest air battle in decades.
Such a public loss will inevitably overshadow India’s efforts to establish the jet abroad after a painstaking development over four decades, experts said, as India paid tribute to Wing Commander Namansh Syal who died in the crash.
Crash at showcase event in Dubai
“The imagery is brutal,” said Douglas A. Birkey, executive director of the US-based Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies, referring to the history of crashes at air shows where nations and industries seek to tout major national achievements.
“A crash sends quite the opposite signal: a dramatic failure,” he said, adding however that while the Tejas would suffer negative publicity, it would most likely regain momentum.
Dubai is the world’s third-largest air show after Paris and Britain’s Farnborough, and accidents at such events have become increasingly rare.
In 1999, a Russian Sukhoi Su-30 crashed after touching the ground during a manoeuvre at the Paris Airshow, and a Soviet MiG-29 crashed at the same event a decade earlier. All crew ejected safely and India went on to place orders for both jets.
Fighter sales “are driven by high order political realities, which supersede a one-off incident”, said Birkey.
Powered by GE engines
The Tejas programme began in the 1980s as India sought to replace vintage Soviet-origin MiG-21s, the last of which retired as recently as September after numerous extensions due to slow Tejas deliveries by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).
The state-owned company has 180 of the advanced Mk-1A variant on order domestically but is yet to begin deliveries due to engine supply chain issues at GE Aerospace.
A former HAL executive who left the company recently said the crash in Dubai “rules out exports for now”.
Target markets included Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and HAL also opened an office in Malaysia in 2023.
“The focus for the coming years would be on boosting production of the fighter for domestic use,” the former executive said, requesting anonymity.
But the Indian Air Force is worried about its shrinking fighter squadrons, which have fallen to 29 from an approved strength of 42, with early variants of the MiG-29, Anglo-French Jaguar and French Mirage 2000 set to retire in coming years.
“The Tejas was supposed to be their replacement,” an IAF officer said. “But it is facing production issues.”
As an alternative, India is considering off-the-shelf purchases to fill immediate gaps, with options including more French Rafales, two Indian defence officials said, adding that India still plans to add to about 40 Tejas already in service.
India is also weighing competing offers from the US and Russia for 5th-generation F-35 and Su-57 fighters — two advanced models also rarely sharing a stage in Dubai this week.
‘Base’ for future programmes
India has for years been among the world’s biggest arms importers, but has increasingly projected the Tejas as an example of self-reliance with Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking a sortie in the fighter in November 2023.
Like most fighter programmes, the Tejas has fought for attention at the intersection of technology and diplomacy.
Development was initially held up partly by sanctions following India’s 1998 nuclear tests as well as problems in developing local engines, said Walter Ladwig, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London.
But the jet’s long-term significance is “likely to lie less in sales abroad than in the industrial and technological base it creates for India’s future combat-aircraft programmes,” he said.
Regional rivalry plays out
Both India and Pakistan were present in force at the show, where the Tejas performed multiple aerial displays in the presence of the rival Pakistani contingent.
Pakistan disclosed the signing of a provisional agreement with a “friendly country” to supply its JF-17 Thunder Block III fighter, co-developed with China.
On the ramp, a JF-17 was flanked by arms including PL-15E, the export variant of a family of Chinese missiles that US and Indian officials say brought down at least one French Rafale used by India during an aerial battle with Pakistan in May.
At an exhibition stand, manufacturer PAC distributed brochures touting the JF-17, one of two models deployed by Pakistan during the four-day conflict, as “battle-tested”.
India is a lot more careful with the Tejas, which was not actively used in the four-day conflict in May, Indian officials have said, without giving any reasons.
Nor did it participate in the annual January 26 Republic Day aerial display in New Delhi this year due to what officials said were safety reasons associated with single-engine aircraft.</p><small>2025-11-23 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634988-judges-transfer-case-five-ihc-judges-challenge-hearing-of-plea-by-fcc' target='_blank'><strong>Judges' transfer case: Five IHC judges challenge hearing of plea by FCC</strong></a><br><p>

Police officials note with concern the increasingly disturbing trend to promote obscenity, vulgarity and brandishing of weapons to terrorise citizens: the rise of negative content on TikTok, which is increasingly influencing young people.
Police say, content creators have turned to entertainment platforms like TikTok to make money by generating more views through showcasing of weapons and promoting vulgar content that is having a negative impact on society.
 
 

In some cases, the exchange of abuses on the social media platform led to fire fight between individuals, resulting in killings.
Taking note of the increasing trend, Peshawar police recently launched a crackdown against those responsible for pushing boundaries and were promoting negative content through vulgar videos and showcasing of weapons.
According to data, 91 cases have so far been registered for vulgar content, resulting in 94 arrests. Additionally, 657 cases have been registered for showcasing weapons leading to 681 arrests.
The police data reveals that majority of those arrested are men misusing the social media platform with a significant number of cases involving the display of pistols to semi-automatic and automatic weapons on the popular platform.
A local TikToker argued that there were many reasons why people engaged in abusive conversation on live videos on the social media platform. “Some individuals believe that they will get more views than normal videos, while others do it for fame, seeking attention in form of likes, comments and followers.”
Interestingly, some individuals claim that they are trying to break free from extremism, using the platform as a space to express themselves in way they feel are liberating.
But while the crackdown helped sent out a strong message with some content creators repenting their behavior in social media posts and video statements promising to become good citizens, police say that some content creators have adopted novel methods to escape the dragnet of law by relocating to other cities to be able to upload videos from outside of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Some TikTokers voiced their concern, arguing that the crackdown was an infringement on their right to freedom of expression and free speech.
They believed they should be free to express themselves without fear of censorship, referring to Article 19 of the Constitution of Pakistan, which guaranteed the right to freedom of expression. But police said that the freedom had limits regarding “decency and morality”.
A sociologist at the University of Peshawar said that some users might engage in such behaviour due to disconnect in their desires and reality.
“People’s desires can drive them to create negative content. The desire for attention and social media fame can lead people to create content that pushes the boundaries. This is often a result of daydreaming where people’s desires are different from reality, leading to a kind of addiction that blurs the boundaries of modesty,” the sociologist explained.

He was addressing the participants of JI’s Ijtima-i-Aam at Minar-i-Pakistan here on Saturday.
He said that the nation wouldn’t allow the government to accept the supremacy of the United States in connection with foreign policy and internal affairs of Pakistan. He said that Islam does not provide immunity to anyone, be it a marshal or a president.
He directed his party workers to invite all political workers without discrimination to join their struggle to change the ‘corrupt and dilapidated’ system.
Talking about reforms to empower people, he lambasted the Punjab government and questioned why it had not held local government elections in the past one and a half decade.
Talking about the education sector, he said the provincial governments had allocated tens of billions of rupees for the sector, yet the situation was utterly disappointing.
Taking a dig at PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, he said that he claimed to be a democrat, however, he himself was a typical feudal landlord. He questioned why the people of rural Sindh were still deprived of their rights. “A capitalist mindset is making the poor even poorer,” he said, adding that the “Badal Do Nizam” (change the system) movement must also be expanded within Sindh to eliminate feudalism and oppression.
If given the opportunity, he promised to fully empower institutions at the grassroots level, establish neighborhood justice committees, and reform the judicial system in accordance with the Constitution.
He said that Bhutto and Imran Khan raised slogans against feudalism, but later made the same feudals their political guardians. “We will not come to power through anyone’s blessings but through the will of the people,” he said, adding that corporate feudalism had now replaced traditional feudalism, enslaving the public even further.
He said the movement was committed to establishing equal education for all, ensuring labour rights, and guaranteeing fundamental rights for women according to the Constitution.
He also condemned the entrenched power of feudal lords, tribal chiefs, generals, and bureaucrats who “exploit 250 million people to please their superiors.”
“The state is prepared to enforce its writ in every matter except providing education to the youth,” he said.
A prize distribution ceremony was later held to encourage the young talent in the society. Seasoned economists, political scientists and industrialists shared their views and shed light on the potential of Pakistan and the red tape culture, coupled with corruption in almost every sector.

He was talking to the media after offering condolences to the family of PPP leader Mian Manzoor Ahmed Maneka.
Mr Ashraf said that Mian Manzoor Maneka was an asset of the PPP, who stood with the party through thick and thin.
He said it was not appropriate to comment on the IMF report and take it as a benchmark. All constitutional institutions should work within their limits, he said, adding that the Chief Minister of KPK should meet the founder of PTI to seek guidance.
To another question, he said that no government wanted inflation, but it was true that it had been out of control. But now, it was bridled to a great extent.
He said that the PPP had an agreement with the PML-N that the local bodies elections would be held in the province soon.

In a detailed response, Ms Bukhari said that the chief minister “never interferes in the work of any government official,” and that all meetings inside jails were strictly governed by established prison rules.
 
 

She said that political meetings were categorically prohibited under jail regulations, and the jail superintendent was the “final authority” on all such matters. She explained that prison officials only facilitate meetings between inmates and their immediate family members and that the list of approved visitors was provided by the prisoner himself.
“If an inmate does not wish to meet someone, jail authorities cannot forcibly arrange such a meeting,” she added.

Suggests KP CM to study the law; Kundi again rules out governor’s rule

Clarifying the situation of the PTI founder, Ms Bukhari said that he was allowed meetings twice a week and had already held 420 meetings with his lawyers and 189 meetings with his family members. She noted that meetings requested by Bushra Bibi’s family were handled separately.
“Yet, every week, a rally is staged outside the jail as if no meetings are being allowed,” she remarked.
Criticising Sohail Afridi, the minister said that he should “study the law himself before attempting to lecture others”.
 
 

She accused him of standing alongside “convicted offenders of the May 9 attacks” and of intimidating government officials during political gatherings.
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Kareem Kundi has again ruled out the possibility of imposition of governor’s rule in KP and termed the social media reports of his removal baseless.
He said his Friday’s meeting with Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif was to discuss the law and order situation and other matters related to the well-being of the people in KP.
He was talking to the media at Kothi Nawab Shaib after offering condolences with former MNA Nawabzada Ghazanfar Gul on the demise of his brother and veteran parliamentarian Nawabzada Mazhar Ali Khan here on Saturday.
JUI-F MNA from KP Noor Alam Khan, ex-MPA Nawabzada Haider Mehdi, Gujrat PML-N president Tahirul Mulk and other members of Nawabzada family were also present at the occasion.
Mr Kundi said the KP province had been a victim of terrorism but still some elements were unnecessarily opposing even the intelligence-based operation.
He said now the educational institutions had come under attack of terrorists who had also been targeting the police, army and Frontier Constabulary which could not be tolerated.
He said the role of federal government and armed forces was vital for the peace and stability in the KP where huge reservoirs of oil, gas and other mines had been found which could become beneficial for the country and the province.
Earlier, he offered prayers for the departed soul.
Meanwhile, former federal minister Chaudhry Wajahat Hussain and his son and PML-Q MNA Hussain Elahi also offered condolences with the Nawabzada family on the death of the ex-MNA.
Wajahat and his son, have been the political rivals of the Nawabzada family for the last three decades in the electoral politics of NA-63 (Jalalpur Jattan-Tanda) of Gujrat district.
Senior PPP leaders Nadeem Afzal Chan, Qamar Zaman Kaira and others also visited the Nawabzada family for the condolences.

Earlier on Friday, KP chief minister Muhammad Sohail Afridi in a media interaction in Islamabad told reporters that he intended to attend NFC inaugural meeting.
He said that he was going to attend the meeting as it was a matter of provincial rights and that the Centre should pay Rs3 trillion of liabilities.
On Saturday, KP adviser to chief minister on finance Muzzammil Aslam in a social media post stated the shared a range of items which the province was expecting from the 11th NFC Award.

Province seeks to align Award with ‘ground realities’

He said that the KP was looking towards the financial merger for erstwhile Fata into federal divisible pool. “Currently, merged area gets special grants from federal government. This will pass on the burden on provinces and relief to federal government,” he said.
 






KP government has been of the view that from 7th NFC to 10th NFC, vertical and horizontal distribution remained intact despite25th Amendment (merger of Fata into KP).
The provincial government has been pushing to align NFC with the change in population, geography and backwardness, as post-merger province’s revised divisible pool share goes up to 19.64 per cent of the total instead of existing 14.62 per cent.
 
 

Mr Aslam also said that the 11th iteration of the NFC Award would also hopefully remove the grievances of small provinces, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan.
He said that the province was also looking towards improvement or reconstitution of the horizontals of provincial horizontals (population, revenue, poverty and reverse population density) and adding climate, water resources, population control, own source revenue collection and human development index as new horizontals
In addition to this, he said that province was also hopeful of retaking non-divisible pool resources which the federal government passed on to provinces without any yard stick (such as subsidies). “In that small provinces are getting less as compared to larger provinces,” he said.
Besides, he said that KP was also looking towards complete devolvement of some expenditure borne by federal government to provinces which doesn’t belong to the Centre as well as identifying the new avenues to improve revenue to GDP and essentially tax to GDP ratio.
He said that they were also hopeful of serious discussion on provincial finance commission (PFC) and assessment of its current status.
Mr Aslam said that the province also looked up to restructuring and rationalisation of federal expenditures, which were challenging federal government fiscal management.
“Fiscal indiscipline and gaps identified by recent International Monetary Fund corruption diagnosis report may ensure extra resources for federal government without disturbing the 57.5: 41.5: 1 percent vertical distribution,” he said.
He said that the province also wanted independent audit of population province-wise.

Trump’s meeting with New York City’s mayor-elect Zohran K. Mamdani a ‘bromance’ may be exaggerated, but who’d have predicted that the Oval Office encounter would turn out to be so amicable that it astounded both the Republican Party rank and file and, possibly, even the top guns of the Democratic Party. The president, who had earlier described Mamdani as a “communist”, an “anti-Semite” and a “lunatic”, changed his tune ahead of the young mayor-elect’s White House visit on Friday, saying he expected the meeting to be “cordial”.
Only a day earlier, his press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a briefing: “It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House, because that’s who the Democrat Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country.”
CNN reported that Republican Senator Rick Scott of Florida late on Friday morning called Mamdani a “literal communist” and predicted he was “on his way to the White House to be schooled by President Trump”. The Republicans, CNN said, have spent weeks, even months, suggesting they were preparing to tie Democrats far and wide to Mamdani’s politics. Democrats also seemed to fear this, judging by how reluctant some of them were to endorse him. “This was the GOP’s [Republican Party] first big opportunity to drive that message — to set up this contrast between Trump’s agenda and the purported communism that has infected the national Democratic Party … Trump trampled all over that strategy.”
He must have shocked the Republican Party by rubbishing another one of its major lines of attack that Mamdani is a ‘jihadist’. Trump was asked if he agreed with Republican candidate for New York governor (the vehemently pro-Israel Congresswoman) Elise Stefanik, who made that claim: “No, I don’t”, and attributed her comment to electioneering.

Although Mamdani stood respectfully by the president’s side, he demonstrated that he was no pushover.

The president also complimented the young New Yorker, who was born when Trump was 45, on his win against some ‘pretty tough’ candidates, and said that the mayor-elect would surprise Republicans by his policies. Not just that, he jumped to his charismatic visitor’s defence when the latter was questioned by reporters on some of his mayoral campaign rhetoric, including calling the White House incumbent a ‘fascist’. This clearly was a change of heart and indicated a reversal of the stance Trump had held since Mamdani entered the race.
The obvious question many are asking is why? I asked one New York-based South Asian-origin analyst, who half-jokingly remarked that the mayor-elect seemed to have taken a leaf out of the Pakistan leadership’s playbook by charming him, “killing him with kindnesses”. Continuing on a more serious note, he said that Trump was a narcissist and a bully. Mamdani, who has exceptional emotional intelligence, may have played on both these traits of the president. He may have combined his South Asian charm — reverence for the elderly — with excellent communication skills, to appeal to the 79-year-old’s narcissism, but he also firmly, though politely, made it clear that he was not one to be bullied.
Although Mamdani stood respectfully by the president’s side as the latter sat at his desk while speaking to the media, he quickly demonstrated that he was no pushover when asked if he believed whether the US was complicit in what he had called the genocide in Gaza. Mamdani repeated his stance that Israel committed genocide in Gaza that the US funded. He also proudly reiterated: “I am a Democratic Socialist.”
 
 

At the same time, Mamdani stuck or reverted to his main election issue of ‘affordability’ for New Yorkers while answering all questions. Trump, whose approval rating has slumped as inflation is again rising in the US, could do nothing but agree that the cost of living was an issue. He said he also raised and hammered home this point in his presidential election campaign.
When asked if he’d cut federal funding to New York as he had threatened ahead of the mayoral election, Trump downplayed the possibility and said he’d be focusing on helping rather than hurting Mamdani to benefit the “city we both love”. Trump may have moved to Florida in recent years, but will always be seen as a New Yorker and said he’d be cheering for Mamdani and that the mayor-elect wanted to make NYC great again.
Another analyst said the president likes ‘strong’ leaders as he has said publicly many times, whether referring to Pakistan’s army chief or some of those he sees as his allies across the world, including the newly elected Japanese prime minister. “He must place Mamdani in the same category, as the mayor-elect battled the whole of the Republican Party and the Democratic Party establishment to win against immense odds.”
There is no doubt that many political pundits have been in awe of the army of volunteers the young politician assembled for door-to-door campaigning and the superb messaging his media team developed to target new or first-time voters on social media as well as to spread his message to the general public through his interviews and campaign ads on legacy media.
Of course, the one missing element in media analyses of the apparent bonhomie in the Oval Office was the ‘transactional’ nature of the president’s policies and demeanour. He was severe, even rude, to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, because the latter to him was someone ‘needy’.
But Mamdani is not. Perhaps, the fact that Trump, his close friend and special envoy Steve Witkoff, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner (and other cronies) all have real estate interests in NYC running into several billion dollars may also have been a factor.
Whether it is regulating real estate in the city including zoning, fire and safety regulations or the award of building licences, or contracts for social housing projects, the buck stops with City Hall. And the mayor more or less controls City Hall. So, Kushner, Witkoff and other family/friends-business associates, partners, and Trump himself, must have realised the importance of keeping City Hall onside, brushing aside political rhetoric and considerations.

Mehsud, along with his other associates, has been booked in a case pertaining to opening fire on people protesting against a fatal accident involving a dumper on the night between Nov 3 and Nov 4 in the Nishtar Road area. On the next day, the suspect had moved the court and got interim pre-arrest bail.
On Saturday, Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Irshad Hussain rejected the pre-arrest bail application and also recalled his interim bail after hearing both sides and examining the record.
The court noted that the act of indiscriminate firing on people by a guard of the applicant was an act of terrorism and the case should be exclusively tried by an anti-terrorism court.
The suspect appeared in court and as soon as the order was announced he managed to escape from the court premises and police as well as the investigating officer (IO) failed to arrest him.
In its order, the court stated that as per the footage produced by the IO, the applicant along with his guard was present at the scene and the latter opened straight fire at the people, which created terror, fear and insecurity among the public.
It also noted that the permit of the weapon used in the crime was also not valid as it had expired in September.
The court observed that although no one sustained firearm injuries, the act of indiscriminate firing on the people amount to use of lethal force in public.
It said that the case came within the ambit of Section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and there were reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed the offences of terrorism, rioting and attempted murder.
Initially, the FIR against Mehsud was lodged under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed) and 337-H (ii) (rash or negligent act to endanger human life) of the Pakistan Penal Court against the dumpers association’s head at Garden police station.

Instead of meaningfully reassessing their strategies, these institutions appear to be resorting to increasingly coercive and defensive responses. While coercion has its place, especially when integrated with a broader political strategy, an overemphasis on primitive actions risks undermining hard-won security gains and is counterproductive.
Before unpacking this argument further, it is worth examining how Pakistan’s security apparatus is currently attempting to secure two key capitals: Islamabad, the federal seat of power, and Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan, a province grappling simultaneously with a protracted insurgency and the persistent threat of Islamist militancy.
The key issue is not to contrast London and Paris as Charles Dickens did, but to analyse how two Pakistani cities, despite receiving similar financial and human resources for security, face threats on different scales, one significantly more secure, the other less so. The state expends large resources on intelligence, deployments, and checkpoints. Still, terrorists exploit weaknesses: attacks occur less often in Islamabad and far more frequently in Quetta. The residents of both cities remain dissatisfied with the security institutions’ counterterrorism strategies, as these measures directly disrupt their daily routines and negatively impact local businesses. The security institutions rarely take public grievances into account when developing their preventive strategies.
 
 

Recent statistics on terrorist incidents in Islamabad and Quetta underscore the pressing need for security agencies to rethink and modernise their preventive measures. In Islamabad, there have been six terrorist attacks since January 2021, resulting in 21 fatalities. Notably, the most recent attack on Nov 11, which struck the district courts and led to 12 deaths, was the deadliest; earlier attacks were comparatively smaller, occurring on the city’s outskirts and primarily targeting police officers, with most incidents linked to the TTP.

Public frustration and insecurity are as lethal as the threat of terrorism itself.

In contrast, Quetta faced 152 terrorist attacks during the same period, causing 264 fatalities. The targets in Quetta were far more diverse: civilians, government officials, security forces, tribal elders, religious communities and their leaders, and political workers. The perpetrators were equally varied, from nationalist insurgent groups such as the Baloch Republican Guards, BLA, BLF, and BRAS (an alliance of BLA, BLF, and BRG), to Islamist militant and sectarian organisations including IS-K/ISPP, LeJ, TTP and UBA. This pattern has remained persistent. Since January alone, Quetta has suffered 32 attacks, causing 32 deaths, with the same range of actors and targets.
The data clearly shows that militant groups, their targets, and their operational tactics have evolved over the years. This shift reflects the ineffectiveness of current counterterrorism strategies, both operational and preventive, which rely heavily on security checkpoints, safe city surveillance systems, and internet jamming. In Islamabad, the latest attack is a stark reminder that terrorist groups have breached the defensive wall constructed by law-enforcement agencies.
The level of insecurity in Quetta is naturally very high, but residents of the federal capital are increasingly frustrated for different reasons: the expanding layers of security, the growing number of checkpoints, and hours-long road blockages due to the movement protocols for cricket teams, foreign dignitaries, and government officials. The city often comes to a standstill, reflecting nervousness and poor management despite the availability of substantial state resources. Yet the government appears reluctant to revisit or rethink its security planning.
When security agencies become overly obsessed with rigid protocols, they inadvertently give an advantage to terrorists who adapt their tactics, focusing on breaching these measures. Data from the two cities illustrates this pattern.
When terrorists gain a sense of advantage, or in some cases of victory, it weakens the state’s coercive strategies. These strategies include pressuring states that provide hideouts or support to militants, as well as the political approach of engagement or non-engagement with such actors. The state’s counter-propaganda strategies also lose credibility when the public sees a very different reality unfolding on the streets.
Pakistan has been pressuring the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to cease its support for terrorist networks, particularly the TTP. Just the other day, the Foreign Office stated that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depends on Kabul ending cross-border terrorism, and even linked the future of key regional energy projects to the Taliban halting support for militant groups. This was in response to the Afghan deputy prime minister for economic affairs Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar’s recent press conference, in which he advised Afghan traders to stop exporting goods through Pakistan. Clearly, this approach is not working, as the adversaries see the level of frustration when dealing with them.
Law-enforcement agencies must enhance their use of human, financial, technical and cyber resources, and strategically adapt operations. Reliance on visible deterrence, such as check posts and major street blockades, disrupts public life, yet efficacy would not decrease with fewer check posts if technology were used more efficiently. As terrorists continually attempt to breach both overt and covert security measures, agencies must broaden their efforts across all domains.
Blocking highways and major routes for the movement of foreign and local VIPs does not reduce risks. In many cases, it increases them and fuels public panic and frustration. This frustration is particularly pronounced in Islamabad, while insecurity remains high in Quetta. Again, the data indicates that the state needs a comprehensive review of its countering strategies, with coherence across political, operational and preventive dimensions.
Public frustration and insecurity are as lethal as the threat of terrorism itself, yet these human-centred dimensions find little space in the state’s counterterrorism thinking. State institutions often expect citizens to bear the burden of sacrifices required to secure cities, while ordinary people ob­­serve a contrasting reality: state functionaries al­­locate disproportionate resources to securing their own areas, creating red zones, deploying heavy contingents, and disrupting daily life whenever the power elites move through public spaces.

For now, it resembles a spectacle.
Earlier this week, four judges of the Islamabad High Court approached the Supreme Court, hoping to challenge the recently enacted 27th Amendment. Instead of the senior judges being given an audience, they were told to take their issues to the Federal Constitutional Court. In other words, the petitioners were told to seek justice from an institution whose very creation they were there to challenge.
It was a sobering moment. The four judges had petitioned the Supreme Court after months of voicing their apprehensions regarding the “incremental but systematic dismantling” of judicial independence, a process which began with the passage of the 26th Amendment and ended in the most recent constitutional changes. Instead, they appeared to find the Supreme Court more than deferential to an institution that had subverted its authority.
One must highlight again that these were not ordinary petitioners. All four are sitting judges — recognised members of the country’s superior judiciary. All four would seem to strongly believe that the new amendment is severely violative of several established articles of the Constitution. The objections they raised in their petition regarding the appointment of the new court, the transfer of judges on executive whim, and the decimation of judicial independence through institutional capture and the installation of ‘like-minded’ judges are questions that have also been raised by legal experts, international observers, as well as concerned members of the public. For them to be brushed aside as brusquely as parliament had the amendment enacted merely reinforces the perception that a future has been chosen for the judiciary, and that no debate or legal cross-examination of the ‘why’ and ‘what for’ will be able to change it.
The legal fight has now become even more complicated. On Saturday, the four judges, joined by one more, challenged the transfer from the Supreme Court to the FCC of an intra-court appeal against a Constitutional Bench judgement deeming the transfer of judges from other high courts to the IHC ‘constitutional’. They have now told the FCC directly that they consider the 27th Amendment ‘unconstitutional’ and reminded it that the amendment is under challenge.
Now, those in the judiciary who have agreed with the regime on the 27th Amendment may choose to stick to their guns. And they are free to do so. But they should satisfy the petitioners, and all those who will be following this case, that any decision to uphold the amendment rests on sound legal reasoning and not another ‘doctrine’. This case must be heard in detail, and the proceedings should ideally be televised for public consumption. This is an opportunity for the FCC to establish its credentials. It must avail it.

This shifting landscape framed the session ‘Truth, Trust, and Tenacity: The New Media Paradigm,’ held on Saturday, which brought together journalists Fazil Jamili, Azhar Abbas, Amber Rahim Shamsi and Azaz Syed under the moderation of Nadia Naqi.
The discussion was part of the Adab Festival, which returned to Karachi for its 10th edition at Habitt City from November 22 to 23.
Opening the discussion, Naqi noted the challenges journalists face in working and surviving in the current media environment.
“Speaking the truth comes with challenges; often we’ve seen journalists being intimidated, and the controlled environment makes it difficult to speak the truth,” she said. “With truth, of course, comes trust. Is there public trust in the media? That’s the big question; it’s a challenge, actually.”
Naqi asked how difficult it had become for traditional media outlets to remain relevant and compete in the new media paradigm, where social media, content creators, YouTubers, and digital platforms held huge influence.
Abbas, currently Managing Editor at Geo TV Network, said the pervasive noise made it much harder to speak the truth. He opined, without naming anyone responsible, that over the past 15 years, “social engineering” had created clouds of lies, misinformation, and doubt aimed at discrediting the political class, journalists, and human rights activists.
“Beyond mainstream media, digital and social media are also used to spread misinformation. It takes a long time for a journalist, politician, or human rights activist to build trust, but that trust can be destroyed in a minute by social media propaganda,” he added.
“We ourselves question whether we are still relevant,” Abbas said, adding that legacy media still held its audience in terms of numbers.
Naqi emphasised that censorship goes beyond shutting down news outlets or intimidating journalists, affecting their families as well. She noted that issues which cannot be raised on television are often addressed through digital platforms.
Shamsi, Pakistan Editor at Nukta, responded that even though digital media avoids censorship faced by traditional outlets, it comes with its own challenges.
“We exist in a time where there’s never been so much access to information,” she said. According to her, digital platforms prioritise clicks and views and appeal to the reactive, emotional side of the brain rather than encouraging rational thought. “You will prefer somebody who will agree with your views and opinions. That will confirm your bias.”
Another limitation, Shamsi said, came from the platforms themselves, including YouTube, Google, Meta, and X. Political and commercial interests shaped content distribution, where platforms profited from outrage, favouring content with sensational headlines and thumbnails.
“If you use keywords like ‘genocide’, ‘rape’, ‘murder’, or ‘Palestine’ in your [search engine optimisation], then you might get shadowbanned. Because it’s not your own platform, distribution remains an issue even in digital media,” she said.
Amid Israel’s onslaught in Gaza, social media platforms have reportedly been accused of curtailing the reach of pro-Palestine or Israel-critical content, though the companies deny it.
“Globally, journalism is struggling, and I don’t think truth is important anymore,” Shamsi added.
Moderator Naqi indicated that journalists today often felt as though they were “competing with creators on TikTok and YouTube, despite their core responsibility being to report news and seek the truth”. She questioned whether the profession itself was partly to blame, emphasising that social media had deepened divisions within journalism, including within press bodies.
Jamili, President of the Karachi Press Club (KPC), said the line between information and journalism had become increasingly blurred, largely because of social media. “Journalists themselves are confused, and even mainstream media gets caught up when something comes up on social media,” he said.
“There’s no comparison between speed and accuracy. You need time for the truth; only then is there trust. These are things we’ve abandoned over time,” he lamented.
Jamili said censorship had evolved, with self-censorship, now the most prevalent form. Editors and reporters, he added, often wrote with fear.
It is important to note that Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan 158 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index.
He argued that algorithms effectively replaced the editor’s role. “Earlier, editors decided which stories mattered, assessed their quality and relevance, and determined how they should be published. Now the algorithm dictates the priorities, and we’ve become captive to it.”
Speaking about KPC, he said that although it had around 1,800 active members, more than half were unemployed. With delayed wages and salary backlogs stretching three to four months, he asked, “If a journalist is hungry, how can you expect them to be honest?”
Syed, also associated with Geo TV Network, disregarded using the word “truth,” and argued that it was subjective, with each religious or political group holding its own version. “My job is to collect facts,” he said, emphasising instead the need for journalists to distinguish between facts, assumptions, and opinions.
On the role of editors, Naqi noted they were once considered “untouchable”, but said the editors themselves no longer pushed back the way they used to. Jamili added that the practice of editorial writing had effectively disappeared. He mentioned that one of Pakistan’s largest-circilated Urdu newspaper no longer published editorials, yet “no one seems to care”.
In response to a question about controversial media ownership and the influence of land developers in Pakistan, the journalists stressed that such challenges “plagued the industry globally.”</p><small>2025-11-23 03:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956790/why-do-companies-delist-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Why do companies delist in Pakistan?</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Shield’s baby feeders are a common household essential for many families. Considering Pakistan’s high population growth rate, one might expect the business to be thriving. However, recently, Shield Corporation has decided to delist, joining the ranks of companies like Gillette and Philip Morris.
In the 1980s, Pakistan offered a 5 per cent tax advantage to firms that listed on the stock exchange, explains Ali Farid Khwaja, CEO of Oxford Frontier Capital and Co-founder and Chairman of KTrade. That incentive drew dozens of family-owned textile mills and others to the PSX.
That incentive no longer exists. Once the tax break went away, many firms had little interest in public shareholders. They quietly bought back shares, shrank the free float, and continued operating like private family businesses. This explains why many listed companies today have negligible trading volumes.
Some delist simply because public ownership is insignificant. Philip Morris fits partly into this category: its free float was 5pc, small enough to make the listing meaningless while still inviting regulatory scrutiny.
“When you’re listed, you become transparent. If you delist, these requirements go away,” says Asad Ali Shah, former managing partner of Deloitte. Being listed increases visibility, reporting obligations, and tax scrutiny. It also limits the ability to operate in the “grey zones” common in Pakistan’s largely undocumented economy and can make competition harder when non-listed peers are less constrained.
Multinationals often prefer to book profits in lower-tax jurisdictions. Listing complicates this because shareholders can question intercompany transactions, import pricing, margins, and royalties. Pakistan’s regulatory apparatus does not meaningfully oversee transfer pricing. “Not a single transfer pricing case has been pursued to conclusion,” notes Mr Shah. Through transfer pricing, profits can be kept in low-tax jurisdictions while the local listed entity shows thin margins or even losses, he explains. Those losses can then be carried forward for years as tax shields. Once listed, all this becomes visible.
Listing also helps families manage inheritance across generations. “For large family groups with multiple sub-families, a listed structure makes it easier to distribute wealth while keeping the business intact,” notes Mr Khwaja.
 
 

Sayyid Babar Ali writes about this in his autobiography, Mr Khwaja points out. In family-driven businesses, listing provides liquidity, inheritance planning, and the ability to monetise a small portion of shares without giving up control.
Being part of a family business holding shares in a listed company can also generate windfalls. Even selling a tiny fraction of shares at a high price brings cash, and when prices fall, you can buy back. Notices on the PSX often show independent directors, family members, mothers, sisters, and aunts selling small percentages and buying them back. Some families also strategically let prices fall and rise again to maximise returns.
Delisting is expensive. Public shareholders must be bought out at a premium, sometimes many multiples of the share price. Pak Suzuki Motors’ stock illustrates this: from around Rs100 before its delisting notice in April 2023, it shot to Rs900 on January 11 2025. Eventually, Suzuki Japan set a minimum share price at Rs406, but the PSX ultimately fixed the buyback at Rs609. Similarly, when Gillette’s delisting news broke, the stock climbed from Rs212 on October 1 to Rs605 by October 16, before settling at Rs340 by last Friday’s close.
M. Farid Alam of AKD Securities adds that delisting also affects price discovery and competitive pressures. In Pakistan, most listed companies are tightly held, with sponsors owning 90-95 per cent of shares, unlike global markets where 10-20pc is often sufficient.If tax rates remain high, more large companies may eventually consider leaving the stock market. Yet delisting is complex and costly, so many companies remain listed by default, even if it is no longer their preference.

PM Shehbaz receives a presentation on initiatives to improve Pakistan Railways.—APP

• ADB approves $10m for railway improvement project
• PM for adopting public-private partnership for rail land
ISLAMABAD: With the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approving $10 million in assistance for preparing the Railway Improve­ment Project, Pakistan Railways is moving to outsource 11 more trains, a step expected to generate an additional Rs8.5bn for the country’s largest state-owned rail operator.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a meeting on Pakistan Railways on Saturday, where he was informed that tenders had been floated for outsourcing the eleven passenger trains to the private sector. Pakistan Railways has already outsourced four trains.
 
 

The meeting was also informed that railway hospitals in Lahore, Karachi, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta and Sukkur were being outsourced, while the outsourcing of railway schools, colleges and rest houses was already underway. Similarly, dry ports in Islamabad, Lahore and Azakhail were also being handed over to private operators.
It was also noted that 40 luggage and brake vans had been outsourced, which are expected to bring in an additional Rs820m. The outsourcing process for two cargo express trains was in progress and is projected to generate Rs6.3bn in additional revenue.
Addressing the meeting, the premier stressed that a public-private partnership model shou­­ld be adopted when managing Pak­istan Railways’ land and properties.
 
 

He said that the railway system serves as the backbone of a country’s economy and directed that top-tier legal and economic experts be engaged, especially for projects related to regional connectivity and cross-border rail links.
He appreciated the ongoing measures for the revival of the railway system and commended Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and his team.
The meeting was infor­med that the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul train service would resume soon, and preliminary work on the Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan-Afghan­istan-Pakistan rail corridor was underway.
A plan was being developed for upgrading the Karachi–Kotri section of Main Line-1 and Main Line-3.
The premier was informed that so far, 155 railway stations have been equipped with solar power. Seven digital portals under the ‘Rabta’ initiative are operational, 56 trains have been shifted onto the new system, and 54 stations have been digitised.
Free Wi-Fi service has been provided at the Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Faisalabad stations.
An online freight booking system has been launched while a pilot digital weighing bridge has been installed at Karachi City Railway Station.
To enhance security, 148 AI-powered surveillance cameras have been installed, and ATM machines are being set up at railway stations.
Cleanliness services have also been outsourced.

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill heard the bail petition during a hearing held at Kot Lakhpat jail.
Barrister Taimur Malik argued on behalf of the petitioner and referred to the rule of consistency applied to other accused people, including PTI founder Imran Khan, former senator Ejaz Chaudhry and former governor Umar Sarfraz Cheema by the courts granting bail to them in similar cases.
The judge approved the bail for Dr Rashid in the case, subject to furnishing surety bonds worth Rs100,000.
However, he adjourned the hearing of the PTI leader’s bail petitions in three other cases till Nov 25.
In a statement, Barrister Malik said his client should be granted bail in the remaining cases as well on the same legal principle.
He added that later if the high court accepted her suspension applications, she could be released pending the outcome of her appeals against the convictions. The PTI Punjab president has already been convicted in four other May 9 cases including an attack on the Shadman police station.
Statements recorded
An anti-terrorism court also recorded the statements of 10 police personnel in a case related to violence at GOR-I neighbourhood during the May 9 riots.
The prosecution presented the police officials as its witnesses. A prosecutor told the court that 57 witnesses had testified in the case so far. The court summoned more prosecution witnesses on Nov 25. The Race Course police had registered the case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking the main gate of GOR-I Club Chowk and damaging property.

• Leaders warn of fracture in multilateralism
JOHANNESBURG: A Group of 20 leaders’ summit in South Africa adopted a declaration addressing the climate crisis and other global challenges on Saturday after it was drafted without US input, a move a White House official called “shameful”.
The declaration, using language Washington has opposed, “can’t be renegotiated”, South African Pre­sident Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson told reporters. “We had the entire year of working towards this adoption and the past week has been quite intense,” the spokesperson said.
President Ramaphosa, hosting the weekend gathering in Johannes­burg, said earlier there was “overwhelming consensus” for the summit declaration.
Envoys from the G20 drew up the draft on Friday without US involvement, according to four sources familiar with the matter.
The document utilised language long disliked by the Trump administration, stressing the seriousness of climate change and the need to better adapt to it. It praised ambitious targets to boost renewable energy and noted the punishing levels of debt service suffered by poor countries.
 
 

The inclusion of climate change language served as a snub to US President Donald Trump, who has doubted the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by human activities. US officials had previously indicated they would oppose such references.
“We should not allow anything to diminish the value, the stature and the impact of the first African G20 presidency,” Ramaphosa said in his opening remarks.
His bold tone presented a striking contrast to his subdued decorum during a visit to the White House in August. During that meeting, Ramaphosa endured Trump repeating a false claim that there was a genocide of white farmers in South Africa. Trump subsequently said US officials would not attend because of allegations that the host country persecutes its white minority.
‘Geopolitical fractures’
The G20’s role in fixing economic crises is threatened by geopolitical fractures, leaders warned, however, despite the boycott, Ramaphosa downplayed Trump’s absence and argued the G20 remained key for international cooperation.
However, French President Emmanuel Macron warned during the summit that “the G20 may be coming to the end of a cycle.” Speaking at the opening, Macron noted that leaders are “struggling to resolve major crises together around this table”.
In a sign of other geopolitical fissures, EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen warned in a speech about “the weaponisation of dependencies.” This was a reference to China’s export curbs on rare earths vital for the energy transition.
While the US skipped the summit, it still intended to take up the G20 baton for the next gathering. Trump plans to stage that summit in 2026 at a Florida golf club he owns.

• Drone attack on Lebanon leaves one dead, five hurt
• Canadian PM, UAE president back comprehensive Palestinian peace plan
• Hamas says ‘escalating violations’ place a responsibility on mediators and US
CAIRO: Israel continued its deadly assault blatantly violating ceasefire agreements on two fronts with airstrikes on Saturday that killed at least 21 people in Gaza and one in southern Lebanon, despite assurances from Palestinian resistance groups that they remain fully committed to the accord.
Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 21 people and wounded several others, local health authorities said, posing a further test to the six-week-old ceasefire.
Witnesses and medics said the initial attack struck a car in the densely populated Rimal neighbourhood, setting it ablaze. It was not immediately clear whether the five dead were passengers in the vehicle or included passersby. Dozens of people rushed to extinguish the fire and rescue the victims.
 
 

Shortly after the attack on the car, the Israeli air force carried out two separate airstrikes on houses in Deir Al-Balah city and Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, killing at least four people and wounding several others, medics said.
The Israeli military claimed a gunman had exploited the “humanitarian road in the area through which humanitarian aid enters southern Gaza” to cross into Israeli-held territory. The military said it was striking targets in Gaza in response.
A Hamas official in Gaza rejected the Israeli military’s allegations as baseless and an “excuse to kill”, insisting the group was committed to the ceasefire agreement.
Hamas said in a statement earlier on Saturday that Israel’s “escalating violations” place a responsibility on mediators and the US to confront the aggression and preserve the ceasefire.
While the October 10 ceasefire in the Gaza war has eased the conflict — enabling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to Gaza’s ruins and increasing aid flows — violence has not completely halted.
Palestinian health authorities say Israeli forces have killed 316 people in strikes in Gaza while Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire began since the truce began. Some observers are concerned Israel is seeking to reassert itself.
Attacks in Lebanon
Violations also continued on another front, where an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed one person on Saturday, Lebanon’s health ministry said. The death occurred in the latest attack despite a nearly year-long ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
In a statement, the ministry attributed the death to “an Israeli enemy strike” on a vehicle in Zawtar al-Sharqiyah. The National News Agency identified the man killed as Kamel Reda Qarnabash.
The ministry also reported that a grenade dropped by an Israeli drone in the southern town of Shaqra wounded five people.
The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the deadly incident in Zawtar al-Sharqiyah but claimed it struck “several Hezbollah launchers that were recently identified and placed in military sites in southern Lebanon”.
Lebanon has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement reached in Nov 2024 by continuing its strikes and maintaining forces inside Lebanese territory. According to the health ministry, more than 330 people have been killed in Lebanon and 945 wounded since the ceasefire.
The attacks follow an Israeli strike Tuesday night on the Ain al-Hilweh camp for Palestinian refugees in southern Lebanon that killed 13 people.
A secondary school in the camp stated on its Facebook page Thursday that two of its students were killed in the attack, publishing an image of two adolescent boys.
Canadian PM, UAE president meet
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan met on Nov 20 in Abu Dhabi to advance bilateral ties and discuss Gaza peace plan, Canada’s government said on Saturday.
Regarding Gaza, the leaders reaffirmed a shared commitment to a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace” based on the two-state solution, leading to a sovereign, independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel.
Both sides welcomed the leadership of US President Donald Trump and his “comprehensive peace plan” to end the war in Gaza, as well as the adoption of Resolution 2803 by the UN Security Council as a key instrument for implementation.

• Firms cut purchases by 23m kg in four years
SWABI: Tobacco purchasing companies have slashed their demand for the 2026 crop by 13.183 million kg, marking the fourth consecutive year of reduced requirements. This cutback is expected to result in significant financial losses for local tobacco farmers, sources told Dawn on Saturday.
Tobacco experts noted that while multinational and national firms have the capacity to store large quantities of tobacco, growers face major challenges due to limited financial resources and storage options. The inability to store crops like Virginia and White Patta tobacco means any surplus must be sold quickly, leaving growers at the mercy of fluctuating market demand.
For 2026, the total demand from tobacco companies is set at 61.627m kg, with 58.184m kg of flue-cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco, 0.360m kg of dark air-cured tobacco, 1.342m kg of White Patta, 1.381m kg of burley, and 0.360m kg of sun-cured tobacco.
This marks a significant reduction from previous years, with companies cutting their demand by 23.873m kg over the past four years. In 2023, total demand was 85.5m kg, which fell to 77.322m kg in 2024, 74.810m kg in 2025, and will drop to 61.627m kg in 2026.
The bulk of tobacco purchases is made by multinational companies, with a smaller portion allocated to national companies and smaller tobacco entrepreneurs. Among multinational firms, Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC) and Philip Morris (Pakistan) Ltd are the largest buyers, with a combined demand of over 36m kg of FCV tobacco in 2026. The remaining FCV demand will be met by 78 national companies, including Khyber Tobacco.
Shift in tobacco requirements
The Pakistan Tobacco Board (PTB) has noted that while demand for FCV, dark air-cured, and sun-cured tobacco has decreased in 2026, demand for White Patta and burley tobacco has increased slightly. FCV tobacco remains the primary focus for both multinational and national companies, given its use in cigarette manufacturing and export.
Iqbal Shewa, a prominent tobacco grower, stressed that both multinational and national companies are primarily concerned with FCV tobacco for export and cigarette production. To avoid confusion during the purchasing season, PTB has instructed tobacco companies and landowners to formalise agreements for the upcoming year and share those agreements with the board. Farmers have been advised to grow tobacco in line with these agreements to avoid complications during the buying season.
Price discrepancies and low profit
Ayaz Khan, a former PTB director, explained that companies are reducing their demand for the 2026 crop in part because of the price discrepancy between the weighted average price (WAP) and the minimum indicative price (MIP). The WAP for the current year was set at Rs 719 per kg, while the MIP for surplus tobacco was set at Rs 545 per kg. Companies, Mr Khan said, profited from purchasing surplus tobacco at the MIP, which was Rs174.8 less than the WAP, resulting in significant savings for them but at the expense of the growers. This year’s surplus tobacco amounted to 35.35m kg, which allowed companies to profit by Rs6.17 billion, a windfall that was not shared with the farmers.
 
 

In contrast, the farmers have faced significant losses. The lower purchase prices have put them in a difficult financial position, with many reliant on tob­acco cultivation for their annual income.
Surging exports
Despite the reduced demand for domestic consumption, tobacco exports have seen a marked increase. In 2023-24, Pakistan exported 20m kg of tobacco, rising to 47m kg in 2024-25, an increase of 135pc year-on-year. However, despite this rise in exports, companies have kept their domestic purchase demand low to avoid paying higher prices for surplus tobacco.
Mr Khan also pointed out that the increased exports have not led to corresponding benefits for local growers. Instead, the companies’ strategy of reducing domestic purchases and capitalising on cheaper surplus tobacco has disproportionately benefited the tobacco industry, while the farmers and government have borne the brunt of the financial losses.
The ongoing reduction in tobacco demand by purchasing companies is creating a challenging environment for tobacco growers, who face severe financial losses due to lower prices and limited storage options. While companies continue to benefit from price discrepancies and increased exports, farmers remain the biggest losers in this equation.

This has increasingly dominated public and political analyses, intensifying significantly over the last two decades.
The current era is widely considered distinct from previous periods of political division. Today’s political polarisation is characterised by an unprecedented level of animosity. One should keep in mind that affective polarisation differs from ‘ideological polarisation.’ The latter is strictly measured by policy differences. 
As noted by Estonian scholar Andres Reiljan, affective polarisation is fundamentally “about people’s feelings”, creating a society split into “mutually hostile political groups” and fostering a powerful “tribal” instinct. Individuals begin to strongly identify with their political party and express a wider hostility toward the opposition. This mentality is strengthened when social identities merge with political affiliations. 
According to Reiljan, some political parties and media outlets often exacerbate this divide for financial or political gain, choosing to intensify conflict rather than promoting consensus. This cycle leads individuals to perceive fellow citizens through a prejudiced lens, based solely on political preferences. 

As political disagreements turn into social suspicion and emotional hostility, a new form of division is taking root around the world

A 2020 study by the American Family Survey indicated a significant decline in marriages and romantic relationships between Democrats and Republicans, as individuals increasingly prefer partners who share their political views. 
Such divisions are being reported from multiple countries. People don’t just dislike the other party’s policies, they dislike the supporters of the other parties as well. Consequently, relationships and social networks are being formed that are politically homogeneous. If one has friends across the political aisle, they often avoid discussing political or social issues to maintain the relationship.
A 2022 study by the US-based Pew Research Centre shows that affective polarisation leads partisans to attribute negative, non-political traits to the opposing group. The dislike is so strong that it becomes a moral judgement. Partisans are less likely to trust members and supporters of the opposing party, even in non-political contexts. They are also less likely to feel empathy for the opponent group when it experiences a personal or financial setback.
On social media platforms, for example, one can see clusters supporting a party actually celebrating the misfortunes of supporters or members of the opposing party. Survey data shows that partisans frequently describe the opposing side as dishonest, unintelligent, immoral or unpatriotic. This shifts the debate away from policy disagreement toward identity rejection.
Indeed, the characteristics of affective polarisation are mostly observed in right-wing populist parties and in groups that support them. But these characteristics are increasingly becoming common among ‘left’ and ‘liberal’ sides also. The latter two often pose as being more sorted, decent, ‘balanced’ and ‘democratic’. They really aren’t. 
The ‘agenda’ of all involved remains the same, though: to question and even demolish the credibility of perceived enemies through echo chambers and internet cliques and mobs. Sometimes even friends and acquaintances aren’t spared. And here lies another aspect of affective polarisation, which rebounds and causes polarisation within a group. 
According to a 2025 study published in the Communications Psychology journal, as affective polarisation intensifies, it begins to impact the inner dynamics of the groups too. Members of a group may begin to turn on each other, causing the fragmentation of the group. 
The segregation and divisions that affective polarisation creates and the mistrusting mindset that it produces, eventually leads to infighting within groups. One can witness this in right-wing populist groups as well as in left and liberal groups and cliques, and even among members of the media.
When some members of a group become more extreme than the parent camp, factions develop. These factions begin to distance themselves from the initial opposing camp, as well as the parent camp. One can see this happening within groups that support US President Donald Trump and those who support the former prime minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan. It’s also quite common within clusters of social activism. 



 
But what causes affective polarisation? A 2025 study by the Berlin Social Science Centre suggests three main reasons. First, current society is less and less structured along permanent formal social groups. There is a decreasing number of memberships in formal civil society organisations and in mainstream political parties. Emotions now play a more central role in identification with a social group and are strategically used to win and maintain group members. Therefore, the ‘us versus them’ mindset is robustly shaped and readily accepted.
Second, social media and digital platforms are increasingly crucial as moderators of public discourse. Social media offers networked flows of communication and a broad set of attitudes that compete with each other for societal attention. Social media postings with a higher intensity of emotional tone are known to elicit more attention and are shared more widely. Thus, emotive arguments have a systematic benefit on social media. This reinforces discourses that are polarising instead of compromising. 
Third, it has become quite obvious now that social and political mechanisms developed by modernity to encourage rational thinking have been eroding for years. The idea of the ‘importance’ of emotions has returned to claim that emotions were always important in the exchange between the state and the polity. Apparently, those who designed and implemented mechanisms to shape a rational polity failed to see this and are therefore struggling to constructively channel the outcomes of the returning emphasis on emotions. 
These are the factors, the study suggests, that are behind the increasing incidents of hate speech, tribalisation, incivility, intolerance and the dehumanisation of political opponents. Affective polarisation is also threatening governance by undermining rational and reformist means of resolving political, economic and social issues.
Affective polarisation symbolises the failure of rational mechanisms. Indeed, these failed and undermined the importance of what they were discouraging or suppressing. From the late 1970s onwards, the ‘post-modernists’ rejoiced this failure by romanticising emotion, intuition and impulse. But by doing this (through academic means, marketing, religious revivals and pop culture) they ended up thoroughly demonising rationality. 
The result was not really societies brimming with joyous, free and tolerant people, but societies pregnant with mistrust, emotional chaos and an overindulgent misuse of certain vital democratic notions, especially freedom of speech.

“Pakistan has strengthened its global digital connectivity with the deployment of the SEA-ME-WE 6 submarine cable system, a 19,200-km high-capacity fibre network linking Pakistan to countries between Singapore and France,” said the statement from the ministry.
The cable has a total capacity of over 100 terabit per second and it will provide “one of the lowest-latency routes between Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe”.
It added that Pakistan has been allocated a total of 13.2tbps, with 4tbps being activated immediately — expanding the country’s international bandwidth capacity and enhancing support for cloud services, data centres, fintech, e-commerce, streaming, and the broader digital economy.
 






The press release added that SEA-ME-WE 6 features “more fibre pairs and more than double the capacity” of previous SEA-ME-WE systems, enhancing resilience and diversification across high-traffic Asia-Europe routes through trans-Egypt geo-diversified crossings and landing points.
“The system enables rapid scalability, improved fault protection and lower total network ownership costs for participating service providers, while adding an essential new redundancy layer to the global internet backbone.”
It added that the consortium involved in the project included Pakistan’s Transworld Associates, Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company, Bharti Airtel, Dhiraagu, Djibouti Telecom, Mobily, Orange, Singtel, Sri Lanka Telecom, Telecom Egypt, Telekom Malaysia and Telin.
In February, Pakistan Tele­communication Com­pany Ltd successfully landed the Africa-1 submarine internet cable at Karachi.
In December, Trans­world Associates linked the Africa-2 cable to its landing station in Karachi.
Currently, six cables, with a capacity of 13tpbs, bring internet to Pakistan: Asia-Africa-Europe 1 (AAE-1), South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 (SMW4) and India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE), managed by PTCL; and South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 5 (SMW-5) and Transworld Associates 1 (TWA-1), operated by Transworld Associates.

A statement from the Crime Reporters Association (CRA) condemned what it said were “threatening activities of two suspicious persons” at the house of senior journalist Faraz Khan, associated with The News International, in Federal B Industrial Area.
Referring to a video of the alleged incident making the rounds on social media, the CRA said: “The two persons can be clearly seen in the CCTV footage, who knocked on the door of the house and threatened the family of serious consequences, which caused panic and fear among the family.”
It said the incident had caused “serious concern” among the affected family and wider journalist community, adding that it had immediately informed the police and high-ranking officials.
“Taking immediate action, Federal B Industrial Area station house officer has reached the house … where the police authorities have taken evidence in their custody and the statements of the affected family are also being recorded.”
“The association demands that the strictest action be taken against such elements in accordance with the law so that the threats to journalists and their families can be addressed,” added the CRA statement.
Central Senior Superintendent of Police Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi similarly told Dawn that police officers visited the residence and took the CCTV footage for investigation purposes.
He said investigators were waiting for the journalist to lodge a case to initiate legal proceedings about the alleged threats.
Last month, the attempted target killing of a DawnNewsTV journalist was foiled following the arrest of the suspects by the Rawalpindi police.
Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation.
Reporters Without Borders has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists.
According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.</p><small>2025-11-22 17:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634934-polish-woman-marries-pakistani-man-after-social-media-friendship' target='_blank'><strong>Polish woman marries Pakistani man after social media friendship</strong></a><br><p>

The Belem deal launches a voluntary initiative to speed up climate action to help nations meet their existing pledges to reduce emissions, and calls for rich nations to at least triple the amount of money they provide to help developing countries adapt to a warming world by 2035.
 
 

Scientists have said existing national commitments to cut emissions have cut projected warming significantly, but are not enough to keep world temperatures from breaching 1.5 degrees Celsius above industrial levels, a threshold that could unleash the worst impacts of climate change.
Developing countries have argued in the meantime that they urgently need funds to adapt to impacts that are already hitting, such as rising sea levels and worsening heat waves, droughts, floods and storms.
The agreement also launches a process for climate bodies to review how to align international trade with climate action, according to the deal text, amid concerns that rising trade barriers are limiting the adoption of clean technology.
Avinash Persaud, special adviser to the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, a multilateral lender focused on Latin America and the Caribbean, said the accord’s focus on finance was important as climate impacts mount.
“But I fear the world still fell short on more rapid-release grants for developing countries responding to loss and damage. That goal is as urgent as it is hard,” he said.
The European Union had been pressing for language in the official deal on the move away from fossil fuels, but had come up against stiff resistance from the Arab Group of nations, including top oil exporter Saudi Arabia.
That impasse was resolved after all-night negotiations on Friday led to an agreement that the issue could be left out of the accord and included in a side text put forward by COP30 host Brazil.
G20 summit in South Africa adopts declaration despite US boycott, opposition
Separately, a Group of 20 leaders’ summit in South Africa adopted a declaration addressing the climate crisis and other global challenges after it was drafted without US input in a move a White House official called “shameful”.
The declaration, using language to which Washington has been opposed, “can’t be renegotiated”, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson told reporters, reflecting strains between Pretoria and the Trump administration over the event.
“We had the entire year of working towards this adoption and the past week has been quite intense,” spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said.
Ramaphosa, host of this weekend’s gathering of Group of 20 leaders in Johannesburg, had earlier said there was “overwhelming consensus” for a summit declaration.
But at the last minute, Argentina, whose far-right President Javier Milei is a close ally of US President Donald Trump, quit the negotiations right before the envoys were about to adopt the draft text, South African officials said.
“Argentina, although it cannot endorse the declaration … remains fully committed to the spirit of cooperation that has defined the G20 since its conception,” its foreign minister, Pablo Quirno, said at the summit. Ramaphosa noted this, but went ahead with it anyway.
In explanation, Quirno said Argentina was concerned about how the document referred to geopolitical issues.
“Specifically, it addresses the longstanding Middle East conflict in a manner that fails to capture its full complexity,” he said. The document mentions the conflict once, saying that “members agree to work for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in … the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.
Envoys from the G20 — which brings together the world’s major economies — drew up a draft leaders’ declaration on Friday without US involvement, four sources familiar with the matter said.
“It is a longstanding G20 tradition to issue only consensus deliverables, and it is shameful that the South African government is now trying to depart from this standard practice,“ a senior Trump administration official said on Friday.
The declaration used the kind of language long disliked by the US administration: stressing the seriousness of climate change and the need to better adapt to it, praising ambitious targets to boost renewable energy and noting the punishing levels of debt service suffered by poor countries.
The mention of climate change was a snub to Trump, who doubts the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by human activities. US officials had indicated they would oppose any reference to it in the declaration.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In opening remarks to the summit, Ramaphosa said: “We should not allow anything to diminish the value, the stature and the impact of the first African G20 presidency”.
His bold tone was a striking contrast to his subdued decorum during his visit to the White House in May, in which he endured Trump repeating a false claim that there was a genocide of white farmers in South Africa, brushing aside Ramaphosa’s efforts to correct his facts.
Trump said US officials would not attend the summit because of widely discredited allegations that the host country’s black majority government persecutes its white minority.
The summit came at a time of heightened tensions between world powers over Russia’s war in Ukraine and fraught climate negotiations at the COP30 in Brazil.
“While the G20 diversity sometimes presents challenges, it also underscores the importance of finding common ground,” Japan Cabinet Public Affairs Secretary Maki Kobayashi told Reuters.
Commenting on Argentina’s absence from the final envoy meeting to agree on the text, Magwenya said: “Argentina [had] been participating quite meaningfully … in all the deliberations,” then never showed up to endorse the declaration on Friday. He added: “We have what we call sufficient consensus.”
The US president had also rejected the host nation’s agenda of promoting solidarity and helping developing nations adapt to weather disasters, transition to clean energy and cut their excessive debt costs.
“This G20 is not about the US,” South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told public broadcaster SABC. “We are all equal members of the G20. What it means is that we need to take a decision. Those of us who are here have decided this is where the world must go.”
But in a sign of the many geopolitical fissures underlying the agreed text, EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen warned in a speech about “the weaponisation of dependencies”, which she said “only creates losers”.
 
 

This was an apparent veiled reference to China’s export curbs on rare earths vital for the world’s energy transition, as well as defence and digital technology.
The US will host the G20 in 2026 and Ramaphosa said he would have to hand over the rotating presidency to an “empty chair”.
The South African presidency on Saturday reiterated its rejection of a US offer to send the US charge d’affaires for the G20 handover.
“The president will not hand over to a junior embassy official the presidency of the G20. It’s a breach of protocol that is not going to be accommodated,” Magwenya said.
Lamola later said that South Africa would assign a diplomat of the same rank as a charge d’affaires to hand over the G20 presidency at the foreign affairs department.</p><small>2025-11-22 17:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22144959ad5c68d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956701/ptis-hammad-azhar-claims-form-45s-missing-ahead-of-tomorrows-lahore-na-129-by-poll' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Hammad Azhar claims Form 45s ‘missing’ ahead of tomorrow’s Lahore NA-129 by-poll</strong></a><br><p>PTI leader Hammad Azhar on Saturday claimed that Form 45s are missing from the election material provided to presiding officers by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) ahead of tomorrow’s by-election in Lahore’s NA-129 constituency.
The by-election is being held after the seat fell vacant in July following the death of Azhar’s father, Mian Azhar.
In a post on X, Hammad said: “We are receiving reports that multiple presiding officers are missing Form 45s in the election materials they have received from ECP (Election Commission of Pakistan) for the by-elections of tomorrow. This is a serious violation of the electoral process.”
 






The alarm came after he had earlier issued “important instructions” for his party’s polling agents about the forms.
“When the bags containing election materials are opened in the morning, make sure that the Forms 45 and Forms 46 in them are blank and shown to you. This is most important.”
The PTI leader stressed the importance of the polling agents’ presence during the polling and the counting processes. “The polling boxes must not be out of sight at any moment.”
Hammad further told the agents that it was their “right to obtain the Form-45 [filled] as per the count”, and that any staff who obstructed this would be liable to strict legal punishment.
He directed all PTI workers at the party camps outside the polling stations to remain there after the polling had ended and “peacefully follow the presiding officer to the returning officer’s (RO) office”.
 






A candidate or their election agent can appoint “as many polling agents as may be prescribed” for each polling station to observe the process on behalf of the candidate under the Elections Act 2017.
In another post, Hammad also gave a message to the presiding officers and the polling staff, urging them not to indulge in any “illegal act”.
“We are aware that you are being frightened and threatened,” the PTI leader claimed, adding that those who were allegedly doing so were “finding immunity for themselves, buying property abroad and moving their families there”.
“They will push you into [carrying out] unconstitutional actions and flee themselves,” Hammad contended.
“Be careful! Do not put yourself in difficulty by taking any serious and illegal action at the behest of any intruder,” the PTI leader said, urging them to fulfil their duty.
 






The NA-129 seat is being contested by Mian Azhar’s nephew Chaudhry Arsalan Ahmad — nominated by Hammad, who himself is absconding as he is wanted by the state in different cases.
Hafiz Mian Nauman, who was defeated by Mian Azhar by a margin of over 30,000 votes in the 2024 elections, is once again the PML-N’s candidate.
The PTI has accused the PML-N’s Punjab government of employing rigging tactics in support of its candidate in the NA-129 by-poll.
Yesterday, Hammad said officials of the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) were appointed as presiding officers for the polls contested by Nauman, who has served as chairman of the Lesco Board of Directors.
Lesco Chief Executive Officer Ramzan Butt, however, rebutted Hammad’s post, stating that the appointments were the decision of the ECP and not Lesco or any other government organisation.
 
 

Before the election campaign could pick up, the local police officials, caught on video footage, were seen removing banners of the PTI candidate.
Similar to the situation during the 2024 general elections, Ahmad is contesting as an independent candidate on the “geyser” symbol, instead of the “bat” due to the revocation of the party’s electoral symbol last year.</p><small>2025-11-22 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22195051055c15c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956710/nawaz-sahibzada-star-as-pakistan-romp-to-seven-wicket-victory-against-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Nawaz, Sahibzada star as Pakistan romp to seven-wicket victory against Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>Spinner Mohammad Nawaz set it up for Pakistan before opener Sahibzada Farhan finished it off to the joy of a packed crowd at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.
With Nawaz (3-16) weaving his magic with the ball, including two wickets in two balls, in the Twenty20 tri-nation clash, Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to 128-7 before romping to their target with 4.3 overs to spare in their Twenty20 tri-nation series clash on Saturday.
Sahibzada led the batting effort with his sixth T20 half-century, hitting five sixes and six fours in an explosive 80 not out off 45 balls, as Pakistan eased to a six-wicket victory that made in two in two for the hosts, who beat Zimbabwe by five wickets in the series opener.
Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have no wins in two with the defeat following a humbling at the hands on Zimbabwe on Thursday.
But it had seemed all so different at the start when skipper Dasun Shunaka won the toss and elected to bat with openers Kamil Mishara and Pathum Nissanka tearing into Pakistan’s bowling with the latter cutting away Salman Mirza for four on the first ball of their innings.
Mishara then pulled Mohammad Waseem Jr, in for the injured Shaheen Shah Afridi, for six and then smashed Salman for a four and a six off consecutive deliveries in the third over.
Mishara then slashed at Faheem Ashraf and got a top-edge that ran for four but his enterprising 22 off 12 ended on the next ball when he was undone by the change of pace and found Fakhar Zaman at mid-off.
One-drop Kusal Mendis, didn’t last long as he was run out in an attempt to scamper a quick two and Sri Lanka ended the powerplay at 44-2 after the incoming Kusal Perera pulled Faheem away past mid-on for four.
Spinner Abrar bowled an expensive first over, giving away 11 — four of them wides, with Perera raising Sri Lanka’s 50 with his second four. But Abrar hit back in his second over, having Nissanka caught at long-off for a sluggish 23-ball 17 and Sri Lanka trudged to 65-3 by the midway point of their innings.
Perera, who made 25 off 19, welcomed Saim Ayub into the attack with a six over deep square leg but Nawaz’s double-wicket burst left Sri Lanka reeling.
First Perera was cleaned up with a ball that was tossed outside off but turned enough to find a way between bat and pad and hit the off-stump before Shanaka was sent packing in similar fashion.
From 78-3, Sri Lanka slipped to 86-6 when Nawaz had Kamindu Mendis caught thanks to a superb display of athleticism by Waseem in the deep.
A first boundary in six overs came when Janith Liyanage, who hit a valiant 41 not out, lifted Abrar straight back over his head for six on the first ball of the 17th and as Sri Lanka crossed 100, Wanindu Hasaranga got a four over extra cover two balls later.
An upper-cut for off Waseem got Liyanage his first four and he followed it up with another off Salman in the penultimate over before Hasaranga (11) holed out in the deep.
Liyanage, though, couldn’t give Sri Lanka the lift they were looking for in the last over with just seven coming off it.
Pakistan got off to a flyer in the chase, Saim (20) getting the first boundary when he dispatched a full toss by Eshan Malinga and the left-hander ended the second over with two fours through the offside.
Sahibzada got on the act, lifting Hasaranga over mid-off for four and then hitting Dushmantha Chameera for a four and six — over square leg.
Saim sliced Shanaka for four to bring up his 1000 runs in T20Is but was stumped two balls later.
Sahibzada, though, was unfazed by losing his opening partner; crashing Vijayakanth Viyaskanth for four as Pakistan ended the powerplay at 53-1.
A glorious cover drive by Sahibzada off Malinga ended a 24-ball boundary drought and Pakistan were well-placed after ending the first 10 overs at 68-1.
Viyaskanth was then crashed by Sahibzada for a four and six, both in the square leg area, off consecutive balls before the right-hander raised his half-century off 33 balls.
At the other end, Babar Azam (16) got his first boundary on the 17th ball he faced when he pulled away Shanaka for six.
Sahibzada, though, was having no difficulty in getting the big hits — smoking two sixes off Hasaranga in the 13th over and following it up with another down the ground in the next off Chameera, who hit back by cleaning up Babar and trapping captain Salman Ali Agha lbw off consecutive balls.
But with Sahibzada at the crease, Pakistan had no late jitters and the right-hander lifted Malinga for four to seal a comfortable victory for his side.</p><small>2025-11-22 16:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/221915095a77b0a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956712/ptis-jhagra-assails-govt-says-judicial-distrust-creating-hurdles-in-foreign-investment' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Jhagra assails govt; says judicial distrust creating hurdles in foreign investment</strong></a><br><p>PTI leader Taimur Saleem Jhagra said judicial corruption and institutional distrust were barriers to capital investment in the country, while he assailed the government on Saturday following the release of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) report.
The report, published earlier this week, highlighted persistent corruption challenges in Pakistan driven by systemic weaknesses across state institutions and demanded immediate initiation of a 15-point reform agenda to improve transparency, fairness and integrity.
Speaking at a press conference today about the report in Islamabad with former Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair, Jhagra highlighted a portion of the report that said: “The judicial sector that is organisationally complex is not able to [reliably] enforce contracts [or protect property rights] due to problems with efficiency, antiquated laws and the integrity of judges and judicial personnel.”
“[The report] also points out how capital investments in the country have been undermined by concerns over vulnerability to corruption of judicial institutions,” said the PTI leader.
“A barrier for investment in Pakistan is that the investor is scared of the fact that your judicial institutions are corrupt,” Jhagra said.
He added that according to the IMF, the judiciary was also unable to play a role in the economy besides political issues and those related to justice in society, as distrust in the system drove investors and businessmen away.
Speaking about the role of the National Accountability Bureau, he said the report criticised its structure and said anti-corruption efforts were constrained by “heavy reliance on a single institution exposed to strong political influence”.
“When IMF is saying there is corruption in Pakistan, and IMF states that the institutions in Pakistan, meant to fight corruption, have no coordination, and their actions are influenced politically; do you accept that or not?”
“If there is one thing that is written about the most, it is that everything is in the government’s hands,” said the former finance minister of KP.
As per the IMF, “state domination extends to employment, where the state employs 72 per cent of individuals with formal jobs”. In reference to this part, Jhagra said undue favours were inevitable when the state ran sectors that it should not.
The IMF pointed out, as emphasised by Jhagra, that the country’s sugar sector was a case study of how the intertwined relationship between economic and political elites and state regulators had combined to capture public benefits at deep cost to the populace.
“Firms in the sugar sector benefited from favourable government policies, subsidies and regulatory loopholes for decades, mainly due to the nexus between industry magnates and political leaders,” as per the report.
Jhagra also pointed out how the report criticised the role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), saying that it operated with “untested transparency and accountability provisions”.
Giving his own thoughts on the matter, Jhagra said the SIFC was brought about by the PML-N government to keep the stakeholders of the self-admitted current hybrid setup placated and content.
“They knew that it would not bring a penny’s worth of investment and neither have they tried.”
Jhagra said there were only two paths left after the report’s release, one was for the government to begin working on the issues and solutions outlined or to give answers to the questions being raised since the revelations were made public.
However, he quipped that the first was unlikely since “the government won’t remain and the SIFC won’t remain”.
Meanwhile, Zubair alleged that the IMF report was only disclosed by the government after “immense pressure” from the institution.
He further alleged that the SIFC awarded contracts to favourite contractors and that those who were involved in the sugar scandal were protected.
The former PML-N stalwart said 240 million people were suffering because of the policy failure of the current government, which had converted into an economic crisis.
He also said that it was unfortunate that no government representative had denied the report even after the passage of 48 hours. The former governor demanded an investigation after the report’s disclosures.
The politicians, under the banner of opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, lashed out at the government and accused it of hiding the report for three months.
They also alleged that the report had identified corruption worth Rs5,300 billion in the governance system and termed it the “worst financial scandal” of the country’s history, demanding that the names of those responsible be made public.</p><small>2025-11-22 16:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22171318caa01b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956711/lawyers-protest-against-27th-amendment-at-shc' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers protest against 27th Amendment at SHC</strong></a><br><p>Lawyers of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) staged a protest on Saturday at the Sindh High Court (SHC) against the recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The contentious amendment, which resulted in the establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), was passed by Parliament amid the opposition’s outcry.
It has also been criticised by some legal experts as a means to dethrone the Supreme Court (SC) as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to the FCC.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, voiced opposition to the amendment, particularly citing its impact on the SC. Hours after the amendment was enacted on November 13, two judges of the SC resigned, citing their reservations against it. The two judges were Athar Minallah and Mansoor Ali Shah, who was the senior puisne judge of the SC at the time.
Today, lawyers began their protest outside the SHC’s premises by chanting slogans against the amendment and later entered the high court’s premises.
Visuals showed some lawyers engaging in a scuffle with police personnel. Following the scuffle, police personnel backed up and allowed the protest to continue. There were reports of some minor injuries to police officials.
The lawyers entered the Sindh High Court Bar Association’s hall and continued their protest with sloganeering against the amendment and the government. They later took their demonstration outside the bar room after the electricity supply was switched off.
 






The KBA had observed a full-day strike in the subordinate judiciary last week in protest over the amendment’s passage and to express solidarity with the retired judges. It had also observed a full-day strike on Monday, during which litigants were not allowed to enter the City Courts premises and proceedings were adjourned due to the boycott.
The KBA had stated that from Tuesday to Saturday (today), “token strikes will be observed from 11am onwards”.</p><small>2025-11-22 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634913-cm-afridi-assures-centre-of-his-support-pledges-to-attend-all-federal-meetings' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi assures Centre of his support, pledges to attend all federal meetings</strong></a><br><p>

US President Donald Trump gave Ukraine less than a week to approve the 28-point plan to end the nearly four-year conflict, which would see the invaded country ceding territory, cutting its army, and pledging to never join NATO.
Meanwhile, Ukraine’s European allies, who were not included in drafting the agreement, said the plan requires “additional work” as they scrambled at the G20 summit in South Africa to come up with a counter-offer to Trump’s plan to beef up Kyiv’s positions.

“In the coming days, consultations will take place with partners regarding the steps needed to end the war,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said, after he issued a decree stating Ukraine’s team for the talks, which will be led by his top aide, Andriy Yermak.

“Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine’s national interests and what is necessary to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion,” Zelensky added.

The wartime leader was also holding rounds of phone calls with European counterparts, as he earlier promised to work round the clock to ensure the final peace agreement will protect Ukraine’s future.
Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s security council secretary who’s also on board for the talks, earlier indicated Switzerland as a location for the deliberations.

“This is another stage of the dialogue that has been ongoing in recent days and is primarily aimed at aligning our vision for the next steps,” added Umerov, formerly a defence minister. He previously led a few rounds of negotiations with Russia in Turkey, which only yielded prisoner exchanges and bodies repatriations.

Zelensky’s decree also said the negotiations will include “representatives of the Russian Federation.” There was no immediate confirmation from Russia whether it would join the talks.
More work needed
The unilateral US plan to end the war in Ukraine “is a basis which will require additional work”, Western leaders gathered in South Africa for a G20 summit said Saturday.

“We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force.

We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack,” the leaders of key European countries as well as Canada and Japan said in a joint statement.

France’s Emmanuel Macron earlier sent a sombre message to the gathering, saying “the G20 may be coming to the end of a cycle,” adding that the grouping was struggling to resolve major crises around the world, referring to the unilateral US plan for resolving the Ukraine war.

Britain, Germany and France emerged as key Ukraine backers, providing it with crucial military and financial support, especially after the US sponsorship waned after Trump’s return to office.

Difficult choice
Ukraine faces one of the most challenging moments in its history, Zelensky said Friday in an address to the nation, adding that he would propose alternatives to Trump’s proposal.

“The pressure on Ukraine is one of the hardest. Ukraine may face a very difficult choice: either the loss of dignity or the risk of losing a key partner,” Zelensky said in his address, referring to a possible break with Washington.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the blueprint could “lay the foundation” for a final peace settlement, but threatened more land seizures if Ukraine walked away from negotiations.

Better equipped and larger in numbers, the Russian army is slowly but steadily gaining ground across the lengthy front line.

Ukrainians were meanwhile facing one of the toughest winters since the war began, after Moscow carried out a brutal bombing campaign against energy infrastructure.

This comes as a sweeping corruption probe that unveiled graft in the energy sector was unravelling in Kyiv, sparking public outcry.</p><small>2025-11-22 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2218132680a107d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956714/pcbs-public-spat-ends-after-rashid-latif-unconditionally-withdraws-comments-against-board' target='_blank'><strong>PCB’s public spat ends after Rashid Latif ‘unconditionally’ withdraws comments against board</strong></a><br><p>Former Pakistan Test captain Rashid Latif ended the saga he began after apologising on Saturday for fiery comments made against the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) policies, which he termed “an error of judgement”.
Latif’s comments on surrogate advertising and removal of Mohammad Rizwan from ODI captaincy had prompted PCB to lodge a complaint against the former captain with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which summoned Latif to appear before an investigation officer at its Lahore office  on Nov 17.
Later, Rashid had also moved the Islamabad High Court against the inquiry, terming it illegal and saying it was issued without lawful authority and was liable to be quashed.
In a lengthy post on X today, Latif clarified that his “principal contention” was related to potential violations of the advisories issued by the Pakistani government.
“At no point, whether inadvertently or deliberately, have I ever sought or intended to implicate any individual including players, board members, or other stakeholders in wrongdoing,” Latif said.
 






He admitted “an error of judgement” when he commented on the removal of Rizwan from ODI captaincy.
“I acknowledge that I made an unwarranted reference to Mohammad Rizwan’s public support for Palestine as a potential factor in his removal from captaincy.
“Upon further reflection, I recognise that this assumption was inappropriate, unfounded, and not supported by any credible evidence.”
Latif said he deeply regretted any distress or offence that his comments may have caused to the general public or to the PCB more specifically.
“I offer my sincere apologies for any unintended harm arising from my remarks which I withdraw unconditionally and affirm that no such harm was ever intended,” he continued in his post.
“Going forward, I shall endeavour to ensure that my public commentary remains measured, evidence-based, and free from conjecture, particularly when addressing matters of sensitivity or issues that may carry significant implications.”
The 57-year-old, who often appears on TV as a sports analyst, further said: “I am an advocate of responsible broadcasting, research-based journalism, and objective analysis.
“Having had the honour of serving as captain of the Pakistan national cricket team, I hold the reputation and dignity of the country in the highest regard and would never intentionally act in a manner that could bring disrepute upon it.
“I endeavour to participate in public discourse in a manner that is fair, balanced, and constructive.”
Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi came to Latif’s defence, albeit untimely.
In a now-deleted post on X, Sethi said he was “shocked at the trumped up FIA against Latif” and urged cricket administrators “to desist from such repressive tactics and expect the judiciary to protect our freedoms”.
PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi responded to Sethi on X for his “misplaced, ill-timed, and factually incorrect” comments.
 






“The PCB’s action against Rashid Latif was never about silencing criticism, it was about addressing the deliberate spread of false and defamatory allegations,” he said in a post on X.
“Our proceedings have remained fully within the law and focused solely on protecting the integrity of Pakistan cricket and its players.
Naqvi further stated that the board welcomes Latif’s apology and offered a clean slate to the former cricketer.
“We do not use any other means to silence those who criticise the Board.
