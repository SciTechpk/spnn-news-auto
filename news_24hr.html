The survey is a pre-budget document that contains details of major socio-economic achievements during the outgoing fiscal year. It serves as a vital document ahead of the annual federal budget which will be presented tomorrow (Tuesday), offering detailed insights into the country’s socio-economic performance over the outgoing fiscal year.
Speaking during a press conference in Islamabad, the finance minister talked about the global economic outlook, noting that global GDP growth was estimated to decline to 2.8pc in 2025 from 3.5pc two years ago.
“Our recovery needs to be looked at in a global context,” he said.

Aurangzeb said Pakistan’s GDP growth in 2023 was -0.2pc, which rose to 2.5pc in 2024. “This year, we announced a 2.7pc growth for 2025. This is a gradual recovery and the right way to go about it is to focus on sustainable growth.
“The last thing we want is to go through another round of boom and bust cycles,” Aurangzeb stressed.
Speaking about the agricultural sector which grew by 0.6pc, Aurangzeb said it would have been closer to the target rate if it had been the same as the 2.7pc overall growth rate.

Meanwhile, the livestock sector surpassed the target growth rate of 3.8pc, recording a 4.7pc boost.
Aurangzeb said: “Poultry did extremely well, [with the growth rate of] 8.1pc. Fisheries and forestries also grew. Fruits and vegetables collectively grew by 4.8pc but our major crops fell below 13.5pc. This includes cotton, maize and wheat.
“That’s what led to the 0.6pc delta on the agricultural side,” he rued.
“Going forward, our discussion will be about how the government has to get out of this [entirely]. The major crops we have exited, like rice and maize … maybe there were supply-demand factors,” he said, noting that there was ample rice export but lower production.
“Volume and prices have fallen at international levels. We need to consider volumes and prices always.”
The finance head called doing away with the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) the “right thing.”
“In terms of mechanisation and seed tech, there is a big delta in the import of agricultural machinery such as wheat threshers. This is the right thing to do,” he added.
Aurangzeb also highlighted that the Punjab government had launched an electronic warehouse for seed financing but “storage capacity and private funding” were needed.
“At the federal level, we will make sure we can provide that ecosystem and support to increase storage. Storage is a big issue. If we want to mitigate middlemen, farmers need a facility to store and retrieve their harvest at will. This is the biggest help we can offer to small farmers,” he noted.
Speaking about financing for farmers, Aurangzeb said credit to the agricultural sector went up by 16pc from July 2024 to April 2025.
“This has crossed over Rs2tr in that time period and we aim to increase it further around the entire supply chain.”
“Whatever we say may sound like we are patting ourselves on the back, but external validation is happening,” Aurangzeb said, recalling that global credit-rating agency Fitch had upgraded Pakistan’s credit rating to ‘B-’ and that Moody’s banking outlook for the country was positive.
“International institutions have faith in us, whether it is the World Bank’s country partnership framework, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in terms of their commitment to multiple projects across the board or the IMF (International Monetary Fund) tranche we just received. This is against many odds,” he added.
Industrial growth for FY2024-25 was 4.8pc, compared to -1.4pc the previous year, the finance chief said.

“In addition to electricity, gas and water, construction went up by 6.6pc,” he stated.
Aurangzeb observed that while small-scale manufacturing had grown by 1.3pc, large-scale manufacturing had contracted, adding that it was still less than the previous FY.
The minister also stressed the need to “do a deep dive” into the sectors that have declined, which he said included chemicals, iron and steel.
“Autos went up by 40pc, wearable apparel rose by 8pc, textiles went up by 2pc, petroleum products increased by 4.5pc,” the minister said, referring to the gains witnessed by each of these sectors during FY2024-25.
“The devil is always in the details. I will mention why I’m very confident in saying that this fiscal year will be a turnaround story,” he underscored.
The services sector grew by 2.9pc against 2.2pc the previous fiscal year, while the information and communications sector expanded by 6.5pc, according to the minister.

“Construction and real estate grew by 3.8pc, food services by 4.1pc,” he said, adding that the transport sector had grown due to higher activity at ports, shipping lines and airlines.
Inflation, he said, had been a fantastic story for Pakistan: 6.8pc global inflation in 2023, 5.7pc in 2024 and the estimate for 2025 is 4.3pc in terms of CPI inflation.

Aurangzeb noted that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) had crossed 29pc in 2023 but now had plunged to just 4.6pc. “So, I think we’ve moved in the right direction in terms of the global figures.”
Addressing the country’s monetary policy, the finance minister recalled that the interest rate was at a record 22pc in 2023, following which “steps were taken” to reduce it, and now the key policy rate stood at 1,100 basis points, he said.
Talking about macroeconomic indicators, Aurangzeb said, “Public debt and debt-to-GDP ratio was 68pc, which is now 65pc.
“Forex reserves as of June 30, 2024, were $9.4bn, which was a huge and remarkable recovery from where we were back in 2023, where we were down to two weeks of import cover. The recovery after [June] 30 continued and we consolidated it in 2024-25.”
Talking about the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan, Aurangzeb asserted, “Our credibility and trust was re-established under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership.”
Noting that the premier had signed the Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) before the caretaker administration took over, the minister also praised the efforts of caretaker finance minister Dr Shamshad Mirza as her “discipline allowed us to continue”.
Aurangzeb then highlighted two reasons for Pakistan desiring an Extended Fund Facility with the IMF, with the first one aiming to “bring permanence to macroeconomic stability” and remove fragility.
The second reason, he added, was to continue with structural reforms. “We needed to fundamentally change the economy’s DNA, and for that, we needed structural reforms which are elusive in this country. We needed to proceed with a structured programme,” he said.
On the topic of revenue, Aurangzeb said, “Our tax-to-GDP has hit a five-year high and the prime minister is leading this personally. This whole transformation is around people, processes, and technology.
“Tech played a big role — digital invoicing, production tracking, AI audits, faceless customs regime,” he added, terming the progress in FY2024-25 great.
“Any transformation takes two to three years, and I think we have done a good job in terms of where we wanted to take things,” the minister said, adding that recoveries in the power sector had been “remarkable”.
Aurangzeb then highlighted that industrial and household energy tariffs had been slashed, while private sector and professional boards were introduced for power distribution companies.
“Distribution losses will be reduced going forward,” he added, noting that the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) distributing to three companies was an important step toward reducing the bottleneck in transmission.
The finance minister said that resolving the Rs1.275tr circular debt would “play an important role”.
“SOEs (state-owned enterprises) have been talked about at length, and Rs800bn has been spent, if you add up equities and guarantees, this goes into the trillions. Those trillions are better spent elsewhere,” he underscored.
Speaking about the government’s decision to privatise 24 SOEs, Aurangzeb affirmed that it would be “completed with renewed vigour and energy next year under adviser to the PM, Mohammad Ali”.
“Debt servicing is the single-largest expense for the federation. In the past year, the policy rate fell and saved us Rs800bn in debt servicing costs,” the finance minister said, adding that he would address it in detail tomorrow.
On pension reforms, the minister stated that contributions must be defined for new government colleagues joining from July 2024.
“Our biggest step is to stop bleeding and then solve legacy issues. But if we don’t stop leakages, it will become very difficult for us to start tackling legacy issues,” he emphasised.
Shedding light on the ongoing rightsizing efforts by the government, Aurangzeb said that “forty-three ministries and 400 attached departments” were to face reduction.
 
 

“It’s not [about] the what and why the federal government has to be rightsized. The question is how,” he said, adding that they will “continue with five ministries at a time”.
The finance minister then invited ministries and the heads of their attached departments to give their input on the matter, including “why a department is so critical to the running of the government”.
Speaking about Pakistan’s current account deficit, Aurangzeb observed there was a surplus of $1.9bn from July 2024 to April 2025 compared to a $1.3bn deficit last year.

“This entire year will be completed on a surplus,” he stated.
The minister termed the 7pc increase in exports, especially in the IT sector as a “big jump”, adding that money earned by freelancers was close to $400m.
He also noted that imports had increased by 12pc, with non-oil imports almost at the same level as back in 2022, which he said was the “time before the country’s economic crisis.”
While the minister said machinery and transport imports had risen by 16.5pc and 24pc, respectively, he asserted that these would help the agricultural sector, where cotton was being imported.
“Remittances, like inflation, have been an outstanding story,” Aurangzeb remarked. “You can see a 31pc increase year-on-year from $31bn and a record $4.1bn in March. When we close June, we expect our overall remittances to be $37-38bn,” he added, noting that the figure was $10bn less two years ago.

“It is very critical that we mention the momentum of the Roshan Digital Account (RDA) because that is investment and lifestyle-led,” the finance head noted.
The minister called RDAs a “different segment of our diaspora”, with inflows from it crossing $10bn and 814,000 accounts opening.
“When we talk about remittances, sometimes we forget about RDA, which is playing a very important role in terms of how we take our diaspora and their commitment to Pakistan,” he stressed.
The minister noted there was a 26pc increase in terms of revenue collection, “on the back of 30pc growth in revenue last fiscal year”.
“There has been a deepening and expanding of the tax base,” Aurangzeb stated.
“Individual filers doubled to 3.7m filers. High-value filers also increased by 178pc,” he said, recalling there were 74pc additional retail registrations in the last fiscal year.
Speaking about debt management, Aurangzeb pointed out that the government had “brought back Rs1tr in local debt due to two reasons”.
“We reduced the prices and money going into markups,” he highlighted, adding that the second reason was to give a signal to the banking system that the government was “not a desperate borrower anymore”.
“We will borrow, but at our terms. It is about time you start lending to the private sector. This was an important message for the banks and they can see the increase,” the minister said.
Aurangzeb further highlighted the banking sector’s shift to Islamic banking. “Average time to maturity has been increased by 66pc so that the refinancing risk is reduced as much as it can be and to prevent bunching around maturities. We want to keep this at 65pc,” he said.
“If the policy rate is falling along with the debt servicing rate, we need to create an alpha. We need liability management trades and strengthening the debt management offices for this purpose.”
“My focus for this fiscal year is restructuring our debt management office around global standards,” Aurangzeb added.
The minister further remarked that the money saved in debt servicing could be diverted to the social or development sectors.
The recent Pakistan-India conflict also came up during the speech: “The way our military helped our nation get a real, real win against India, so, we too have been fighting a war on the economic front.
“The Indian executive director left no room for us, he didn’t want the IMF meeting to happen. If it did, he didn’t want certain items on the agenda, such as receiving the second tranche of the EFF,” the minister said, referring to New Delhi approaching the Fund over Pakistan’s loan.
“Financial institutions and our bilateral partners are standing with us on the economic front as well because economic security is absolutely critical as we move forward,” Aurangzeb said.
“It is a very critical component of national security,” the minister stressed.
He also referred to surveys carried out by various bodies, including one by the  Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce & Industry (OICCI), which stated that foreign investors’ confidence had gone up by 16pc. Similarly, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) had said optimism among companies’ chief executive officers had surged by 83pc, he noted.
“If CEOs are optimistic, then they can take the firms forward that ‘please invest in this country’. Foreign investors can come only if local investors come,” Aurangzeb remarked.
“This survey is extremely important. I keep talking to various CEOs myself so it is very positive,” he stressed.
The minister also mentioned a survey by Gallup which said household financial institution affordability has gone up by 27.5pc in one quarter, as well as an Ipsos survey that indicated that national optimism was at a six-year high.
“Now we have to take this forward. SIFC — focused on energy, IT, agriculture and mining — is going to be a real game changer for Pakistan’s future investments,” the minister asserted.
On the Benazir Income Support Programme, part of the social sector, Aurangzeb said Rs593bn were disbursed, supporting around 10m families.
Fiscal findings
According to the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC), whose recommendations were endorsed by the National Economic Council (NEC), Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth rate for the fiscal year 2024–25 has been recorded at 2.7pc while the target for GDP growth in the next fiscal year has been set at 4.2pc.
The NEC also noted that remittances witnessed a strong increase of 30.9pc from July 2024 to April 2025, and for the first time, the current account balance remained in surplus during this period.
The survey also highlights improvements in fiscal indicators, including a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 2.6pc of GDP. The primary balance recorded a surplus of 3pc of GDP, reflecting a more disciplined fiscal approach.
Owing to improved economic fundamentals and proactive monetary policy measures, the policy interest rate was gradually reduced to 11pc. Meanwhile, credit to the private sector grew significantly, with loans amounting to Rs681 billion disbursed between July 2024 and May 2025.
The survey highlights trends, achievements, and challenges across major sectors including agriculture, manufacturing, industry, services, energy, information technology and telecommunications, capital markets, health, education, transport, and communication.
Additionally, it sheds light on developments in social protection programmes, environmental sustainability, and infrastructure.
The document also presents updated data on critical economic indicators such as inflation, trade and balance of payments, public debt, population growth, employment levels, and climate change impacts. By offering a consolidated view of these indicators, the survey aims to inform public debate and policy planning in the lead-up to the new fiscal year.
Meanwhile, the NEC emphasised that recent signs of “economic stabilisation” were the result of coordinated efforts by the federal and provincial governments.
It stated that the country has now moved onto a path of economic recovery and growth, with the agriculture sector playing a particularly important role in strengthening national reserves and supporting economic expansion.
“A comprehensive strategy is currently being formulated to ensure a steady and sustainable increase in agricultural productivity in the coming years,” it said.
In terms of development spending, a total outlay of Rs3,483bn has been approved for the Annual National Development Programme (ANDP) for 2024–25. Of this amount, Rs1,100bn was allocated for federal development initiatives, while Rs2,383bn was utilised by provincial governments for their respective projects.

The incident reflects the escalating militant presence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, where attacks have become more frequent in recent months despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
“In the exchange of fire, three Khawarij, including a key local terrorist, Commander Chhota Waseem Gundi Khankhel, were killed,” a statement by Lakki Marwat police spokesperson Shahid Marwat said.
Fitna Al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Policeman Shahidullah Gundi Khankhel was seriously injured and was sent to the District Headquarters Hospital, where he was embraced martyrdom while succumbing to his injuries on the way,” the statement continued.
KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed praised the courage and bravery of the Lakki Marwat police, the statement said.
He also paid tribute to the patriotic spirit of the brave people of Lakki Marwat, who are standing by their police to cleanse their area from the Fitna al-Khawarij. He further announced cash rewards and certificates of appreciation for this successful operation.
The police received information that some terrorists were going from Gundi towards Kot Kashmir.
On the instructions of Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and District Police Officer Lakki Marwat Jawad Ishaq, the local police and peace committee chased the terrorists.
Police and local peace committees came face to face with Fitna-ul-Khawarij terrorists at Kot Kashmir, during which the latter opened fire.
During this, there was a fierce exchange of fire between the police and the terrorists, in which one terrorist was killed on the spot, while two terrorists entered a house and tried to use the women and children in the house as shields, the police said.
“However, the police surrounded the house and continued the fight with great skill, which lasted for two hours. At the same time, the police strategically took out the women and children trapped in the house and continued the fight with the terrorists there and killed them,” the statement said.
The police also recovered weapons and ammunition from the possession of the terrorists.
“One of the killed terrorists was officially confirmed as a major terrorist commander, Chhota Waseem. The slain terrorist commander was wanted by the police for terrorist operations, while the formal identity of the other two slain terrorists is being confirmed,” the statement concluded.
In April, the killing of an elderly man and the injuring of his two relatives and a neighbour by terrorists sparked a fierce gun battle between the assailants and members of a local peace committee in the Begukhel area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district, according to police.
Last month, the police and CTD commandos launched a joint operation against terrorists in rural areas of the district.</p><small>2025-06-09 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/091331445feb15f.jpg?r=133456' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916067/who-is-who-aboard-the-gaza-aid-vessel-madleen' target='_blank'><strong>Who is who aboard the Gaza aid vessel Madleen?</strong></a><br><p>Aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces early on Monday morning and towed to Israel.
The Israeli foreign ministry, in a statement on X, said that the vessel “is safely making its way to the shores of Israel. The passengers are expected to return to their home countries”.
The British-flagged yacht Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, had departed from Sicily on June 1 and had hoped to reach Gaza later in the day, when the interception occurred, the group said on its Telegram account.
On board the Madleen — named after Palestine’s only fisherwoman — are 12 activists from around the world, who had set out in response to Israel’s total aid blockade in the besieged enclave, according to a report by Al Jazeera.

Tehran and Washington have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new nuclear accord to replace the deal with major powers that US President Donald Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
The longtime foes have been locked in a diplomatic standoff over Iran’s uranium enrichment, with Tehran defending it as a “non-negotiable” right and Washington describing it as a “red line”.
On May 31, after the fifth round talks, Iran said it had received “elements” of a US proposal, with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi saying later the text contained “ambiguities”.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei criticised the US proposal as “lacking elements” reflective of the previous rounds of negotiations, without providing further details.
“We will soon submit our own proposed plan to the other side through (mediator) Oman once it is finalised,” Baqaei told a weekly press briefing.
“It is a proposal that is reasonable, logical, and balanced, and we strongly recommend that the American side value this opportunity.”
Iran’s parliament speaker has said the US proposal failed to include the lifting of sanctions — a key demand for Tehran, which has been reeling under their weight for years.
‘Strategic mistake’
Trump, who has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign of sanctions on Iran since taking office in January, has repeatedly said it will not be allowed any uranium enrichment under a potential deal.
On Wednesday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the US offer was “100 per cent against” notions of independence and self-reliance.
He insisted that uranium enrichment was “key” to Iran’s nuclear programme and that the US “cannot have a say” on the issue.
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60pc, far above the 3.67-pc limit set in the 2015 deal and close though still short of the 90pc needed for a nuclear warhead.
Western countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Iran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes
The United Nations nuclear watchdog will convene a Board of Governors meeting from June 9-13 in Vienna to discuss Iran’s nuclear activities.
The meeting comes after the International Atomic Energy Agency released a report criticising “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it relied on “forged documents” provided by its arch foe Israel.
Britain, France and Germany, the three European countries who were party to the 2015 deal, are currently weighing whether to trigger the sanctions “snapback” mechanism in the accord.
The mechanism would reinstate UN sanctions in response to Iranian non-compliance — an option that expires in October.
On Friday, Araghchi warned European powers against backing a draft resolution at the IAEA accusing Tehran of non-compliance, calling it a “strategic mistake”.
On Monday, Baqaei said Iran has “prepared and formulated a series of steps and measures” if the resolution passed.
“Without a doubt, the response to confrontation will not be more cooperation,” he added.</p><small>2025-06-09 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09143316c75f0c6.png?r=144450' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916073/trump-travel-ban-in-effect-barring-12-nations-citizens-from-us' target='_blank'><strong>Trump travel ban in effect, barring 12 nations’ citizens from US</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s sweeping new travel ban came into effect early on Monday immediately after midnight, barring citizens from a dozen nations from entering the United States and reviving a divisive measure from his first term.
The move is expected to disrupt refugee pathways and further restrict immigration as the Trump administration expands its crackdown on illegal entries.
Many of the nations covered by the restrictions have adversarial relations with the United States, such as Iran and Afghanistan, while others face severe crises, like Haiti and Libya.
In announcing his restrictions last week, Trump said the new measure was spurred by a recent “terrorist attack” on Jews in Colorado.
The group had been protesting in solidarity with hostages held in Gaza when they were assaulted by a man the White House said had overstayed his visa.
That attack, Trump said, “underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted” or who overstay their visas.
The move bans all travel to the United States by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, according to the White House.
Trump also imposed a partial ban on travellers from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from those countries will be allowed.
New countries could be added, Trump warned, “as threats emerge around the world”.
 


Mehria, a 23-year-old woman from Afghanistan who applied for refugee status, said the new rules have trapped her and many other Afghans in uncertainty.
“We gave up thousands of hopes and our entire lives… on a promise from America, but today we are suffering one hell after another,” she told AFP.
World Cup, Olympics, diplomats excluded
The ban will not apply to athletes competing in the 2026 World Cup, which the United States is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, or in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Trump’s order said.
Nor will it apply to diplomats from the targeted countries.
United Nations rights chief Volker Turk warned that “the broad and sweeping nature of the new travel ban raises concerns from the perspective of international law”.
US Democratic lawmakers and elected officials blasted the ban as draconian and unconstitutional.
“I know the pain that Trump’s cruel and xenophobic travel bans inflict because my family has felt it firsthand,” Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari, who is Iranian-American, posted on X.
“We will fight this ban with everything we have.”
 






Rumours of a new travel ban had circulated following the Colorado attack, with Trump’s administration vowing to pursue “terrorists” living in the United States on visas.
US officials said suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national according to court documents, was in the country illegally having overstayed a tourist visa, but that he had applied for asylum in September 2022.
Trump’s new travel ban notably does not include Egypt.
His proclamation said Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and war-torn Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen lacked “competent” central authorities for processing passports and vetting.
Iran was included because it is a “state sponsor of terrorism”, the order said.
For the other countries, Trump’s order cited an above-average likelihood that people would overstay their visas.</p><small>2025-06-09 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09113906b29407f.jpg?r=114004' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916023/5-injured-as-blaze-in-karachis-landhi-factory-almost-under-control' target='_blank'><strong>5 injured as blaze in Karachi’s Landhi factory almost under control</strong></a><br><p>A fire that broke out at a factory in Landhi on Sunday could not be fully controlled even after more than 30 hours of firefighting efforts, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb told Dawn.com that the “fire has been brought under control to a large extent”, however, more time is required to completely control the blaze.
“There are flames burning in the affected factories. It may take more time to fully control the fire and complete the cooling process,” he said.
The spokesperson said rescue teams are still present on the third day of Eid and continuously engaged in extinguishing the fire.
The fire, which erupted in a factory in the export processing zone in Landhi, caused part of a factory building to collapse, leaving five people injured.
“The injured include 45-year-old Aslam, 30-year-old Hamza, 20-year-old Ayaz, 43-year-old Sajid Mahmood and 53-year-old Mohsin,” Haseeb said. “They have been transported to Civil Hospital.”
Earlier, Haseeb told Dawn.com that the fire broke out at 4:31am, meaning that it has been burning for over 24 hours.
Speaking to Dawn.com earlier, Abid Jalaluddin Sheikh, chief operating officer at Rescue 1122 Sindh, said that the fire broke out early on Sunday morning, spreading rapidly and engulfing two other factories due to the presence of combustible material.
He said, “As soon as the information was received, the Fire and Rescue team of Rescue 1122 reached the spot.”
According to Sheikh, a total of 12 fire brigade trucks,two snorkels and two ambulances of Rescue 1122 and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) are present at the spot to provide full assistance to deal with any emergency situation.
“The rescue operation is facing difficulties due to the intensity of smoke and other difficulties, as well as the shortage of water, but Rescue 1122 is making efforts to control the fire,” he said.
Sheikh highlighted that firefighting operations were “in full swing and full efforts are being made to reduce the intensity of the fire because the intensity of the fire is very high”.
“The Rescue 1122 team is making full efforts to control this emergency situation by utilising all possible resources,” he said, adding that citizens have been requested to immediately report any emergency to 1122.
Fire incidents are common in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate fire safety measures in buildings.
Thirty shops were gutted when a huge fire erupted in a commercial building in Clifton in February.
Four people, including one firefighter, were affected by smoke inhalation and 12 fire tenders worked for four hours to bring the fire under control.
Last year, the KMC informed the Sindh High Court that it had conducted a fire safety audit of over 265 commercial buildings, and not a single one was found to have a fire safety certificate or a no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the fire brigade department.
Out of 265 buildings, around 155 did not have fire alarms and smoke detectors installed, while the status of nine such buildings was not available in this respect, the KMC report added.
Similarly, the condition of the wiring and electric system of over 155 buildings was termed unsatisfactory. Regarding access to firefighting equipment, the report said that around 200 buildings had no or unsatisfactory firefighting equipment.</p><small>2025-06-09 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915942/detention-law' target='_blank'><strong>Detention law</strong></a><br><p>CITIZENS will be presumed guilty until proven innocent. At least that is the message the political leadership of Balochistan has sent to the people of the province. The Anti-Terrorism (Balochistan Amendment) Act, 2025, adopted last Wednesday by the Balochistan Assembly, states that any individual “suspected of offences enshrined in the anti-terrorism law may be held in preventive detention for up to three months for the purpose of inquiry”.
It was passed without any real resistance from the parties present, ostensibly because the province’s elected leadership has run out of ideas about how its violent sociopolitical crisis may be addressed. There is no denying that the state faces immense law-and-order challenges in the province, but will such sweeping legislation solve problems, or merely complicate them by adding more fuel to the fire?
The Balochistan Assembly seems to have made the amendments to provide legal cover to the state, which routinely detains citizens from the province without any formal charge. The vague legal standard for ‘reasonable suspicion’, the absence of judicial checks, the formalised involvement of military forces in policing civilians, and Balochistan’s history of political targeting all but guarantee that this law will be abused, and in turn fuel more of the same anger and discontentment that even today make Balochistan’s problems seem intractable.
Even aside from the host of legal and moral issues with the law, if the state really needed these powers, it could have at the very least respected some long-standing Baloch grievances while it was being drafted. For example, it should have said that each detention would be properly documented; that there would be continuous civilian and judicial oversight of each case so that there were no rights abuses in detention; and that the families of detainees would be kept informed of each detainee’s whereabouts and legal status so they would not keep searching for them in desperation. It would have made the law much more palatable. Perhaps it can still be reconsidered.

The British-flagged yacht Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, had departed from Sicily on June 1 and had hoped to reach Gaza later in the day, when the interception occurred, the group said on its Telegram account.
Among those on board the boat are Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament. The yacht is carrying a small shipment of humanitarian aid, including rice and baby formula.

The ministry said in a statement on X that the vessel “is safely making its way to the shores of Israel. The passengers are expected to return to their home countries”.
It said earlier that “the maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to unauthorised vessels under a legal naval blockade, consistent with international law”.
“Humanitarian aid is delivered regularly and effectively via different channels and routes and is transferred through established distribution mechanisms,” it added.
The FFC said earlier on Monday that Israeli soldiers had kidnapped the activists who were on the Madleen.
Israeli forces boarded the charity vessel attempting to reach the Gaza Strip in defiance of an Israeli naval blockade, the FFC had said earlier in the day.

The Israeli military had no immediate comment.
The United Nations’ special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, has supported the FFC operation and urged other boats to challenge the Gaza blockade.
“Madleen’s journey may have ended, but the mission isn’t over. Every Mediterranean port must send boats with aid & solidarity to Gaza,” she wrote on X.
“As the Madleen was reportedly intercepted and seized by Israeli forces in int’l waters, the UK gov must urgently seek full clarification and secure the immediate release of the vessel & its crew,” she said in a separate post.
 






The Gaza Freedom Flotilla had also said that quadcopters surrounded the Madleen and were “spraying it with a white paint-like substance”, Al Jazeera reported.
Huwaida Arraf, the co-founder of the International Solidarity Movement, which is supporting the FFC, told Al Jazeera that some people on board reported that their “eyes were burning” after the white substance was dropped on the aid boat.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry posted a video on X showing the Israeli Navy communicating with the Madleen over a loudspeaker, urging it to change course, shortly before the FFC confirmed that Israeli forces had boarded the Gaza-bound aid ship.
“The maritime zone off the coast of Gaza is closed to naval traffic as part of a legal naval blockade,” a soldier said. “If you wish to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, you are able to do so through the (Israeli) port of Ashdod.”
Mouin Rabbani, a non-resident fellow at the Qatar-based Centre for Conflict and Humanitarian Studies, told Al Jazeera that the “absolute silence” from the Madleen crew members’ governments reflects Israeli impunity.
“If any other state had sent its military forces to seize a small civilian boat carrying 12 unarmed civilians to deliver food, baby formula and crutches to a besieged population, it would immediately be recognised for the act of state piracy that it indisputably is,” Rabbani said.
“But for Israel, there’s always an exception.”
“This is not only an act of state piracy. It’s in direct violation of the provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ),” Rabbani added, noting that the court has emphasised “the need for the unhindered delivery of humanitarian supplies to the besieged population of the Gaza Strip.”
The organisers of the Madleen’s voyage said on Saturday that they had reached Egyptian waters and were nearing Gaza, where the Israeli invasion of Gaza entered its 21st month.
The Madleen, a sailing boat operated by the FFC, left Italy on June 1 with the stated aim of delivering humanitarian aid and breaking the Israeli blockade on the Palestinian territory.
“Israel will not allow anyone to break the naval blockade of Gaza, which is aimed at preventing weapons from reaching Hamas — a murderous terrorist group holding our hostages and committing war crimes,” Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said.
“Israel will act against any attempt to break the blockade or support terror groups — by sea, air or land,” he added.
The coalition responded in a statement on X, saying it expected “interception and an attack from Israel at any moment” and calling for the governments of those on board to protect them.
The post added that the Madleen is 160 nautical miles from Gaza and that jamming “briefly disrupted our location, but our tracker is functioning again”.
 






Meanwhile, activists aboard the vessel have said they will continue their journey “until the last minute”.
“We’ll stay mobilised until the last minute — until Israel cuts the internet and networks,” European parliament member Rima Hassan told AFP from the boat. “There are twelve of us civilians on board. We are not armed. There is only humanitarian aid.”
Hassan voiced concern over the lack of official response from countries whose citizens are part of the crew.
“No state has responded. The message being sent is that Israel is being allowed to act with impunity, without any guarantee of protection for us,” she added.
In a post on X, Hassan said that the activists have “less than 24 hours” before they are detained by Israeli authorities.
“When we are no longer able to communicate with you, I’m counting on you to continue the mobilisation that has been so valuable to us throughout this journey,” she wrote.
 






Nationals of Germany, France, Brazil, Turkey, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands are on the boat.
“We’re not scared of them,” said German human rights activist Yasemin Acar, also on board. “The message they have been sending us, that we cannot come closer, is not making us step back.”
On Sunday, French Minister for Foreign Trade and French Nationals Abroad Laurent Saint-Martin said that France was obliged to ensure “consular protection” for its nationals aboard the Madleen.
“The six French citizens on this boat are entitled to consular protection,” he told a state TV channel.
On May 27, Israel began implementing a controversial plan to distribute aid through the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, bypassing UN oversight. Palestinians have denounced the move as a coercive tactic to force displacement from northern to southern Gaza.
Gaza’s Government Media Office said the death toll from the American-Israeli aid distribution sites had risen to 125, with 736 wounded and nine missing since May 27.
According to the office, 13 people were killed and 153 injured on Sunday alone in two separate incidents near those locations.
On Sunday, the health ministry in Gaza said that the overall toll for the Gaza invasion had reached 54,880, the majority being civilians. The UN considers these figures reliable.
The conflict was sparked by Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.</p><small>2025-06-09 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0313440463dea61.jpg?r=134514' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914504/we-asked-two-ex-finance-ministers-what-the-2025-26-budget-should-look-like-here-are-their-thoughts' target='_blank'><strong>We asked two ex-finance ministers what the 2025-26 budget should look like. Here are their thoughts</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is expected to present the Finance Bill 2025-26 in the National Assembly tomorrow (Tuesday). Much has been said in the lead-up to the big day; the finance minister has pledged to introduce “bold measures” to steer the national economy in a strategic direction, while the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has stressed the need for tight expenditure controls to ensure sustainable debt servicing.
Meanwhile, the government has decided to cut allocations for almost all sectors, barring a rise in road building schemes and no changes to parliamentarians’ schemes.
While all this chatter continues, Dawn.com reached out to former finance ministers, Asad Umar and Miftah Ismail, for their input on what the government should be prioritising in the next fiscal year. Here’s what they had to say.
 


Asad Umar — Finance Minister [Aug 2018 - April 2019]
During the last 10 years, the fiscal deficit has averaged more than 6 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). These heavy deficits running over a long period of time have landed Pakistan in a classic debt trap. Not only are we borrowing to repay loans, we are also borrowing to pay the interest on these loans.
In fact, the level of deficit is actually understated as it has been curtailed by lowering development spending. Ten years back, for example, the fiscal deficit stood at 5.5pc; last year it was 6.8pc. This increase in deficit was despite reducing development spending by almost 3pc during this period.
The fundamental question for the government at this point is: how to increase the revenue and what expenditures to cut. No government, whether military, civilian or hybrid, has been able to expand the tax net by fairly taxing severely under-taxed sectors such as retail. Similarly, the many efforts to identify big tax evaders and money launderers and collect their due share of tax have failed. This budget must include implementation measures using the legislation enacted in the last few years regarding the sharing of information on lifestyle, asset ownership and benami (fictitious) properties. We must shut down the biggest loophole in the form of real estate being used to hide wealth by the severe under-recording of transaction prices.

This budget must lay the foundation for a structural shift

Last year’s budget placed a crushing burden on the salaried class. This budget must include a reversal of that unfair taxation. We have also now taken taxation on the documented economy to a level where it has become counterproductive. This is one of the reasons why we have seen unprecedented wealth outflows in recent years. We must now look at the beginning of a reduction in these tax rates.
The federal expenditure is dominated by interest payments, which are now more than four times the defence expenditure. This is the result of massive accumulated deficits and curtailment of low-cost external financing. Ten years ago, for instance, the deficit was financed through 40pc external finance, 40pc domestic banks and 20pc domestic non-banks. Last year, almost the entire deficit was financed by domestic banks, with external financing down to only 3pc.
This 800-pound gorilla in the fiscal room, à la interest payments, has to be dealt with on a priority basis. A mere curtailment in deficits, though necessary, will not be sufficient. Debt restructuring, which protects the financial stability of the banking system and creates fiscal space, has become absolutely essential.
Our growth rates are low and decreasing further. The GDP growth rate, which averaged around 7pc in the mid-80s, stood at 3.5pc in the last 10 years and a meagre 1.6pc in the last three years. One reason is the cut in development spending from 7pc of the GDP to a mere 2pc, to contain the fiscal deficit.
Poor and inconsistent macroeconomic policies, which led to recurring external shocks and the economy having to go into a demand compression mode every few years, have been largely to blame. The exchange rate management and trade taxation policies have had a long-term anti-export bias, putting the brakes on exports becoming an engine of growth.
However, equally important is the lack of any kind of meaningful and long-term growth strategy. Macroeconomic stability is a necessary but an insufficient condition for sustained growth. Our economic structure is low value-added and static. Unless we produce products and services of increasing complexity and value, we will be unable to compete in the global market and generate a sustainable and non-inflationary growth momentum.
In the first two decades of this century, Pakistan’s economic structure remained virtually unchanged. Vietnam, on the other hand, saw a dramatic rise in the complexity index, indicating a marked shift to more sophisticated products. As a result, during this period, Vietnam’s exports grew at a rate almost six times higher than Pakistan’s.
This budget must lay the foundation for this structural shift. We must break out of this low-value-added trap that the economy is in. Growth engines must be tradables, have high job intensity, be globally competitive and help move to higher value. The fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, skill development, pursuit of foreign direct investment and all other government policies and actions must be aligned with this strategy.
To meet the immediate need for growth, barring huge external deficits, it is essential to focus on measures to help farmers. One of the key reasons for the extremely weak growth in the current fiscal year is the terrible state of agriculture. Farmers have suffered terribly due to multiple factors, and the budget must address some of these, including a close look at farm input costs, which have gone up drastically.
 


Miftah Ismail — Finance Minister [April 2022 - September 2022]
The Pakistani government’s fiscal or budget policy suffers from two fundamental structural issues and two political issues that render our budgets both anti-growth and anti-middle class.
The first structural issue comes from constitutional provisions that don’t allow the federal government to tax agricultural income, while it can tax all other types of income or property. These provisions together give the rich a means to evade income taxes and also keep their wealth out of the tax net, perpetuating income inequality in the country.
The second structural issue is the sharing of about 60pc of federal taxes with provinces. Given that provinces are awash in cash and have surpluses most years, and given that the federal government is running huge deficits, a change in the National Finance Commission (NFC) is particularly warranted. This will reduce the overall tax burden on citizens and also allow Pakistan to achieve economic growth, something we have not really seen in two decades.

The NFC refers to the National Finance Commission, a constitutional body mandated to determine how the federal government distributes financial resources (taxes, grants, etc.) to the provinces.

This year, the total taxes collected by the Federal Board of Revenue will be Rs12,000 billion, and yet, the budget deficit will amount to approximately Rs8,500bn. Now, to balance the budget, the FBR wouldn’t just have to raise an additional Rs8,500bn. It would in fact have to raise an additional Rs14,500bn, because 60pc of the FBR revenue goes to the provinces. We are talking about taxes totalling Rs26,500bn or 22.5pc of the GDP, which is substantially higher than the US federal government tax-to-GDP ratio of 16pc and more than our current taxes.
Hence, the possibility of substantially reducing the deficit under the current NFC award is remote.

As long as we have a large budget deficit, our country will not be able to post high growth rates

But why do we need to balance the budget anyway? Why not just keep borrowing? Well, it turns out that when the government borrows money to finance the deficit, the preferred method is to borrow from the private sector. But since our private sector’s savings are less than the investments, it is unable to finance the government’s deficit. Therefore, the government has to print money or borrow from foreign sources, which means that we keep running a perpetual current account deficit (if we borrow from foreigners) and/or end up with a depreciated currency and high inflation (if we print money).
Therefore, as long as we have a large budget deficit, our country will not be able to post high growth rates. We have seen this since 2010, and especially in the last three years, when the per capita income of Pakistanis decreased.
As stated above, there are also two political problems with our fiscal policy. The first being that we are unwilling to tax the wealthy and happy to shift the burden onto the middle class. For instance, we tax people with a monthly salary of only Rs50,000, while agricultural landlords are exempt from taxes. Either that, or we are eager to tax, say, a small weaving unit — the backbone of our textile export — but lack the courage to tax large estates and properties.
Even our taxes on goods such as sales tax, excise tax, and customs duties disproportionately affect the poor and the middle class.
The second political problem is that our tax and tariff codes are solely focused on raising revenues, lacking consideration of their economic damages; think of the 38.5pc tax rate on salaried incomes. This policy is either forcing people to migrate out of Pakistan or to cheat on taxes.
On the other hand, there is the super tax of 10pc on the income of exporters. This is the government telling firms that if you export and earn more, we will penalise you with a 10pc super tax. In a similar vein, customs duties or sales tax are imposed on the import of solar cells, but the same is nowhere to be seen on finished solar panels. These are all counterproductive steps that should be fixed in the upcoming budget.
Moreover, the recent escalation with India has brought home the point that we need a well-financed defence sector that can ensure a credible yet conventional deterrent against the neighbour. This means our armed forces would require more resources. To finance this, I would like to see a substantial reduction in federal and provincial “development” spending, from this year’s Rs2,500bn to no more than Rs1,300bn next year. The Rs1,200bn in savings can then be used to increase defence spending and provide much-needed relief to both the salaried class and the very poor.
Finally, rather than giving subsidies and distorting prices, I would like to see the budget for the Benazir Income Support Programme be raised to Rs1,500bn so that we can finally make a dent in poverty, stunting and illiteracy.</p><small>2025-06-09 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/091047594133d2a.jpg?r=112951' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916065/california-governor-calls-trump-national-guard-deployment-in-la-unlawful' target='_blank'><strong>California governor calls Trump National Guard deployment in LA ‘unlawful’</strong></a><br><p>California National Guard troops were deployed to the streets of Los Angeles on Sunday to help quell a third day of protests over President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement, a step the state’s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, called “unlawful”.
Police were making more arrests after at least 10 on Sunday and 29 the previous night, Los Angeles police officers told a news briefing.
National Guard troops guarded federal government buildings, as police and protesters clashed in separate demonstrations over federal immigration raids in Los Angeles.
Los Angeles police declared several rallies to be “unlawful assemblies”, accusing some protesters of throwing concrete projectiles, bottles and other items at police.
Video images showed several self-driving cars from Alphabet’s Waymo were set ablaze on a downtown street on Sunday evening.
Los Angeles police officers on horseback attempted to control the crowds.
Demonstrators shouted “Shame on you!” at police, and some appeared to throw objects, video images showed. One group blocked the 101 Freeway, a major downtown thoroughfare.
Groups of protesters, many carrying Mexican flags and signs denouncing US immigration authorities, gathered in spots around the city.
The Los Angeles branch of the Party for Socialism and Liberation organised speakers outside City Hall for an afternoon rally.
 






California Governor Gavin Newsom said he requested the Trump administration to withdraw its order to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles County, calling it “unlawful”.
In an interview with MSNBC, Newsom said he planned to sue the administration over the deployment, adding that Trump “has created the conditions” around the protests.
 






Newsom accused Trump of trying to manufacture a crisis and violating California’s state sovereignty. “These are the acts of a dictator, not a president,” he wrote in a post on X.
 






However, Police Chief Jim McDonnell told a media briefing on Sunday night that the protests were getting out of control.
Asked if the National Guard was needed, McDonnell said police would not “go to that right away,” but added, “Looking at the violence tonight, I think we’ve got to make a reassessment.”
In a social media post, Trump called on McDonnell to do so.
“He should, right now!!!” Trump added. “Don’t let these thugs get away with this. Make America great again!!!”
The White House disputed Newsom’s characterisation, saying in a statement, “Everyone saw the chaos, violence and lawlessness.”
Earlier, about a dozen National Guard members, along with Department of Homeland Security personnel, pushed back a group of demonstrators outside a federal building in downtown Los Angeles, video showed.
US Northern Command said 300 members of the California National Guard had been deployed to three spots in the Los Angeles area. Their mission was limited to protecting federal personnel and property.
In a social media post on Sunday, Trump called the demonstrators “violent, insurrectionist mobs” and said he was directing his cabinet officers “to take all such action necessary” to stop what he called “riots”.
Speaking to reporters in New Jersey, he threatened violence against demonstrators who spit on police or National Guard troops, saying, “They spit, we hit.” He did not cite any specific incidents.
“If we see danger to our country and to our citizens, it will be very, very strong in terms of law and order,” Trump said.
The FBI offered a $50,000 reward for information on a suspect accused of throwing rocks at police vehicles in Paramount, injuring a federal officer.
Despite Trump’s rhetoric about the demonstrations, he has not invoked the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that empowers a president to deploy the US military to suppress events like civil disorder.
Asked on Sunday whether he was considering doing so, he said, “It depends on whether or not there’s an insurrection.”
‘High alert’
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has warned that the Pentagon was prepared to mobilise active-duty troops “if violence continues” in Los Angeles, saying the Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton were on “high alert”.
US Northern Command said about 500 Marines were prepared to deploy if ordered.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the Trump administration for inciting tension by sending in the National Guard, but also condemned protesters who became violent.
“I don’t want people to fall into the chaos that I believe is being created by the administration completely unnecessarily,” Bass told a press conference.
Vanessa Crdenas, the head of the immigration advocacy group America’s Voice, accused the Trump administration of “trumping up an excuse to abuse power, and deliberately stoke and force confrontations around immigration”.
On Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CBS’ ‘Face the Nation’ that the National Guard would provide safety around buildings to people engaged in peaceful protest and to law enforcement.
 


Trump has pledged to deport record numbers of people in the country illegally and lock down the US-Mexico border, setting ICE a goal of arresting at least 3,000 migrants a day.
Census data suggests a significant part of the population in Democratic-run Los Angeles is Hispanic and foreign-born.
But the sweeping enforcement measures have also included legal residents, some with permanent residence, spurring legal challenges.
On Sunday, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum criticised the US government over the immigration raids and National Guard deployment.
“We do not agree with this way of addressing the immigration issue,” Sheinbaum, who has sought to cultivate a positive relationship with Trump, said at a public event.
“The phenomenon will not be addressed with raids or violence. It will be by sitting down and working on comprehensive reform.”
Trump’s justification
Trump’s justification for the National Guard deployment cited a provision of Title 10 of the US Code on the Armed Forces.
However, Title 10 also says the “orders for these purposes shall be issued through the governors of the States.”
It was not immediately clear if the president had the legal authority to deploy the National Guard without Newsom’s order.
Title 10 allows for National Guard deployment by the federal government if there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States”.
Those troops are only allowed to engage in limited activities and cannot undertake ordinary law enforcement activities.
Trump’s memo says the troops will “temporarily protect ICE and other United States government personnel who are performing federal functions, including the enforcement of federal law, and to protect federal property, at locations where protests against these functions are occurring, or are likely to occur”.</p><small>2025-06-09 06:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09095130aabc434.jpg?r=100220' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916060/indias-80-billion-coal-power-boom-is-running-short-of-water' target='_blank'><strong>India’s $80 billion coal-power boom is running short of water</strong></a><br><p>April marks the start of the cruellest months for residents of Solapur, a hot and dry district in western India. As temperatures soar, water availability dwindles. In peak summer, the wait for taps to flow can stretch to a week or more.
Just a decade ago, water flowed every other day, according to the local government and residents of Solapur, some 400 km inland from Mumbai.
Then in 2017, a 1,320-megawatt coal-fired power plant run by state-controlled NTPC began operations. It provided the district with energy — and competed with residents and businesses for water from a reservoir that serves the area.
Solapur illustrates the Catch-22 facing India, which has 17 per cent of the planet’s population but access to only 4pc of its water resources. The world’s most populous country plans to spend nearly $80 billion on water-hungry coal plants by 2031 to power growing industries like data centre operations.
The vast majority of these new projects are planned for India’s driest areas, according to a power ministry document reviewed by Reuters, which is not public and was created for officials to track progress.
Many of the 20 people interviewed by Reuters for this story, which included power company executives, energy officials and industry analysts, said the thermal expansion likely portended future conflict between industry and residents over limited water resources.
Thirty-seven of the 44 new projects named in the undated power ministry shortlist of future operations are located in areas that the government classifies as either suffering from water scarcity or stress. NTPC, which says it draws 98.5pc of its water from water-stressed areas, is involved in nine of them.
NTPC said in response to Reuters’ questions that it is “continuously striving towards conservation of water with best of our efforts in Solapur”, including using methods like treating and reusing water. It did not answer queries about potential expansion plans.
India’s power ministry has told lawmakers in parliament, most recently in 2017, that the locations of coal-fired power plants are determined by factors including access to land and water and that state governments are responsible for allocating water to them.
Access to land is the dominant consideration, two federal groundwater board officials and two water researchers told Reuters.
India’s complex and arcane land laws have delayed many commercial and infrastructure projects for years, so power operators under pressure to meet burgeoning demand pick areas where they are likely to face little resistance, said Rudrodip Majumdar, an energy and environment professor at the National Institute of Advanced Studies in Bengaluru.
“They look for areas with easy land availability — minimum resistance for maximum land — even if water is available only far away,” he said.
The federal power ministry, as well as energy and water authorities in Maharashtra state, where Solapur is located, did not respond to queries.
Delhi attempted to reduce its reliance on coal before reversing track after the Covid-19 pandemic. It has invested heavily in renewable energy sources, like solar and hydro, but thirsty thermal power will still be dominant for the coming decades.
India’s former top energy bureaucrat Ram Vinay Shahi said ready access to power was strategically important for the country, whose per-capita power consumption is far lower than its regional rival China.
“The only energy resource we have in the country is coal,” he said. “Between water and coal, preference is given to coal.”
‘Nothing’ in Solapur?
Solapur resident Rajani Thoke plans her life around water in high summer. On days with supply, “I do not focus on anything other than storing water, washing clothes and such work,” said the mother of two, who strictly polices her family’s water use.
Sushilkumar Shinde, the federal power minister who approved the Solapur plant in 2008, when the area had already been classified “water scarce,” told Reuters he helped NTPC procure the land by negotiating payments to locals.
The member of the opposition Congress party, who won the election to retain Solapur’s parliamentary seat a year after the plant’s approval, defended the operation on the grounds of NTPC’s sizable investment. The $1.34bn plant generated thousands of jobs during its construction and now provides part-time employment to about 2,500 locals.
“I made sure farmers got good money for the land NTPC acquired,” he said, adding that mismanagement by local authorities was to blame for water shortages.
Solapur municipal official Sachin Ombase acknowledged that water distribution infrastructure had not kept up with population growth, but said that authorities were trying to address the problem.
Shinde said “there was nothing” in Solapur in 2008 and that residents who received land payments had no reason to oppose the plant.
Researcher Shripad Dharmadhikary, who founded the environment advocacy group Manthan Adhyayan Kendra, said local politicians often supported splashy infrastructure projects to boost their popularity.
Any “problems come up much later,” he said.
Even before the Solapur plant started operating, there were signs of the trouble to come. The first of its two units was supposed to start generating power by the middle of 2016, but it was delayed by more than 12 months because of years of severe water shortages, according to a 2020 regulatory filing.
The absence of nearby water resources meant the station ended up drawing on water from a reservoir about 120 km away. Such distances can sharply increase costs and the risk of water theft, said Dharmadhikary and two plant sources.
As of May 2023, the station is among India’s least water-efficient, according to the latest available federal records. It also has among the lowest capacity utilisation rates of coal-fired plants, according to data from government think-tank NITI Aayog.
NTPC said its data indicates the Solapur plant has an efficiency ratio in line with the country’s norms.
Indian stations typically consume twice as much water as their global counterparts, according to the Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment think-tank.
Solapur plant officials told reporters in March that capacity utilisation will improve with increasing demand, indicating that water consumption could surge in the future.
A forthcoming survey on water use in Solapur, led by state groundwater authorities and reviewed by Reuters showed that irrigation demand in the district outstrips supply by a third.
Dharmes Waghmore owns farmland a few miles from the plant and said that developing it would provide more financial security than his current casual work.
But he said borrowing money to develop the land by drilling a bore well is too risky: “What if there’s no water?”
Kuladeep Jangam, a top local official, said authorities were struggling to draw businesses to Solapur.
The lack of “water neutralises all other pull factors,” he said.
Thirst For Water
Since 2014, India has lost 60.33bn units of coal-power generation across the country — equivalent to 19 days of coal-power supply at June 2025 levels — because water shortages force plants to suspend generation, according to federal data.
Among the facilities that have struggled with shortages is the 2,920 MW Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station, one of India’s largest.
Located about 500 km northeast of Solapur but also in a water-stressed area, the plant shuts several of its units for months at a time when the monsoon delivers less rain than usual, according to NITI Aayog data.
Despite the challenges, the plant is considering adding 800 MW of new capacity, according to the power ministry list seen by Reuters and half a dozen sources at Mahagenco, which operates the station.
The document indicates the plant hasn’t identified a water source for the expansion, though it has already sourced its coal.
State-owned Mahagenco did not respond to Reuters’ questions.
The plant’s thirst for water has previously led to tensions with residents of nearby Chandrapur city. Locals protested the station during a 2017 drought, prompting officials such as local lawmaker Sudhir Mungantiwar to order it to divert water to homes.
Mungantiwar, however, says he supports the expansion of the plant, which he hopes will lead to the project retiring water-inefficient older units.
But the station has already delayed a plan to decommission two polluting and water-guzzling power units with a capacity of 420 MW by about seven years, citing instructions from the federal government, the company sources said.
The Indian government asked power companies not to retire old thermal plants until the end of the decade due to a surge in demand following the pandemic, Reuters has reported.
Chandrapur resident Anjali, who goes by one name, said she is resigned to visiting a tap installed by the station near one of its gates for drinking water.
“We’re poor, we make do with whatever we can get,” she said.</p><small>2025-06-09 05:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/09091922431a736.jpg?r=092332' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916058/no-deaths-as-plane-with-20-aboard-crashes-in-tennessee-us-authorities' target='_blank'><strong>No deaths as plane with 20 aboard crashes in Tennessee: US authorities</strong></a><br><p>No one was killed, but several people were injured and taken to hospital on Sunday when a skydiving plane carrying 20 passengers and crew crashed in the US state of Tennessee, authorities said.
A twin-engine plane used for skydiving expeditions crashed shortly after midday in Tullahoma, south of Nashville, according to local and federal officials.
“There were no casualties,” city spokesman Lyle Russell said in a statement sent to AFP.
He said a total of 20 passengers and crew were onboard the DeHaviland DH-6 Twin Otter when it crashed at the Tullahoma Regional Airport at around 12:30pm (10:30pm PKT).
“Three were sent for medical treatment via helicopter and one sent by ground transport for more serious injuries to local hospitals,” he said, adding that “other minor injuries were treated by first responders on scene”.
Russell said that “no ground facilities or airport facilities were damaged and there were no injuries reported from the ground”.
The Federal Aviation Administration said it was investigating the crash, while the Tennessee Highway Patrol said on X that its troopers were assisting police at the scene.

Reigning champion Alcaraz rallied from the brink of defeat to overcome world number one Sinner 4-6, 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (10/2) to clinch his fifth Grand Slam title after five hours and 29 minutes.
The 22-year-old Spaniard is now unbeaten in five Grand Slam finals after snapping Sinner’s 20-match winning run at the majors.
Alcaraz pulled off his first-ever comeback from two sets down to stun Sinner in the longest Roland Garros final in history. It easily eclipsed the 1982 final in Paris when Mats Wilander triumphed in four sets over Guillermo Vilas in 4 hours and 42 minutes.
Alcaraz becomes the third youngest man to win five Grand Slams — after Bjorn Borg and compatriot Rafael Nadal — following an incredible duel between the two stars of a new generation.
Sinner fell agonisingly short of a third successive Grand Slam crown after last year’s US Open title and back-to-back Australian Open triumphs.
He suffered his fifth straight loss to Alcaraz in what was their first meeting in a Grand Slam final — and the first championship match at a major between two men born in the 2000s.
Alcaraz leads 8-5 overall, having also beaten Sinner to win in Rome, where the Italian returned to competition after a three-month doping ban.</p><small>2025-06-08 19:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/08215858b9db87d.jpg?r=220139' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916010/troops-sent-by-trump-reach-protest-hit-los-angeles-over-governors-wishes' target='_blank'><strong>Troops sent by Trump reach protest-hit Los Angeles over governor’s wishes</strong></a><br><p>United States National Guard troops began arriving in Los Angeles early on Sunday after being deployed by President Donald Trump, a rare deployment against the state governor’s wishes after sometimes violent protests against immigration enforcement raids.
Trump took federal control of California’s state military to push soldiers into the country’s second-biggest city, an extraordinary move not seen for decades and deemed “purposefully inflammatory” by California Governor Gavin Newsom.
Helmeted troops carrying automatic weapons and with camouflaged vehicles could be seen in the Compton neighbourhood of the California city early Sunday, ahead of more protests, including a call by organisers for a “mass mobilisation” at City Hall at 2pm local time (2100 GMT).
The development came after two days of confrontations during which federal agents fired flash-bang grenades and tear gas toward crowds angry at the arrests of dozens of migrants in a city with a large Latino population.
Republicans lined up behind Trump on Sunday to dismiss warnings by Newsom and other local officials that the protests had been largely peaceful, and that the deployment was against their wishes and would exacerbate tensions.
“I have no concern about that at all,” Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson told ABC’s ‘This Week’ when asked, adding that Newsom “has shown an inability or unwillingness to do what is necessary there, so the president stepped in”.
As for threats by Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Saturday to send in active-duty Marines on top of the Guard troops, Johnson said he did not see that as “heavy-handed.”
“We have to be prepared to do what is necessary,” he argued.
Federal authorities “want a spectacle. Don’t give them one. Never use violence. Speak out peacefully,” Newsom had posted on X late on Saturday. He branded Hegseth’s threat “deranged”.
 






“We agree that if you’re being violent, you should be arrested … But this is not what’s happening,” California Congresswoman Nanette Barragan told CNN on Sunday.
“We are having an administration that’s targeting peaceful protests … The president is sending the National Guard because he doesn’t like the scenes,” the Democrat said.
Overnight, an AFP photographer saw fires and fireworks light up the streets during clashes, while a protester holding a Mexican flag stood in front of a burnt-out car that had been sprayed with a slogan against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.
“It’s up to us to stand up for our people,” said a Los Angeles resident whose parents are immigrants, declining to give her name as emergency services lights flashed in the distance.
‘Zero tolerance’
Trump had signed a memorandum sending 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, the White House said on Saturday.
The National Guard — a reserve military — is frequently used in natural disasters, and occasionally in instances of civil unrest, but almost always with the consent of local authorities.
It is the first time since 1965 that a president has deployed a National Guard without a request by a state governor, the former head of Human Rights Watch, US activist Kenneth Roth, posted on X, accusing Trump of “creating a spectacle so he can continue his immigration raids”.
 






But the National Guard are “specifically trained for this type of crowd situation”, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told CBS’ ‘Face the Nation’ on Sunday, refusing to divulge where in Los Angeles they would be deployed.
 


Trump has delivered on a promise to crack down hard on the entry and presence of undocumented migrants — who he has likened to “monsters” and “animals” — since taking office in January.
ICE raids in other US cities have triggered small-scale protests in recent months, but the Los Angeles unrest is the biggest and most sustained against the Trump administration’s policies so far.
A CBS News poll taken before the Los Angeles protests showed a slight majority of Americans still approved of the immigration crackdown.
Masked and armed immigration agents carried out high-profile workplace raids in separate parts of Los Angeles on Friday and Saturday, attracting angry crowds and setting off hours-long standoffs.
Fernando Delgado, a 24-year-old resident, said the raids were “injustices” and those detained were “human beings just like any.”
The stand-off demonstrated “Trump’s authoritarianism in real time,” Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders posted on X on Sunday.
“Conduct massive illegal raids. Provoke a counter-response. Declare a state of emergency. Call in the troops,” he wrote, adding: “Unacceptable.”

As announced by Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad, the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 will be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey will be released a day earlier.
According to today’s statement, Sadiq approved the NA’s schedule for the budget, which will be presented in the lower house on June 10.
“There will not be any sessions in the National Assembly on June 11 and 12,” Sadiq was quoted as saying.
“The discussion on the federal budget will begin in the National Assembly on June 13 [and] parliamentary parties present … will be given time for discussion as per the rules and regulations,” he added.
 
 

According to the statement, debates on the federal budget will continue until June 21, when it will be finalised.
“There will be no meeting of the National Assembly on June 22. The necessary expenses for 2025-26 will be presented and debated in the National Assembly on June 23,” the statement added.
Sadiq was quoted as saying that on June 24 and 25, there will be debates and voting on motions for deductions and grants, while the Finance Bill 2025-26 will be finalised on June 26.
“On June 27, there will be a debate and voting on other issues, including supplementary grants,” the speaker said, with the statement adding that changes to the schedule could be made with his permission.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has stated that the government’s priority in the upcoming budget is to provide relief to the common man, in addition to “the creation of jobs, agriculture, information technology, small and medium enterprises, and the housing sector”.
Meanwhile, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said that the government would have a Rs1 trillion development budget and hinted at an increase in defence spending.</p><small>2025-06-08 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/08200549e280a95.jpg?r=200707' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916039/ayaz-sadiq-expresses-gratitude-to-saudi-crown-prince-for-supporting-pakistan-during-difficult-time' target='_blank'><strong>Ayaz Sadiq expresses gratitude to Saudi crown prince for supporting Pakistan during ‘difficult time’</strong></a><br><p>National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Sunday met the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, and expressed Pakistan’s gratitude for the kingdom’s support during “a difficult time”, a statement from the NA Secretariat read.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif embarked on a two-day state visit to the kingdom and performed Umrah on the night of Thursday and Friday, offering prayers for the country’s success in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, the government said on its X account.
During his visit, the prime minister “expressed appreciation for the kingdom’s proactive role during recent tensions between Pakistan and India, and its steadfast commitment to promoting peace and stability in the region and beyond”, according to a statement from the PM’s office.
According to the statement issued today, the Saudi crown prince expressed his commitment to addressing issues that affect the Islamic world when he met with NA Speaker Sadiq, who expressed gratitude for the kingdom’s support for Pakistan.
“Saudi Arabia has supported Pakistan in every difficult time,” Sadiq was quoted as saying. “I am grateful for the Saudi leadership’s clear stance on Pakistan. The people of Pakistan look up to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques [the title held by the Saudi king].”
Sadiq added that he expects that ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will “further strengthen”.
 






Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who was also attending the luncheon, expressed his gratitude to the Saudi crown prince for the invitation to perform Haj as a royal guest.
“The exemplary arrangements for the pilgrims and the services to the Muslim Ummah are commendable,” Tessori wrote on X, adding that he extended an invitation to the crown prince to visit Pakistan.
 






Pakistan and India engaged in a brief military confrontation last month, following the latter’s allegations that Islamabad orchestrated a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam; an allegation Pakistan strongly denied.
Saudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Aljubeir welcomed the ceasefire between the two countries, according to a post by the Foreign Office (FO) on X.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited Turkiye for two days last month and expressed gratitude to Erdogan for Turkiye’s support during a brief military confrontation with India.
According to PTV News, a delegation-level meeting between the two nations was “warm and most cordial” and both nations “reaffirmed the deep-rooted, historic, and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Türkiye, anchored in shared values, mutual respect, and a common vision for progress and prosperity”.
PTV News reported that the Turkish president made his remarks during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, where both leaders exchanged Eidul Azha greetings.
“While recalling their recent meetings in Istanbul and Lachin, the prime minister thanked President Erdogan once again for Turkiye’s strong and unwavering support to Pakistan during the recent Pakistan-India crisis,” the report read.
“He said this gesture has won the hearts of the people of Pakistan and added another glorious chapter to the history of [the] Pakistan-Turkiye brotherhood.”
 






Both leaders agreed to fast-track key decisions taken in recent meetings, which PM Shehbaz said would “help accelerate bilateral cooperation, particularly in trade and investment”, the report stated.
Erdogan and Shehbaz “reaffirmed their unflinching support to each other on their core interests. They also discussed the latest regional and global developments, including the situation in Gaza.”
“In his remarks, President Erdogan … reaffirmed Turkiye’s resolute support to Pakistan on all important issues,” PTV News added.</p><small>2025-06-08 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0813451152d5266.png?r=165315' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916022/pakistan-seeks-global-intervention-in-issues-with-india-as-diplomatic-team-lands-in-london' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks global ‘intervention’ in issues with India as diplomatic team lands in London</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for “intervention” from global powers in resolving key issues with India amid ongoing tensions, members of a high-level delegation presenting Islamabad’s stance said on Sunday after landing in London.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team has arrived in London and will also visit Brussels.
The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Subzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
“The resistance we faced is that the Americans think that since [US] President [Donald] Trump has mediated the ceasefire, there is no need for further intervention. This was exactly our mission: to make them understand that intervention is needed,” Dastgir told Geo News after arriving in the United Kingdom.
“The diplomatic delegation fulfilled its objectives,” he asserted.
The former MNA added: “Our ministers also put forward this stance that if India does not come to the table for talks again, then due to [the water issue] and India’s irresponsible behaviour — saying that it does not need evidence for a war — a war in the subcontinent is certain.”
 






Similarly, Subzwari told Geo News: “We want global powers to tell India that two neighbouring nuclear states cannot move forward in such a dangerous environment. It is not just damaging for the region but for the world’s peace.”
Noting that the delegation began its engagements with a multilateral forum, the United Nations, the senator stressed, “Despite showing our military prowess, we have come with an invitation to peace.”
Rehman, a former ambassador to the US, called the meetings “very positive”.
“They understood our points and the risks. They all also agreed that the weaponisation of water is extremely wrong,” she said, terming India-occupied Kashmir as the “largest open-air prison after Gaza”.
“Whatever the Indians do, good luck to them,” the PPP leader quipped, referring to the delegations sent by New Delhi to various countries on the matter.
Rehman highlighted: “India’s delegation does not know what its mission is, except for maligning Pakistan. [However,] we did not go [to US] to malign India, but to tell Pakistan’s story.”
Senator Butt termed the response in both New York and Washington to Pakistan’s concerns on held Kashmir and the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which India unilaterally held in abeyance after a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir, as “fantastic”.
“If the Indus Waters Treaty is overlooked today, then no treaty in the future will stand any ground,” she asserted.
 
 

Summarising the delegation’s stance, former caretaker foreign minister Jilani stated: “Our message was that India committed aggression and that Pakistan is a peaceful country.”
He reiterated Islamabad’s desire for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing issues between the two nations.
Pakistan has appeared to be aiming to draw the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Trump a “man of peace”, while Bilawal said it was “reasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us”.
Diplomatic contest
On June 4, the Bilawal-led delegation concluded its two-day visit to New York, where it met with United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres, along with elected and permanent members of the UN Security Council.
It then met with several US Congress members in Washington — including chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee — as well as think tanks.
 


Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, visited Moscow from June 2 to June 4. It met with Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and a senior aide to President Vladimir Putin.
On its part, India had also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, as well as meet members of the UNSC, to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.
On June 5, the Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance, taking advantage of his links to India.
 
 

Both delegations lobbied for their countries on Capitol Hill, meeting senior US lawmakers and chairs of various Congress committees.
The Indian delegation met members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, including senators Dave McCormick, Jacky Rosen, Jim Risch, Mark Warner, John Cornyn, and Elissa Slotkin.

Iranian state media reported on Saturday that Iranian intelligence agencies had obtained a large trove of sensitive Israeli documents. Khatib said these were related to Israel’s nuclear facilities and its relations with the United States, Europe and other countries, and to its defensive capabilities.
There was no immediate official comment from Israel.
It was not clear whether the information breach was linked to a reported hacking of an Israeli nuclear research centre last year, which Tehran is only disclosing now amid heightened tensions over its nuclear programme.
“The transfer of this treasure trove was time-consuming and required security measures. Naturally, the transfer methods will remain confidential but the documents should be unveiled soon,” Khatib said, adding that in terms of volume, “talking of thousands of documents would be an understatement.”
In 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israeli agents had seized a huge “archive” of Iranian documents that showed Tehran had done more nuclear work than previously known.
United States President Donald Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if Tehran does not come to an agreement with Washington over its nuclear programme. But Trump in April reportedly blocked a planned Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites in favour of negotiating a deal with Tehran.
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that abandoning uranium enrichment was “100 per cent” against Iran’s interests, rejecting a central US demand in talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
Western powers say Iran is refining uranium to a high degree of fissile purity close to the level suitable for atomic bomb fuel. Iran has long denied seeking nuclear weapons.</p><small>2025-06-08 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/081635117b62afb.jpg?r=163841' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916038/pope-leo-criticises-nationalist-politics-at-sunday-mass' target='_blank'><strong>Pope Leo criticises nationalist politics at Sunday Mass</strong></a><br><p>Pope Leo criticised the emergence of nationalist political movements on Sunday, calling them unfortunate, without naming a specific country or national leader.
Leo, the first pope from the United States, asked during a Mass with a crowd of tens of thousands in St Peter’s Square that God would “open borders, break down walls [and] dispel hatred”.
“There is no room for prejudice, for ‘security’ zones separating us from our neighbours, for the exclusionary mindset that, unfortunately, we now see emerging also in political nationalisms,” said the pontiff.
Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, was elected on May 8 to succeed the late Pope Francis as leader of the 1.4-billion-member Church.
Before becoming pontiff, Prevost was not shy about criticising US President Donald Trump, sharing numerous disapproving posts about him and Vice President JD Vance on X in recent years.
The Vatican has not confirmed the new pope’s ownership of the X account, which had the handle ‘drprevost’ and was deactivated after Leo’s election.
Francis, pope for 12 years, was a sharp critic of Trump. The late pope said in January that the president’s plan to deport millions of migrants in the US during his second term was a “disgrace.”
Earlier, Francis said Trump was “not Christian” because of his views on immigration.
“A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,” Francis said when asked about Trump in 2016.
Leo was celebrating a Mass for Pentecost, one of the Church’s most important holidays.</p><small>2025-06-08 11:43</small></div><hr>
