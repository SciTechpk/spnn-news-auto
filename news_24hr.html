Iranian media outlet Tehran Times reported that 100 missiles were fired at Israel from Shiraz in the initial phase.
“TV footages show that Israel’s capital Tel Aviv is in disarray and people seeking shelter as ballistic missiles are raining down on the occupied territories. The legitimate retaliatory attacks by Iran’s military is called ‘Operation True Promise 3’,” the report added.
 






It said the attack was launched as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was addressing the nation. Khamenei said that Israel initiated a war and said it will not be allowed to do “hit and run” attacks without grave consequences.
“The Zionist regime (Israel) will not remain unscathed from the consequences of its crime. The Iranian nation must be guaranteed that our response will not be half-measured,” Khamenei said in a statement
 






Khamenei said that Israel’s deadly attacks on his country will “bring it to ruin”, vowing retaliation.
“The armed forces of the Islamic Republic will inflict heavy blows upon this malevolent enemy,” Khamenei said, adding that the consequences of the Israeli attack “will bring it to ruin”.

Iran launches response as part of “Operation True Promise 3”
Israel launches more attacks in evening
Iran says top commanders, including Hossein Salami, killed
Israel says military intercepting drones fired from Iran in response
At least 95 casualties so far, including women and children
Iran’s supreme leader appoints new military commanders

Iran says at least six nuclear scientists killed in attacks


Iran’s state news agency IRNA said the attack was the “beginning of Iran’s crushing response to the Zionist regime”.
It added: “A decisive response to the brutal attack by the Zionist regime began minutes ago with the firing of hundreds of various ballistic missiles towards the occupied territories.”
 






Iran’s Revolutionary Guards said they launched an attack on dozens of targets in Israel.
“The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps … has executed its decisive and precise response against tens of targets, military centres and airbases of the usurping Zionist regime in the occupied territories,” the Guards said in a statement carried by state media.
The United States is helping Israel intercept Iranian missiles, Axios reported, citing a senior US official.
Al Jazeera reported citing Israeli newspaper Haaretz that as per emergency services, 15 people were wounded in central Israel, including one with moderate injuries.
Images on Israel’s Channel 12 showed what appeared to be a building hit by a missile.
Iranian news agency Mehr and IRNA reported that an Iranian missile hit Israel’s Ministry of War as well, the former citing Israel’s Channel 13.
 






Air raid sirens sounded in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and loud blasts were heard, AFP journalists reported, as the Israeli military said it had detected a missile launched from Iran.
“A short while ago, sirens sounded in several areas across Israel following the identification of missiles from Iran toward the State of Israel,” the military said in a statement, with AFP journalists reporting booms over Jerusalem, similar to those heard during past interceptions.
 






A thick plume of smoke billowed over the coastal Israeli city of Tel Aviv, an AFP journalist reported. The smoke towered over the city’s skyscrapers as blasts echoed across the city, the journalist said.
Israel’s military sirens sounded across the country after the new salvo of Iranian missiles was identified.
Israel’s Home Front Command application, used to warn the public of incoming projectiles, said that sirens sounded across the country.
 






Israel’s firefighting service said its teams were responding to several “major” incidents resulting from an Iranian missile attack, including efforts to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.
“Firefighting crews are handling several major incidents, mainly in the Dan region” around Tel Aviv, a statement said, adding that “firefighters are working in a high-rise building to rescue trapped individuals and extinguish a fire, as well as responding to two additional destruction sites. “
Later, the military said Israelis could leave protected spaces but urged them to stay nearby.
“Following the situational assessment, the Home Front Command published that it is now permitted to leave protected spaces in all areas across the country and to remain near them,” the military said in a statement.
Separately, Iranian state media also said the country’s forces downed two Israeli fighter jets during a massive Israeli air raid.
“At least two Israeli fighter jets were shot down in Iranian skies,” IRNA reported, without elaborating.
 






Iranian outlets Mehr and Tasnim reported that a female Israeli pilot was captured. However, Al Jazeera reported that Avichay Adraee, the Arabic spokesperson of the Israeli military, denied the reports.
Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran earlier today, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders, and that this was the start of a “prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon”.
Iran promised a harsh response and the Israeli military said Iran launched around 100 drones, with air defences intercepting them outside Israeli territory, while neighbouring Jordan said it targeted drones and missiles that violated its airspace.
But around 0800 GMT (1pm PKT), Israeli media said an order to citizens to remain near protected areas had been lifted, suggesting that most or all the drones had been neutralised.
In a letter to the United Nations, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the attack as a “declaration of war” and called on the UNSC to immediately address the issue, the ministry said.
Araghchi requested the meeting in a letter to the 15-member body, saying Israel “has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished”.
He wrote: “Iran reaffirms its inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter and will respond decisively and proportionately to these unlawful and cowardly acts.”
Article 51 of the UN Charter covers the individual or collective right of states to self-defence against armed attack.
An Israeli security source said Israeli Mossad commandos had operated deep inside the Islamic Republic before the attack and the Israeli spy agency and military had led a series of covert operations against Iran’s strategic missile array.

Israel also established an attack-drone base near Tehran, the source added.
The military said it had carried out a large-scale strike against Iran’s air defences, destroying “dozens of radars and surface-to-air missile launchers”. Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.

Evening attacks by Israel
The Iranian retaliation came some time after Tehran’s defence system intercepted fresh projectiles as several explosions were heard in the city and its surrounding areas in the evening, more than 12 hours after a massive wave of Israeli attacks on the country.
“There were reports of explosions heard in the west of Tehran province,” in the cities of Shahriar and Malard and around the neighbourhood of Chitgar in Tehran city, state news agency IRNA reported, while Mehr agency reported a blast in Pakdasht southeast of the capital.
 


IRNA said Tehran’s defences were activated. “News received indicates that enemy projectiles have been intercepted by Tehran’s defences,” it said in a post on X.
 


Meanwhile, the Mehr news agency said a “massive explosion” was heard in Isfahan, a major city in central Iran, in a province that is home to several nuclear facilities.
“A few minutes ago, a massive explosion was heard in Isfahan,” Mehr said without immediately elaborating.
The Israeli military said it struck Iran’s nuclear facility in Isfahan as it pressed on with its strikes on the Islamic Republic’s military and nuclear sites. “I can now confirm that we struck the nuclear facility in Isfahan. The operation is still ongoing,” military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin told journalists.
He said Israel had so far struck more than 200 targets across Iran since it began the wave of air strikes. “We are continuing to strike,” Defrin added.
The Israeli military said its strike on Iran’s nuclear facility in Isfahan dismantled infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium.
Israeli “fighter jets completed a strike on the Iranian regime’s nuclear site in the Isfahan area”, a military statement said, adding that “the strike dismantled a facility for producing metallic uranium, infrastructure for reconverting enriched uranium, laboratories, and additional infrastructure.”
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Iranian authorities said that nuclear sites at Fordow and Isfahan were struck in attacks.
“At present, the Iranian authorities are informing us of attacks on two other facilities, namely the Fordow fuel enrichment plant, and at Isfahan, [where a] fuel plate fabrication plant, a fuel manufacturing plant, a uranium conversion facility … are located,” Rafael Grossi told the UN Security Council.
However, Iran’s atomic energy agency said there was limited damage to the Fordow nuclear site south of Tehran and another site in the country’s centre after Israeli attacks.
“The damage was limited to areas that did not cause any urban damage in the case of Fordow … In Isfahan, there were also attacks on several points, which were related to warehouses that caught fire,” said agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, adding that “the damage was not extensive and there is no cause for concern in terms of contamination”.
Israel’s army chief said the military was keeping up “full force” to achieve its goals after launching the wave of strikes.
“We are continuing with full force, at a high pace, in order to meet the goals we have set for ourselves,” Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir said in a statement.
“There will be difficult moments, we need to be prepared for the range of scenarios we have planned for, very high readiness and discipline are required on the home front. “
The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting at 1900 GMT (12am PKT) following Israel’s wave of airstrikes, current presidency Guyana announced.
The meeting was requested by Iran, and supported by Russia and China, a diplomatic source told AFP.
Iran said Israel’s deadly strikes on its military and nuclear facilities were a “declaration of war” and called on the UNSC to act.
Iranian military leaders killed
Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said its top commander, Hossein Salami, had been killed and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Several children were killed in a strike on a residential area in the capital, they said.
At least 95 people were wounded in Israel’s attack and taken to medical centres in 12 different provinces that were targeted, national emergency services spokesperson Mojtaba Khaledi told state TV.
The IRGC confirmed later in the day that its aerospace commander had been killed with fellow officers in an Israeli air strike on their command centre.
“Commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps aerospace force Major General Amirali Hajizadeh … along with a group of brave and dedicated fighters of this force, were martyred” in an Israeli attack on their command centre, the Guards said in a statement.
 
 

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei swiftly appointed new Revolutionary Guards and armed forces chiefs to replace those killed.
In separate decrees, Khamenei named Mohammad Pakpour to replace Salami as IRGC commander and Abdolrahim Mousavi to replace Mohammad Bagheri as chief of the armed forces general staff. Major General Ali Shademani was appointed as the commander of the Khatam al-Anbia Headquarters.

Pakpour threatened to open “the gates of hell” in retaliation for Israel’s attacks that killed his predecessor.
“In retribution for the blood of our fallen commanders, scientists and citizens, the gates of hell will soon be opened upon this child-killing regime,” Pakpour said of Israel in a message carried by state news agency IRNA.
A senior adviser to Khamenei was wounded during the attack, state media reported.
“Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to the supreme leader… was injured in today’s attack by the Zionist regime,” according to state TV.
Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message: “We are at a decisive moment in Israel’s history.
“Moments ago, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”

Khamenei said in a statement that Israel had “unleashed its wicked and bloody” hand in a crime against Iran and that it would receive “a bitter fate for itself”.
An Israeli military official said Israel was striking “dozens” of nuclear and military targets, including the facility at Natanz in central Iran. The official claimed Iran had enough material to make 15 nuclear bombs within days.

The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil-producing region.
Iran’s foreign ministry summoned the ambassador of Switzerland, which represents US interests in Tehran, state media said.
“During the meeting, the Islamic Republic of Iran conveyed its deep outrage and strong protest over this act of aggression by Israel and the support extended to it by the United States,” IRNA reported.
Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel’s Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, Axios reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Iran’s strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.
At least six nuclear scientists were killed in Israel’s attacks, media outlets in the Islamic Republic reported.
Iran’s Tasnim news agency named the six scientists, including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran. Fereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, was also among the scientists killed, it added.
The organisation added that most of the damage from Israeli air strikes targeting its underground uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was at ground level.
“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said the organisation’s spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, adding that there had been “no casualties” at the facility where the enrichment centrifuges are housed underground.
A fresh round of explosions was heard in northwestern Iran, state television reported, following Israel’s wave of early morning strikes on multiple cities.
“A few minutes ago, new explosions were heard in East Azerbaijan,” the broadcaster said, as the Tasnim news agency said an earlier wave of strikes had hit 10 sites in the province, killing at least three people.
The death toll from Israeli strikes in northwestern Iran increased to 18, state media reported, revising an earlier figure of eight dead.
“So far, as a result of this brutal aggression, 18 individuals have attained martyrdom and 35 of our fellow citizens have been injured,” IRNA quoted East Azerbaijan provincial authorities as saying, reporting attacks on 11 locations in the province.
A loud blast was heard later in the afternoon near a military airbase in Iran’s western Hamedan province, state media reported.
“A few hours ago, a loud blast was heard near Hamedan,” more than 300 kilometres from Tehran, the IRNA state news agency said, adding that “it was heard near the Nojeh airbase”.
Meanwhile, Israel’s embassy to Sweden said that Israel would close its diplomatic missions around the world in light of recent developments and that consular services would not be provided. It did not say how long the missions would be closed.
Pezeshkian administration: Iran will write the ending to this story
The administration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has released a statement, announcing that Iran will avenge the blood of every single individual killed in Israeli strikes, IRNA reported.
“With a savage regime as this,” the statement read, referring to Israel, “one shall not speak but with the language of power.”
“As of this moment, the Islamic Republic of Iran’s government has begun the necessary defensive, political and legal measures to make the illegitimate Israel regret [its aggression] and will deny the Israelis a moment’s rest,” it said.
“The world now better understands Iran’s insistence on its right to enrichment and nuclear technology and missile power.”
Iran has in the past 200 years never started a war, the statement said, but would not hesitate for a second to defend itself.
“The ending to this story will be written by Iran.”
Pezeshkian said that Iran would make Israel “regret” its deadly attack.
“The Iranian nation and the country’s officials will not remain silent in the face of this crime, and the legitimate and powerful response of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make the enemy regret its foolish act,” Pezeshkian said in a video statement aired on state TV.

Trump urges Iran to make a deal
US President Donald Trump urged Iran to “make a deal”, warning that there will be more “death and destruction” after Israel launched the deadly strikes.
“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left … just do it before it’s too late,” he said.
He said there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.
“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
Speaking to ABC News, Trump added the Israeli attack on Iran was “excellent” and warned there was much more to come.
“I think it’s been excellent. We gave them a chance and they didn’t take it. They got hit hard, very hard. They got hit about as hard as you’re going to get hit. And there’s more to come. A lot more,” Trump was quoted as saying by an ABC reporter on X.
The outlet reported that when asked if the US participated in the attack in any way, Trump responded by saying, “I don’t want to comment on that.”
 






Trump told Reuters in a phone interview that it was unclear if Iran still has a nuclear programme following Israeli strikes on the country.
Trump told Reuters the US still has nuclear talks planned with Iran on Sunday, but that he is not sure if they will still take place. He said it was not too late for Iran to make a deal.
“I tried to save Iran humiliation and death,” Trump said.
He said he is not concerned about a regional war breaking out as a result of Israel’s strikes.
Earlier in the day, Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with Fox News after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.
“We will see,” Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.
Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday that an Israeli strike on Iran “could very well happen” but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.
The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told Reuters.
Iran’s armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally, the US, would pay a “heavy price” for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.
While the US tried to distance itself from Israel’s military operation, an Israeli official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the country was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.
“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said in a statement.
“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,” he added.
 






The State Department issued an advisory saying that all US government employees in Israel and their family members should “shelter in place until further notice”.
Lebanese group Hezbollah condemned Israel’s wave of strikes, warning that they threaten to “ignite the region”.
“This enemy adheres to no logic or laws and knows only the language of killing, fire, and destruction,” Hezbollah said in a statement that condemned the strikes as a “brutal” aggression.
UN nuclear watchdog chief ready to travel to Iran to assess situation
UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said he was ready to travel to Iran to assess the situation there after Israel’s strikes hit the sprawling nuclear complex at Natanz.
In a statement to a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors, Grossi said the other main enrichment centre in Iran, Fordow, was not hit, and neither was another nuclear facility in Esfahan, citing Iranian authorities.
There are no elevated radiation levels at Natanz, he added.
“I call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. I reiterate that any military action that jeopardises the safety and security of nuclear facilities risks grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region, and beyond,” Grossi said in his statement.
“I have indicated to the respective authorities my readiness to travel at the earliest to assess the situation and ensure safety, security and non-proliferation in Iran.”
He did not say what the extent of the damage at Natanz was or what parts of the site were hit. The site includes a vast underground uranium enrichment plant and a smaller, above-ground pilot enrichment plant.
Iran is enriching to up to 60 per cent purity, close to the roughly 90pc of weapons-grade, at the pilot plant, but it is producing smaller quantities of that material there than at Fordow, a site dug into a mountain that military experts have said would be difficult for Israel to destroy through bombardment.
“Despite the current military actions and heightened tensions, it is clear that the only sustainable path forward — for Iran, for Israel, the entire region, and the international community — is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability, and cooperation,” Grossi said.
Earlier today, Grossi said that nuclear facilities “must never be attacked”.
The UN nuclear watchdog said that Iranian authorities told it that no increase in radiation levels was observed at the Natanz uranium enrichment site following Israeli strikes.
“Iranian authorities have informed the IAEA … that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a post on X, after earlier confirming that the facility was “among targets” of the strikes.
 






It added that Iran’s only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr had not been targeted.
An exceptional meeting of the watchdog’s Board of Governors will be held on Monday to discuss Israel’s strikes after at least one country on the board requested one at Friday’s regular, quarterly session of the body, diplomats said.
Any country on the board of the IAEA can call a meeting under its rules.
Iran, which is not on the board, requested a meeting and its call was supported by board members Russia, China and Venezuela, diplomats said. The diplomats gave differing accounts as to which board member was the first to clearly make the request.
The meeting will start at 10am (0800 GMT) on Monday, diplomats at Friday’s closed-door meeting said before any public announcement of the emergency meeting.
There was no sign of any push for a resolution or other action on Monday by the 35-nation board, said the IAEA’s top policymaking body.
However, Iran’s atomic energy organisation confirmed in a statement that its nuclear facility in Natanz had been damaged, but investigations had not shown any radioactive or chemical contamination outside the site.
“The attack has damaged several parts of the facility. Investigations are ongoing to assess the extent of damages,” the statement said.
 






Meanwhile, Israel’s neighbouring country Jordan’s military said it intercepted drones and missiles that had violated the kingdom’s airspace.
“Royal Air Force aircraft and air defence systems intercepted on Friday morning a number of missiles and drones that entered Jordanian airspace,” a military statement said.
Air raid sirens sounded in the Jordanian capital after Israel’s attack on Iran, while the public security directorate urged people to stay at home.
“Adhere to the guidelines and stay in your homes,” said an announcement on loudspeakers in Amman.
Jordan had earlier said it would not allow its airspace to be violated and vowed not to become a “battleground” in any regional conflict. “Jordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,” government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told AFP.
The government condemned Israel’s attack, with foreign ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah warning of “the consequences of such escalatory actions”.
Jordan also called the attack “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of a United Nations member state and a clear breach of international law and the UN Charter”.
Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel’s air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.
“Following the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.
Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and “prepared across all borders”.
“We are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,” he said.
Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding a “marathon of calls” with counterparts around the world regarding Israel’s attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which condemned Israel’s strikes, with the Foreign Office calling it “unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned “in the strongest possible terms today’s unprovoked attack on Iran by Israel”.
“I convey my deepest sympathies to the Iranian people on the loss of lives in this attack. This grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further destabilising an already volatile region,” he said in a post on X.
“We urge the international community and the United Nations to take urgent steps to prevent any further escalation that could imperil regional and global peace.”
 






Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar condemned the blatant Israeli aggression and reiterated Pakistan’s strong support for Iran in a telephonic conversation with FM Bagchi.
 






The National Assembly also unanimously passed a resolution against Israel’s attack on Iran, which was jointly presented by the government and opposition.

The attacks triggered sharp falls in stock prices in Asian trade on Friday, led by a selloff in US futures, while oil prices jumped as investors scurried to safe havens such as gold and the Swiss franc.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned any military escalation in the Middle East, said deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.
“The secretary general asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford,” Haq said.
Flight disruptions, airspace closure

Emirates airline said flights to and from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Iran had been cancelled after Israel’s strikes sparking concerns of a wider escalation.
Several flights scheduled for Friday and one Tehran flight on Saturday were listed as cancelled on the airline’s website, with the Dubai International Airport also reporting that “some flights at [DXB] and DWC — Al Maktoum International have been cancelled or delayed due to airspace closures over Iran, Iraq, and Syria” in a statement on X.

The United Arab Emirates capital’s international airport warned of flight disruptions.
“Flight disruptions are expected through today at Zayed International Airport. Passengers are advised to check with their airline for the latest status of their flights before travelling to the airport,” the Abu Dhabi airport said in a statement on X.
 






Qatar Airways said it had temporarily cancelled flights to Iran and Iraq “due to [the] current situation in the region”, the airline said in a statement.
German airline Lufthansa also said it had suspended all flights to and from Tehran.
“Lufthansa Group flights to and from Tehran will be suspended until further notice due to the current situation,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding it would also avoid Iranian, Iraqi and Israeli airspace for now.
Air France said it was suspending its flights to and From Tel Aviv “until further notice” and was “closely monitoring the situation in the Middle East in real-time,” a spokesman for the French airline told AFP, adding that “the safety of its customers and crews is its absolute priority.”
Air India diverted or called back 16 flights between India and London and cities in Canada and the United States “due to the emerging situation in Iran”.
The New Delhi-Vienna and Mumbai-London flights were about to enter Iranian airspace when Israel launched its attack, forcing the planes to turn back to their origin, according to aircraft tracker Flight Aware.
Iraq also closed its airspace. “The ministry of transport closes Iraqi airspace and suspends air traffic at all Iraqi airports,” the Iraq News Agency reported.
It filed a complaint later with the UN Security Council over Israel’s “violation of Iraqi airspace” in a major attack on Iran, Baghdad’s foreign ministry said.
“These practices constitute a flagrant violation of Iraq’s sovereignty,” the ministry said, calling on “the Security Council to assume its responsibilities” and act to “prevent the recurrence of such violations”.
Nuclear talks
US and Iranian officials were scheduled to hold a sixth round of talks on Tehran’s escalating uranium enrichment programme in Oman on Sunday, according to officials from both countries and their Omani mediators.
A US official said those talks were still scheduled to proceed despite the Israeli attack.
The Israeli military said that it was forced to act based on new intelligence information showing that Iran was “approaching the point of no return” in the development of a nuclear weapon.
“In recent months, this programme has accelerated significantly, bringing the regime significantly closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” it said in a statement, without disclosing the purported evidence.
A source familiar with US intelligence reports said there had been no recent change in the US intelligence assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei had not authorised the restarting of the nuclear weapons programme that was shuttered in 2003.

The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the clandestine nature of the operations, described secret and lengthy preparations that went into an attack that sent oil prices sharply higher on fears of regional escalation.
Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.
Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters shortly before the attack had been dismissive about any imminent action and repeatedly said talk of strikes was just “psychological pressure” to influence US-Iranian nuclear negotiations that were due on Sunday.
Iran has not given a detailed account of what its Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called “unlawful and cowardly attacks”, but it has promised a harsh response. Iran’s mission at the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Israel’s covert operation and other subterfuge related to the attacks.
Ahead of the strike, Israel gave the impression its focus was still on US diplomacy towards a nuclear deal with Iran, briefing journalists that its spy chief would go to Washington before the next negotiations.
Instead, Israel said it sent 200 warplanes to conduct a wave of air strikes across Iran before dawn on Friday, hitting nuclear facilities and missile factories, and killing military commanders and nuclear scientists, in a culmination of its efforts to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
Iran says its nuclear programme is purely civilian.
The Israeli security source said Israel’s military and Mossad had worked for years on the intelligence needed for the strikes, which killed the commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps among others.
 
 

The security source said Mossad commandos had covertly deployed weapons across Iran, including explosive drones that were launched at a surface-to-surface missile base near Tehran.
The Mossad commandos also fired precision-guided weapons systems at Iranian surface-to-air missile systems as the Israeli attack got underway, reducing the threat to Israeli warplanes.
A grainy black and white video distributed by Mossad showed what it said was the organisation’s operational force — two camouflaged figures crouched in what looks like desert terrain, deploying the precision weapons system meant to destroy Iran’s air defence systems.
Some of the operation’s components would have taken years to be put together, said Sima Shine, a former chief Mossad analyst and now a researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies (INSS).
The decision to strike Iran was made on Monday, the same day Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump spoke by phone, when Netanyahu, Defence Minister Israel Katz and military chief Eyal Zamir decided the operation would begin on Friday, said a second source, an Israeli defence official.
Their discussion was held after the conversation between Trump and Netanyahu, a third official, close to Netanyahu, said.
Press briefings
The final green light was given by Netanyahu’s security cabinet, which convened on Thursday night.
In the days leading up to the strikes, Israel played out a ploy to create the impression an attack was not imminent, according to a fourth source, also an Israeli official.
False reports suggesting that a rift between Israel and the United States had emerged during Netanyahu and Trump’s phone call on Monday were not denied, the fourth source said.
A press release about a visit by Katz, Zamir and the head of Israel’s Air Force Tomer Bar to an air force base mentioned Gaza, Yemen and Lebanon — but not Iran.
The fourth source said that the ruse included misleading information given in press briefings. As the attack unfolded in the early hours of Friday, some Israeli journalists pointed to one such briefing, according to which Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer and Mossad Head David Barnea were to be sent to Washington ahead of the next round of nuclear talks on Sunday.
Dermer later appeared seated with Netanyahu at Israel’s defence headquarters bunker in Tel Aviv, in a video distributed by the prime minister’s office.
A fifth, military source said that Israel had been able to surprise Iran but since the operation was not over, there could be “difficult days” ahead.
Iran, which fired ballistic missiles at Israel when they traded blows last year, has promised “harsh punishment” in response to the attack. Israel said it had intercepted many of the 100 drones launched towards Israeli territory in retaliation.</p><small>2025-06-13 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1320382771658ab.jpg?r=213144' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916940/gilani-says-no-connection-with-massive-hike-in-salaries-of-senate-chairman-na-speaker' target='_blank'><strong>Gilani says ‘no connection’ with massive hike in salaries of Senate chairman, NA speaker</strong></a><br><p>Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani on Friday distanced himself from the massive hike in the salaries of senior parliamentarians including himself, saying he was not consulted before the raise was approved.
The government recently approved a fivefold increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and National Assembly speaker, taking it to Rs1.3 million a month. A May 29 notification revealed that the Senate chairman and NA speaker’s salaries have been raised from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3m, besides 50pc of the revised salary (Rs650,000) as the sumptuary allowance. The hike will take effect from January 2025.
“I have full respect for the defence minister. I have nothing to do with my salary increase,” Gilani told reporters at the Senate building when asked about the hike amid an economic crisis and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s criticism of the move.
The PPP stalwart said the decision regarding the raise will be made by the government. When asked if he would refuse the salary hike, he replied, “I didn’t say about withdrawing. I have no connection with it.”
Gilani added he was not consulted when the hike was approved.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has taken notice of the increase in the salaries of the National Assembly speaker and Senate chairman and sought a report from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.
The decision has drawn criticism from within the ruling PML-N as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif publicly criticised the move. In a post on X, the senior PML-N leader termed the massive hike in salaries a “financial obscenity, urging lawmakers to “keep in mind the life of a common man.”
During an appearance on Geo TV show ‘Capital Talk’ hosted by Hamid Mir, the defence minister defended his stance, saying that while the hike will not have a significant financial impact, it reflected poorly on the image of the ruling elite and the parliament.
He said the salary hike was approved by the National Assembly’s finance committee despite government resistance. When asked if the prime minister opposed the move, Asif said it was “logical” to assume so. He added that the salary increase was not included in the budget.
The defence minister said the ruling elite should practice austerity and simplicity, noting that the prime minister does not receive a salary and poses no burden on the exchequer. However, Asif defended the increased expenditures of the President’s House and PM’s Office.
On the other hand, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb defended the steep hikes in the salaries of parliamentarians.
During the post-budget press conference on Wednesday, he insisted the hikes should be seen in the context that the salaries were last adjusted in 2016, compared to annual increases in the wages of employees in public and private sectors in line with inflation and other factors.
“Had these been adjusted on an an­­n­ual basis, there would have been no sudden jump,” he said.
Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique had earlier slammed the pay raise, calling it “incomprehensible” and lacking moral justification.
In a post on X, Rafique said: “A sudden increase of many times in the salaries of the Chairman Senate and Speaker National Assembly and a 50 per cent increase in allowance is an incomprehensible move.”</p><small>2025-06-13 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609059-indias-suspension-of-iwt-threatens-regional-peace-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>India's suspension of IWT threatens regional peace: Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

A former student killed ten people and himself at a secondary school in Graz on Tuesday in the worst school shooting in Austria’s modern history, sending shockwaves through the country which declared three days of national mourning.
In a statement, the Foreign Office said it was “deeply saddened by the tragic shooting at the secondary school in Graz that resulted in several casualties with many injured.”
The foreign office extended “deepest condolences to the families and loved ones and wish a swift and full recovery for the injured.”
“Pakistan stands with the people and government of Austria in this hour,” the statement added.
Introvert, online shooting games
Austrian police described the shooter as an introvert who had largely withdrawn from the outside world before he carefully planned the attack, Reuters reported.
Police found discarded plans for a bomb attack and a non-functional pipe bomb during a search of his home after the shooting in Graz, the capital of the state of Styria.
Police are still trying to establish a motive, but Michael Lohnegger, head of Styria’s criminal investigation office, said findings indicated the man was very introverted and that his great passion was online first-person shooting games.
“He led an extremely withdrawn life, he didn’t want to take part in activities in normal life outside in the real world, he preferred to withdraw into the virtual space,” Lohnegger told reporters.
Police said the rampage at the school lasted about seven minutes and that the man shot himself in the head in a toilet about 10 minutes after beginning the attack. A few minutes earlier, the man entered the school with a rucksack, and then went into a bathroom to prepare for his assault.
The shooter posted on social media from the building just before he shot dead 10 people and then killed himself this week, Austrian newspapers reported on Friday.
Newspapers Heute and Kronen Zeitung published details of a photo the young man apparently took inside a toilet cubicle with a timestamp minutes before police said the attack began in the school in Graz, a city in the southern state of Styria. The photo was published on X, they said.
Kronen Zeitung said the man had an interest in the 1999 US Columbine school massacre in Colorado carried out by two teenage shooters and that he apparently used a photo of one of the pair on his profile with his online gaming pseudonym.
Heute said the man had also published pictures of the pistol and the shotgun he would go on to use during the shooting on other social media.
Police have been scouring the perpetrator’s electronic devices, and said on Thursday that they had not discovered any video of the high school shooting on his mobile phone. The shooter was an introverted fan of online shooting games, criminal investigators said.</p><small>2025-06-13 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609023-sindh-announces-12-salary-hike-8-pension-increase' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh announces 12% salary hike, 8% pension increase</strong></a><br><p>

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision does not mean that the court will ultimately agree with Trump, but it does leave the command of the Guard with the president for now.
Earlier on Thursday, San Francisco-based US District Judge Charles Breyer found that Trump’s deployment of the Guard was unlawful. Breyer’s 36-page ruling had ordered the National Guard to return to the control of California Governor Gavin Newsom, who had brought the case.
It was a short-lived victory for Newsom, as Breyer’s order was paused about two and a half hours later. Asked for a comment, Newsom’s press office referred to the governor’s statement after the initial ruling and noted that the appeals court put a temporary pause on the ruling but did not reverse it.
“I’m confident, on the basis of the review of the 36 pages — absolutely it will stand,” Newsom said of the district judge’s order. Trump welcomed the ruling in a social media post on Friday.
The three-judge appeals court panel consisted of two judges appointed by Trump in his first term and one judge who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden. The panel said it would hold a hearing on Tuesday to consider the merits of Breyer’s order.
The court’s action called an administrative stay, gives the appeals judges additional time to consider the Trump administration’s request to block Breyer’s order while litigation in the case continues.
Trump summoned the National Guard on Saturday in response to protests that had broken out over immigration raids, then on Monday ordered the US Marines to support the Guard.
A battalion of 700 US Marines is expected to arrive on Friday, marking an extraordinary use of military forces to support civilian police operations within the United States.
The troops have stood guard at a federal detention centre in downtown Los Angeles where many of the protests have taken place in a show of solidarity for immigrants detained inside. The protests so far have been mostly peaceful, punctuated by incidents of violence, and restricted to a few city blocks.
The Guard had also accompanied Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on operations to detain immigrants.
In his ruling, Breyer wrote that the presence of the troops in the city was itself inflaming tensions with protesters — a contention made by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, among others — and depriving the state of the ability to use the Guard for other purposes.
Mayor wants ICE out of LA
Bass on Thursday called on ICE officers to stand down from the intensified series of raids that led to the protests, saying the local economy could be harmed as immigrants stayed home from work and school for fear of being snatched off the streets.
“The peace that we need to have happen needs to begin in Washington, and we need to stop the raids,” Bass told a press conference as supporters flanking her broke out in a chant of “Stop the raids.”
“Peace begins with ICE leaving Los Angeles,” said Bass, who has imposed a nighttime curfew over one square mile (2.5 square km) of downtown LA.
Bass spoke after Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem pledged to “liberate” Los Angeles at a press conference that was dramatically interrupted when federal agents dragged Democratic US Senator Alex Padilla out of the room, forced him to the ground and handcuffed him.
The court battle and press conference scuffle underscored the political polarisation generated by Trump’s hardline approach to immigration enforcement and expansive use of presidential power.
Trump is carrying out a campaign promise to deport immigrants, employing forceful tactics consistent with the norm-breaking political style that got him elected twice. Democrats have said the use of military force was unnecessary and an example of Trump’s authoritarianism.
Between the rulings, Newsom said the National Guard would be redeployed to its previous tasks, including border security, preparing for wildfires and countering drug smuggling.
But the Trump administration immediately appealed the judge’s order, calling Breyer’s ruling “an extraordinary intrusion on the President’s constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.”
Trump justified the deployment of troops by characterizing the protests in Los Angeles as a “rebellion,” but Breyer said in his temporary restraining order that the protests fell far short of that legal standard.
“The Court is troubled by the implication inherent in Defendants’ argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion,” Breyer wrote.
Trump on Friday reiterated his comments that if he had not ordered the National Guard the city would be in flames, writing: “We saved LA.”</p><small>2025-06-13 13:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/131410194f3f951.jpg?r=154613' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916920/a-timeline-of-the-long-standing-conflict-between-israel-and-iran' target='_blank'><strong>A timeline of the long-standing conflict between Israel and Iran</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s recent strikes on Iranian military and nuclear sites — including the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz — have marked a significant escalation in tensions between the two countries and the Middle East. This is not the first time Israel has taken pre-emptive action against Iranian nuclear infrastructure. For years, the two states have been engaged in a complex and often covert conflict involving cyber operations, proxy engagements, and targeted killings.
Disputes over Iran’s nuclear activities — which Tehran maintains are for peaceful purposes — have long shaped the relationship. Israel has consistently called for international pressure on Iran, while the latter has rejected allegations of seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

From deadly bombings in Buenos Aires in the early 1990s, to the cyberattack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility using the Stuxnet virus, assassinations of key Iranian nuclear scientists, and now the retaliatory missile exchanges of 2024–2025, the two countries have been locked in a high-stakes regional conflict with global repercussions.
Here is a timeline of key events tracing the covert and open hostilities that have defined the Iran–Israel confrontation over the past decade:
August 2019
Israel carried out a series of attacks in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq — all of Iran’s allies — claiming it was to prevent them from equipping themselves with sophisticated weapons.
It accused Tehran of trying to establish an arms supply line through Iraq and northern Syria into Lebanon. During the same year, Israel also attacked ships carrying Iranian oil and weapons through the sea, according to the New York Times.
January 2020
General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Quds force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC’s) and the architect of its security apparatus, was killed in a US airstrike near Baghdad International Airport. The US has traditionally been Israel’s staunchest ally and has echoed its calls against Iran’s nuclear programme. As a result of the airstrike, Soleimani died alongside Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and several others.

The White House and the Pentagon confirmed that the “killing” of Soleimani in Iraq was ordered by US President Donald Trump as a preemptive action to deter future attacks allegedly being planned by Iran. The Pentagon said Soleimani had been “actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region”. It said it took “decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani,” but did not specify how.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed Soleimani as a “martyr”, and vowed that a “vigorous revenge is waiting for the criminals”  behind the killing.
Iran struck back in retaliation with missile attacks on Iraqi bases housing American troops. About 100 US military personnel were injured.
March 2021
By the beginning of 2021, Iran and Israel had increasingly begun attacking each other at sea.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, accused Iran of being behind a February explosion on an Israeli-owned ship transporting vehicles sailing off the coast of Oman. Iran accused Israel of targeting an Iranian cargo ship about 50 miles off the coast of Israel.
The Wall Street Journal cited US and Middle East officials reporting that Israel, in the same year, targeted at least a dozen vessels travelling to Syria and, in most cases, transporting Iranian petrol, according to AFP.
April 2021
Iran blamed Israel for a mysterious explosion that knocked out power at its uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, BBC reported.
Israel did not publicly accept that it was behind what Iran called “an act of sabotage”, but US and Israeli media reports quoted officials as saying it was carried out by Israel’s overseas intelligence agency, Mossad.
Iran vowed to take revenge “at a time of its choosing”.
November 2021
Iran’s high-ranking nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was shot “by terrorists” in an ambush near Tehran. At the time of his death, he was serving as head of the Research and Innovation Organisation within Iran’s Ministry of Defence.
Fakhrizadeh had long been suspected by Western, Israeli and Iranian exile foes of masterminding what they alleged was a covert programme to develop nuclear weapons. Iran had consistently denied pursuing nuclear arms, insisting its nuclear activities were for peaceful purposes.

Netanyahu had previously claimed that after the closure of Project AMAD — Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons programme — Fakhrizadeh continued to work on “special projects” within the Defence Ministry.
Following the assassination, Iran’s then-foreign minister condemned the killing as an act of terrorism and accused Israel of carrying out the operation. A spokesperson for Netanyahu declined to comment when approached by AFP.
In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council, Iran’s envoy Majid Takht Ravanchi warned against “any adventuristic measures by the United States and Israel against his country, particularly during the remaining period of the current administration of the United States in office.” referring to Trump’s final weeks in office. He stated that Iran reserved the right to take “all necessary measures” in self-defence.
Fakhrizadeh’s assassination took place less than two months before Joe Biden was to take office as US president.
Biden had promised a return to diplomacy with Iran after four hawkish years under  Trump, who withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and began reimposing crippling sanctions.
July 2022
US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed a new security pact aimed at reinforcing their united stance against Iran. As part of the agreement, the United States pledged it would “never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon” and vowed to use “all” elements of American power to prevent the Islamic Republic from doing so.
Lapid stated that the only measure capable of stopping Iran was knowing that if they continued to develop their nuclear programme, “the free world would use force”.
In response, Iran’s ultra-conservative President Ebrahim Raisi warned the US and its allies that Tehran “would not accept any crisis or insecurity in the region”.
December 2023
An Israeli airstrike outside the Syrian capital Damascus killed a senior adviser in the IRGC, Sayyed Razi Mousavi. He was responsible for coordinating the military alliance between Syria and Iran, according to Reuters.
According to Iran’s ambassador in Damascus, Hossein Akbari, Mousavi was posted at the embassy as a diplomat and was killed by Israeli missiles after returning home from work.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called it a “show of weakness” on Israel’s part.
The IRGC warned that Israel would suffer for killing Mousavi, who held the Guards’ rank of brigadier-general.
April 2024
A suspected Israeli airstrike on the main Iranian embassy compound in Damascus killed seven officer of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), including two senior commanders — Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and his deputy, General Mohammad Hadi Hajriahimi. Several other IRGC military advisers were in the building.
The attack marked the first time the vast embassy compound itself had been hit, and it came amid soaring tensions over Tel Aviv’s war in Gaza.

Israel neither confirmed nor denied responsibility. However, a senior Israeli government official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said those hit had “been behind many attacks on Israeli and American assets and had plans for additional attacks”.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian called for a “serious response by the international community”, while Iran vowed to take revenge.
In retaliation, the IRGC launched what it described as “extensive” drone and missile strikes against “certain targets” inside Israel under the name Operation True Promise. On April 13, Iran carried out a direct attack on Israeli territory using a barrage of drones and missiles. Its regional proxies and allied groups also launched coordinated attacks on Israeli positions.
In response, Israel conducted a direct strike on the Iranian city of Isfahan on April 19, according to multiple sources. Tehran, however, downplayed the incident and indicated it had no immediate plans for retaliation.
July 2024
Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran amid the Israel-Gaza conflict, hours after he attended a swearing-in ceremony for Iran’s new president. Haniyeh’s bodyguards were also killed in their residence in Tehran.
Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri called it “a grave escalation” aimed at breaking the will of Hamas.

Khamenei threatened “harsh punishment” for Haniyeh’s killing, saying: “We consider it our duty to seek revenge for his blood as he was martyred in the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”
Initially, Israel did not comment on the killing. Later, in December, Israel’s defence minister for the first time admitted to Israel’s role in killing Hamas’s political leader, according to BBC.
September 2024
Israel killed Hezbollah leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, in an airstrike in Beirut’s southern suburbs on September 27.  Nasrallah was a leading figure in the Tehran-backed “Axis of Resistance”, helping to project Iranian influence across the Middle East.
General Abbas Nilforoushan, deputy commander of the Guards’ operations, died in the same strike, according to IRNA news agency.
 






The Israeli military admitted in a statement that Nasrallah was eliminated along with another top Hezbollah leader — Ali Karaki — and other commanders in a “targeted strike” on the group’s underground headquarters under a residential building in Dahiyeh — a Hezbollah-controlled southern suburb of Beirut.
Soon after, Israeli military posted on X saying, “Hassan Nasrallah will no longer be able to terrorise the world.”
 






While in Tehran, posters of Nasrallah were erected bearing the slogan “Hezbollah is alive”.
October 2024
Tensions between the two regional arch-rivals came to a head when Iran launched what it described as a barrage of missiles at targets within Israel. Although Israel claimed it destroyed most of the projectiles before they impacted, several missiles did hit various areas across the country, although no widespread loss of life was reported.
Tehran had claimed at the time that the attack was a response to the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, IRGC commander Abbas Nilfor­oushan, as well as the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.
On October 26, 2024, Israel bombed military targets in Iran, killing four servicemen, in retaliation for the Islamic republic’s barrage of around 200 missiles against Israel on October 1.
June 2025
Israel launched widescale attacks on several Iranian nuclear facilities and military sites, and carried out assassinations of top military officials and nuclear scientists, as part of their launch of Operation Rising Lion — a targeted military operation aimed at rolling  back what it called the “Iranian threat to Israeli survival.” Israeli officials described it as the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from developing an atomic weapon.
Iranian state media have reported the killing of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) top commander Hossein Salami, as well as nuclear scientists Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi in the strike.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned that Israel and its chief ally would pay a ‘heavy price’ for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation. He said Israel would face a “bitter and painful” fate in its aftermath.
Israeli military Chief of Staff, Eyal Zamir, said Israel had reached a “point of no return” with the operation, which began early Friday.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the United States was not involved in the strikes and that Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence. However, an Israeli official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.</p><small>2025-06-13 12:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/13165750c2c7db7.png?r=165930' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916931/pakistans-cities-sizzle-under-extreme-hot-weather-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s cities sizzle under extreme hot weather: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The country experienced extremely hot and dry weather on Friday with the perceived or ‘Feels Like’ temperature crossing 50 degrees Celsius in four cities.
Cities in Punjab recorded reported high temperature exceeding 40°C amid no let-up in the extreme heatwave that has engulfed the country since last week. The heatwave could subside as the Met Office has forecast gusty winds and rain in the northern and central parts of the country from Friday (today) to Monday.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, the highest current temperature was recorded in Sibbi at 47°C with extremely hot and dry weather and humidity levels of seven per cent.
Karachi recorded a temperature of 39°C at 2pm with a humidity level of 48pc. However, the perceived temperature was recorded at 50.4°C. The Met Office heat index warns of danger with probable risk of heatstroke, cramps, and exhaustion at temperatures from 41-54°C.
 






The temperature in Bahawalpur was recorded as 46°C, but the perceived temperature reached 55.8°C — the highest in the country. The heat index warns of “extreme danger” with imminent risk of heatstroke at temperatures above 54°C.
Cities recorded the following current temperatures: Faisalabad (46°C), Sargodha (46°C), Dera Ismail Khan (45°C), Multan (45°C), Lahore (44°C), Sialkot (43°C), Islamabad (43°C),  Rawalpindi (42°C),  Peshawar (41°C), Muzaffarabad (40°C), Quetta (35°C) and Gilgit (30°C).
However, the perceived temperature in Sialkot and Lahore was 51.4°C and 51.1°C, respectively. Other cities also reported hot weather with the ‘Feel likes’ temperature in DI Khan at 49.6°C, 48.4°C in Faisalabad and Sargodha, Multan with 47.9°C, Islamabad with 44.4°C and Rawalpindi with 41.2°C.
Several parts of Pakistan are currently experiencing an intense spell of extreme heat, with temperatures soaring well above normal across many regions.

The 12th session of Pak-UAE JMC is being held following a hiatus of 13 years after it was scheduled in October 2024. The 11th session was held in Islamabad from 6-7 November 2013.
“Dar chaired a high-level meeting that discussed advancing key bilateral initiatives, formalising collaboration in existing sectors, exploring new avenues for cooperation, and attracting mutually beneficial UAE investments in priority areas,” the FO statement said.
“The deputy prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to strengthening Pak-UAE economic and trade relations.”
 






The meeting was attended by federal secretaries of economic affairs, commerce, maritime affairs, interior, inter-provincial coordination, national heritage, and health, along with senior officials from relevant ministries and departments, and special assistant Tariq Bajwa.
The UAE is Pakistan’s third largest trading partner after China and the United States, is home to more than a million Pakistani expatriates, and is the second-largest source of remittances to the South Asian country after Saudi Arabia.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE Faisal Tirmizi earlier this year said that the bilateral trade between Pakistan and the UAE exceeded US$10.9 billion in the fiscal year 2023–24, including goods and services.
The envoy also disclosed that remittances from the Pakistani community in the UAE reached $6.7 bn in 2024. He noted that during the period July 2024 to January 2025, goods trade rose by 21.63pc, with Pakistan’s exports growing by 7.53 per cent, indicating sustained momentum in economic engagement.
According to Ambassador Tirmizi, goods trade in 2023–24 reached $8.41 bn, with Pakistan’s exports rising by 41.06pc to $2.08 bn, while imports from the UAE declined by 14.45pc to $6.33 bn, resulting in a 28.28pc reduction in the trade deficit. In the services sector, total trade stood at $2.56 bn, marking a 20.54pc year-on-year increase.
He added that there were 19 Emirati companies currently operating in Pakistan and the UAE had invested significantly in key sectors such as communications, services, tourism, information technology, oil and gas, housing, banking, and real estate.
A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his official one-day visit to the Gulf state, where he discussed matters of bilateral and regional interest.
The high-level engagement aimed at reaffirming Pakistan’s gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad’s position during its recent standoff with New Delhi.
PM Shehbaz conveyed his sincere gratitude to the UAE leadership for its “constructive role” in helping defuse tensions during the recent conflict between Pakistan and India. He appreciated the UAE’s positive role in promoting peace, dialogue and stability in the region.
Tensions flared following what Islamabad termed a “false flag operation” by India in the mountainous resort town of Pahalgam. In the wake of the incident, both countries carried out missile and air strikes. According to Pakistan’s military, India lost six aircraft in the exchange, including a Rafale fighter jet.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the meeting underscored the deep-rooted, brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE, built on mutual trust, shared values, and a history of close cooperation.
The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral, regional, and global issues of mutual interest, and reaffirmed their commitment to further enhancing collaboration in key areas.
Both sides expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties and ongoing engagements at all levels. The leaders agreed to maintain close coordination and continue working together to advance shared goals of regional peace and prosperity.</p><small>2025-06-13 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1316485284c925e.png?r=164940' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916928/india-china-agree-to-expedite-resumption-of-direct-flights-as-ties-improve' target='_blank'><strong>India, China agree to expedite resumption of direct flights as ties improve</strong></a><br><p>India and China have agreed to expedite the resumption of direct air services and step up communication, the two countries’ foreign ministries said on Friday, as Beijing and New Delhi continue to mend bilateral ties.
The ministries’ statements came after a meeting on Thursday of Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, who is visiting India.
The two countries reached an agreement in October regarding patrolling along their Himalayan border, thawing a standoff that began in 2020 and had strained bilateral ties, impacting areas from trade to technology to air travel.
Sun said in the meeting that the two sides should properly handle disputes and differences, and jointly play a constructive role in maintaining international and regional peace and stability, according to the Chinese ministry’s statement.
The two sides agreed to continue to stabilise and rebuild ties, the Indian ministry’s statement said.

Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran earlier today, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders and that this was the start of a “prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon”.
Iran promised a harsh response and Israel said it was working to intercept about 100 drones launched towards Israeli territory in retaliation.
In light of PM Shehbaz’s directives, a Crisis Management Cell has been established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to monitor the situation and coordinate efforts.
The Pakistani Embassy in Iran has also been instructed to remain vigilant and actively assist the pilgrims. Earlier today, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar shared the embassy’s hotline number: (0098)-2166941388.
 






The prime minister emphasised that immediate and effective measures must be taken to ensure the safety of all Pakistani nationals in Iran. He further instructed that all available resources be utilised to facilitate their safe and prompt return to Pakistan.
He directed that until the regional situation normalises, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Pakistani diplomatic mission in Iran will remain on high alert, ensuring continued support and communication with the pilgrims.
The Foreign Office (FO) also advised all Zaireen from Pakistan to reconsider their travel plans to Iran and Iraq in view of the evolving security situation in the region.
 






Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which condemned Israel’s strikes, with the FO calling it “unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.”
“The Israeli military strikes violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran and clearly contravene the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law. Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter,” FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said in a statement.
He said that Pakistan stood in “resolute solidarity” with the people of Iran and unequivocally denounced these blatant provocations, which constituted a grave danger and a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, with serious implications.
The spokesperson said that the international community and UN had the responsibility to uphold international law, stop this aggression immediately and hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari called Israeli’s military strikes “a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran”, while PM Shehbaz said this “grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further destabilising an already volatile region”.</p><small>2025-06-13 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1316294752836a6.jpg?r=162953' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916927/sbp-set-to-hold-policy-rate-as-israel-iran-conflict-overshadows-growth-push' target='_blank'><strong>SBP set to hold policy rate as Israel-Iran conflict overshadows growth push</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is expected to hold its policy rate on Monday, a Reuters poll showed, as many analysts shifted their previous view of a cut in the wake of Israel’s military strike on Iran, citing inflation risks from rising global commodity prices.
Israel said on Friday (today) it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders in a “preemptive strike” to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Several brokerages had initially expected a cut but revised their forecasts after the Israeli strikes sparked fears of a broader conflict. The escalating hostilities triggered a sharp spike in oil prices — a worry for Pakistan given the broader impact on imported inflation from a potentially prolonged conflict and tightening of crude supplies.
Eleven of 14 respondents in a snap poll expected the SBP to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 12 per cent. Two forecast a 100 basis-point cut and one predicted a 50 bps cut.
“There remains an upside risk of a rise in global commodity prices in light of geopolitical tensions which could mark a return to inflationary pressures,” said Ahmad Mobeen, senior economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“The resultant higher import bill could also threaten external sector performance and bring pressure to the exchange rate.”
Inflation has been declining for several months after it soared to around 40pc in May 2023.
Last month, however, inflation picked up to 3.5pc, above the finance ministry’s projection of up to 2pc, partly due to the fading of the year-go base effects. The SBP expects average inflation between 5.5pc and 7.5pc for the fiscal year ending June.
The SBP paused its easing cycle in March after cumulative cuts of 1,000 basis points from a record high of 22pc, and resumed it with a 100-basis-point reduction in May.
The policy meeting follows the release of a tight annual budget, which saw defence spending raised by 20pc but overall expenditure was reduced by 7pc, with GDP growth forecast at 4.2pc.
The government says the $350 billion economy has stabilised under a $7bn International Monetary Fund bailout that helped it stave off a default threat.
Some analysts are sceptical of the government’s ability to reach the growth target amid fiscal and external challenges.
Abdul Azeem, head of research at Al Habib Capital Markets, which forecast a 50-bp cut, said a lower rate could “support the GDP target of 4.2pc and reduce the debt financing burden”.</p><small>2025-06-13 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1316064947e7ba7.jpg?r=161256' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916914/fact-check-viral-video-said-to-be-of-israeli-attack-on-tehran-shows-oct-2024-iranian-strikes-on-israels-nevatim-airbase' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video said to be of Israeli attack on Tehran shows Oct 2024 Iranian strikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple users on social media platform X on Friday shared a video amid the outbreak of Israeli attacks on Iran, claiming that it allegedly showed a missile attack on Tehran. However, the footage dates back to October 2024 and shows Iranian airstrikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase.
Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders and that this was start of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed and state media reported that the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Additionally, at least six nuclear scientists were also killed along with civilians, as per reports.
Today, an Israeli X user posted a video of missile attack on an unidentified location, with the following caption: “Crazy documentation from Iran, dozens of periods at the same time.”
The post was viewed nearly 30,000 times.
Israeli analyst Eli David shared the same clip with the following caption, “Tehran moments ago,” racking up 523,000 views.
It was also shared here, here, here, and here, gaining 209,000, 77,000, 11,000, and 2,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and influx of visuals coming out of the recent conflict between Iran and Israel.
A reverse image search of the keyframes of the clip yielded a posted by a user on X dated October 1, 2024, with the caption, “🇮🇱🇮🇷 15 minutes Iranian missiles hitting Israel … supercut.”
 






Refining the search for that date yielded an October 1, 2024, YouTube video by Indian state broadcaster Doordarshan titled: “Iranian missiles targeting the Nevatim airbase in the Negev Desert”.
 


A keyword search for “Iran airstrike” and “Israel” around the corresponding date yielded an October 1, 2024, news report from Al Jazeera, titled “Iran says missiles fired at Israel in response to assassinations.”
According to the report, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, in retaliation for the killing of senior Iranian and allied leaders, including top commanders from Hezbollah and Hamas.
Israeli authorities reported that around 200 ballistic missiles were fired, triggering air raid sirens and shelter warnings across several regions. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had claimed responsibility, labelling the attack a response to Israeli “crimes”. While many of the missiles were intercepted, some caused significant damage and casualties, escalating fears of further regional conflict.
The viral clip was also circulated during the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May with claims it showed India attacking Pakistan.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows an Israeli attack in Tehran is false. The video is old from October 2024 and shows Iranian airstrikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase.

The incident follows the crash of an Air India flight in Ahmedabad on Thursday shortly after takeoff, in which more than 265 people were killed.
AOT did not provide details on the bomb threat. Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Indian airlines and airports were inundated with hoax bomb threats last year, with nearly 1,000 hoax calls and messages received in the first 10 months, nearly 10 times that of 2023.
Blackbox found of crashed Air India 787; India considering grounding fleet
Investigators recovered a black box recorder from the crash site on Friday of a London-bound passenger jet that ploughed into a residential area of India’s Ahmedabad city, killing at least 265 people on board and on the ground.
The Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner had issued a mayday call shortly before it crashed around lunchtime on Thursday after lifting barely 100 metres (330 feet) from the ground.
One man on board the plane, which was carrying 242 passengers and crew, miraculously survived Thursday’s fiery crash, which left the tailpiece of the aircraft jutting out of the second floor of a hostel for medical staff from a nearby hospital.
“Initially, I too thought that I was about to die, but then I opened my eyes and realised that I was still alive,” survivor Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, a British citizen, told national broadcaster DD News from his hospital bed.
The nose and front wheel of Air India flight 171 landed on a canteen building where students were having lunch, witnesses said.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Kanan Desai said that 265 bodies had been counted so far, which suggested that at least 24 people were killed on the ground. The toll could rise further as more body parts are recovered.
“The official number of deceased will be declared only after DNA testing is completed”, Home Minister Amit Shah said in a statement late on Thursday. DNA samples will be taken from family members of the dead who live abroad, he said.
Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian on board the flight bound for London’s Gatwick airport, as well as 12 crew members.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the devastated neighbourhood on Friday and was also pictured by survivor Ramesh’s bedside.
Ramesh, who suffered burns and other injuries, said: “Everything happened in front of me, and even I couldn’t believe how I managed to come out alive from that.”
“Within a minute after takeoff, suddenly… it felt like something got stuck… I realised something had happened, and then suddenly the plane’s green and white lights turned on.”
The Indian government is also considering grounding Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet, Indian broadcaster NDTV reported earlier on Friday, a day after one of the airline’s aircraft of the same make crashed in Ahmedabad city, killing more than 240 people.
The fleet will likely be grounded for a safety review, NDTV reported, citing sources.</p><small>2025-06-13 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/131344206804c5e.jpg?r=143118' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916909/israel-just-launched-a-widescale-attack-on-iran-heres-how-we-got-to-this-point' target='_blank'><strong>Israel just launched a ‘widescale’ attack on Iran.

In a rather anticipated move, Israel on Friday launched widescale strikes on Iran, claiming that it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. In a message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, Reuters reported. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed, and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Six Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, Iranian state media reported.
 
 

In response, Iran launched around 100 drones towards Israeli territory, which Israel was working to intercept, according to Tel Aviv. At around 0800 GMT, Israeli media said an order to citizens to remain near protected areas had been lifted, suggesting that most or all of the drones had been neutralised.
Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally.
The United States and other European countries had already warned of such an attack by Israel on Iran, which has once again reignited tensions in the Middle East. In fact, on Wednesday, the US withdrew diplomats from Iraq and authorised the voluntary departure of its military family members from the region.
These developments come against the backdrop of the Iran-US nuclear talks, which, as per a New York Times report, revolve around Tehran’s near-bomb-grade uranium and Washington’s goal to ensure Iran enriches no uranium at all on its soil.
Uranium enrichment is a process used to make fuel for nuclear power plants, but it can also yield material for an atomic warhead.
Negotiations or bombs
In April, the US and Iran initiated high-level nuclear talks with Oman serving as an intermediary. It was the first engagement between the two countries in nearly seven years, when President Donald Trump had pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear agreement.
Essentially, the 2015 deal imposed restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme, making it impossible for the country to produce a bomb, in return for the lifting of most of the US and international sanctions against it. But Trump withdrew the US from the accord with world powers in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. Tehran reacted a year later by violating the deal’s nuclear curbs.
In March 2025, after assuming the presidency for the second time, Trump said he had written a letter to Iran, pressing it to open talks on preventing the development of nuclear weapons or face possible military action. In response, Iran had pushed back against Trump’s demands regarding direct negotiations and instead left the door open to indirect discussions.
A few days later, however, Trump told reporters at the Oval Office that Washington was commencing direct talks with Iran. The announcement was made during talks with Netanyahu, who was visiting the US at the time.
The talks
The first round of US-Iran talks took place on April 12 in Muscat and was described as “constructive”. The focus of the talks was on “de-escalating regional tensions, prisoner exchanges and limited agreements to ease sanctions in exchange for controlling Iran’s nuclear programme”, Reuters had reported.
US and Iranian officials again met for the second time on April 19, this time in Rome. Speaking on state television after the talks, the Iranian foreign minister had described them as useful and conducted in a constructive atmosphere. There was no immediate comment from the US side following the talks.
The third round of talks was held in Oman again, this time including a technical-level meeting between experts from both sides. Just a day before the talks, Trump, in an interview with Time magazine, had said that he “would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped”.
 
 

The same week, Washington had also announced new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil network, a move described as “hostile” by Tehran. Separately, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had warned Iran that it would face consequences for supporting the Houthis, a Zaydi Shia military organisation active in Yemen.
Subsequently, the fourth round of talks, scheduled for May 3 in Rome, was postponed. “US sanctions on Iran during the nuclear talks are not helping the sides to resolve the nuclear dispute through diplomacy,” Reuters had quoted an Iranian official as saying. Meanwhile, Oman had stated that the talks were being rescheduled due to “logistical reasons”.
The same day, in an interview with Fox News, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said that Iran had to ‘walk away’ from uranium enrichment and long-range missile development, and it should allow American inspectors into its facilities.
“If you have the ability to enrich at 3.67 per cent, it only takes a few weeks to get to 20pc, then 60pc, and then the 80 and 90pc that you need for a weapon,” Rubio had said.
Deal or no deal?
The fourth round of US-Iran talks did end up taking place, again in Muscat on May 12. The meeting was held the same week President Trump undertook his visit to the Middle East, the Associated Press reported.
Iran called the negotiations, which ran for three hours, “difficult but useful”. On the other hand, a US official told AP: “Agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements.”
Three days later, on May 15, Trump announced that the US was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran. “We’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,” he said on his Gulf tour, according to a shared pool report by AFP.
“We’re getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this … there [are] two steps to doing this, there is a very, very nice step and there is the violent step, but I don’t want to do it the second way,” he added.
However, an Iranian source said that while Tehran was prepared to offer what it considered concessions, the “issue is that America is not willing to lift major sanctions in exchange”.
Irrespective, the fifth round of talks took place between the two countries in Rome on May 23, where “some but not conclusive progress” took place, said mediator Oman. Meanwhile, Iran said it had received “elements” of a US proposal, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later said the text contained “ambiguities”.
A few days after the fifth round of talks, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a speech delivered on the commemoration of the death of the Islamic Republic’s founder, pledged that Tehran would not abandon its uranium enrichment — a key demand in the US proposal.
“Independence means not waiting for the green light from America and the likes of America,” he said, adding that the US proposal was “100pc against” the ideals of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Tensions rise
Henceforth began a tug of war between Iran and the US.
On June 9, the Iranian foreign ministry said it would soon present a counterproposal for a nuclear deal to the US via mediator Oman. It stated that the US proposal had failed to include Tehran’s key demand of lifting sanctions.
But despite the disagreement, President Trump earlier this week said talks would continue between the two countries. “They’re just asking for things that you can’t do. They don’t want to give up what they have to give up,” Trump told reporters at the White House, according to Reuters. “They seek enrichment. We can’t have enrichment.”
 
 

He further said that Iran was the main topic of a phone conversation he had on Monday with the Israeli PM. Netanyahu’s office said the president had told him talks with Iran would continue at the end of the week. Soon after, Oman announced that the sixth round of US-Iran talks will take place on Sunday.
But then a lot happened in just one day — June 12. Trump warned that a “massive conflict” could break out in the Middle East. “I don’t want to say imminent, but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen,” Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about an Israeli attack on Iran, AP reported.
At the same time, the US president also said that he was urging Netanyahu to hold off from taking action for the time being and later took to social media to say that the “entire Administration has been directed to negotiate with Iran”.
The same day, the International Atomic Energy Agency issued its strongest condemnation of Iran in 20 years, saying that the country had continued to enrich uranium to near weapons-grade levels and had failed to comply with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations. Following this, Iran said it had built and would activate a third nuclear enrichment facility.
Within just a few hours after the developments, Israel attacked Iranian nuclear targets, with Netanyahu saying strikes would continue for as long as it would take “to remove this threat”.

Noorpur Thal among hottest Punjab regions with mercury touching 48.5°C

Dust storms, thunder and rain are also exp­­ected in some districts of southern Pu­­njab and upper Sindh during the period.
Heatwave
Punjab is currently ex­­p­eriencing a severe heatw­a­­ve, with temperatures re­­aching a scorching 48.5°C in Noorpur Thal, making it one of the hottest regio­­ns in the province. Baha­w­alnagar, Bhakkar, Gujran­wala, and Hafizabad rec­o­rded te­­mperatures bet­w­een 47°C and 48°C, while major cities like Lahore and Fai­salabad recorded temperatures of 46°C.
Meanwhile, the Provin­cial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) also issued an alert warning of an impending weather shift from today.
The Punjab governm­ent also directed district administrations and other departments to prepare for potential weather-related disruptions.
NDMA advisory
An impact-based wea­ther advisory issued by NDMA’s National Emer­g­e­ncies Operation Centre (NEOC) has urged the public to take precautions and stay updated via the NDMA app, as extreme heat is expected to affect the rest of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Ba­­lochistan, some areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK from Friday to Wednesday (June 13-18).
A weak western wea­ther system is forecast to affect the upper regions of the country from June 13 to 16, potentially influencing weather conditions across multiple provinces. In Punjab, hot weather is expected to persist throu­ghout the week.
In Khyber Pakhtun­kh­­wa, mostly hot conditions are predicted, but scatte­red rain and windstorms are likely in several districts, including Chitral, Dir, Haripur, Karak, Ko­­h­at, Kohistan, Khyber, Ku­­rram, Mansehra, Moh­ma­­nd, Nowshera, Malakand, Charsadda, Abbottabad, Bannu, Buner, Hazara, Pe­­shawar, Swabi, Swat, Waz­iristan, and adjoining areas.
Sindh and Balochistan are forecast to remain predominantly hot and dry throughout the advisory period.
In Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK, hot weather will prevail, although areas such as Astore, Skardu, Hunza, Shigar, Bagh and Neelum Valley may receive isolated rainfall from June 13 to 16.

Justice Raheel Kamran issued a detailed 21-page judgement on a writ petition filed by Ms Khan, who had challenged her de-notification on Aug 4, 2023, on the grounds of lack of legal authority, procedural impropriety, and infringement of her guaranteed tenure.
The petitioner was appointed for a fixed term of four years under the amended Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Amendment) Act, 2022.
The judge held that no removal is permissible during the tenure except for proven misconduct or incapacity, and even then, only after due process, which was entirely absent in this case.
The judge observed that the caretaker government lacked the authority to remove the ombudsperson, terming the act outside its limited constitutional and statutory functions.
Justice Kamran noted that caretaker setups are designed to ensure electoral neutrality and cannot take policy-level or structural decisions that impact statutory bodies. He said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had directed the caretaker government to ensure removal of all politically appointed institutional heads.
However, the judge found the ECP overstepped its authority, as it had no power to direct the termination of a statutory office-holder unless there was compelling evidence that the official could influence electoral outcomes — a criterion that was not met in the petitioner’s case.
The judge also criticised the absence of any inquiry or due process in the petitioner’s removal.
He said despite objections raised later by the provincial government about the petitioner’s qualifications and prior political affiliations, no formal hearing or notice was given to her before de-notification.
“Even if an elected government intended to take any action based on such objections, it would be required to act while following the principles of natural justice, ensuring fairness and due process for the petitioner,” the judge noted.
Recognising the constitutional role of the ECP in conducting free and fair elections, Justice Kamran found that its 2023 directive — used by the caretaker government to justify the de-notification of the petitioner — did not authorise the removal of statutory office holders unless there was a demonstrated risk of election interference.

During a meeting with UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, PM Shehbaz appreciated the Gulf state’s consistent efforts in promoting peace, dialogue and stability in the region.
The high-level engagement took place as part of the prime minister’s day-long official visit to Abu Dhabi, aimed at reaffirming Pakistan’s gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad’s position during its recent standoff with New Delhi.
Tensions flared following what Islamabad termed a “false flag operation” by India in the mountainous resort town of Pahalgam. In the wake of the incident, both countries carried out missile and air strikes. According to Pakistan’s military, India lost six aircraft in the exchange, including a Rafale fighter jet.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, both sides expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties and ongoing engagements at all levels. The leaders agreed to maintain close coordination and continue working together to advance shared goals of regional peace and prosperity.
The meeting underscored the deep-rooted, brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE, built on mutual trust, shared values and a history of close cooperation.
The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral, reg­i­o­nal and global issues of mutual interest, and reaffirmed their commitment to further enhancing collaboration in key areas. Prime Minister Shehbaz reiterated his earlier invitation to the UAE president to visit Pakistan.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi were also present at the meeting.
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz was warmly received at Abu Dhabi’s Al Bateen Airport by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE’s national security adviser and brother of the president. He also accompanied the prime minister to the Presidential Palace.
Secretary General of the UAE Supreme National Security Council Ali Ahmed Al Shamsi, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, and Pakistani diplomatic staff were also present at the airport to receive the prime minister.
London Tech Week
Later in the day, PM Shehbaz addressed Pakistan’s participation at London Tech Week 2025 held in Abu Dhabi, where he highlighted the country’s commitment to transitioning into a knowledge-based economy.
Speaking at the global platform, the premier said Pakistan’s dedication to digital transformation, technological innovation and youth empowerment remained unwavering.
The prime minister congratulated all stakeholders on Pakistan’s impactful presence at London Tech Week 2025.
“This positions Pakistan as a forward-looking country that is harnessing technology, innovation and youth potential to engage with the world,” he said. “Our presence at such an important platform reflects our growing digital footprint and global ambition.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz returned to Pakistan on Thursday evening after concluding his official visit to the United Arab Emirates.
PM’s notice
In a separate development, PM Shehbaz has taken notice of a more than five-fold increase in the salaries of the National Assembly speaker and Senate chairman and sought a report from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.
Sources said the prime minister’s action came in the wake of widespread public criticism over the increase in the salaries of the custodians of the two houses from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3 million a month.
The decision has drawn criticism from within the ruling PML-N, as two party stalwarts — Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Khawaja Saad Rafique — publicly criticised the move.
However, during the post-budget press conference on Wednesday, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb defended the steep hikes — some as large as 550 per cent — in the salaries of the speaker, deputy speaker, members of parliament, and ministers.

• Minister expects policy rate to come down before next year, seems hopeful about privatisation
• Finance secretary says current year’s uplift budget reduced to Rs967bn, hints at further drop
• Lawmakers concerned over tax-to-GDP ratio, revenue shortfall, taxes on solar panels, among other things
ISLAMABAD: Amid a downward revision in federal development spending, which may fall further by the end of this month, the Ministry of Finance told a parliamentary panel on Thursday that armed forces officers had been granted a special relief allowance at 50 per cent of their basic salary, while junior commissioned officers and soldiers would get 20pc allowance in the upcoming fiscal year.
Testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Secretary Finance Imdadullah Bosal highlighted relief measures proposed in the budget, saying that “special relief allowance at the rate of 50pc to officers and 20pc to JCOs/soldiers” of their basic salary had been granted. The meeting was presided over by MNA Syed Naveed Qamar.
The ministry did not disclose the financial impact and the reason for the higher allowance for officers in response to members’ questions about the financial impact of these allowances. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb promised to get back with a detailed response, besides few other things, later saying he had noted down the points raised by Omar Ayub, the leader of the opposition.
Mr Bosal disclosed that the current year’s public sector development programme had been revised to Rs967bn from Rs1.1 trillion and conceded even this amount may not be fully utilised by June 30, given the fact that Rs662bn had so far been actually spent.
At this, the members pointed out that a reduction in development expenditure would not only change the current year’s growth estimates (2.7pc of GDP) based on Rs1.1tr investment but also many other economic indicators as well.
The minister expected the central bank’s policy rate decline to single digits before the close of the current calendar year, as inflation had been a ‘fantastic story’ and both fiscal and current accounts improved significantly. He said the monetary policy committee was set to meet next week and there was a cushion to do more. He did not comment further, saying it was the State Bank of Pakistan’s domain.
The minister said Pakistan would be receiving about $1bn foreign inflows before the close of the current fiscal year through a syndicated arrangement from banks, with about $500 million guarantee from the Asian Development Bank, to be doubled next year. Therefore, the foreign exchange reserves currently at over $11bn would touch $14bn by June-end.
The minister said Pakistan would double commercial and capital market borrowing next year as credit ratings improved further, pointing out that about $500 million foreign bond maturing in September and another $1.2bn in April next year would be repaid in time.
The finance secretary said the major source of non-tax revenue – SBP profit – that stood at Rs2.6tr during the current year and projected at Rs2.4tr next year was mainly because of windfall from the higher policy rate. Normally, it remains around Rs1tr or so, he said.
Petroleum levy
He said the petroleum levy, another major source of non-tax revenue, stood at Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs77 per litre on petrol and would be increased by Rs2.5/litre carbon levy under the next year’s budget, taking its size on average to Rs80/litre on these two products.
With an additional levy on furnace oil, the PDL was targeted to generate Rs1.468tr next year from Rs1.161tr during the current year. He confirmed that the upper cap on the petroleum development levy had been removed as the government increased its rate by Rs10/litre for the power sector subsidy and another Rs8 per litre for the Quetta-Karachi (N25) highway. The government had no plan to further increase it, he added.
Mr Bosal said the BISP allocation for next year had been increased by 21pc to Rs716bn from Rs592bn, while Azad Kashmir’s grant had been jacked up by 33pc to Rs140bn next year from Rs105bn. The allocation for Gilgit-Baltistan had also been raised by 18pc to Rs80bn from Rs68bn, which was in addition to another Rs20bn wheat subsidy to the region. Likewise, another special area of tribal merged districts had also been increased by 21pc to Rs80bn from Rs66bn.
The minister acknowledged members’ concern about Rs87bn revenue projections next year from privatisation deals. He said this was an area where the government could not complete any transaction, but many corrections had been made, including certain incentives allowed by the IMF. This would not only take the PIA to the finish line but also the Roosevelt Hotel, three power distribution companies and a couple of financial sector transactions, both through strategic sale and listings on the capital market, he added.
The finance minister thanked the four provinces for delivering over Rs1tr cash surplus this year and hoped to secure another Rs1.464tr next year. Their support helped the overall fiscal deficit reach 5.6pc of GDP against the federal deficit of 6.8pc envisaged in the budget last year. With their support, the consolidated fiscal deficit was estimated at 3.9pc of GDP for next year.
The committee members expressed concerns over the tax-to-GDP ratio, revenue shortfall, taxes on solar panels, hybrid vehicles, carbon levy, petroleum levy, private sector lending and debt, SMEs, industrial and agricultural growth and targets, withholding tax (WHT) on ATMs and bank deposits, pensions, gender-specific allocations, health-specific allocations, electric vehicles, structural reforms, sales tax on cotton, public sector expenditure, defence spending, the widening current account deficit, and the negative growth rates observed in both the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
The discussion also highlighted the challenges of climate change and the need for social protection. The members expressed serious concerns regarding the inefficiency of Customs Intelligence and smuggling at the borders.

The Israeli army said on X that its soldiers seized several suspected members of Palestinian group Hamas in a  “targeted” operation in Beit Jinn, 12 kilometres (seven and a half miles) from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Since the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria aimed at denying military assets to the Islamist-led interim administration. It has also deployed tro­ops across the demilitarised zone on the Syrian side of the armistice line that used to separate the opposing forces on the Golan.
Syria’s interior ministry said “these repeated provocations constitute a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic… these practises cannot lead the region to stability and will only result in further tension and turmoil”.
The Israeli military said troops carried out a  “targeted, intelligence-based nighttime operation in Syria and apprehended several Hamas terrorists”. It alleged that those seized were plotting attacks on Israeli troops.
The Syrian interior ministry said that Israeli soldiers detained seven people and fired directly at the villagers, killing one civilian.
In a statement, Syria’s foreign ministry called on the international community to  “take decisive steps to stop these recurring attacks”.
The raid comes days after the Israeli army said it  “struck a Hamas terrorist in the area of Mazraat Beit Jinn”, which neighbours Beit Jinn. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said one person was killed in the attack.

• Says fiscal space shrinking, provinces must share burden and invest in human development
ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Thursday proposed shifting the “regressive” population-based formula for distributing divisible pool resources under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award to criteria based on climate adaptation and other performance indicators.
Speaking at a news briefing, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the current NFC criteria were regressive as population, being the overwhelming consideration, had been made an incentive instead of a disincentive. He said the Centre would seek climate adaptation and other social sector indicators as key determinants for distributing resources with and among the provinces when the NFC meets in August this year. He went on to question the devolution planned under the 18th Amendment and the 7th NFC Award in place since 2009.
He said the devolution was incomplete as the provinces had not devolved responsibilities and resources down to the district level for such a long time despite commitments. He said the size of provincial finances had expanded, which required a district government system to be activated. He said the Centre had devolved powers to the provinces, which would have to empower local governments.
On the occasion, Chief Statistician Naeemuz Zafar defended economic growth estimates for the current year at 2.7 per cent, saying he could elaborate and defend the outcomes of the recent National Accounts Committee (NAC).
He said the objections over NAC datasets were not justified as the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics had published all the data on its website, and statistics about the growth estimates were transparent.
He said he had also noticed some objections over agricultural output, but it should be recognised that major crops only made up 18pc of the agricultural sector. The remaining 80pc comprises livestock, fisheries and forestry.
However, responding to a question, he conceded that the GDP growth rate estimates had taken into account Rs1.1 trillion public sector development investments and data pertaining to livestock was worked out based on the 2010 survey.
This indicated that, along with the industrial sector’s upsurge reported in the fourth quarter, the 2.7pc GDP growth rate would need to be revised by the September-October NAC review, as the Ministry of Finance separately put the PSDP spending at Rs967 billion instead of Rs1.1tr and indicated its further revision.
Fiscal space shrinking
The planning minister said the Centre’s fiscal space was shrinking as the development programme had contracted to 0.8pc from over 1.2pc of GDP in a few years, which was a matter of concern. He said that after transfer of provincial shares, the Centre would be left with about Rs11tr, of which over Rs8.2tr would go for debt servicing and the remaining on defence expenditure.
Therefore, the provinces must share the expenditure and invest in human development, including child stunting, as 40pc children were currently stunted, he said.
Responding to a question, the minister said India was weaponising water, which was a serious challenge for Pakistan, but warned that India would need to avoid that route or face consequences. He stressed that Pakistan was prioritising water sector projects and dams.
Mr Iqbal said the national leadership had resolved collectively to transition from crisis to stability and sustained growth under the vision of Uraan Pakistan and the 13th Five-Year Plan. “This year’s budget is not merely a financial statement. It’s a roadmap towards recovery, resilience and opportunity for all Pakistanis,” he added.
He said the government had been struggling for two years to pay for ongoing development projects. “Today, we are paying our defence expenditures and servicing debt obligations from our own resources, but very soon, we will finance our development independently,” he said.
This would be achieved through 4.5pc growth in agriculture through Rs4.2bn investments in crop productivity and livestock, modernisation and mechanisation, backed by provincial initiatives such as the Punjab Kissan Card.

The distribution of food and basic supplies in the war-ravaged Gaza Strip has become increasingly fraught and perilous, exacerbating the territory’s deep hunger crisis.
Civil defence official Mohammed al-Mughayyir told AFP that the Al-Awda Hospital received 10 dead and around 200 wounded, including women and children, “after Israeli drones dropped multiple bombs on gatherings of civilians near an aid distribution point around the Netzarim checkpoint in central Gaza”.
He said that Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital received six dead following Israeli attacks on aid queues near Netzarim and in the Al-Sudaniya area in northwestern Gaza.

GHF accuses Hamas of attacking aid workers; Palestinian group calls the foundation a ‘filthy tool’ of Israeli forces

The Israeli army said it was looking into the reports when asked for comment by AFP. Restrictions imposed on media in the Gaza Strip and the difficulties of access on the ground mean AFP is not able to independently verify the death tolls.
Mughayyir said another six people were killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza.
Aid workers
The US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) on Thursday accused Palestinian group Hamas of attacking aid workers en route to distribution centres, saying that at least eight people had been killed.
GHF had earlier given a toll of at least five killed in the attack, which took place late Wednesday in the southern Gaza Strip.
“We are still collecting more information on the deadly and unprovoked attack on our dedicated local team members and volunteers,” GHF interim executive director John Acree said in a statement.
“As of now, we can confirm at least eight fatalities, multiple injuries, and we fear that some of our team members have been taken hostage,” he added.
In an earlier statement, GHF said a bus carrying more than two dozen members of it team, “local Palestinians working side by side with the US GHF team to deliver critical aid, were brutally attacked by Hamas”.
It said the team was en route to one of the foundation’s distribution centres west of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip.
“We carefully considered closing our sites today given the heightened security risks and safety concerns, but we decided that the best response to … murderers was to keep delivering food for the people of Gaza who are counting on us,” Acree said in the group’s update.
“We will not be deterred from our mission towards providing food security for the Palestinian people in Gaza.”
An officially private effort with opaque funding and backed by Israel, GHF began operations on May 26 after Israel completely cut off supplies into Gaza for more than two months, sparking warnings of mass famine.
The United Nations and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives. GHF claimed it had distributed nearly 2.6 million meals today and more than 18.6 million to date.
Hamas accused GHF of becoming a “filthy tool” of Israeli forces. “The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has become a filthy tool in the hands of the occupying army, used to lure civilians into deadly traps,” the Hamas government media office in Gaza told AFP on Thursday.
