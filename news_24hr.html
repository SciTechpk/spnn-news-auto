Sources told Dawn that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had forwarded a summary advising President Zardari to withdraw the Special Economic Zones (Amendment) Ordinance, 2026.
In his remarks during the year’s first NA session, PPP’s Naveed Qamar had not specified which ordinance was promulgated without the president’s approval when he led a walkout by the party, saying it would not participate in proceedings until the situation was addressed.
Sources in the PPP, however, had confirmed to Dawn he was referring to an ordinance related to special economic zones.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, meanwhile, said that nowadays there was an e-office through which files were approved online. “This ordinance was also approved. Staff to staff, it was considered approved,” he said in a statement.
The minister acknowledged that when the ordinance’s file was received, it did not bear the president’s signature.
“It had already been printed. A mistake was made which has been rectified,” he stated. “As a goodwill gesture, these bills were not notified because the president did not approve them,” he said.
He noted that the president had 10 days to give his assent to bills passed by a joint sitting of Parliament.
“As a goodwill gesture, these bills were not notified because the president did not approve them,” he said.
“The PPP and the PML-N have a good relationship and because of this relationship, the ordinance has been withdrawn,” the minister said. “In the future, we will approach these matters with understanding,” he concluded.
After the withdrawal of the ordinance, PPP’s Shazia Marri said the party would now attend Tuesday’s NA session.
PPP stages walkout in NA, calls move ‘shameful’
Speaking on the floor of the NA earlier in the day on a point of order, PPP’s Qamar said, “There is a very serious constitutional anomaly taking place.”
He highlighted that Parliament’s primary responsibility was to legislate. “Without the assemblies, there is only one way of legislating, which is if the president promulgates an ordinance under Article 89(1) of the Constitution,” he said.
“For the first time in Pakistan’s black legislative history, an ordinance has been promulgated without the approval or the signature of the president, which is shameful and against the Constitution,“ he alleged, without specifying what the ordinance was.
He said that for the first time, the government was “deviating from the Constitution”.
“How can you promulgate an ordinance and put it into effect without getting the president’s approval on it?” he asked. The PPP leader said that the party had not seen such a practice even during military dictatorships.
“I do not know what the government’s excuse is for doing this,” he remarked. He made it clear that the law would have no standing anywhere, including in a court of law and Parliament.
Declaring that the PPP would not participate in proceedings until the situation was addressed, he announced a walkout along with other members of his party.
For his part, Law Minister Tarar had attempted to call the PPP members back to no avail.
“Please come back and join the proceedings. Let me explain that things are going in the right direction,“ he said. He explained that an ordinance was issued on the premier’s advice and “there is no doubt that the president has to assent to it”.
Tarar insisted that Article 89 of the Constitution was subject to Article 48(1) of the Constitution under which the advice of the prime minister was binding on the president.
“It has been brought to our notice … there is something circulating on social media. Let me recheck,” he said.
He noted that “nine or 10 bills and ordinances” were pending presidential assent, and the ministry only came to know on Sunday that President Zardari had given his assent to those bills.
“Maybe it is part of that or it is not part of that,” he said.
He said the deeming clause is invoked under Article 75 of the Constitution when the bills returned by the president and passed by the Parliament in a joint sitting are not assented to within ten days. “But we never notified them out of respect for the president,“ he remarked.
He said he would speak to the relevant quarters and get back to PPP’s Qamar.
Later, PPP MNA Hussain Tariq returned to the assembly only to point out the lack of quorum. After a headcount, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq suspended the proceedings. Subsequently, the session was adjourned till 11am on Tuesday.







NA speaker gets ball rolling on opposition leader’s appointment
Separately, NA Speaker Sadiq also sought proposals for the nomination of the opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament during Monday’s session.
The post has been vacant since August 2025, following the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). While the opposition has accused the government of delaying the appo­intment despite them putting forward Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s name for the role, Sadiq has maintained that the delay was because the matter was sub judice.
At the outset of Monday’s session, Sadiq reiterated his stance that he could not initiate the nomination process earlier as the matter was subjudice and the NA Secretariat had been made a party in the cases.
He said that as PTI’s Ayub had withdrawn his petitions in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal, the nomination process could now be formally initiated.
“This issue had to head towards resolution only then. We would have done so if we had not been made a party [to the case],” Sadiq said.
Addressing the opposition benches, he said proposals for nominating the opposition leader may be submitted in his chambers by 3pm tomorrow (Tuesday), as per Rule 39(ii) of the Rules of Procedures.
Rule 39 confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.







Sadiq stated that the nominations should be accompanied by the signatures of members of the opposition. The count will be made at 3pm on January 14 in accordance with Rule 39(iii) of the NA rules, the speaker announced.
The MNA having the greatest numerical strength after the signature of the members shall be declared as the opposition leader.
It is worth noting that the opposition had submitted the name of Achakzai — who heads the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — to the speaker’s office in October 2025 rather than presenting it to the speaker personally.
Speaking in the NA, Sadiq recalled that he had informed PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan and opposition chief whip Malik Amir Dogar that the matter was sub judice when they had called on him in November 2025.
He highlighted that he had written letters to the opposition on Nov 19, Dec 5, Dec 19 and Dec 29 to “confirm the status”, following which Dogar submitted the required documents.
Responding to him on the assembly floor, Dogar said he had submitted an application with the signatures of 76 opposition MNAs keeping in view Rule 39.
“We are unanimously willing to provide verification however you want,” he said, reiterating that Achakzai was their choice as per PTI founder Imran Khan’s decision.
Dogar assured the speaker that the opposition would fulfil the required process tomorrow, and requested him to formally notify the opposition leader immediately.

The collaboration marks a significant shift for Apple, which has traditionally developed its core technologies in-house.
A joint statement said Apple selected Google’s AI technology after a “careful evaluation” determined it provided “the most capable foundation” for the iPhone-maker’s AI ambitions.
The announcement represents a rare alliance between two companies that have long competed in the smartphone market, where Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android operating systems dominate globally.







However, the two rivals have maintained a lucrative partnership for years, with Google paying Apple billions of dollars annually to remain the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices.
That arrangement has faced scrutiny from regulators, with the US Justice Department arguing in an antitrust case that the deal helps Google maintain its search monopoly, though a judge said the arrangement could continue.
Financial details of the AI arrangement were not provided.
Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities said the partnership was “a major validation moment for Google” and “a stepping stone” for Apple to get its AI strategy on track into 2026 and beyond.
Apple reportedly also considered partnerships with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity.
The company co-founded by Steve Jobs is largely perceived to have stumbled in efforts to roll out AI capabilities across its products and last month announced the head of its artificial intelligence team was stepping down.
Apple last year delayed the release of an improved Siri digital assistant and is now promising it for later in the year.
Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and other tech rivals have been releasing ever-improved AI models and features in a fierce race to lead the sector.
Despite the collaboration, Apple emphasised that its in-house AI system, Apple Intelligence, will be used to power its iPhones and iPads at the device-only level, maintaining what it described as “industry-leading privacy standards“.</p><small>2026-01-12 18:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12212532b9d51a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966581/indonesia-expresses-desire-to-expand-defence-ties-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia expresses desire to expand defence ties with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Indonesia has expressed its desire to further expand defence ties with Pakistan across multiple domains, the military’s media affairs wing said on Monday.
The development came as Indonesian Defence Minister Lieutenant General (retd) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin called on Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“The meeting focused on matters of mutual interest, evolving regional and global security dynamics, and exploration of avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” it said.







“Both sides underscored the importance of strengthening institutional linkages, training collaboration and defence industrial cooperation between Pakistan and Indonesia,” it added.
“The visiting dignitary lauded the professionalism of Pakistan’s armed forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. He also expressed Indonesia’s desire to further expand defence ties with Pakistan across multiple domains,” it said.
CDF Field Marshal Munir reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fostering a strong and enduring defence relationship with Indonesia, based on shared values, mutual respect, and convergence of strategic interests, the statement concluded.
Meanwhile, a defence delegation led by the Indonesian minister also called on Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, a separate ISPR statement said.
“The meeting reaffirmed the historic and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Indonesia and focused on strengthening bilateral air force cooperation, particularly in capacity building, training and technological collaboration,” the statement said.
It added that the air chief briefed the delegation on PAF’s modernisation drive, including infrastructure development, revamped training and the induction of niche capabilities to enhance readiness for multi-domain operations.







The Indonesian defence minister praised the PAF’s professionalism, combat readiness and indigenisation achievements under the National Aerospace Science and Technology Park, expressing strong interest in expanding cooperation in training, aviation and aerospace domains, the statement added.
“The meeting reflected growing momentum in Pakistan-Indonesia defence ties and a shared resolve to deepen cooperation through sustained engagement and dialogue,” it concluded.
The meetings come a month after Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto visited Pakistan, with the two countries agreeing to enhance bilateral trade, expand cooperation in health, agriculture, information technology, science and education, and deepen coordination on regional and global issues, including Palestine.</p><small>2026-01-12 17:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12160415ef37620.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966562/indian-rocket-loses-control-after-lift-off-in-fresh-blow-to-countrys-space-agency' target='_blank'><strong>Indian rocket loses control after lift-off in fresh blow to country’s space agency</strong></a><br><p>An Indian rocket carrying 16 loads of equipment and experiments, including an earth surveillance satellite, went off track after lift-off on Monday in a fresh setback to the workhorse launch vehicle of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
It was a second disappointment for the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle in about eight months, denting its reputation for reliability, with a more than 90 per cent success rate over about 60 past missions.
The PSLV-C62 lifted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on the island of Sriharikota at 10:18am local time, carrying the EOS-N1 observation satellite and 15 other payloads developed by startups and academic institutions in India and abroad.

 


The ISRO’s mission control said the rocket performed normally for most of the flight before an unexpected disturbance and deviation from its path.
“The PSLV-C62 mission encountered an anomaly during the end of the PS3 stage. A detailed analysis has been initiated,” ISRO said in a statement, without giving further details on what had gone wrong or where the rocket ended up.







The PSLV has been central to India’s space programme, having launched missions such as Chandrayaan-1 and the Aditya-L1 solar observatory. It also underpins India’s push to open space manufacturing to private industry.</p><small>2026-01-12 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/122211394111160.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966583/greenland-rejects-us-takeover-under-any-circumstance' target='_blank'><strong>Greenland rejects US takeover ‘under any circumstance’</strong></a><br><p>Greenland’s government on Monday said it could not accept a US takeover of the Arctic island under “any circumstance”, after US President Donald Trump said that the United States would take the territory “one way or the other”.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to bring the island under US control, arguing that the Danish autonomous territory is crucial for national security.
He reiterated that the United States must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich territory in the future.
“The United States has once again reiterated its desire to take over Greenland. This is something that the governing coalition in Greenland cannot accept under any circumstances,” the Greenlandic government said in a statement.
On Sunday, Trump warned that if the United States didn’t take Greenland, “Russia or China will, and I’m not letting that happen”.
The US leader said he would be open to making a deal with the Danish self-governing island, “but one way or the other, we’re going to have Greenland”.
Last week, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom issued a joint statement with Denmark to show their backing for Copenhagen and Greenland against Trump.
“On the basis of the very positive declaration from the six Nato member states regarding Greenland, the government of Greenland will intensify efforts to ensure that the defence of Greenland is carried out within Nato,” Monday’s statement said.
“Greenland will always be part of the Western defence alliance,” the government added.
“All Nato member states, including the United States, have a common interest in the defence of Greenland,” the island’s coalition government said in a statement, adding that it can in no way accept a US takeover of Greenland.
“As part of the Danish commonwealth, Greenland is a member of Nato and the defence of Greenland must therefore be through Nato,” the government said.
The European Union Commissioner for Defence and Space Andrius Kubilius said earlier on Monday that any US military takeover of Greenland would be the end of NATO.
While Denmark has ruled Greenland for centuries, the territory has gradually been moving towards independence since 1979, a goal shared by all political parties elected to the island’s parliament.
“We are a democratic society that makes our own decisions. And our actions are based on international law,” Greenland’s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen wrote on LinkedIn.
Trump first floated the idea of a US takeover of Greenland in 2019 during his first term in office, although he faces opposition in Washington, including from within his own party.
Denmark and other European allies have voiced shock at Trump’s threats over the strategic island, which has been home to a US military base since World War II.
A Danish colony until 1953, Greenland gained home rule 26 years later and is contemplating eventually loosening its ties with Denmark. Polls show that Greenland’s people strongly oppose a US takeover.</p><small>2026-01-12 17:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/122035558a91014.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966524/iran-condemns-interventionist-statements-by-trump-other-us-officials-about-its-internal-affairs' target='_blank'><strong>Iran condemns ‘interventionist statements’ by Trump, other US officials about its internal affairs</strong></a><br><p>Iran, which has accused the US and Israel of fomenting the ongoing unrest in the Middle Eastern country, said on Monday it strongly condemned “interventionist statements” by US President Donald Trump and other officials regarding its internal affairs.
Trump has warned Tehran of strikes over the crackdown on the protests and also said on Sunday that he was weighing a range of strong responses, including military options, to action against protesters.
Iran’s latest condemnation of his statements came in a press release titled “Fact Sheet on Recent Protests in Iran”, which was shared by the Iranian embassy in Islamabad on the social media platform X.







In the statement, Tehran expressed “deep concern regarding overt and increasing foreign interference in the country’s internal affairs and recent protests”.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns the interventionist statements made by the president of the United States of America and other American officials,” it said.
“Such coercive and unlawful positions constitute a flagrant violation of the fundamental principles of UN Charter and international law, particularly the principle of sovereignty and non-intervention, and effectively amount to encouragement of violence and terrorism against Iranian citizens. These reckless statements are not unprecedented.“
It was recalled that days earlier, the US president had “publicly threatened the Islamic Republic of Iran with the use of force, including the prospect of renewed military attacks against Iran’s peaceful nuclear facilities and its defensive capabilities“.
The press release also mentioned economic pressures on Iran, resulting from universal coercive measures.
“The extensive imposition of unilateral coercive measures had a direct and adverse impact on the Iranian people’s livelihood and economic situation, severely restricting the country’s financial resources, disrupting trade and investment, impeding access to essential goods and services, and consequently intensifying economic pressure on ordinary citizens,” it said.
In a reference to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the statement said: “The prime minister of the Zionist regime has made blatantly interventionist statements regarding Iran’s internal developments and has portrayed himself as sympathetic to the Iranian people.
“Such claims are profoundly deceptive, particularly considering the aggressive actions of this regime against Iran, which have resulted in the killing of more than 1,100 Iranian citizens.“
It further stated: “Decades of criminal actions by the Zionist regime against the Iranian people cannot be concealed by rhetorical manoeuvres and or hypocritical behaviour. It is evident that the Zionist seeks to exploit every opportunity to sow division within Iranian society and undermine national cohesion.
“Statements by him and certain hardline American officials amount to incitement to violence, terrorism and criminal acts,” it added.
The statement also recalled that on December 28, 2025, following an increase in foreign exchange rates, sector-based protest gatherings were formed by some traders in the Tehran Bazaar, motivated by economic concerns.
The escalating protests in Iran, which began in December last year in response to soaring prices, now pose one of the biggest challenges to the government since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirm its commitment to its obligation under international human rights law regarding respecting and protecting the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly guaranteed under the Constitution.
“Government recognised the lawful demands of peaceful protesters and started utilising all available capacities to address the demands,” the statement added.
However, it continued, a distinction should be made between peaceful protests and riots or violent acts.
“Just as Iran considers itself fully committed to supporting and protecting the right of its citizens to peaceful and lawful protest, it is equally obliged to prevent threats to public security.
“Accordingly, it must adopt necessary legal and preventive measures to confront any form of violence that endangers the lives, property, or psychological well-being” of its citizens and society. Within this framework, the rights of millions of peace-seeking Iranians will not be compromised due to the actions of a very limited number of violent individuals,” it said.
It further stated that no international official, mechanism, or human rights body “expect law-enforcement forces to remain indifferent to armed or violent acts occurring simultaneously with or alongside peaceful assemblies, or to allow perpetrators of violence free rein to impose damage, harm, or costs on society and peaceful protesters”.
“Nevertheless, a significant portion of the peaceful and fully lawful protests by some bazaar merchants and members of the public, held in protest of the country’s economic conditions, were exploited — due to foreign interference — by a very small group, and in some cases escalated into violent and even armed clashes with law enforcement forces at protest sites.
“These acts bore no connection to the legitimate demands of the protesters nor endorsed by most of the population.”
At the same time, the statement said, Iranian authorities observed instances of violent unrest perpetrated by a limited number of individuals, including attacks on police stations, the use of incendiary devices such as Molotov cocktails against law enforcement officers and, in some cases, the use of firearms.
“Such actions constitute serious crimes involving violence against people and destruction of public property and fall outside the protective scope of peaceful assemblies under international human rights law.
“It is evident that such violent acts, including the use of weapons and various types of hand-made explosive devices by terrorist groups, not only harm public security and endanger the lives and property of citizens, but also undermine the peaceful nature of protests and give rise to public concern as explicitly underscored in the remarks of the supreme leader on January 3, 2026.”
The statement further added: “Despite the occurrence of violence by some individuals, law enforcement forces have acted with restraint and in accordance with applicable laws, exercising utmost care to restore public order and security while minimising harm and observing human rights principles, including necessity and proportionality.“
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar discussed “current developments in Iran” with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araghchi during a phone call, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
“[The] DPM/FM reaffirmed the importance of sustained dialogue and engagement. Both sides agreed to continue to maintain close contact,” the FO said.







Trump weighing tough options
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday night, Trump said the US may meet Iranian officials and was in contact with the opposition, as he weighed a range of strong responses, including military options, to the protests.
He said Iran called to negotiate its nuclear programme, which Israel and the US bombed in a 12-day war in June.
“The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.”
However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“.
Trump was to meet with senior advisers on Tuesday to discuss options for Iran, a US official told Reuters on Sunday.
The Wall Street Journal has reported that options included military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources.
“The military is looking at it, and we’re looking at some very strong options,” Trump told reporters.
Trump also said that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran, where authorities have blacked out services for four days.
“He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran.







Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday.
‘Not seeking war but fully prepared’
Following Trump’s statement, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran on Monday that “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“.
“We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he said.
Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf earlier warned Washington against “a miscalculation.”

 

“Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.
Near paralysis
In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis.
The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse.
There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown.
One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy.
The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States.
State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel.
Iran has not given an official casualty toll for the protests.
After three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday.
Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”.
The Iranian government on Sunday declared three days of national mourning for “martyrs” including members of the security forces killed.
President Masoud Pezeshkian also urged Iranians to join a “national resistance march” Monday to denounce the violence.
Son of ousted Iran shah urges security forces to ‘stand with the people’
The US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement in the Islamic Republic.
“Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Reza Pahlavi posted on social media.
Pahlavi, who has emerged as an opposition figurehead, also called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag.
“The time has come for them to be adorned with Iran’s national flag, in place of the disgraceful banner of the Islamic Republic,” he said.
In London, protesters managed to swap out the Iranian embassy flag over the weekend, hoisting in its place the tri-coloured banner used under the last Shah.
The ceremonial, pre-revolution flag has become an emblem of the global rallies that have mushroomed in support of Iran’s demonstrations.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the flag swapping, according to the official IRNA outlet.</p><small>2026-01-12 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644715-pakistan-indonesia-closing-in-on-jets-and-drones-defence-deal-say-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Indonesia closing in on jets and drones defence deal: sources</strong></a><br><p>

“Six policemen were martyred in the IED blast,” said a statement from the Tank police spokesperson, adding that their armoured personnel carrier (APC) was targeted within the jurisdiction of the Gomal police station.
“The blast occurred while the APC was on its way to Tank from the Gomal police station,” the statement added.
The martyred included an additional station house officer (SHO), the police spokesperson said.
The bodies were taken to the Tank District Headquarters Hospital by Rescue 1122. Police have sealed off the area and a “massive” security operation was underway, state-run APP reported.
Separately, another IED blast took place near Darra Tang road in Lakki Marwat, which injured three police personnel, according to APP.
According to a police statement, which did not specify the number of the wounded, a SHO and “police personnel were slightly injured and are now out of danger”.
“Fitna al Khwarij targeted the police APC with an IED explosion while they were patrolling near Jabar Khel on Darra Tang Road within the jurisdiction of the Saddar police station.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Subsequently, Lakki Marwat District Police Officer (DPO) Nazir Khan reached the site of the incident and assessed the situation. A search operation was then launched in the area, the police statement said.
It quoted DPO Nazir as saying, “These cowardly acts cannot lower our morale. The Lakki Marwat police are responding vigorously to every challenge and are ready to give every possible sacrifice for the public’s protection.”
The officer asserted that the police were resolutely tackling Fitna al Khwarij, adding that security has been increased in the area.
PM Shehbaz orders probe into Tank attack
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered an “immediate investigation” into the incident and directed that those responsible be brought to justice at the earliest, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
The premier reaffirmed the government’s commitment to completely eradicate terrorism from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed his deep grief over the martyrdom of police personnel in the “terrorist attack”, a statement from his office said.
He paid tribute to the cops’ “bravery and their passion to serve the country”. The president prayed for the martyrs’ elevated ranks and for patience for their families.







KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought an immediate report from the top police officials on the incident, a statement from his office said.
He expressed his deep grief and anger, conveying his condolences to the bereaved families of the martyrs.
“The brave men of KP police embraced martyrdom to protect the lives and property of the people,” Kundi was quoted as saying, adding that he was proud of the martyrs.
“These actions by Indian-backed Fitna al Khwarij cannot dampen our morale,” the governor asserted.
The KP governor urged the PTI-run provincial government to “take practical steps to ensure peace in the province”.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also strongly condemned the attack and hailed the sacrifices of “five policemen”.
“The courageous men of the police sacrificed their today for the nation’s peaceful tomorrow,” Naqvi was quoted as saying by his ministry.
“The great sacrifices of the martyrs will always be remembered,” he added.







National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, in a statement condemning the blast, expressed deep sorrow over the martyrdom of six police personnel.
The NA speaker paid rich tribute to the sacrifices of the law enforcement agencies in the fight against terrorism.
“The martyrdom of police officials is an irreparable loss,” he said, adding that the entire nation was proud of its brave sons who stood against terrorism.
The speaker also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
“The nation stands shoulder to shoulder with its security forces in the fight against terrorism,” Sadiq affirmed.
Recent attacks on LEAs
Law enforcement personnel have increasingly come under attack in KP in recent weeks.
On January 10, a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in Peshawar, while another CTD official was gunned down in Bannu.
The day before, a policeman was martyred after gunmen attacked him in the Bajaur tribal district, while another died in Khyber when gunmen ambushed a car.
Three cops were injured in Bannu on January 8 as a police vehicle transporting prisoners to Hangu came under attack by “terrorists”. Also in Bannu, a former tehsil nazim was injured in a bomb blast outside his office on January 6.
Last month in December, five policemen were martyred when a police vehicle was ambushed in KP’s Karak district. Eight terrorists were killed in an operation launched to hunt down the attackers.
On December 1, a head constable lost his life and five cops were injured in Lakki Marwat when a suicide bo­mber targeted a police vehicle. The same day, a police constable was gunned down by terrorists in Bannu.</p><small>2026-01-12 16:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1219182588a3e1c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966569/jcp-recommends-making-4-ad-hoc-high-court-judges-permanent' target='_blank'><strong>JCP recommends making 4 ad hoc high court judges permanent</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) recommended on Monday that three ad hoc judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and one of the Balochistan High Court (BHC) be made permanent.
The decision was taken during a meeting of the JCP — the key judicial body responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary — chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi.
A press release issued by the Supreme Court of Pakistan after the meeting said: “The commission also recommended, by majority, the confirmation of the following additional judges as judges of the Islamabad High Court … after due consideration of the relevant data form, antecedents and evaluation of material placed before it.”
The commission has recommended the confirmation of Additional Judges Muhammad Azam Khan, Muhammad Asif and Inaam Ameen Minhas of the IHC.
“Similarly, the commission also recommended, by consensus of the present members, the confirmation of Justice Najamuddin Mengal, additional judge, as judge of the High Court of Balochistan,” the press release added.
The JCP, however, did not recommend, by majority, the confirmation of Additional Judge Ayub Khan of the BHC, the press release said.
The five ad hoc judges approved by the JCP will become permanent after the president’s assent.
Among the IHC judges, Justice Azam and Just­ice Minhas were appoi­nted as additional judges to the IHC, whereas Jus­tice Asif was appointed as a judge in the BHC before he was transferred to Islamabad through a presidential order that also brought incumbent IHC CJ Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar to the high court in federal capital.
These transfers and the subsequent elevation of Justice Dogar as chief justice witnessed unprecedented internal discord within the IHC. Several judges appeared as litigants before the Supreme Court, while two judges attended proceedings before the Sindh High Court as private petitioners in the case relating to Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s degree.
In 2025, the IHC decided at least 16,000 cases. Official data shows that Justice Minhas recorded the highest number of disposals, deciding 2,039 cases in his single bench and more than 500 cases in division benches. Justice Mohammad Azam Khan decided 1,841 cases in single benches and around 600 in division benches, while Justice Mohammad Asif disposed of 1,338 cases.
It may be noted that Justice Asif is also facing a complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), in which it has been alleged that he misused his authority to influence proceedings in a hit-and-run case involving his son.
According to the complaint, dated December 25 and submitted by Advocate Inamul Rahim, the incident occurred on December 2 last year near the Pakistan National Council of Arts, where a speeding SUV allegedly driven by Justice Asif’s son struck a scooter, killing two girls on the spot. A judicial magistrate later granted bail to the accused on December 6 after the victims’ families pardoned him in court.
Sources told Dawn that during deliberation on making ad hoc judges permanent in the JCP meeting, IHC‘s Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and IHC CJ Dogar appreciated that Justice Asif did not use his official position to influence the victims’ families soon after the incident. They also acknowledged that the judge visited the bereaved families to apologise.
However, during voting, Justice Kayani and SC Judge Munib Akhtar opposed making Justice Asif permanent.
Deliberation on key institutional, policy matters
The SC press release also said that key institutional and policy matters were deliberated on during the JCP meeting
“The core commission constituted under Article 175A (2) of the Constitution, considered issues relating to the criteria for nomination of judges to Constitutional Benches of the high courts, the procedure for interviews of candidates for judicial appointments, and amendment to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (Appointment of Judges) Rules, 2024, concerning appointments to the Federal Constitutional Court of Pakistan,” the press release said.
It added: “Following deliberations, the commission authorised the committee to examine these matters in detail and to place recommendations before it regarding procedure for interview, and amendments to the rules, ensuring effective and transparent implementation of the constitutional framework.”</p><small>2026-01-12 16:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/122104081a2190b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966579/kp-speaker-swati-seeks-in-camera-briefing-on-military-operations-from-peshawar-corps-commander' target='_blank'><strong>KP Speaker Swati seeks in-camera briefing on military operations from Peshawar Corps Commander</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati has requested the Peshawar Corps Commander to give an in-camera briefing on military operations being carried out in the province’s merged districts, it emerged on Monday.
In a letter dated January 8, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the speaker said that the KP Assembly had constituted a 40-member special house committee on September 8, 2025 to examine the overall security situation in KP.
Swati said that the committee comprised more than 40 members, including the leader of the house, the leader of the opposition, provincial ministers, parliamentary leaders of respective political parties and members of the KP Assembly, reflecting a “broad-based and representative forum of the house”.
The speaker said that in pursuance of the committee’s mandate, it had received detailed briefings from key stakeholders — including from the chief secretary, the additional chief secretary of the Home and Tribal Affairs Department and the provincial police chief — which was regarded as essential input for the committee “prior to the finalisation of its findings and presenting a report to the house”.
Swati said that during the second meeting of the special committee, the members further resolved to engage all political parties and relevant stakeholders across the province.
He also noted that a grand peace jirga was held on December 12, 2025, which “unanimously adopted a comprehensive declaration outlining a roadmap for long-term peace and stability in the province”. He further said that the declaration was also shared with the federal government.
“In continuation of the consultative process, the committee desires to receive a detailed briefing from Headquarters XI Corps, Peshawar, particularly in the context of the ongoing operations being conducted by the federal government and law enforcement agencies in the merged districts of KP,” he said.
“The committee acknowledges the importance of security measures, however, it considers that operations alone, without broader political, social, and developmental initiatives, might not ensure sustainable peace and stability and could risk further unrest in the province,” he said.
“In view of the sensitivity of this matter, I am further directed to request that an in-camera briefing for the special committee kindly be arranged at the KP Assembly on a mutually convenient date and time,” he said.
He said that the committee would highly appreciate the Corps Commander’s cooperation in this regard, which would assist it in discharging its constitutional responsibility.
Security sources, however, said the Corps Commander had not received any such letter and termed sending a direct communique from the office of the KP Assembly speaker a violation of official protocol.
They said that under the Constitutional and administrative framework, the provincial government lacked the authority to directly contact the Corps Commander or General Headquarters (GHQ) for any kind of formal, in-camera or institutional briefing from the military.
“In this regard, the legal and recognised procedure is that the provincial government sends the matter in writing to the federal government; the federal government forwards it to the General Headquarters through the Ministry of Defence and then formal instructions are issued from there to the relevant formation,” a security source said.
Security sources also said that by ignoring clear, established and legal procedure, the PTI government’s act of writing directly to the Corps Commander was not only a violation of Constitutional order but also a deviation from the established institutional principles of civil-military relations.
Sources said that GHQ had authorised the day-to-day liaison or routine coordination but an in-camera briefing was by no means a routine matter, adding that it required the federal government’s approval.</p><small>2026-01-12 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121930304363909.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966574/govt-castigates-kp-cm-for-saying-state-should-give-evidence-of-kabuls-soil-being-used-against-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt castigates KP CM for saying state should give evidence of Kabul’s soil being used against Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The government on Monday took strong exception to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi saying the state should provide evidence of Kabul’s soil being used against Pakistan.
In a media interaction at the home of PTI leader Alamgir Khan on Sunday night, Afridi said that the state should give evidence for the claim that Afghanistan’s soil was being used for terrorism in Pakistan. He said that other countries also shared a border with Afghanistan but they did not have the same complaints.
The clip was also shared by state broadcaster PTV on the social media platform X.







In a post on X, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Afridi was speaking as Afghanistan’s “spokesperson“ which was highly “condemnable and shameful”.
“The whole world has seen evidence of the Afghan Taliban regime’s support for terrorists, and there is also irrefutable evidence that Afghanistan’s soil is being used for terrorist activities,” Tarar said.
“Sohail Afridi has reached the peak of lies and hypocrisy. The Pakistani nation has made immense sacrifices while fighting terrorists,“ he said. He added that whenever the party opened its mouth, they always facilitated terrorists.
“Pakistan’s development is unacceptable to Fitna al Khawarij which is why Pakistan is targeted,” he said. The minister concluded that Afridi needed to “come to his senses”.







Speaking to the media in Islamabad, Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry said that it had been the PTI’s “consistent policy” to create “uncertainty” on national issues, adding that they also refrained from calling perpetrators of terrorism terrorists.
“They are always reluctant to call terrorists terrorists and say things that spread doubt amongst the common man,“ he said.
He also held neighbouring countries responsible for terrorism, saying that one was “investing” while the second was “implementing”.
He took strong exception to Afridi’s remarks, saying: “The KP CM, once again, said in Karachi that we should provide the Afghan government with evidence of terrorist activities.
“Do you still not know who’s behind terrorism?“ he asked. He said that at least two dozen countries had pointed out that Afghanistan’s soil was being used for terrorism.
“They intentionally spread doubt. They do not want military operations. They do not want to expel illegal Afghans and want to negotiate instead of taking action,“ he said.



“There must be a reason for this soft attitude,” Tallal said. “They have something in common, and I’ll say it on record: there has not been even a single attack on any PTI leader, worker, adviser, minister in the past 11 years,“ he alleged, criticising the party for ”spreading doubt“.
“You create ambiguity in the minds of common people, so the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other groups may operate in KP and also get the sympathies of the common man,” the state minister added.
Speaking about the PTI’s street movement, the state minister questioned whether party leaders had taken the time to meet with the families of martyrs.
“You stand against the national narrative because you are a beneficiary,” Tallal said.
“Let me say this again: no matter if you are a chief minister or an ordinary representative, speaking against the national narrative or spreading any doubt will not be tolerated,” he warned.
Speaking about the PTI’s street movement, the state minister said that the PTI “could run 100 political movements“ but having a soft stance on terrorism or forming a narrative in favour of terrorists would be unacceptable.
“We will send you where we are going to send them. If you have such empathy for them, then go to Afghanistan,” Tallal stated.
“Over 1,200 people have been martyred; families and children have been killed in bombings; 60-70pc of incidents take place in KP,“ he added.
“What is more important: to run a street movement or stand alongside our security forces and martyrs against terrorism?”
The state minister accused the PTI of trying to create unrest “so it can be weakened and then blackmailed, and you (PTI) can benefit”.
“There will be no softness,” he warned. “We will not tolerate even a word coming in favour of those terrorists from any of your leaders. We will not tolerate the ambiguity anymore.
“There is no space for terrorism in Pakistan. Sympathisers will be treated like terrorists. If you love Afghanistan that much, then leave or we’ll send you there,“ he said.
The state minister warned that nobody would be allowed to “play with the blood” of Pakistanis, either through narratives or weapons.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal termed Afridi’s remarks “upsetting” and stated that KP witnessed the most terrorist incidents in the country.
“As far as proof is concerned … when we had dialogue with them (Afghan Taliban) in Doha and Istanbul, Afghanistan did not deny that their soil is being used for cross-border terrorism, but they denied that they have control over it,” he said in a video statement posted to X.







“Our demand was for them to take control of the situation.”
The minister questioned whether the KP CM was acknowledging the sacrifices of security forces and civilians and noted that major terrorist attacks, including the bombing outside an Islamabad district court, were linked to Afghanistan.
“If you mistakenly became the chief minister of a province facing such challenges, then please stop giving such upsetting and shameful statements,” Chaudhry said.
“Your statement today is like rubbing salt in the wounds of the families of martyrs and slain civilians,” he added.
The minister then noted that Pakistan had provided evidence and footage on the international stage, which showed terrorists crossing over from Afghanistan.
“Pakistan remains a friendly nation to Afghanistan, but no country forms relations based on internal security,” he said. “We have served the Afghans for 40 years, housing 4 million Afghan refugees as our guests and brothers. There is still a large number of them here.”
“However, Pakistan’s security and the safety of the people are our responsibility and we will fulfil it in any circumstance. Afghanistan also wants the Afghan Taliban regime to ensure that no terrorist group can use its soil to attack Pakistan in these cowardly acts,” Chaudhry added.
“If they continue to attack, we will deal with them and send a message to Afghanistan telling them to stop engaging in this game.”</p><small>2026-01-12 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121756465afa118.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966572/info-ministry-rubbishes-claims-of-pakistan-being-used-as-a-base-for-possible-us-strike-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Info ministry rubbishes claims of Pakistan being used as a base for possible US strike on Iran</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has rejected claims circulating on social media alleging that Pakistan is being used as a base or launch corridor to support the United States for a possible military strike on Iran, which has been rocked by protests in recent weeks.
The ministry’s fact check account on X attributed the claims to “propaganda machineries in Afghanistan“ and Indian accounts, particularly identifying three handles — Khurasan Media Urdu, Baba Banaras and Afghan Defense.
Among them, a post by Khurasan Media Urdu claimed that “special American aircraft have reached Pakistan for an attack on Iran”. The post also mentioned “unusual” flight activity of US aerial refuelling and surveillance aircraft between Pakistan and Iran.
A post by Afghan Defense repeated the claim.
Baba Banaras’ post made a similar claim, stating: “Multiple US reconnaissance aircraft and cargo planes with weapons landed at Dalbandin Airbase and Pasni Airbase of Pakistan. Looks like the game has been set for Iran.”
The ministry’s fact check account said false claims had been made “that the US has moved aerial refuelling (KC-135R) and surveillance aircraft to Pakistan, that these aircraft are conducting unusual flights towards or into Iranian airspace, and that Pakistan is being used as a base or launch corridor to support US stealth fighters (F-35/F-22) for a possible imminent military strike on Iran”.







The post added that while it was true that the activity of US aerial refuelling aircraft had increased, it was not from Pakistan. “Reuters reported the US moved a large number of refuelling aircraft to Europe as Middle East tensions rose,” the ministry clarified, referring to a June 2025 report.
It also referred to a June 2025 report by The Washington Post, which it said mentioned Pentagon dispatching “refuelling aircraft to European bases as posture expanded”.
The ministry’s post further stated: “No credible outlet confirms that US KC-135R/ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) aircraft are operating in Pakistan.”
It reiterated that “US refuelling aircraft movements have been reported, but mostly linked to Europe”.
“No credible proof that US aircraft/ISR are based in Pakistan. No credible proof of Pakistan-to-Iran operational flights for strikes,” it added.
It recalled that Pakistan had “publicly condemned US strikes on Iran” — ostensibly a reference to Islamabad’s stance during a 12-day war between Iran and Israel, during which the US also carried strikes in Iran.
“This clearly denied the ‘Pakistan is facilitating strikes’ story,” the information ministry said. “This is a reckless, blame-pushing narrative that tries to drag Pakistan into a US-Iran conflict without any verifiable evidence.”
It said that the claim that “US aircraft arrived in Pakistan for Iran strikes’ is purely disinformation”.

 

The claims have surfaced as tensions are growing between Iran and the US, with US President Donald Trump warning Tehran of strikes over the crackdown on ongoing protests in the Middle Eastern country. Iran subsequently issued stern statements in response.
On Sunday, the Iranian government — which blames Washington and Tel Aviv for fomenting the unrest — warned the US of retaliation against its military bases and Israel if the Trump administration attacked the country over a crackdown on protesters.
The same day, Trump said he was weighing a range of strong responses, including military options, to action against the protests. He also said, “The leaders of Iran called [yesterday], … a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.”
A subsequent statement by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said “the Islamic Republic of Iran is not seeking war but is fully prepared for war“.
“We are also ready for negotiations, but these negotiations should be fair, with equal rights and based on mutual respect,“ he added.</p><small>2026-01-12 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12192514c0905f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966576/noor-surges-into-world-top-30-after-karachi-open-boosts-pakistani-squash-players-rankings' target='_blank'><strong>Noor surges into world Top 30 after Karachi Open boosts Pakistani squash players’ rankings</strong></a><br><p>Noor Zaman surged in the global squash rankings to break through in the Top 30 on Monday and reach a career best after a scintillating performance at last week’s Karachi Open that saw all six Pakistani players at the tournament improve in the PSA list.
Noor reached world number 30 on the Professional Squash Association (PSA) rankings, having achieved his previous career best of 37 on October 27 after a series of international wins.
The 21-year-old gave former world champion Mohamed Elshorbagy a run for his money as he took the Englishman to five intense games at the Karachi Open quarterfinals before being defeated 3-2, thereby ending Pakistan’s streak at the international championship.

 

Noor, the U23 world champion at the same venue last year, is no stranger to strong comebacks and lengthy, five-game matches. He was narrowly defeated in the fifth game with a match scoreline of 11-2, 11-8, 6-11, 8-11, 11-9.
Former world number one Elshorbagy called Noor one of the most focused players he’s ever seen.
“It’s great for Pakistan to have someone coming up, you guys need another world champion coming up soon since you’re a squash nation, and it’s very exciting for Pakistan to have Noor,” Elshorbagy said after the match.
Ashab Irfan, Noor’s only other compatriot in the Top 50, jumped up two spots for a career best 45 on PSA’s list.
Ashab also gave former world champion Karim Gawad a scare when he took the Egyptian to a five-game match that saw Gawad take the last three games with a scoreline of 7-11, 9-11, 11-8, 11-5, 11-5.
The duo were accompanied by two men and two women, wildcard entrants.
Although veteran player Nasir Iqbal surged 35 places in the ranking to sit at world number 99, he has a career best of 35 achieved in February 2016.
Nasir was Pakistan’s only wildcard entrant to advance to the Round of 16, where he was defeated 3-1 (11-6, 7-11, 11-7, 11-5) by Egyptian teenage sensation Mohamad Zakaria, who won the championship title in front of a packed audience on Sunday.
Like Nasir, Tayyab Aslam surged 50 points in the rankings to reach 149, which pales in comparison to his all-time high of 41 achieved in January 2021.
Tayyab was ousted 3-0 in the first round by Spain’s Iker Pajares (11-6, 11-2, 11-7).
Nasir and Noor were part of Pakistan’s Asian Games squad in 2023 to win a silver medal in the men’s team squash event.

 

Over on the women’s side, Sana Bahadar and Mariam Malik also achieved career-best rankings despite being knocked out of the Karachi Open in the first round.
Sana, who is entirely deaf and cannot speak, broke into the Top 200 to sit at 197. Her previous career best was 212 in Jan 2023. She was defeated 11-4, 11-1, 11-6 by Egypt’s Mariam Metwally.
“I was emotional when I found out Sana is deaf. I’ve never competed against a deaf player before, and it makes me realise how much we take for granted when you see her overcome the obstacles she has to reach this level,” world number 35 Metwally told Dawn after her match with Sana.
PSA’s latest rankings see Mariam at 214, up from 248, also in Jan 2023. Mariam was defeated 3-0 by Sin Yuk Chan of Hong Kong, China (11-2, 11-4, 11-0).
“It’s definitely a big margin to lose by, but it’s also a matter of trust to be playing at a gold level event like this,” Mariam, 22, told Dawn after her match.
“I can’t remember the last time a Pakistani woman player competed at a competition of this calibre, which helps build up local players like myself and my teammates.”</p><small>2026-01-12 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644686-govt-refutes-reckless-claims-us-fighter-jets-using-pakistan-for-potential-iran-strike' target='_blank'><strong>Govt refutes 'reckless' claims US fighter jets using Pakistan for potential Iran strike</strong></a><br><p>

“There have been deeply concerning reports of the Grok AI chatbot account on X being used to create and share undressed images of people which may amount to intimate image abuse or pornography and sexualised images of children that may amount to child sexual abuse material,” Ofcom said in a statement.
The regulator is under pressure to act after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the images produced by Grok were “disgusting” and “unlawful”.







When asked for comment on Monday on the launch of the formal investigation, X pointed to a previous statement in which it said it takes action against illegal content on the platform — including child sexual abuse material — by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.
“Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content,” it said.
Grok images are disgusting: Starmer
The regulator is under pressure to act after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Thursday the images produced by Grok were “disgusting” and “unlawful”.
Musk’s X had to “get a grip” on Grok, Starmer said.
Asked on Monday whether X could be banned, Business Secretary Peter Kyle said: “Yes, of course,” but he noted that the power to do so lay with Ofcom.
Creating or sharing non-consensual intimate images or child sexual abuse material, including AI-generated sexual imagery, is illegal in Britain.
Additionally, tech platforms must prevent British users from encountering illegal content and remove it once they become aware of it.
X has faced condemnation in other countries over the feature, which can produce images of women and minors in skimpy clothing.

 

French officials have reported X to prosecutors and regulators, calling the content “manifestly illegal”, while Indian authorities have also demanded explanations.
X said it has restricted requests to undress people in images to paying users.
Asked about the subject recently, xAI told Reuters: “Legacy Media Lies.”
Ofcom will investigate whether X failed to assess the risk that people in Britain would see illegal content, and whether it considered the risk to children.
Ofcom said in the most serious cases of non-compliance, it could ask a court to require “payment providers or advertisers to withdraw their services from a platform”, or make internet service providers block access to a site in Britain.
X did not immediately reply to a request to comment on the Ofcom investigation.







British Technology Minister Liz Kendall welcomed Ofcom’s investigation.
“It is vital that Ofcom complete this investigation swiftly because the public and most importantly the victims will not accept any delay,” Kendall said in a statement.
“The content created and shared using Grok in recent days has been deeply disturbing,” she said, adding that she would update parliament later on Monday.</p><small>2026-01-12 13:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644673-talal-chaudhry-tells-pti-to-go-to-afghanistan-for-having-so-much-sympathy' target='_blank'><strong>Talal Chaudhry tells PTI to 'go to Afghanistan' for having 'so much sympathy'</strong></a><br><p>

The chief minister is currently on a visit to Karachi, where he staged a rally at the Mazar-i-Quaid on Sunday.
In an address to the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) in Karachi on Monday, Afridi thanked all the SHCBA members for their warm welcome and generous hospitality, adding that people from all over Pakistan — including Pashtuns, Kashmiris, Balochis — of every school of thought were present there.
In contrast to this welcome from the public, however, he decried the provincial government’s treatment of him and his guests in Karachi, saying that they had “desecrated” the honour of the Sindhi ajrak and topi.







“I think every Sindhi will fully condemn this,” he said amid an outcry of support from the crowd.
The KP CM also criticised the fact that the constitution and law were being “toyed with,” saying that it was not only damaging institutions but the whole of Pakistan.
“On one hand, they are selling our national assets — they auctioned PIA on OLX,” he said, referring to the recent auction of the national airline. “But here they have sold justice.”
Afridi added that the general public at least had hope that the judiciary would provide them justice and stand with them.
He said that, although three judges in Islamabad had issued an order that he be allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, “the jail superintendent picks up this order and throws it away”.
“We are accused of protest politics,” he added. “But our Constitution allows us to do this, so we will do protest politics.”
He further claimed that the judiciary was not cooperating with the party, adding that he had called the chief justice repeatedly but received no answer.
“We are being put against the wall, so the only way left is for us to protest,” he said.
The chief minister affirmed that he would always stand beside those who turned out in support of the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, saying, “We have to fight for our rights ourselves … we will not get freedom on a plate.
“If we do not raise our voice, then more pressure will be put on us.”
Afridi further said that the passport of one province’s chief minister had been blocked, saying that the people of the province were being discriminated against.
However, he added that his leader, Imran, had always supported peaceful struggle.
Regarding the economy, the KP CM said that it was facing a very bad situation, with people “fleeing” Pakistan while unemployment had risen to 7.1 per cent.
“These people are building their properties abroad,” he said, adding, “These people are bound to answer to us and one day it will definitely happen”.
The chief minister told the crowd that he had come to Karachi as his [Imran] leader had directed him to call for a street movement and that he hoped for “full support” from them.
Expressing his thanks, he said, “I hope the rule of law will come to Pakistan one day.”
‘No Section 144 can stop us’: Salman Akram Raja
Addressing the ceremony, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said, “We talk about the constitution, we talk about the law, this is our job. No section 144 can stop us”.
“Today, our rights are being attacked again and again,” said the PTI general secretary.
He stressed that the “living Constitution and law” must be restored.
Raja also said that Karachi’s vote had been robbed “in an attempt to take away the rights of the people”.
The PTI leader said that whenever the Constitution had been attacked, the SHC had been the first to raise its voice.
“The Pakistani nation is alive, due to which the chief minister of KP has been elected,” he said. “If the vote is stolen in front of you, if the judiciary is attacked, how can we remain silent? We are an alive and proud people, we have to fight for our rights.”
He added, “This country was not made for the elite. This country is a country of farmers, no matter which province they are from“.
“We stand like a lead wall against oppression.”
SHCBA President Jamali says lawyers will participate ‘fully’ in KP convention
President of the High Court Bar Muhammad Haseeb Jamali, addressing the event, called Sindh a land of peace.
“Along with peace, this land also belongs to those who have raised their voice against oppression,” he said.
The president stressed that the bar would talk about its rights as it was independent and did not belong to any party.
He added that every citizen of this country held equal opportunities under the law.
Jamali further said that lawyers of the bar had protested the 26th Amendment, the 27th Amendment and the issue of Karoonjhar as they happened.
“We are not part of any revenge politics, nor do we support it.”
“Hold a convention in KP — we will participate in it fully,” he said.
“This Pakistan is dear to all of us. Lawyers built the country; lawyers will save it,” he added.
‘Only want supremacy of Constitution’: Amir Nawaz Warraich
Sindh Bar Council Member and head of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) Amir Nawaz Warraich, also addressed the ceremony, welcoming all those present.
He said that when any bad time came about, the bar association raised its voice against it.
“Whenever there is talk of supremacy of law and putting a curb on the Constitution, we raise our voice,” he said. “We do not support any party but only want the supremacy of the Constitution.”
Warraich added that the KBA would continue to protest against the recently passed Constitutional Amendment until the Constitution was restored to its rightful form.
Visit to Mazar-i-Quaid
Earlier in the day, the KP chief minister paid a visit to Mazar-i-Quaid, where he had also criticised the Sindh government’s treatment of the PTI delegation.
Speaking to the media, he called Sindhis a “proud nation” and said that the imposition of “such people” on a proud nation was a cruelty.
“Punjab’s false government also did this; Sindh’s false government also did this,” he said.
However, he said that the people of Pakistan were respectable and proud, and always treated the guests from any province with respect.
“This is not even one per cent of Pakistan that does such actions,” he said. “The remaining 99pc of the Pakistani nation is extremely proud, brave, courageous and hospitable.”







Salman Akram Raja also spoke to reporters at the mausoleum, saying that after “three excellent days” in Karachi, they had seen the public’s “love for democracy, for Imran Khan and for human rights” as well as the force of the state, including its refusal to allow them to hold a rally even after gaining permission.
“This is all a part of Pakistan,” he said. “We are fighting for a beautiful Pakistan, for the realisation of the Quaid’s dream for Pakistan under Imran Khan’s leadership.
“Today, we have come to renew our pledge that we will create that Pakistan.”

Ilyas — a right-hand batter and right-arm leg-spin bowler — played 10 Test matches along with 82 first-class and two List-A games between 1961 and 1976, PCB said in a statement as it expressed its grief following Ilyas’s passing.
PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi also extended his heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the bereaved family, while also paying homage to the late Ilyas for his valuable services to the game of cricket in Pakistan.
Ilyas made his Test debut against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on December 4, 1964 and played his last Test match against England at Dhaka from February 28 to March 3, 1969, according to the national board.







Apart from one Test century, the opening batsman boasted a record of 12 first-class tons, having scored 4,607 runs in the format.
His solitary Test century came in the third Test match of a 2-0 home series win over New Zealand in March-April 1965. He played a masterful 126 while opening the batting as Pakistan hunted down the 202-run target in Karachi to seal the series.
He played twice when England toured in 1968-69, making 42 runs in four innings. Early on his second tour to Australia, he was struck in the face, and he was also accused of indiscipline.
Rather than fly home, he applied for Australian citizenship and ended the season playing grade cricket for Waverley in Sydney. He made his last appearance in Pakistan in the BCCP Trophy final in 1971-72 when he helped PIA to victory.</p><small>2026-01-12 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121736282f78fd3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966555/may-9-riots-punjab-refutes-pti-claims-of-submitting-unrelated-videos-for-forensic-analysis' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 riots: Punjab refutes PTI claims of submitting unrelated videos for forensic analysis</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari on Monday refuted claims by PTI leaders that different and unrelated videos were submitted for a forensic report about the May 9, 2023 riots.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident.
“There are two separate videos [of KP CM] and they should not be confused. One of the videos must be from Zaman Park. However, the other one showing [him] vandalising and lighting fire has been deleted [from the social media account],” she said while addressing a press conference in Lahore.
“When KP chief minister realised that an effort to rebellion which he termed as revolution failed, he deleted the videos [of May 9, 2023] from social media. However, the videos remained in the record,” said Bokhari.
She further claimed their destination was the Corps Commander House, located very close to the Radio Pakistan building. However, they were denied entry there, so they entered the state media building, vandalised it, set fire, and destroyed the records there.
In response to the conviction of identified suspects in May 9 cases, she said those involved in cases in Punjab have been convicted and they were serving their sentences in prison. “We don‘t have any political revenge against anyone,” she said, adding the cases on PML-N leadership in PTI’s tenure were politically motivated.
Speaking on the PTI’s call for a wheel-jam strike on February 8, the information minister said they planned a “new programme of anarchy to subjugate the state and make the law subservient to them, which cannot be made possible”.
The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted.
At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage.
Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad.</p><small>2026-01-12 11:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1216225475179aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966564/president-zardari-to-embark-on-4-day-official-visit-to-bahrain-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari to embark on 4-day official visit to Bahrain tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari will undertake an official visit to Bahrain from January 13-16, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement on Monday.
According to the FO, the president will be accompanied by a “high-level delegation”.
It said that during the visit, the president will hold meeting with Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who is also the prime minister.
“The discussions will focus on bilateral, regional, and international issues of mutual interest,” the FO said.







“The visit seeks to reinforce Pakistan’s longstanding cooperation with the brotherly Gulf nation while expanding opportunities for collaboration in trade and economic partnership, defence and security, and people-to-people ties,” it added.
Last year in November, Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif, during a two-day visit to Bahrain, had reiterated Pakis­tan’s commitment to deepening ties with the kingdom.
Discussing economic relations, the prime minister had unde­r­lined Pakistan’s desire to expand trade and investment and said bilateral trade was set to grow with the Pak­istan-GCC Free Trade Agree­ment.
Earlier in September, Bahrain’s interior minister had visited Pakistan, with the two countries agreeing to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics, and immigration.</p><small>2026-01-12 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644619-kp-assembly-seeks-peshawar-corps-commanders-in-camera-briefing-on-security-situation' target='_blank'><strong>KP Assembly seeks Peshawar corps commander's in-camera briefing on security situation</strong></a><br><p>

India will also be invited to join Pax Silica next month, Gor said, referring to a US-led initiative to build a silicon supply chain from critical minerals to semiconductors and AI.
Trade talks between India and the US fell apart last year and Trump then doubled tariffs on Indian goods in August to 50 per cent, among the world’s highest rates, including a levy of 25pc to punish New Delhi for purchasing Russian oil.
The two nations have been close to a deal on several occasions since they agreed to negotiate in February last year, India said last week.
“Both sides continue to actively engage. In fact, the next call on trade will occur tomorrow,” Gor said in New Delhi as he formally took charge of his position, adding that the two countries will continue to work on issues such as security, counterterrorism, energy, technology, education and health.
The failure to reach a deal has pushed the Indian rupee to a record low and spooked investors waiting for progress in two-way negotiations.
Friends always resolve differences: Gor
Gor’s comments brought some cheer to Indian markets, and the benchmark Nifty 50 recovered 220 points to trade 0.15pc higher as of 12:45pm (12:15pm PKT).
Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal, in comments made elsewhere, also said that New Delhi continues to talk to Washington for a trade deal.
“The United States and India are bound not just by shared interests, but by a relationship anchored at the highest level,” Gor said.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had earlier agreed to target a deal by fall 2025, and more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.

 

To bridge the $47 billion goods trade gap, India pledged to buy up to $25 billion in US energy and boost defence imports.
Reuters has reported that New Delhi and Washington were very close to a trade deal last year but a communication breakdown led to the collapse of any potential pact.
“Real friends can disagree, but always resolve their differences in the end,” Gor said.</p><small>2026-01-12 09:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12124840db4297e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966551/pmd-dismisses-reports-of-extreme-cold-wave-temperatures-to-remain-within-normal-winter-range' target='_blank'><strong>PMD dismisses reports of ‘extreme cold wave’, temperatures to remain within normal winter range</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday said that, according to the latest numerical analysis of weather data, temperatures in the coming days will stay within the “normal winter range,” dismissing reports claiming an “extreme cold wave” expected from January 16 to 25.
In a rebuttal issued today, the PMD said, “Certain social media platforms are circulating misleading and unverified forecasts claiming an extreme cold wave across Pakistan during the period from Jan 16-25 with record-breaking temperatures in the country.”
The weather body dismissed the reports of extreme weather, stating that “No such extreme or historic cold wave is expected during the mentioned period”.
“According to the latest analysis of numerical weather prediction models and observational data, temperatures are within the normal winter range, with no indication of widespread or persistent record-breaking conditions,” PMD said.
It urged the public to rely on official forecasts, warnings and advisories issued by the PMD.

Separately, Weather Updates PK, an independent weather agency, took to X and said that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) “has been indicating a large and rare weather scenario since yesterday” — a polar vortex disruption.
A polar vortex is a large area of low pressure and cold air surrounding both of the Earth’s poles, according to the US National Weather Service.
ECMWF is a service that provides global numerical weather predictions.
It said the forecast had drawn attention on social media, with some platforms claiming that “due to severe Arctic cold winds, record-breaking negative temperature anomalies could be observed in southern Pakistan, including Karachi and its surroundings.”







Weather Updates PK clarified that the forecast made by ECMWF was “long range“ and subject to “change with each passing day”.
The weather body said that no other weather models had yet confirmed the forecast, stating that it was “not right to take it seriously”.
It further added: “However, it is true that a western disturbance is expected between January 18 and 20 […] usually, every western system is followed by a cold wave; however, there is no final confirmation about its intensity yet”.</p><small>2026-01-12 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121058504f27e6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966546/motorways-now-open-for-traffic-say-police-following-partial-closure-due-to-dense-fog-conditions' target='_blank'><strong>Motorways now open for traffic, say police following partial closure due to dense fog conditions</strong></a><br><p>The motorway police have said that all motorways under its jurisdiction have been opened for traffic, after dense fog conditions prompted partial closure of several motorways early on Monday.
In a post on X, the National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) said, “All motorways falling under the jurisdiction of the NHMP have been opened for traffic upon improved visibility”.







Earlier, due to dense and persistent fog conditions, the motorway police had partially closed various key motorways, including sections of the M-2, M-3, M-4, M-5, and M-11.
At 10:25am on Monday, NHMP said on its X account that the M-2 motorway had been closed from Thokar Niaz Baig to Sial Mor, the M-3 motorway remained closed from Faisal Pur to Darakhana, and the M-4 motorway is closed from Shershah to Pindi Bhattian.
While the M-5 motorway is closed from Shershah to Zaheer Peer, and the M-11 motorway is closed from Lahore to Sambrial.







Earlier, the NHMP said that Motorway M-5 was closed from Rohri to Rahim Yar Khan, but it had now been opened due to “improved visibility”.







According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s fog forecast, the M-2 (Pindi Bhattian-Lahore), M-3 (Lahore - Abdul Hakim), M-11 (Sialkot - Lahore), M-4 (Pindi Bhattian - Faisalabad), and M-5 (Multan - Sukkur) were expected to remain in “dense“ fog situation till 11am.



Last week, three people were killed, and 34 others were injured in fog-related accidents in various parts of Punjab.
On January 7, dense fog paralysed road traffic across large parts of Punjab, prompting authorities to close several key motorways.
According to a spokesperson for the NHMP Central Region, the M-4 Motorway from Gojra to Abdul Hakeem and the M-11 Lahore-Sialkot Motorway were closed for all traffic due to severely reduced visibility.</p><small>2026-01-12 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/121221216509650.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966548/australia-moves-india-3-other-countries-to-highest-risk-category-for-student-visas-media' target='_blank'><strong>Australia moves India, 3 other countries to ‘highest risk’ category for student visas: media</strong></a><br><p>Australia has tightened checks for student visa applicants from India, moving it to the ‘highest risk’ category along with Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan, according to Australian and Indian media.
The Times of India reported on Sunday that the re-rating of the countries was out of cycle, quoting Australian media, while the administration said this was triggered by “emerging integrity risks”.
According to the TOI report, the administration did not cite any specific reason for which India had been assigned to a new category. However, it added that the move came after reports of “fake degree busts” in India which had reached international media.







“India alone accounts for almost 140,000 of Australia’s 650,000 international students, and the four nations represent nearly one-third of 2025 enrolments,” the Indian outlet said.
Impact on students
Assessment levels influence not only the documentary burden but also how easily prospective students can plan to study in Australia, according to The Australia Today.
“Higher levels typically require more extensive proof of finances, English proficiency and genuine temporary entrant intentions, among other criteria. These changes can slow processing times, increase applicant costs and discourage applicants if perceived as overly burdensome,” it said.
It added that international education stakeholder groups had stressed that clarity and predictability are essential, especially for countries that contribute significant student numbers and economic activity.
India, in particular, is one of Australia’s largest source markets for international students, it added.
According to the Australian outlet, experts say the latest changes may lead to closer scrutiny of applications from South Asia, but also stress that genuine students still have pathways to study in Australia.
The Australian Department of Education and Home Affairs is expected to publish detailed guidance for providers and agents explaining the basis for the updates and how documentation requirements will be implemented in practice, it said.
“The sector will be watching closely for official documents that could explain whether the Assessment Level changes are temporary or if they signal a longer-term shift in how Australia manages risk across major international student source markets,” it added.
Fraudulent applications
“Authorities have seen evidence of a rise in suspected fraudulent documentation — both financial and academic — from certain source countries during recent visits to South Asia,” The Australia Today said.
Australia’s Minister for International Education Julian Hill, reportedly described Australia as having become “the least worst country of choice amongst the Big Four” destinations for international students — referring to global competitors such as the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.
Hill said that this had prompted a stronger emphasis on documentary evidence and risk filtering to protect visa integrity, the Australian outlet reported.
Meanwhile, The Times of India said that according to experts, Australia now remained the only option among these destinations, as the US, UK and Canada were shutting their doors to foreign students.
“It recently became obvious that student applicants who couldn’t get into those other three countries are increasingly applying to come to Australia, and in many cases we’ve seen an increase in fraudulent financial and academic documents,” TOI quoted Phil Honeywood, chief executive officer of the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA), as saying.
“By placing a number of these countries into the highest risk rating level, it automatically enhances any filtering of the student visa applicants to ensure bona fide study motivation.”
Concerns over ambiguity
While some in the sector acknowledge the importance of maintaining rigour against fraud, the sudden jump in assessment levels — particularly the broad move of multiple large source countries such as India and Bangladesh to AL3 — has prompted questions about how risk is being measured and communicated.
The Australia Today reported that Honeywood had raised concerns about the timing and frequency of assessment level changes.
He said that ambiguity around shifting risk categories was affecting education providers at a critical point in the academic calendar during the first intake of 2026.
According to the outlet, he said that he had had a “long discussion” with Minister Hill about the sector’s concerns, “primarily with two aspects of the assessment level changes”.
“First and foremost, the frequency of change is causing confusion among providers here and agents offshore. Secondly, at the very time we are trying to ensure a good start to the year intake, we appear again as though we are not quite sure which countries we seek to recruit from.”
Honeywood added that educational institutions needed stability and clear policy signals to properly plan recruitment efforts, liaise with agents and support prospective students trying to understand evolving visa requirements, the outlet added.</p><small>2026-01-12 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644569-who-got-what-fresh-toshakhana-records-emerge' target='_blank'><strong>Who got what: Fresh Toshakhana records emerge</strong></a><br><p>

The threatening social media post drew an angry retort from Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, who said “no one” would tell his country what to do.
Washington has imposed economy-crippling sanctions on its island neighbour for decades, but Trump has ramped up the pressure in recent days.

 

US special forces seized Maduro and his wife this month in a lightning raid that left dozens of the ousted Venezuelan president’s security personnel dead — many of whom were Cuban.
Though Maduro’s allies have become interim leaders, Trump has claimed the United States now actually controls Venezuela through a US naval blockade of its vital oil sector.
“THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
“I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE.”
He said, “Cuba lived, for many years, on large amounts of OIL and MONEY from Venezuela. In return, Cuba provided ‘Security Services’ for the last two Venezuelan dictators, BUT NOT ANYMORE!” “Most of those Cubans are DEAD from last week’s U.S.A. attack, and Venezuela doesn’t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years.”







Trump provided almost no details about what potential deal he referred to, or what such an arrangement would achieve.
Asked about it later on Sunday, Trump told reporters travelling with him on Air Force One that he wanted people forced out of Cuba or who “left under duress” to be taken care of.
“Most importantly, right now, we’re going to take care of the people that came from Cuba, that are American citizens, or in our country,” Trump said, without clarifying how this would be achieved under a deal with Havana.
‘Ready to fall’
A week ago, Trump stated that “Cuba is ready to fall,” noting that the island’s economic crisis was worsening and it would be difficult for Havana to “hold out” without receiving heavily subsidised Venezuelan oil.
Earlier on Sunday, the president reposted a message that jokingly suggested US Secretary of State Marco Rubio — a child of Cuban immigrants who concurrently holds the posts of national security advisor, acting head of the US archives, and acting international aid administrator — could also become the president of Cuba.
Trump shared that post with the comment: “Sounds good to me!” Cuba’s president rebuffed Trump’s threatening language, saying the Caribbean island’s residents were “ready to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood.” “Cuba is a free, independent and sovereign nation. No one tells us what to do,” Diaz-Canel wrote on X.
Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez also weighed in to stress that Cuba is within its rights to import fuel from any willing exporter, “without interference or subordination to the unilateral coercive measures of the United States.”
‘Talk, talk, talk’
A Cold War-era US trade embargo has cinched Cuba’s economy beginning in 1962, and since 2000 Havana has increasingly relied on Venezuelan oil provided as part of a deal struck with Maduro’s predecessor, the firebrand leftist Hugo Chavez.
On Sunday in the streets of Havana, retiree Mercedes Simon seemed to dismiss the US leader’s latest bluster.
“Trump is not going to touch Cuba,” the 65-year-old told AFP.
“All the presidents talk, talk, talk” about Cuba, for decades, “but they don’t act.” Marcos Sanchez, a 21-year-old working in the restaurant business, said the two countries should find common ground, “without resorting to violence.”
Trump’s provocative language on Cuba comes as the emboldened American leader has hinted he has other countries in his sights after capturing Maduro.
Trump, who had openly sought last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, has recently threatened Colombia, Mexico, Iran and Greenland.
Some Republican US lawmakers on Sunday lauded Trump for his aggressive comments on Cuba, including Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart from Florida.
“The tyranny in Cuba will not survive the second term of President Trump,” Diaz-Balart posted in Spanish on X, “and Cuba will finally be free after decades of misery, tragedy, and pain.”

According to police, the operation was conducted within the jurisdiction of Mirakhel Police Station on Jhandokhel Road near Shagi Machankhel.
Acting on credible intelligence, CTD Bannu’s Special Weapons and Tactics teams, along with Bannu Police, cordoned off the area and launched the operation. During the action, the terrorists opened fire, prompting effective retaliatory fire by the police and CTD personnel.
Following an exchange of fire, two terrorists were found dead during a search operation. They were identified as Suhail Khan alias Sangri and Ismail alias Usman.
Police stated that both terrorists were involved in attacks on Sheikh Landik and Fateh Khel police check posts, in which eight police constables were injured. They were also involved in attacks on security forces’ convoys and an IED attack on the under-construction Rescue 1122 building.
Weapons and ammunition recovered from the slain terrorists included two Kalashnikov rifles, one pistol, multiple rounds of ammunition, a motorcycle, two mobile phones, two national identity cards, and a card belonging to the proscribed TTP.
Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, along with the Additional IG CTD, commended the Bannu Police and CTD SWAT teams for the successful operation.
The IGP KP stated that intelligence-based targeted operations will continue uninterrupted across the province until terrorism is completely eliminated.
In a separate incident, militants launched an attack on the Nala Kasho police checkpost, using light and heavy weapons.
However, the attack was foiled after retaliatory action by police personnel.
As soon as information about the attack was received, police contingents from Domel and Town Police Station, along with other security forces, immediately reached the site of the incident.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during 2025, according to the “Pakistan Security Report 2025” report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS).
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-12 04:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/120808384ef5a73.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966436/istehkam-pakistan-party-demands-16-smaller-provinces-in-place-of-4' target='_blank'><strong>Istehkam Pakistan Party demands 16 smaller provinces in place of 4</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: President of the Istehkam Pakistan Party (IPP) and Federal Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan has urged political parties to show magnanimity and accept the need for smaller provinces to facilitate the people at their doorsteps.
Speaking at a party workers’ convention at Kamoke, around 50km from Lahore, he said that the IPP has launched a movement for creation of smaller provinces as an immediate and sustainable solution to problems of people living in far-flung areas.
“We will not change the names of provinces; new provinces should be created like in Punjab as North, South, West, and East Punjab. For this purpose, political parties must rise above narrow-mindedness and show magnanimity as it is in everyone’s own interest,” he said.

 

Welcoming support from MQM and other political parties for the proposal of new provinces, he said this would save people’s time and energy and allow their issues to be resolved closer to their doorstep.

Parties must show magnanimity to back the proposal: Aleem

He said that not only Punjab, but Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should also be divided into four provinces each with a new name.
The IPP leader announced linking cities of Kamoke and Gujranwala with the Lahore-Sialkot-Kharian Motorway which will provide these cities access to Islamabad via the Motorway network.
He also announced widening of this Motorway from four to six lanes which will benefit Gujranwala division in general and Kamoke city in particular.
The minister said that the prime minister would be invited to Kamoke and Gujranwala to inaugurate the link Motorway. He said the communications department has carried out important development works in Kamoke, including U-turns and that further projects will be added in future.
He demanded fixing of the minimum price of wheat for farmers at Rs4,000 per maund. He said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should take personal interest in reducing tax rates for the business community so that wheels of industry can move faster.
He said the youth are our future and providing them with dignified employment is our national responsibility.
If all-round development takes place, jobs will be created for the youth through the private sector for which business activities must be accelerated.
The minister also praised the leadership of the Pakistan armed forces for humbling the enemy and earning global respect for the country.

PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident.
The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted.
At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage.
The authorities had provided the video clips and the pictures of CM Afridi, former provincial ministers Taimur Saleem Jhagra and Kamran Bangash, and two other PTI leaders, Irfan Saleem and Amir Khan Chamkani, for analysis. None of them had been nominated in the case.
In the report, the PFSA gave its opinion on two points: whether the videos in the USB were genuine and whether the persons whose profile pictures had been shared appeared in the clips. It said the five individuals, including the CM, were seen in the clips, but did not clarify if the videos were related to the Radio Pakistan attack or any other event.
It, however, said the clips were not edited except for the merger of multiple video clips of different camera views.
A legal expert, privy to the case, said the investigating officer, after this ‘evidence’ could nominate more accused through a supplementary report to the ATC. However, the court can also take cognisance of the matter. Similarly, the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) could also submit an application for the inclusion of the accused persons in light of the forensic report.
‘Unrelated clips’
Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad.
PTI leader Taimur Jhagra said it was interesting that this campaign was against the CM and other individuals never nominated in this case. “The posts with screenshots are very interesting because they have nothing to do with Radio Pakistan. I believe the Punjab lab is simply commenting on whether it thinks the videos are genuine or not. My first video screenshot is of a video that is not even shot in Peshawar… The video is of my condemnation of Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, while in Islamabad,” he mentioned.
The ATC has fixed Jan 26 for the next hearing in the trial.
The ATC is conducting the trial, with 75 accused, including some present and former lawmakers, being indicted on June 3, 2025, on multiple counts. The FIR was registered at the East Cantonment police station on May 10, 2023.
‘Irrefutable evidence’
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the incidents involving arson attacks on Radio Pakistan and toll plazas by the PTI in Peshawar were part of a well-planned conspiracy, and “irrefutable evidence” has surfaced in the forensic report.
Ms Bokhari said the report included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence. She stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting would be brought to justice.
