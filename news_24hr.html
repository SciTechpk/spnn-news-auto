The 2025 floods — perhaps as devastating as the 2022 disaster but with even bigger dimensions, making them among the worst in recent history — have claimed over 842 lives (some sources estimate over 1,000), displaced 1.2 million people, affected more than 4m, mainly in Punjab, and threatened economic losses between $6–10 billion thus far.
Yet, amid the chaos of rescue and relief, a powerful opportunity emerges to document the crisis in real time, harnessing community voices — especially women’s — to build a resilient future. By blending local insights with global best practices, Pakistan can transform this disaster into a catalyst for systemic change.
A nation under water
Perhaps, this is bigger than a war — those have dry spaces and pauses. But here, the battle is against water that advances like a warfront; it is everywhere.
The 2025 monsoon has unleashed a dual assault of river and rain-induced flooding. In South Punjab, districts such as Multan, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan are inundated, with over 4m residents affected and 1,400 villages submerged under 5–10 feet of water.
 
 

In Sindh, the Guddu Barrage braces for peak inflows of 800,000 cusecs by September 10 or 11, putting downstream areas and 1.6 million katcha residents on high alert. Urban centres — Lahore, Rawalpindi, Karachi, and Hyderabad — face flash floods, with clogged drains and 50 per cent higher runoff due to rapid urbanisation.
The echoes of the current crisis bring back bad memories of the 2022 floods, when a third of the country was submerged and 33 million people were displaced. But here’s the scary part: the intensity of the deluge this year — driven by climate change and upstream water coming from India through a destined gradient — exposes persistent vulnerabilities.
Over 100,000 animals have perished, cotton crops face 20pc–30pc losses, and school closures disrupt critical exams. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reports over 155,000 rescues in Punjab alone, yet bottlenecks in boats, helicopters, and supply chains underscore systemic gaps.
The power of real-time planning
Disasters demand more than reactive aid; they require strategic foresight. The World Meteorological Organisation’s (WMO) Integrated Flood Management (IFM) framework emphasises real-time data to balance prevention with sustainable development.
By documenting bottlenecks, inundation patterns, and community experiences now, Pakistan can lay the groundwork for resilient recovery. “Every crisis is a classroom,” says Naseer Memon, a water and disaster risk reduction expert. “Notes taken today — on what fails, what works, and who’s most affected — can rewrite tomorrow’s playbook.”
 
 

The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction’s (UNDRR) Sendai Framework also underscores this, advocating iterative learning to bridge institutional silos.
In Pakistan, where coordination between federal and provincial disaster management authorities often falters, structured documentation can align efforts. The Global Flood Partnership’s worldwide monitoring network shows how satellite data, like Nasa’s Global Precipitation Measurement Mission, predicts patterns, optimising resources.
Similarly, the Google Flood Hub provides important insights and forecasting for floods.
Listen to the women
Women, comprising 60pc of relief and rescue camp populations, face unique burdens: childcare, limited mobility, and risks of gender-based violence. The World Bank’s research reveals women are disproportionately excluded from early warnings and resources, increasing their vulnerability.
In 2022, Pakistan’s failure to include local voices led to mismatched aid; 2025 demands better. Women’s miseries have been reported from Lahore camps and many other places.
 
 

Focus groups in camps — prioritising women — reveal sanitation woes, privacy deficits, and hygiene gaps. Social media posts on various platforms call for resilient housing and disaster risk reduction (DRR) training, echoing Bangladesh’s success with community-led adaptations like elevated homes and floating gardens, which cut flood damages by 40pc.
This is the time to do it differently for women, children, and the elderly. It should go beyond words and rituals.
Bottlenecks and breakthroughs
Rescue operations highlight both triumphs and failures. The NDMA’s app-based alerts enabled 259 swift rescues, but insufficient boats and helicopter shortages stranded families in South Punjab. Supply chains crumble under flooded roads, delaying the UN’s $5 million aid package. Medical facilities strain under 1,117 injuries, with cholera risks looming due to weak disease surveillance.
In urban areas, flash floods paralyse markets like Hyderabad’s, worsened by 10–14-hour electricity breaks. These power outages during rain are universal across Pakistan’s cities and towns, with some areas going without power for days. This aggravates urban flooding, as pumping becomes hampered.
The white elephant of the Water and Power Development Authority has given birth to Hesco and other monsters that have entangled the entire energy supply network. The distribution networks need to be overhauled with complete management change. This must be considered an important step for better preparedness for disaster management, including flood management, in Pakistan.
 
 

Structural issues — leaky canals losing 30–40pc of water, clogged urban drains, nonexistent stormwater management for cities — and non-structural ones, such as absolutely weak land-use planning with no concept of geographical planning, and deforestation across the country, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan, amplify the crisis.
Alleged upstream water releases from India add geopolitical strain; this necessitates basin-level planning for both flood and drought management. Inundation patterns show rapid pluvial buildup in South Punjab’s low-lying farmlands, escalating within 24–48 hours, with 2025 volumes 20pc higher than 2022.
Global lessons, local solutions
So when it comes to learning, there are international case studies that offer blueprints for Pakistan.
Japan’s Yokohama uses public-private detention systems to manage 82 mm/hour rainfall, slashing runoff by 75pc via permeable pavements. Jakarta’s tidal barriers and community warnings tackle pluvial-fluvial overlaps, while Shenzhen’s spatial planning curbs urban inequities. Bangladesh’s community radio saved lives during the 2013 cyclones, and its Netherlands-backed Delta Plan 2100 pioneers sustainable flood defences. Bangladesh’s flood experiments foster collaborative capacity-building, a model for Pakistan’s fragmented response.
The Associated Programme on Flood Management (APFM) champions participatory vulnerability assessments, ensuring gender equity. A global review of 80 documents stresses context-specific research to empower communities. Pakistan’s 2022 “build back better” approach — elevated housing — reduced future damages; broader inclusion of locals closed response gaps.
To operationalise real-time planning, stakeholders can adopt this checklist, inspired by global frameworks like the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s after-action reviews and WMO’s Integrated Flood Management tools:

Document daily: Log rescue bottlenecks, supply chain delays, and medical gaps by PDMAs/NDMA and the Revenue Department. This needs to reflect what one observes, how people express their problems, and the important solutions they offer. Never underestimate their knowledge. Local people are the first responders. This daily diary should be available at least at the tehsil level.
Map patterns: Use satellite data to track inundation trends, focusing on prone areas. Initiate the marking of water levels, mapping water gradient patterns and lines, and other important on-ground information that can be highly helpful for planning.
Engage communities: Seek input from communities, especially women,  to capture needs, prioritising hygiene and safety.
Assess infrastructure: Identify failing assets, noting where, why, and to what extent.
Integrate urban-rural plans: Address pluvial-fluvial synergies via climate modelling. As some towns have been flooded first by rainfall and then by river overflows during emergent conditions, prepare a long list at the tehsil level.
Evaluate and learn: This should be a weekly task for one or two hours by respective PDMAs and the revenue departments. The regular meetings carried out in different offices, mainly led by deputy commissioners, the PDMA, or local ministers and legislators (or ministers on special duty), focus on key urgent problems, but these are rarely minuted; when done so, they provide superficial information rather than the crucial discussions that take place. This must be given time and a dedicated role so that when floodwaters recede, they provide both geographical and spatial problem and solution lists. Conduct post-flood audits to refine strategies, ensuring gender-sensitive aid.

The 2025 floods are not just a disaster — they’re a call to reimagine resilience. By weaving community voices, especially women’s, into real-time planning, Pakistan can break the cycle of devastation. Notes scribbled amid the deluge — on bottlenecks, patterns, and solutions — can become the cornerstone of a safer, stronger nation. With global wisdom and local resolve, this crisis can spark a revolution in preparedness, ensuring no flood catches us off guard again.

Lyari and Malir rivers serve as Karachi’s main storm drains, channeling rainwater through a network of nalas into the Arabian Sea. Once natural seasonal streams, they are now heavily constricted by urban sprawl, encroachments, and solid waste, turning many drains into open sewers. This blockage reduces their capacity to carry stormwater, causing frequent urban flooding during monsoon downpours.
“So far 318 people have been rescued [and] moved to safe [places] from around the [areas] close to Lyari Naddi (drain) and teams are still present on ground,” the mayor posted on X. “All major arteries of the city as well as underpasses are clear and open for traffic,” he added.
 






Meanwhile, the Sindh government had ordered the closure of all educational institutions in Karachi following the heavy monsoon rains and a weather advisory from the Met Office.
“All the educational institutions (public/private) will remain closed within the territorial jurisdiction of Karachi Division,” said a notification by the Karachi commissioner, dated September 9.
A notification issued yesterday by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecasted “intermittent rain/wind-thunderstorm” today with maximum temperatures ranging from 27 to 29 degree Celsius.
“The minimum temperatures are expected to range between 25 and 27 degree Celsius, with 85 to 95 per cent humidity in the morning and 80 to 90pc in the evening,” the notification mentioned. As of 8am on Wednesday, Karachi had received 47.7mm rainfall, according to PMD.
Last night, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah instructed the Rescue 1122 teams and the district administration to work through the night and evacuate people trapped in rainwater, shifting over 350 citizens to safety.
According to Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan, joint efforts with the Pakistan Army resulted in the rescue of 10 people in Saadi Town.
“Near Saima Society, two men, three women and six children were safely moved,” Khan told Dawn.com. “Eight people were trapped in Nashr Basti and Isa Nagri due to waterlogging,” he added.
Due to widespread rain, two teenagers had also died from electrocution yesterday and ano­ther had drowned in the city.
The Met office said the deep depression that had been causing rains in Karachi and Sindh would gradually move towards Balochistan and turn into a well-marked low-pressure area.
Several hundred straw-mud houses in the rural areas of Tharparkar and Dadu districts were swept away as the two districts had been receiving intermittent heavy, moderate and light spells of monsoon rains for the last six and four days, respectively.

The 28-year-old Arshad, who stunned the athletics world by throwing the javelin at an Olympic record 92.97 metres distance to achieve glory for Pakistan at the 2024 Paris Olympics, was seen preparing for the Sept 13-21 global spectacle at the Punjab Stadium in Lahore just a few hours before leaving for Tokyo via Bangkok.
And the celebrated player during practice attempted throws at distances above 85 metres, showing he is in good shape for the challenge in Tokyo.
“I always target to do my best in every event and I am going to Tokyo with the same mission with high hopes. And rest is on my God; He will do better,” Arshad told reporters after completing his final practice session.
Answering a volley of questions about his competition against India’s Neeraj Chopra, Arshad said: “My competition is always against Arshad Nadeem, I have my competitions against myself.
“I am in a good shape and well prepared for the contest in Tokyo,” the Mian Channu-born prodigy who earned an Olympic gold for Pakistan after 40 years, added.
“Most of the other main rivals in Tokyo [javelin throw event] are same who were at the Paris Olympics, so it will be good contest.”
Arshad will feature in the qualifying round of the javelin throw event on Sept 17 while the final round is scheduled for Sept 18.
 
 

After the Paris Olympics, Arshad missed two Diamond League meetings — in Silesia, Poland and Zurich, Switzerland — last month due to fitness problems after he had clinched gold at the Asian Athletics Championship held in Gumi, South Korea in May this year with an 86.40-metre throw. In August, he was undergoing rehabilitation in England under the supervision of Dr Ali Sher Bajwa.
“I am thankful to the nation and media for supporting me every time. I need more prayers from them to again lift the Pakistan flag with a gold medal in the coming competition [in Tokyo],” he said.
“I regret that I could not feature in the last two Diamond Leagues but the decision was taken just not to take any risk before the World Championships,” he added.
Meanwhile, Dr Asad Abbas Shah, one of Arshad’s doctors, said that the 1.92-metre athlete was in best physical shape.
“Yesterday, Arshad passed all the fitness tests; that is a good news that he has recovered from his calf injury,” Dr Asad said while talking to reporters.
Meanwhile, Arshad’s coach Salman Butt avoided talking to the media. When he was asked about the estimated distance of Arshad’s throws he made during practice at the Punjab Stadium on Tuesday, the coach said that they were not measured.
POA SCHOLARSHIP
Arshad, on the occasion, also received an Olympic scholarship from Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) president Arif Saeed who visited the Punjab Stadium to personally give the scholarship to Arshad while witnessing him practise.
Under the scholarship, Arif said, Arshad would get $1,125 per month for 36 months till the 2028 Los Angles Olympics.
According to Arif, the POA had got similar scholarships for six other athletes of shooting, table tennis and taekwondo.
Arshad thanked the POA president and hoped the scholarship would help him prepare better for the Los Angles Olympics.

• US distances itself from attack, though White House says it was ‘informed’
• Qatar PM warns Doha reserves right to respond
• Pakistan calls for holding Israel accountable for destabilising already-volatile region
• World leaders flay Tel Aviv for ‘violation of international law’
• Aid flotilla defiant after being hit by drone
DOHA: Expanding its web of unlawful military actions in the region, Israel launched a surprise airstrike against Qatar — which has been instrumental in trying to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza — that claimed the lives of five people.
The strike, which the US had advance information of, targeted the Hamas negotiating team, drawing widespread condemnation and sharp reactions from global leaders and states.
Qatar’s prime minister warned his country reserved the right to respond to Israel’s deadly attack, calling it a “pivotal moment” for the region.
“Qatar… reserves the right to respond to this blatant attack,” Prime Minister Sheikh Moha­mmed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani told a press conference.
“We believe that today we have reached a pivotal moment. There must be a response from the entire region to such barbaric actions,” he added.
The attack came shortly after a boat in the Samud Flotilla, heading to Gaza, was targeted by an Israeli drone, off the coast of Tunisia.
Hamas said that five of its members had been killed in the attack, including the son of Hamas’s exiled Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya. However, Al Hayya was said to be safe and Hamas political bureau member Suhail al-Hindi told Al Jazeera that the group’s top leadership had survived the attack.
 
 

Several explosions were heard in Doha on Tuesday and plumes of black smoke were seen billowing from the city’s Legtifya petrol station.
Next door to the petrol station is a small residential compound that has been guarded by Qatar’s Emiri Guard 24 hours a day since the beginning of the Gaza conflict.
Ambulances and at least 15 police and unmarked government cars thronged the streets around the blast site an hour after the strike.
Qatar’s interior ministry said a member of the security forces was also killed in Israel’s attack.
White House ‘on board’?
“The Trump administration was notified by the United States military that Israel was attacking Hamas,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, declining to add details when asked to clarify how the military obtained that information.
But Qatar denied receiving advance warning from the US, saying the notification came after the attack had already started.
“Statements circulating about Qatar being informed of the attack in advance are false. The call received from an American official came as explosions sounded from the Israeli attack in Doha,” Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari posted on X.
 






But the White House also distanced itself from Israel’s strikes, with Leavitt saying that while eliminating Hamas was a “worthy goal”, a strike in the Qatari capital “does not advance Israel or America’s goals”.
In his call with the Qatari leader, Trump “assured them that such a thing will not happen again on their soil.”
Asked if he had made that clear to Netanyahu, Leavitt replied that Trump had “overstressed the importance of peace in the region” in his call with the Israeli premier.
Pakistan’s reaction
The Foreign Office condemned the Israeli aggression against Qatar in the strongest possible terms. “This highly provocative and reckless action constitutes a blatant violation of Qatar’s sovereignty as well as international law, the UN Charter, and the established norms governing interstate relations”, it said.
This reckless action by Israel is yet another manifestation of its continued disregard for international peace and security, and its policy of destabilising the region, it said.
 






Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif telephoned the Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani to condemn the unlawful and heinous bombing in Doha by Israeli forces. Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar also denounced the Israeli attack on Doha, saying that targeting civilians and sovereign territory was an indefensible act of aggression.
 






World response
The Israeli action was met with condemnation from nearly all quarters.
Speaking to media, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the Israeli strikes are a flagrant violation of sovereignty and the territorial integrity of Qatar. All parties must work towards achieving a permanent ceasefire, not destroying it.”
“There’s some really serious news right now: Israel’s attack on some Hamas leaders in Qatar. The entire situation is very serious,” Pope Leo said outside his summer residence. Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas condemned the Israeli air strikes, warning they threatened regional security.
 
 

The United Arab Emirates, which normalised relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords in 2020, called the Israeli attack on Doha “blatant and cowardly”.
Regional power Saudi Arabia denounced what it called a “brutal Israeli aggression” against Qatar’s sovereignty.
Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Israel’s attack on Hamas officials in Qatar is ‘dangerous’ and a ‘violation of international law’.
Attack on flotilla
Activists on a Gaza aid flotilla that was targeted by a “drone attack” remained “determined” to reach the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.
The flotilla organisers had said late Monday that one of their boats was hit by a suspected UAV off the coast of Tunisia, but authorities there said “no drones” had been detected.
But security footage posted by the flotilla organisers later showed a burning mass falling from a distance onto the ship.
 






Some members of the flotilla said they saw the drone, adding that the boat’s bow caught fire immediately after.
Also, former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan, in a social media post, said that the Israeli attack represents the worst form of brutality, while the rulers and generals of the Islamic world facilitate Israel by remaining silent, neutral, or limiting themselves to empty statements.­

Headed by Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza, the team was formed on the directions of the Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelam to take up the task of recovering the missing woman, Fouzia Bibi, and submit a report to the court on Sept 18.
The complainant, Hameedan Bibi, the mother of the woman, had claimed that her daughter had suddenly gone missing in May 2019.
She said Fouzia’s in-laws claimed that she had been ‘kidnapped/taken away’ by a djinn, leaving the police groping in the dark since the launch of the FIR.
Lahore Investigation DIG Zeeshan Raza told Dawn the chief justice took ‘strict notice’ of the incident when the police high-ups informed that the woman could not be recovered despite all possible efforts.

LHC summons CCPO on 18th

In the last hearing on Sept 2, he said, the CJ had directed Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Bilal Siddique Kamyana to appear in person along with the missing woman on Sept 18.
The DIG declared it a tough case saying that several ‘strange’ factors associated with this ‘kidnap’ case had baffled the police since the registration of the FIR.
The most irrigating part of the case for investigators was that the in-laws of the woman had kept on insisting that Fouzia was taken away by the djinn.
 
 

He said the case had been investigated under the supervision of the two chiefs of the then Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Lahore — Capt Liaqat Ali Malik and Asim Iftikhar — but they failed to trace the woman.
He said police also opted for geofencing, a technique that is increasingly used in some challenging cases, to trace the individuals’ movements and activities within a specific time frame but to no avail.
Mr Zeeshan said they also obtained the call details records (CDRs) of over 800 mobile phone numbers in order to reach the missing woman.
“We have done polygraph test of many relevant people in this case,” the DIG said, adding that the results, however, brought no positive development.
To a question, the police officer said the case may be associated with her ‘mismatched marriage’ as she was 35 years old while her husband was in his teens.
She might have been forced to marry the young man against her will and this marriage might be the leading factor behind the ‘incident of kidnap’, he said.
The DIG said police officers questioned many members of both families, including her husband, mother-in-law and other relatives.
Some of the family members claimed that the missing woman was unwilling to bear children and used to visit ‘Hakeems.’ Reportedly, she also opted for abortion. Despite this, she later gave birth to a son.
To another question, he said: “It seems the woman had deliberately gone somewhere as she was unhappy with her marriage.”
He said the woman had no CNIC, a key point that rendered the police investigators helpless in tracing her.
“The woman did not have any record in Nadra database,” he said.
The police investigators also took help from the Punjab Safe City Authority and privately installed cameras besides contacting several local residents.
“Now we have little options to resolve the case,” Zeeshan Raza said. However, he expressed the hope that the police would resolve the case.

“Aircraft have used weapons against hostile objects,” Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on social media, adding: “We are in constant contact with NATO command.”
The incursion came as Russia unleashed a barrage of strikes across Ukraine, including in the western city of Lviv, around 50 miles (80 kilometres) from the Polish border.
Russian drones and missiles have entered the airspace of NATO members — including Poland — several times during Russia’s three-and-a-half-year war, but a NATO country has never attempted to shoot them down.
A cornerstone of the Western military alliance is the principle that an attack on any member is deemed an attack on all.
The operational command of Poland’s military slammed the “unprecedented” airspace violations, saying it had spotted around a dozen drone-type objects and downed some of them.
“This is an act of aggression that has created a real threat to the safety of our citizens,” it said.
Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that weapons had been used against the invading objects, saying on social media that an “operation related to multiple violations of Polish airspace is underway”.
The Polish government announced it will hold an “extraordinary” cabinet meeting at 8am (11am PKT).
‘Provocation’
The operation came as authorities closed the airspace over part of the country, according to a statement from Warsaw’s main Chopin Airport, where flights were halted.
It comes a day after Poland’s newly elected nationalist President Karol Nawrocki warned that Russian leader Vladimir Putin was ready to invade more countries after launching his war in Ukraine.
“We do not trust Vladimir Putin’s good intentions,” Nawrocki told reporters Tuesday at a press conference in Helsinki.
“We believe that Vladimir Putin is ready to also invade other countries.”
NATO-member Poland, a major supporter of Ukraine, hosts over a million Ukrainian refugees and is a key transit point for Western humanitarian and military aid to the war-torn country.
Last month, Warsaw said a Russian military drone flew into its airspace and exploded in farmland in eastern Poland, calling the incident a “provocation”.
Poland in 2023 said a Russian missile had crossed into its airspace to strike Ukraine.
And in November 2022, two civilians were killed when a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile fell on a village near the border.</p><small>2025-09-10 06:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/101131472314c87.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940839/hundreds-of-chinese-other-foreigners-stranded-in-gb-for-second-day' target='_blank'><strong>Hundreds of Chinese, other foreigners stranded in GB for second day</strong></a><br><p>GILGIT: Hundreds of Chinese nationals, foreign tourists and students remained stranded on the second day on Tuesday at Sost as protesters blocked Khunjerab Pass Immigration Office’s entry and exit points on the Pakistan-China border.
Officials said a large number of Chinese nationals, students, foreign tourists couldn’t travel to China through Khunjerab Pass on the second day as the GB protesters did not allow travel at KKH between the two countries.
The stranded Chinese nationals and foreign tourists protested with local police for not arranging their departure to China. Officials said a large number of Chinese nationals protested and exchanged hot words with officials.
The GB people and traders have been staging a protest sit-in and blocking the Karakoram Highway for the last 51 days against collection of Sales Tax, Income Tax and Excise Tax by the federal government from the GB people. They say that collection of any tax from the GB people by the federal government is illegal as they have no representation in Pakistan’s parliament and they are not part of Pakistan according to Constitution of Pakistan.

Protesters block KKH at Sost till acceptance of their demands, suspending travel between Pakistan and China through Khunjerab Pass

GB Assembly member from treasury bench advocate Amjad Hussain, who is also PPP president of GB chapter, told GB Assembly that talks with the federal government are under way to settle the issue.

Advocate Amjad Hussain is also the member of a committee formed by the GB chief minister to hold talks with the federal government committee to resolve the issue.
In first meeting between representatives of the GB committee and the federal government committee, the federal government had admitted that collection of Sales Tax, Income Tax and Excise Tax from GB people and traders is illegal.
Advocate Amjad Hussain told the GB Assembly the issue will be resolved soon.
Opposition members of GB Assembly Javed Ali Manwa, Raja Zakaria and Syed Sohail Abbas criticised the GB government and federal government for prolonging the issue and not resolving it immediately.
Protesters at the sit-in said that instead of solving the genuine issues, the GB government is planning to start a crackdown against them and warned the government to be ready for dire consequences if it tried to crack down against the protesters.
The protest sit-in on the KKH is being staged on the call of all traders’ bodies of Gilgit-Baltistan. Gulsher Khan, one of the protest sit-in organisers, said the federal and GB governments are not serious in resolving the issue.
He said protesters have been demanding their rights under the Constitution of Pakistan and laws. He said Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) could not collect federal taxes from GB people and its traders as the people of the region have no representation in Pakistan’s parliament and therefore the federal government could not collect taxes from the people of the region.
He said over 200 consignments imported from China have been stuck up at the Sost Dry Port for the last 10 months and because of this, traders of GB have been facing losses of billions of rupees.
Another organiser of the protest, Ebad Nagari, said that policies of FBR have made thousands of GB people jobless.

This is particularly true when that investment happens early, from conception to two years of age, when the brain and body grow at their fastest, requiring adequate amounts of essential nutrients.
The returns are real: they are seen in children who grow and develop well, stay healthier, remain in school longer and grow into productive adults. Good nutrition reduces healthcare costs, strengthens communities, and drives national progress.
But the reverse is equally true — when this investment is missed, the costs are devastating, with inaction projected to cost $41 trillion globally over the next 10 years. Malnutrition robs children of their potential and nations of their future. It weakens bodies and impairs cognitive development, locking families into cycles of poverty that can last for generations.
The world is off track to end malnutrition — a crisis that contributes to nearly half of all deaths among children under five and one in five maternal deaths.
In Pakistan today, nearly 40 per cent, and in the poorest quintile 50pc, of children are stunted. Stunting means a child is too short for their age, signalling prolonged inadequate nutrition, which affects not only growth in length, but also short- and long-term health and development, and is largely irreversible.

Nutrition is Pakistan’s best investment.

These risks are compounded in times of crisis. The recent flash floods in Pakistan illustrate how quickly climate shocks can undo progress: crops destroyed, livelihoods lost and families displaced. In such emergencies, women and children face the greatest burden — with disrupted access to food, healthcare and safe water, the dangers of malnutrition intensify.
Targeted interventions during pregnancy and early childhood are critical, particularly for the poorest households. Across Pakistan’s provinces, 73-87pc of all households cannot afford a diverse, nutritious diet, with cost being 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than households’ current food expenditure (Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, 2024). This results in large dietary gaps, even larger among the poorest households, leaving much of their food and nutritional needs unmet.
 
 

Global evidence shows that the most effective nutrition programmes combine specialised nutritious foods, access to maternal and child health services, social and behaviour change, communication to promote breastfeeding and complementary feeding, to improve diets within the families’ means.
Pakistan’s Benazir Nashonuma Program­­me stands as an evidence-based global example of these best practices. Implemented under the Benazir Income Support Programme, Nashonuma combines conditional cash transfers, integrated health services, nutrition counselling, and specialised nutritious foods for pregnant and breastfeeding women and children under two.
The specialised nutritious food provided — Maamta for mothers and Wawamum for children — consists of 50-75 grams of nutrient-packed paste made from chickpeas and other ingredients such as vegetable oil, skimmed milk powder and vitamin and mineral premix, designed to fill critical nutrient gaps during pregnancy, breastfeeding and early childhood.
In many low-income households, diets are repetitive, often consisting of foods of just one to three of eight food groups, dominated by cereals, and lacking nutrient-rich foods such as eggs, milk, fish, fruit and vegetables.
The specialised food does not replace daily meals, it fills critical nutrient gaps that current diets of this target group cannot address, es­­p­ecially during pregnancy and early chi­ldhood. For long-term impact, it must remain part of the comprehensive pac-kage while efforts to improve dietary di­­v­ersity continue.
The model is showing promising results according to preliminary results of an independent impact evaluation. While no single approach can solve the nutrition crisis alone, such evidence underscores that when interventions are comprehensive, targeted and delivered at scale, they can move the needle quickly.
For Pakistan, investing in early life nutrition, especially during the first 1,000 days, is a smart economic strategy, and as the country responds to ongoing floods, protecting early life nutrition must remain a priority. This aligns with Pakistan’s commitments under the Sustainable Development Goals and the Scaling Up Nutrition Movement.
The country already knows what works. The task now is to sustain and strengthen proven approaches, ensure they reach the most vulnerable households, and safeguard the core elements that make them effective, including targeted nutrition support.

The decision comes as part of a change in the company’s business strategy.
According to a letter posted on the company’s website and sent to its authorised dealers, Yamaha will continue to supply spare parts through its authorised network, ensuring adequate stock to meet dealer requirements. The company also reiterated its commitment to providing warranty services and customer support under the existing warranty scheme.
YMPL had been producing four models with prices ranging from Rs429,500 to Rs493,500. The Yamaha YBR125, initially launched at Rs129,400, saw its price rise to Rs471,500 due to the devaluation of the rupee and escalating production costs.
In 2012, Yamaha announced plans to invest $150 million in a new assembly plant at Bin Qasim Industrial Park in Karachi. The plant was initially expected to produce 45,000 units annually and achieve an 85pc localisation target within 10 years.
 
 

At the time, the company began with 25pc localisation and hired around 200 people for assembly and office work in the first phase.
The FY16 marked the assembly of two-wheelers and the company assembled and sold 20,100 units and 16,109 units, respectively. The company’s production and sales peaked in FY19, with Yamaha assembling 24,811 units and selling 23,610 — the highest figures in its nine-year journey in Pakistan. However, production and sales began to decline, and by FY25, Yamaha’s output and sales hit a record low, with only 4,300 units produced and 5,709 sold.
Despite some improvement in the first half of FY25, with 500 units assembled and 586 units sold in July (compared to just 100 and 302 units, respectively, in July 2024), Yamaha faced increasing competition from dominant players like Honda, Suzuki, and Chinese assemblers.
Mohammad Sabir Sheikh, an authorised Yamaha dealer on Akbar Road, attributed the slowdown to falling consumer incomes and a shift in demand towards lower-priced bikes, typically in the Rs100,000-150,000 range. Yamaha’s focus on higher-end models limited its appeal to the mass market.
“The closure of an organised Japanese assembly plant is troubling news for vendors and dealers across the country,” said Sheikh.
He noted that many Chinese bike assemblers, unable to compete with Honda’s popular CDI70cc bike in terms of quality and reliability, had already shut down.
Currently, only 10-12 of the 70 licensed bike assemblers in Pakistan are active, with many others pivoting towards electric bikes (EVs). “The future is EV, and it may take two to three years to transition from petrol-powered to electric bikes,” said Sheikh, highlighting that even Atlas Honda, the leader in the petrol bike market, had ventured into electric vehicles.
A vendor, who wished to remain anonymous, pointed out that Yamaha’s localisation levels were low, which kept prices high as the company relied heavily on imported parts.
Additionally, the preference for larger bikes, capable of carrying multiple passengers, worked against Yamaha, whose models were seen as less practical for local consumers.
Despite these challenges, Pakistan’s motorcycle production rose to 1.692 million units in FY25, up from 1.234 million in FY24, reflecting the growing demand in the sector.

Following a recent agreement to harness natural resources, a US delegation visited the Ministry of Maritime Affairs on Tuesday. Federal Secretary Syed Zafar Ali Shah briefed the delegation on Pakistan’s port facilities, operational capacities, and investment opportunities.
The delegation was informed that Karachi Port handles 54pc of Pakistan’s trade, with an annual capacity of 125 million tonnes. The port’s infrastructure includes three private container terminals, bulk and liquid cargo facilities, and dry cargo berths. It has recently improved its global ranking to 61st among 405 container ports, and successfully managed the country’s largest vessel, measuring 400 metres.
 
 

Discussions also centred on investment prospects at Port Qasim, particularly in bulk, break-bulk, containerised cargo handling, and off-dock terminals. The Port Qasim Authority (PQA) chairman highlighted ongoing projects such as dredging navigation channels, the development of a coastal economic zone, and plans for LNG terminals and multipurpose cargo terminals.
The delegation showed particular interest in LNG terminals and bulk cargo handling, recognising Pakistan’s ports as critical assets for economic development.
Meanwhile, Kazakhstan’s interest in Pakistan’s ports was underscored in a meeting between a Kazakh delegation, led by Transport Minister Nurlan Sauranbayev, and Pakistani officials at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.
The delegation discussed expanding maritime cooperation and enhancing multimodal transport corridors connecting Central Asia to the Arabian Sea. Pakistan’s ports, including Karachi, Port Qasim, and Gwadar, were identified as key facilitators for Central Asian trade.
Federal Secretary Shah emphasised the strategic position of Pakistan’s ports, offering access to South Asia, Central Asia, and the Gulf. Kazakhstan could benefit from container handling, logistics, and off-dock terminals under the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor, he noted. KPT and PQA officials also highlighted spare capacity to handle Central Asian cargo.

The PM directed FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial to finalise the directory within a week so it could be tabled at the upcoming cabinet meeting for formal approval prior to its public release.
An official told Dawn that the new directory will differ from earlier editions by including both declared incomes and corresponding tax payments. Previous directories only listed contributions, omitting income details, many of which appeared understated.
“This decision requires formal cabinet approval,” the official said.
 






The PM issued the directive during a high-level meeting on FBR-related matters held on Tuesday.
The FBR last issued the directory on Sept 18, 2020, covering returns filed up to Sept 14 that year, along with a separate parliamentary directory for 2019.
Since then, no directory has been made public — first under the PDM-led government, then during the caretaker setup, and now under the current coalition.
 
 

According to a PM Sec­r­e­tariat announcement, the premier ordered early completion of the directory.
He stressed that responsible citizens who fulfil tax obligations form the backbone of the economy and should be publicly recognised, while decisive action must be taken against tax evaders.
The prime minister also instructed the FBR to promote a business-friendly environment, provide facilitation to taxpayers, and recruit professionals to help trace tax evaders and recover dues.

In choosing Lecornu, 39, to replace Francois Bayrou as the seventh premier of his mandate, Macron has plumped for one of his closest allies rather than seeking to broaden the appeal of the government across the spectrum.
Macron has told Lecornu “to consult the political forces represented in parliament with a view to adopting a budget for the nation and making the agreements essential for the decisions of the coming months”, the Elysee announced.
Bayrou, who survived just nine months in office, submitted his resignation to Macron earlier on Tuesday, a day after parliament ousted the government.

Unlike some of his predecessors, Lecornu is not known to have presidential ambition

The formal handover of power between Bayrou and Lecornu is due to take place on Wednesday at midday.
The French president has in the past been notoriously slow in casting a new prime minister. But this time he has taken less than a day given the risk of financial and political instability.
“Emmanuel Macron is now in the front line to find a solution to the political crisis,” said the Liberation daily.
France’s borrowing costs, a measure of investor confidence, surged slightly higher than those for Italy, long one of Europe’s debt laggards.
“The president is convinced that (under Lecornu) an agreement between the political forces is possible, while respecting the convictions of each,” said the Elysee.
Bayrou had blindsided even his allies by calling a confidence vote to end a lengthy standoff over his austerity budget, which foresaw almost 44 billion euros ($52bn) of cost savings to reduce France’s debt pile.
In the end, 364 deputies in the National Assembly voted that they had no confidence in the government, while just 194 gave it their confidence.
Fifth PM in three years
Bayrou was the sixth prime minister under Macron since his 2017 election, and the fifth since 2022.
His predecessor, Michel Barnier, was brought down by a no-confidence vote in December.
The crisis dates back to last year’s legislative elections that resulted in a hung parliament.
“Emmanuel Macron, a vulnerable president,” said the Le Monde daily.
Macron, who has been leading diplomatic efforts internationally to end the war in Ukraine, had faced one of the most critical domestic decisions of his presidency over who to appoint as premier.
Lecornu has been in his post more than three years, for most of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and is a staunch supporter of Kyiv.
He is seen as a discreet but highly skilled operator who, crucially for Macron, himself harbours no ambition of becoming president.
Lecornu had been tipped to take the job in December, but in the end Bayrou reportedly strong-armed the president into giving him a chance.
Social tensions
Alongside political upheaval, France is also facing social tensions.
A left-wing collective, “Block Everything”, is calling for a day of action on Wednesday and trade unions have urged workers to strike on Sept 18.
“I hope we can find agreements. I believe there is a possibility of building a project that satisfies what I call the national majority,” said Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, who is also leader of the main right-wing Republicans Party.
The 2027 presidential election remains wide open, with analysts predicting the French far right will have its best-ever chance of winning.
Macron is forbidden from standing for a third term in 2027.
The hopes of three-time presidential candidate for the far-right National Rally (RN), Marine Le Pen, depend on the outcome of an appeal hearing early next year over her conviction for a European Par­liament fake jobs scam that disqualified her from standing for office.
She described Lecornu’s appointment as the “final shot of Macronism”.
The Socialist Party, which had been eying the prime minister’s position for itself, denounced Macron’s decision not to include them and said the president had taken the risk of “provoking legitimate social anger and institutional stalemate”.
But former prime minister Edouard Philippe, who is on the centre-right, was more optimistic. Lecornu “has the qualities” to “discuss” and “find an agreement” with the other parties, he told a television channel.

• PTI concerned over Bushra’s health, says will move apex court for her treatment
• Police add terror clause to case over assault on journalist outside Adiala
ISLAMABAD/RAWALPINDI: Amid an uptick in terror incidents in areas bordering Afghanistan, former prime minister Imran Khan on Tuesday directed his party leader and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin to visit Kabul to hold peace talks with the interim Taliban government.
In a tweet from his personal acc­ount, which he does not have access to in jail, the PTI founder alleged that the army chief, through his ‘short-sighted’ policies, destroyed the peace established in the region during the PTI government.
Amid the deportation of the Afghan nationals taking refuge in the country, the ex-PM said, “Where there should have been a strong relationship, things are being made worse. It grieves me deeply that after decades of hospitality, our Afghan brothers are now being forcibly pushed out of the country.
“At a time when Afghanistan has been struck by an earthquake, we ought to be helping them, not expelling them.”
“I direct Ali Amin Gandapur to go to Afghanistan, sit with them, and hold discussions regarding mutual issues and peace and security so that the situation can be prevented from deteriorating further. The sham federal government must answer: if Maryam Nawaz can travel to Japan and Thailand, why should the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa not be able to travel to Afghanistan for peace in his province,” he asked.
 






He alleged that ongoing military operations, drone strikes, and forced displacements of the people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were “an attempt to undermine” the provincial government and asked CM Gandapur to “firmly resist this operation”.
“The people of the province are already devastated by floods. If drone strikes and military operations are not stopped, it will be a grave injustice. Already, many of our police personnel have embraced martyrdom. As long as this operation continues, the hardships of the people will increase, and terrorism will intensify further,” he said.
The PTI leader also directed his party to participate in the protest against a recent attack on a political gathering in Balochistan.
Bushra Bibi’s health
Meanwhile, the PTI expressed concern over the condition of former first lady Bushra Bibi and announced moving a petition before the Supreme Court in this regard.
In a statement, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram claimed that prison authorities were obstructing Bushra Bibi’s treatment despite her deteriorating health in defiance of court orders. He emphasised that during a recent meeting, Imran Khan revealed that Bushra Bibi had been suffering from a severe illness for the past several days.
He claimed that the prison doctors had failed to diagnose her condition, while repeated requests for examination by a private physician were denied.
“The PTI demands that Bushra Bibi be granted immediate access to a private medical specialist and that all necessary requirements for her treatment be fulfilled without delay,” he said.
Two arrested
Separately, the Rawalpindi po­­li­­ce added Section 21 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 to a case registered against the PTI leaders, including Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, over torture of a journalist outside the Adiala jail.
Sources said two suspects had been arrested while raids were underway to apprehend the rest of the suspects. Aleema Khan, Naeem Haider Panjutha and 40 other PTI supporters were booked after a journalist was beaten up outside the prison.
An FIR was registered with the police on the complaint of Tayyab Baloch against three PTI leaders and 40 other individuals on the charges of robbery, rioting, unlawful assembly, causing damage to property and hurling death threats.
According to the police officials, Section 21 deals with the designation of cordoned areas for terrorism investigations, allowing the federal government to restrict access to these zones to prevent terrorist acts or to aid in the investigation.
It also empowers the police officers, members of the Armed Forces or Civil Armed Forces deployed in these areas (powers within cordoned areas) to use necessary force after giving sufficient warning to prevent terrorist acts.
A few days ago, two women were taken into custody by police for  throwing eggs at Aleema Khan during a media talk outside Adiala Jail,  where the proceedings on the Toshakhana case were held on Friday.
A  statement issued by the Rawalpindi police said the two women, who threw  eggs, were PTI supporters who had travelled to Rawalpindi with members  of the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance and the All-Pakistan  Clerks Association from KP to protest in support of their demands.

Sharma Oli were unknown after he was forced to step down in the face of furious protests by young people, as mobs set fire to the parliament and Supreme Court buildings.
The outrage was sparked by a social media ban, which Oli’s government  lifted after police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters  trying to storm parliament, and 100 people were injured alongside the 19 dead.
Organisers of the protests, which spread to other cities, have called  them  “demonstrations by Gen Z”, driven by young people’s frustration  with a perceived lack of action to tackle corruption and boost economic  opportunities.
But there was no let-up in the protests on Tuesday, which plunged Nepal into fresh political uncertainty.
“In view of the adverse situation in the country, I have resigned  effective today to facilitate the solution to the problem and to help  resolve it politically in accordance with the constitution,” Oli said in  his resignation letter to President Ramchandra Paudel.

Armed demonstrators set parliament, Supreme Court buildings ablaze; minister’s family attacked by protesters

An aide to the president told Reuters the president had begun the process of  finding a new premier, but also summoned protest leaders for talks.
Paudel, whose offices were also set on fire by  mobs, pleaded for  “all parties to exercise restraint, to not allow  further damage”.
Army chief Ashok Raj Sigdel, in a video address, urged the protesters  to end the unrest and avoid further loss of life and property, and come  for talks.
The call was echoed by neighbouring India, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that the  “stability, peace and prosperity of Nepal are of utmost importance to us”.
The United Nations rights chief, Volker Turk, said he was  “appalled” by the violence and called for talks.
Early in the day, Oli had summoned all parties, saying violence was not  in the interest of the nation and calling for peaceful dialogue. He did  not respond directly to the complaints of corruption.
But protesters continued gathering at parliament and elsewhere in the capital, defying an indefinite curfew.
They set fire to tyres on some roads, threw stones at police in riot gear and chased them through narrow streets.
Witnesses also said protesters had set fire to the homes of some politicians in Kathmandu, and local media said some ministers had been plucked to safety by military helicopters.
After he stepped down, gangs descended on and set fire to Oli’s house, and his whereabouts are not known.
The Singha Durbar area, which houses the Prime Minister’s Office and other ministries as well as Parliament House, and Oli’s private residence were also set on fire.
Footage circulating on social media also showed former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his wife Arzu Rana, foreign minister under Oli, and Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel being attacked by protesters.
Kathmandu’s airport remains open, but some flights were cancelled after  smoke from fires affected visibility, airport spokesman Rinji Sherpa  said.
The International Crisis Group called it a “major inflection point in the country’s uneasy experience with democratic rule”.

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the verdict inside Kot Lakhpat Jail after concluding the trial for torching a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House during the May 9 protests.
The court also sentenced fashion designer Khadija Shah, granddaughter of former army chief Asif Nawaz Janjua, to five years in prison. However, former MNA Rubina Jamil, Afshan Tariq and Rubina Khan were acquitted due to a lack of evidence.
Of the 51 accused, the court acquitted 21, convicted 18 and declared 12 others, including PTI activist Sanam Javed, absconders for failing to appear before the court.
Among those sentenced to 10 years each were Junaid Ali, Salamat Khan, Najam Shahid, Saud Javed, Muhammad Faisal, Haroon Khan, Ahmed Mursalin, Elahi Bakhsh, Rana Talal Khurshid, Rana Tanvir, Hamza Sohail, Usman Aslam and Farhan Aziz.
Those acquitted inc­l­uded Umair Nazir, Far­man Ali, Umar Bilal, Saa­d­ullah, Muhammad Qas­im, Kashif Ahmad, Hafiz Ihsan, Amber Gul, Kha­l­ilur Rehman, Amir Yasin, Ali Hassan, Muhammad Qasim, Tayyab Ali, Mian Haroon, Bilal Zulfiqar, Yar Khan and Naeem Akhtar.
The Sarwar Road police had registered the case (FIR No. 109/2023) against PTI leaders and workers for attacking and torching a judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House and Rahat Bakery in Lahore Cant­onment. The May 9 riots erupted after the arrest of PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan by the National Accou­n­t­ability Bureau from the Islamabad High Court premises. PTI leaders and workers subsequently att­acked military facilities and public property across the country.
This is the fourth case in Lahore in which Shah Mahmood Qureshi has been acquitted, while Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mehmoodur Rashid have been convicted.

The Silicon Valley powerhouse held its annual iPhone release event amid mounting pressures: the White House is pushing the company to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing, while investors question whether Apple is truly ready for the AI age.
Adding to these challenges, the company faces headwinds from President Donald Trump’s high tariff policies. Apple shares have dropped more than three per cent since the Republican took office in January.
Against this backdrop, Apple is betting on a product that it hopes will spark a super-cycle of iPhone purchases and reverse the trend of customers holding onto their devices longer before upgrading.
“The event shows Apple sidestepping the heart of the AI arms race while positioning itself as a long-term innovator on the AI hardware front, with silicon and device-level integration,” said Emarketer analyst Gadjo Sevilla.
To reinvigorate its brand, Apple introduced the iPhone 17 Air, which CEO Tim Cook called “a total game changer”.
At just 5.6mm thick (less than a quarter inch), the $999 device features Apple’s new A19 Pro processor — its most powerful iPhone chip to date — and promises all-day battery life with up to 40 hours of video playback.
The Air joins Apple’s more standard lineup, including the premium iPhone Pro 17, the company’s most expensive and highest-performing model.
While all new devices incorporate generative AI technology, Apple made no major announcements about expanding its AI capabilities beyond updates to existing features in its “Apple Intelligence” suite.
The company’s AI push has struggled to gain traction since it launched “Apple Intelligence” late last year. Users have been particularly disappointed with improvements to Siri, which remains surprisingly basic despite years of promises.
Apple reportedly plans to integrate AI into online search next year and overhaul Siri, though the company hasn’t confirmed these reports.
The tech giant is also said to be partnering with Google to tap into its search and AI expertise.
“To truly differentiate and smoke the competition, Apple will have to crack AI as a new contextual user-interface” on its devices, Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said in a note.
“Executing such an ambitious AI strategy will take time. It won’t happen at best until next year, if not for the iPhone’s 20th anniversary” in 2027, he added.

Pivot to iPhone Air
Industry analysts see the iPhone Air as a strategic pivot, with Apple positioning ultra-thin design — rather than larger screens — as its new premium selling point.
The super-slim profile could also pave the way for Apple’s long-rumoured foldable iPhone, expected as early as next year. Samsung and China’s Huawei already offer foldable smartphones.
However, engineering such thin devices presents challenges: higher production costs and reduced battery space, though Apple claims 24-hour battery life for the iPhone 17 Air when fully charged.
Despite tariffs that increase production costs, Apple kept iPhone prices unchanged from last year’s equivalent models — a move that may squeeze profit margins.
Cook revealed in July that Trump’s tariffs cost Apple $800 million last quarter, with an estimated $1.1 billion impact expected this quarter.
Apple shares fell 1.40pc after pricing details were announced, reflecting investor concerns about the company’s ability to maintain its profit margins.
Apple also introduced the AirPods Pro 3, featuring enhanced noise cancellation and real-time translation capabilities, along with the Apple Watch Series 11, which includes 5G connectivity, extended battery life, and heart health monitoring features pending regulatory approval.

“Of 10,618 cases of mis­sing persons, 8,873 have been disposed of from Ma­­rch 2011 to August 2025. This works out to 83.56 per cent of the total cases,” the commission said in a press release issued on Tuesday.
According to its mon­thly report, the COIED disposed of 103 cases and registered 11 new ones during August this year.
Of the 8,873 cases disposed of, the whereabouts of 6,809 persons have been traced. The remaining 1,745 cases are still under investigation at the commission’s registries in Islamabad, Karachi, Quetta and Lahore.
The commission said its Khyber Pakhtunkhwa re­­g­­­istry is expected to be­­c­o­­me functional in the third week of this month. It has also launched hearings via video link, which according to the press rel­ease, saves families and stakeholders’ time and exp­ense of travelling to Islamabad.
COIED Chairman Arshad Hussain has been making frequent visits to different stations, to expedite disposal of cases and provide justice at the doorstep of aggrieved families.

• UN announces $5m aid; president orders measures to ensure food security
LAHORE: As the overflowing Chenab continues to inundate large swathes of land in the southern districts of Punjab, authorities on Tuesday said the next two days were critical for Multan and its neighbouring districts amid an “unprecedented flood emergency” that triggered mass evacuations.
Besides Multan, Muzaffargarh, Shujabad, Khangarh, Jalalpur Pirw­ala, Uch Sharif, and Alipur were at risk as a second major flood wave was passing through the Head Muham­madwala and Shershah bridges. However, the water level at Shershah was still half a foot below the critical threshold.
The government had decided to breach the Shershah embankment if the water level crossed its critical limit of 393.50 feet, which would affect as many as 8,000 houses and 30,000 people.
As of Tuesday, 138 mouzas in Muzaffargarh were submerged, affecting 135,000 people, in Rangpur,  28 mouzas were submerged, affective 50,000 people.
The government had also briefly closed the road connecting Multan and Muzaffargarh at Shershah Bridge. However, light vehicular traffic was resumed in the evening.
Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said water levels are rising due to a flood flow of 500,000 cusecs from Head Trimmu reaching Head Muhammadwala. In case of a high-level flood, the Sher Shah Road will be immediately breached.
 
 

Mr Sindhu said that an additional 2,000 people have been rescued from Jalalpur Pirwala in the last 24 hours. He said the floodwaters from the Sutlej and Chenab had placed Jalalpur Pirwala at high risk, so an emergency would remain in effect in Jalalpur Pirwala for the next 24 hours due to the high flood.
Multan Commissioner Aamir Kar­im Khan was monitoring rescue activities in Jalalpur Pirwala. He said that 50 villages in the area had been affected by the floods and 235,296 people besides 180,377 head of cattle had been relocated to safe locations.
In a press conference, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Kat­hia claimed the 10th monsoon spell had ended and there would be no more heavy rain in Punjab. He also said there would not be a third flood wave since the rainy season had ended.
This claim, however, was contested by an official from the Pakistan Met Department, who said the monsoon season had not ended in India and it could trigger a third wave of floods in downstream Pakistan.
He said that monsoons started early in India and the season was also longer than in Pakistan.
He said that no one could make a long-term forecast like the one made by the PDMA DG.
Meanwhile, the Met department also forecast widespread rain, windstorms and thundershowers in southern Balochistan and lower Sindh on Wednesday, with scattered heavy to very heavy falls likely in parts of south Balochistan.
The claims by the PDMA chief came as the Sutlej River flowed in high flood due to water released by India from its dams.
According to him, 253,000 cusecs had passed at Ganda Singh Wala and 11 feet of water at Indian Dam Thein receded. He said that the water near Kasur also decreased from 311,000 to 253,000 cusecs and the river flow would be normal in a day or two.
He said that upper Punjab villages would be normalised in a day or two, adding that 300,000 cusecs of water at Trimmu Barrage had started receding and 300,000 cusecs was crossing Head Panjnad. According to the official, a surge of 400,000 cusecs was approaching Guddu Barrage, which would release pressure in areas of southern Punjab.
Mr Kathia said that 80,000 people are currently residing in 488 relief camps, adding that over 2.1 million people had been evacuated to safer locations. Likewise, 1.95 million acres of agricultural land in Punjab had been flooded, he added.
The PDMA DG said that in the last 24 hours, a girl died due to a roof collapse caused by rain. He did not mention the place of the incident.
Three killed in Karachi
Due to widespread rain, two teenagers died from electrocution and ano­ther drowned in Karachi.
The Met office said the deep depression that had been causing rains in Karachi and Sindh would gradually move towards Balochistan and turn into a well-marked low-pressure area.
Several hundred straw-mud houses in the rural areas of Tharparkar and Dadu districts were swept away as the two districts had been receiving intermittent heavy, moderate and light spells of monsoon rains for the last six and four days, respectively.
River flows
As of 11:30pm on Tuesday, PDMA reported that on the  Chenab River, the flow is steady at 69,300 cusecs at Marala Headworks,  with Khanki Headworks at 97,898 cusecs and Qadirabad Headworks at 98,316  cusecs, both also steady.
The Chiniot Bridge was reporting a steady  flow of 79,914 cusecs, while the Rivaz Bridge gauge was at 519.10 feet,  which was falling. At Trimmu Head­works, the flow was steady at 339,292  cusecs, with the Head Muhammadwala gauge at 413.70 feet against a level  of 417.50 feet and steady. The Shershah Bridge was at 393.40 feet  against 393.50 feet and was steady.
Panjnad Headworks was  reporting a flow of 475,129 cusecs, which was rising. The barrage’s  operational capacity had reduced due to a backwater effect from the  Indus River.
On the Ravi River, the flow at Jassar was steady at  28,040 cusecs, while Ravi Syphon was steady at 42,731 cusecs. The gauge  at Shahdara was steady at 42,380 cusecs. Balloki Headworks was reporting  a flow of 93,305 cusecs, which was falling, and Sidhnai Headworks was  steady at 129,470 cusecs.
For the Sutlej River, the flow at G.S.  Wala was steady at 230,738 cusecs. Sulemanki Headworks was steady at  133,097 cusecs, and Islam Headworks was steady at 121,357 cusecs. The  Mailsi Syphon was steady at 120,150 cusecs.
On the Indus River,  the Chachran Bridge gauge upstream of Guddu was steady at 310.60 feet,  and the Guddu Barrage was reporting a steady flow of 443,494 cusecs.
$5m from UN
United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher has announced a $5 million allocation from the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to support the government-led flood response in Pakistan.
The funds will enable UN agencies and partners to deliver immediate life-saving assistance to some of the four million people who have been affected by flooding so far, including more than 2 million who were forced out of their homes in search for higher ground.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari directed the Ministry of National Food Security to take urgent measures to ensure food security in the country in the wake of the recent flood devastation.

• Opposition parties to coordinate rallies with district administrations under SOPs
QUETTA: All political leaders and workers arrested during the wheel-jam and shutter-down strike — following clashes with police and road blockades — were released on Tuesday after successful negotiations between the provincial authorities and opposition party leaders.
Both sides reached an agreement under which the government agreed to release all detained workers and supporters of opposition parties and withdraw cases registered against them under various sections across Balochistan.
Police had on Monday arrested around 260 people from Quetta and other towns and cities of the pro­v­ince for violating Section 144, blocking highways, pelting police with stones, and attacking public and private property.
They were protesting a recent sui­cide bombing at a BNP-M rally in Quetta, which claimed over a dozen lives.
The negotiations were held at the commissioner’s office, where the government side was represented by Balochistan’s Senior Minister Mir Zahoor Ahmed Bul­edi, Finance Minister Mir Shoaib Nosh­e­rwani, Health Minister Bakht Muham­mad Kakar, and Zamarak Khan Acha­k­zai.
Quetta Division Com­m­issioner Shah­zeb Khan Kakar and Deputy Com­­mi­s-­­­sioner retired Captain Mehrullah Badini also participated in the talks.
The opposition delegation was led by Advocate Sajid Khan Tareen, Akhtar Hussain Langove and Agha Hassan Baloch of the Balochistan National Par­ty; Talimand Khan, Majeed Khan Achakzai and Kabir Khan Afghan of the PkMAP; Aslam Baloch and Changeez Hayee Baloch of the National Party; Asghar Khan Achakzai and Rash­eed Nasar of the ANP; Advocate Salam Agha and Malik Faisal Dehwar of the PTI; Zahid Akhtar Baloch and Jameel Ahmed Mashw­ani of the Jamaat-i-Islami; and Maulana Wilayat Hussain of the MWM.
The government and opposition delegations discussed the prevailing situation in the province and Monday’s incidents, ultimately reaching a consensus to sign an agreement. As a goodwill gesture, the government delegation annou­nced the release of all political activists and the withdrawal of cases registered in various districts of Balochistan, on the directives of Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti.
 
 

It was agreed that opposition parties would coordinate with district administrations to organise rallies and public gatherings in line with standard operating procedures (SOPs).
Opposition leaders assu­red that all demonstrations would remain peaceful, laws would be fully respected and public property protected. They further pled­g­­ed that no violent incidents or destructive actions would take place during protests.

“The under-construction Diamer-Bhasha Dam project is all set to achieve yet another milestone as roller-compact-concrete (RCC) work of the main dam will commence in early 2026 after completion of trials and excavation work on abutment and pit (foundation) by the end of this year,” the statement said.
On Tuesday, Wapda Chairman retired Lt Gen Muhammad Saeed visited the site, which is 40 kilometres downstream from Chilas, Gilgit-Baltistan.
The Wapda chief revie­wed construction activities at the crushing plant, div­ersion tunnel, dam pit and abutments, the RCC trial section area and the conveyor belt tunnel, acco­rding to the statement.
Gen Saeed advised the contractors to deploy additional resources for accelerating construction work so that targets could be achieved in time. 
 
 

He urged the Wapda te­­a­m and consultants to ad­­opt a “proactive appr­o­a­­ch” for removing bottlene­cks that could delay com­p­l­etion of the project in time.
Security arrangements for the project were also discussed during the visit.
Gen Saeed also visited Chilas Cadet College, built by Wapda at a cost of Rs 2.1 billion as part of its “corporate social responsibility”.
 






Wapda has spent Rs 78.5bn for resettlement of the people displaced by the project and on execution of uplift schemes in health, education and upgradation of infr­a­structure in the region.
The Diamer-Bhasha dam, with a height of 272 metres, is the highest RCC dam in the world.
It will have a gross water storage capacity of 8.1 MAF and irrigate 1.23 million acres of land.
With an installed power generation capacity of 4,500 megawatt, the project will provide 18 billion units of green, clean and the most affordable electricity to the national grid every year.

Hamas’ armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, on Tuesday claimed responsibility for a shooting that killed six people on the outskirts of Jerusalem the previous day. Israel said it would demolish homes of residents of the attackers’ villages in the occupied West Bank.
Residents of Gaza City, home to a million Palestinians before the war, have been expecting an onslaught for weeks, since the Israeli government devised a plan to deal Hamas a fatal blow in what it says are the group’s last strongholds.
“I say to the residents of Gaza, take this opportunity and listen to me carefully: you have been warned get out of there!” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
The Israeli military airdropped leaflets with evacuation orders on residents standing amid the rubble, who say there is no safe place to go. Some said they would have no choice but to leave for the south, but many said they would stay and there were no immediate signs of a mass exodus.

Netanyahu asks Palestinians to ‘take this opportunity’; residents say they have no safe place to go

Anxiety was spreading through a tent area in Gaza City housing displaced cancer patients.
“There’s no place left, not in the south, nor the north, nothing. We’ve become completely trapped,” said Bajess al-Khaldi, one of a group of displaced cancer patients housed in a tented area, as people looked on at the rubble of several buildings destroyed in an Israeli attack.
Displacement is a profound issue for Palestinians who fear that Netanyahu and his far-right allies in government want a repeat of the “Nakba”, or “catastrophe”, when hundreds of thousands of people fled or were driven out during the 1948 war that accompanied Israel’s creation.
Israel has been accused of genocide, including this month by the world’s biggest group of genocide scholars, over its nearly two-year campaign in the Palestinian enclave that has killed more than 64,000 people according to local authorities.
 
 

The health authorities in Gaza announced they would not evacuate Gaza City’s two main operational hospitals, Al Shifa and Al Ahli Arab, adding that doctors would not leave patients unattended.
Most Gazans have already been displaced several times since the war started, much of the territory lies in ruins and a hunger crisis has grown far worse in recent months.
The Israeli military has instructed residents in Gaza City to move to a designated “humanitarian zone” in the already overcrowded Al-Mawasi area along the coast in the south, where thousands of Palestinians have already been sheltering in tents. Israel has also regularly bombed the south.
Um Samed, a 59-year-old mother of five, said the choice now was whether “to stay and die at home in Gaza City, or follow Israel’s orders and leave Gaza and die in the south”.
Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Monday the military would unleash a “mighty hurricane” that would destroy Gaza if Hamas did not free the last prisoners it holds and surrender.
Israel has called up tens of thousands of reservists for a ground operation. Netanyahu said Israeli forces were organising and assembling into Gaza City.

The PTA said that subscribers’ data remains solely with licensed telecom operators, adding that an initial review indicated the leaked datasets contained family details, travel records, vehicle registrations, and CNIC copies, suggesting that the data was aggregated from multiple external sources, rather than telecom operators.
The explanation comes following a report by the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA). The issue of citizens’ leaked data recently gained attention when the interior ministry formed an inquiry committee to investigate, and the NCCIA established a special investigation team to probe the matter.
Sources in the interior ministry said the Joint Task Force (JTF) on ‘Unauthorised Data Access and Pilferage’ has di­rected the National Tech­nology and Information Security Board (NTISB) to conduct an audit of telecom operators. Under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016, PTA licensees have been declared critical information infrastructure.
 
 

The initial report also indicated that the breach could have exposed sensitive data, potentially enabling cybercriminals to carry out sophisticated frauds.
A listing on the dark web was identified, advertising a data leak of 3.2 million IMSI (Inter­national Mobile Subscriber Identity) and IMEI (Inter­national Mobile Equipment Identity) records, allegedly belonging to mobile subscribers in Pakistan.
On the other hand, the telecom regulator disputed the ministry’s claim that the data leaks originated from some telecom company or fixed-line internet service provider (ISP).
The PTA referenced its recent cybersecurity audit, completed around two weeks ago, asserting that no breaches were found within its licensed sector. It highlighted that Telenor Pakistan ranked first among mobile operators, while Nayatel led fixed-line operators in terms of cybersecurity.
Telecom Operators Associa­tion (TOA) Vice Chairman Wahaj Siraj, while responding to queries, told Dawn that combating cybercrime was an ongoing challenge, and hackers could potentially strike any company or sector, though he affirmed that Pakistan’s telecom and internet infrastructure were secure.
He said the PTA conducted annual cybersecurity audits of all its licensed entities through third-party consultants, but authorities should also ensure similar audits are performed across all relevant sectors.

According to a notification issued by Nepra today, the authority “decided to allow a negative FCA of Rs1.7859/kWh for July 2025, to be passed on to the consumers in the billing month of September 2025”.
Nepra said the negative FCA would apply to all consumer categories of K-Electric and XWDiscos (ex-Wapda distribution companies) “except lifeline consumers, domestic protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and prepaid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”.
The adjustment would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in the respective month to which the adjustment pertains, it said.
“In case any bills of September 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” the notification said.
At the same time, Nepra also notified a Rs0.78 per unit negative FCA following an adjustment on account of variation in fuel charges for June in the approved tariff of K-Electric consumers. It said the relief had previously been provided to ex-Wapda distribution company consumers.
“The authority has also decided that negative FCA for June 2025 i.e. Rs.0.7772/kWh,” the notification read.

The 17th edition of the Asia Cup kicked off with the Group ‘B’ match between the two teams which have six-time Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka and Bangladesh as the other teams in their group
 






Afghanistan elected to bat first in Abu Dhabi and posted 188-6 with opener Sediqullah Atal playing the anchor role with an unbeaten 73.
His fifth-wicket partnership of 82 with Omarzai, who hit 53 off 21 balls, including two fours and five sixes, proved key for Afghanistan in the Group B fixture.
Afghanistan’s bowlers then combined to keep Hong Kong down to 94-9.
Temperatures early on touched 40 degrees Celsius, but it was the humidity in the evening that tested the fitness of the players who took regular drinks breaks.
Hong Kong bowlers struck two early blows, but Atal stood firm to put on 51 runs with veteran Mohammad Nabi, who made 33, as the two counter-attacked.
Off-spinner Kinchit Shah broke the stand to dismiss Nabi but Atal raised the run-rate with Omarzai, who raised his first T20I fifty — the fastest by an Afghan batter — with three sixes and a four before his departure.
Hong Kong, whose fielders dropped five catches, were never in the chase after they slipped to 22-4 inside five overs, including two run-outs.
Afghanistan came into the match after being routed by Pakistan by 75 runs in a tri-series final at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Sunday.

The outrage was sparked by a social media ban, which Oli’s government lifted after police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters trying to storm parliament, and 100 people were injured, alongside the 19 dead.
But there was no let-up in the protests on Tuesday, which plunged Nepal into fresh political uncertainty.
 


The unrest is the worst in decades in the poor Himalayan country, which is wedged between India and China and has struggled with political and economic instability since protests led to the abolition of its monarchy in 2008.
Young Nepalis have for years been frustrated at the lack of jobs, and millions have gone to work in the Middle East, South Korea and Malaysia, mainly on construction sites, and send money home.
“In view of the adverse situation in the country, I have resigned effective today to facilitate the solution to the problem and to help resolve it politically in accordance with the constitution,” Oli said in his resignation letter to President Ramchandra Paudel.
An aide to Paudel told Reuters the president had begun the process of finding a new premier, but also summoned protest leaders for talks.
A military source said army chief Ashok Sigdel would address the nation later today.
Jubilant youths entered the parliament complex on hearing the news, waving their hands in the air and shouting slogans as smoke rose from sections of the building.
“We won,” one protester wrote in huge orange letters on the wall of the parliament building.
Although the protesters were still on the streets of the city, there was no more violence as security forces kept their distance.

Prime minister’s house ransacked
Oli, 73, was sworn in for his fourth term in July last year as Nepal’s 14th prime minister since 2008. Two of his cabinet colleagues had resigned on “moral grounds” late on Monday.
Early in the day, Oli had called a meeting of all parties, saying violence was not in the interest of the nation and “we have to resort to peaceful dialogue to find solutions to any problem”. He did not respond directly to the protesters’ complaints about corruption.
But protesters continued gathering in front of parliament and elsewhere in the capital, Kathmandu, defying an indefinite curfew.
They set fire to tyres on some roads, threw stones at police in riot gear and chased them through narrow streets.
Witnesses also said protesters were setting fire to the homes of some politicians in Kathmandu, and local media reported that some ministers had been plucked to safety by military helicopters.
The Singha Durbar area, which houses the Prime Minister’s Office and other ministries as well as Parliament House, and Oli’s private residence, was also set on fire, they said.
Footage circulating on social media showed former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his wife Arzu Rana, foreign minister under Oli, and Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel being attacked by protesters.
Reuters could not immediately verify the information.

Kathmandu airport shut
Kathmandu airport, Nepal’s main international gateway, was closed because of smoke from fires set by protesters, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
Organisers of the protests, which spread to other cities, have called them “demonstrations by Gen Z”, driven by young people’s widespread frustration with a perceived lack of action to tackle corruption and boost economic opportunities.
“The protest was intended, first and foremost, against the rampant corruption in government,” a protester said in an email to Reuters, signing off as ‘A concerned Nepali citizen’.
Young Nepalis had been posting on social media about the “luxurious lives of the families and children of corrupt politicians and civil servants” until the government clamped down on the platforms, the email said.
Last week, Oli’s government blocked access to several online platforms for allegedly failing to register with the government, saying social media were being used to spread disinformation and commit fraud.
UN rights chief ‘appalled’ by Nepal violence, urges dialogue
The UN rights chief voiced alarm at the escalating violence.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk is “appalled by the escalating violence in Nepal”, his office said in a statement.
“I plead with security forces to exercise utmost restraint, and avoid further such bloodshed and harm,” Turk said. “Violence is not the answer.”
Turk stressed that “dialogue is the best and only way to address the concerns of the Nepalese people”, adding that “it is important that the voices of young people are heard”.
He said they had the right to peacefully express their frustrations, adding there were “concerning reports of unnecessary and disproportionate use of force by the security forces”.
“I call for urgent, thorough, transparent and impartial investigation into such acts.”
Turk stressed that protesters, too, must refrain from violence.
“I am disturbed by reports of public buildings, businesses and private residences being attacked and, in some instances, set ablaze,” he said.
“Equally, I am concerned by reports of physical attacks on senior government officials,” he added.
Turk said his office stood “ready to support dialogue and trust-building measures that can help de-escalate tensions and restore confidence”.</p><small>2025-09-09 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/09212512cb5d9c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940770/pigs-heads-left-outside-mosques-in-frances-paris-region' target='_blank'><strong>Pigs’ heads left outside mosques in France’s Paris region</strong></a><br><p>At least nine pigs’ heads were found outside several mosques in the Paris region on Tuesday, the city’s police chief said — an incident that has sparked alarm over rising anti-Muslim hatred.
“Pigs’ heads have been left in front of certain mosques … Four in Paris and five in the inner suburbs,” Laurent Nunez told a press conference, adding that officers were not “ruling out the possibility of finding more”.
Police have opened a probe into incitement to hatred aggravated by racial or religious discrimination, Nunez said, calling the acts “despicable”.
The consumption of pork is forbidden in Islam as the meat is believed to be impure.
Several of the heads had the surname of President Emmanuel Macron scrawled on them in blue ink, the Paris prosecutor’s office told AFP.
Nunez said there could be parallels with past incidents linked to “foreign interference” but urged “extreme caution”.
In early June, three Serbs were charged over the vandalism of Jewish sites in a case investigators suspect was backed by Russia.
France is home to the largest Muslim community in the European Union, as well as the largest Jewish population outside Israel and the United States.
Several EU nations have reported a spike in “anti-Muslim hatred” and antisemitism since Israel’s invasion of Gaza started in October 2023, according to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights.
Anti-Muslim incidents in France rose by 75 per cent between January and May 2025 compared with a year earlier, with attacks on individuals tripling, the interior ministry said in July.
Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive since October 2023, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
‘Anti-Muslim hatred’
The incidents around Paris drew swift condemnation from political and community leaders.
Macron met with representatives of the Muslim community in the capital following the incident to express his “support”, his office told AFP.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said the city had taken legal action, denouncing the “racist acts”.
For his part, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau called the deeds “outrageous” and “absolutely unacceptable”.
“I want our Muslim compatriots to be able to practice their faith in peace,” he said.
Chems-Eddine Hafiz, the rector of the Grand Mosque of Paris, denounced the “Islamophobic acts” as “a new and sad stage in the rise of anti-Muslim hatred”.
Bassirou Camara, head of anti-discrimination group Addam, told AFP he feared an escalation.
“We have been raising the alarm for months and we are not being heard,” Camara said.
“What will be the next step? Throwing pigs’ heads at worshippers or physically assaulting them?”
Outside one of the affected mosques, a 40-year-old former association director, who spoke on condition of anonymity, laid flowers to show “solidarity and support”.
“People shouldn’t have to hide their faith,” she said.
Similar incidents have targeted mosques and Muslim associations elsewhere in France in recent years, including a pig’s head left outside a Muslim association in the northern Pas-de-Calais region in 2024.</p><small>2025-09-09 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622841-floods-put-south-punjabs-mango-orchards-at-risk-of-decades-long-losses' target='_blank'><strong>Floods put South Punjab's mango orchards at risk of decades-long losses</strong></a><br><p>

Following the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan on May 9, 2023, from the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) premises, riots erupted across the country and went on for at least 24 hours. Protesters vandalised and torched government buildings and military installations, while also breaking into the residence of the Lahore corps commander. The state subsequently launched a crackdown against him and his party, filing several other cases against Imran and party leaders since the events of May 9.
Sarwar Road Police had registered a case against the PTI leaders on charges of setting police vehicles on fire near Jinnah House (Corps Commander House).
Advocate Rana Mudassar confirmed the development to Dawn.com, saying ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill acquitted Qureshi while Rashid, Chaudhry, Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed and former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema were sentenced to 10 years in prison in the case.
He added that PTI activist and fashion designer Khadija Shah was also sentenced to five years in prison in the case, adding that a total of 51 accused were involved in the case, with 12 declared absconders and the trial of 39 completed.
Today’s court proceedings come after similar other acquittals for the former diplomat and sentences for the PTI leaders in multiple May 9 cases.</p><small>2025-09-09 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622828-atc-sentences-yasmin-rashid-ejaz-chaudhry-to-10-years-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>ATC sentences Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry to 10 years in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>
