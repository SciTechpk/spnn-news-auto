The visit comes after a series of steps between both nations to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee (JCC) and the upgrading of each country’s diplomats from the rank of chargé d’affaires to ambassador. Both countries also held the inaugural round of the Additional Secretary-Level Mechanism talks earlier in the month.
“Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi holds an important meeting with his Afghan counterpart Sirajuddin Haqqani,” the Interior Ministry said in a post on X.
Naqvi was warmly welcomed by interim Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani upon arrival at the Afghan Ministry of Interior, the post said.
“Discussion on bilateral relations, particularly counter-terrorism, infiltration, and the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban [Pakistan],” took place, according to the interior ministry.
Effective management of the Pak-Afghan border, prevention of narcotics, and mechanisms for regulating cross-border movement were also discussed, the post said.
“Terrorist organisations are causing chaos and instability; We must stop them together,” Naqvi was quoted as having said to his counterpart.
“Pakistan has selflessly hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades; the doors are open for the legal entry of Afghan citizens,” the interior minister said.
The process of repatriation of Afghan citizens illegally residing in Pakistan was also a subject of the conversation between Naqvi and Haqqani.
Afghanistan’s Senior Deputy Interior Minister Ibrahim Sardar, Pakistan’s Special Representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq, Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha and other senior diplomatic officials were there as part of the country’s delegation. Officials from the Afghan Ministry of Interior were also present on the occasion.
Earlier in the day, Naqvi arrived in Kabul on a day-long visit to Afghanistan, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
 






On his arrival at the Kabul airport, Naqvi was received by Afghan Interim Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Nabi Omari.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Earlier in the week, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan signed the Framework Agreement on the Joint Feasibility Study for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Project in Kabul.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had made the announcement in a post on X from Kabul, where he had arrived on a day-long visit for the signing.
On Wednesday, the UN special representative for Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, proposed a ‘prioritised’ regional dialogue with Pakistan, Iran and Central Asian states to halt the disorderly return of Afghans and uphold the principle of voluntary, dignified and safe repatriation.
On Friday, security forces foiled an infiltration attempt by terrorists along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border and arrested five “alleged suicide bombers”, state-run PTV News reported.</p><small>2025-07-20 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/20185119c28891f.jpg?r=191404' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925443/9-terrorists-killed-8-captured-in-malakand-joint-action-by-military-leas-during-four-days' target='_blank'><strong>9 terrorists killed, 8 captured in Malakand joint action by military, LEAs during four days</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed nine terrorists and captured another eight during a four-day joint operation with police, the Counter Terrorism Department, paramilitary organisations and the district administration in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations, the joint intelligence-based operation was conducted on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Fitna Al Khawarij — a term used to designate members of the banned TTP.
“During the conduct of operation, spread over four days, [our] own forces skillfully surrounded and effectively engaged the khawarij location, and after intense multiple fire exchanges, nine Indian-sponsored khawarij were sent to hell, while eight [others] were apprehended,” the ISPR said.
The statement added that two hideouts used by terrorists were destroyed and a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered.
“Locals of the area appreciated the operation and expressed their full support for the state’s counter-terrorism efforts,” the military’s media wing said.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other kharji found in the area, as the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan, in step with the nation, are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement read.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
Eleven terrorists were killed, five were injured and seven were arrested during joint operations conducted in the Hangu and Malakand districts on Saturday.
A senior army officer and two police officials were also wounded during the clash.
In a separate incident, Bannu police claimed to have shot down two explosive-laden quadcopters intended to target police stations.</p><small>2025-07-20 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2021273701e5ebb.jpg?r=212819' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925448/viral-video-case-registered-in-couples-murder-and-suspect-arrested-says-balochistan-cm' target='_blank'><strong>Viral video: case registered in couple’s murder and suspect arrested, says Balochistan CM</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Sunday said that a case had been registered and a suspect had been arrested after a video showing the murder of a couple went viral on social media.
The video shows a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert apparently in Balochistan, before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists have termed the incident an ‘honour’ killing.
In a post on X, Bugti addressed the incident, stating that it occurred a few days before Eidul Azha this year and that the victims had been identified.
“Taking immediate notice of the viral video of the murder of a woman and a man on all social media, orders were issued to Balochistan Police for action,” the CM wrote. “A terrorism case has been registered on behalf of the state, and one suspected killer has been arrested; the law will take its course in this heinous matter!”
 






Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind spoke at the Karachi Press Club today and said that action was underway to trace and apprehend the suspects.
“The two affected families had not filed any report of the incident; however, the state has registered a case,” he said.
“The tribes and individuals seen in the video have been identified; however, their names are not being disclosed at this stage as part of a strategic approach,” he added. “The data of the people seen in the video has been obtained and those whose faces can be identified are being traced through Nadra [National Database and Registration Authority].
“So far, one person has been arrested, while raids are being conducted to arrest others,” he added.
Rind stated that the area shown in the video had been identified, but he did not disclose where it is. He did mention that the incident took place on Eidul Azha.
“Whether it is the killers or those who possibly held a jirga, strict legal action will be taken against all of them,” he warned. “An FIR (first information report) has already been registered based on the facts revealed in the video, and now the investigation will be taken to its logical conclusion.”
Rind continued: “Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti has said that such brutal acts are not only intolerable but are also a serious insult to social values and human dignity. He [CM Bugti] has made it clear that those who challenge the rule of law will be dealt with strictly and no one can be allowed to take the law into their own hands.”
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.
Viral video sparks condemnation
Various political figures and activists condemned the incident as the video was circulated across social media.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari strongly condemned the video in a statement, calling the suspects “beasts” and saying that they deserve no concessions.
“I have faith that the criminals involved in this murder will be brought to justice soon,” he said. “This murder should be a test case for the Balochistan government, as it is gender terrorism.”
The PPP chief added that Islam allows women to marry men of their choice and that the Constitution guarantees the protection of this right.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif shared the video in a post on X, with a message for the people of Balochistan. Referring to the growing militancy in the province, he said: “Those who have taken up arms against the state — start by raising your voice against the unjust system that surrounds you.”
He continued that the ones responsible for this “oppression are your own brothers, not the travellers and labourers from other provinces”, pointing out the recent bus attack in Balochistan’s Kalat district, which left three people dead and other similar incidents in the recent past.
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman condemned the incident in a post on X, labelling it an “unforgivable crime”.
“Crushing the right to marry is a violation of fundamental human rights. Killing in the name of tribal decisions is a despicable act. The cycle of brutality in the name of honour must be stopped,” she wrote.
“By mercilessly killing the married couple, not only have law and justice been insulted, but the authority of the provincial government has also been challenged,” Rehman added. “The chapter of oppression and barbarism under the guise of jirgas must be closed.”
The senator emphasised that the perpetrators must be brought to justice and that legislation to end “outdated customs” is indispensable.
Baloch activist Sammi Deen Baloch decried the incident as an ‘honour’ killing, appealing to Baloch elders to “respect women’s decisions”.
“As a woman, this chilling incident is deeply painful and heart-wrenching for me,” she wrote on X. “Killing any woman in the name of honour is not only a heinous crime but also the worst humiliation of humanity.
“I appeal to Baloch and Pashtun tribal elders, influential sections of society, and intellectuals to respect women’s decisions. Today’s woman is the same woman who is educated, aware, and fully capable of making decisions about her future.”
She demanded that the incident be investigated in a transparent and comprehensive manner so that the suspects are brought to justice and “no one dares to repeat such a barbaric act in the future”.</p><small>2025-07-20 16:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614926-mohsin-naqvi-arrives-in-kabul-on-day-long-visit-to-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan vow joint efforts against terrorism, border threats</strong></a><br><p>

The oath-taking issue has risen once again after the recent redistribution of reserved seats in the wake of a verdict by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench that effectively took away the seats from the PTI and declared other political parties eligible for them.
 


Kundi delivered a press conference following the swearing-in ceremony, where he highlighted that the government reneged on an agreement it had made with the opposition.
“A formula of 6-5 was agreed upon and our opposition candidates withdrew,” the KP governor said. “All of them agreed that they will contest five seats — two will be contested by the JUI-F, two by the PPP, and the PML-N will for one.
“The PTI founder [Imran Khan] then made a decision, and their information secretary said, ‘our Senate candidates are not in our control’. If your Senate candidates are not in control, then how are the MPAs-elect in your control?” Kundi asked.
“The point is, we had a deal in place, we had an agreement. But their members were not completely on board.”
The KP governor highlighted that there are between 30 and 35 independent members of the assembly.
“We have spoken with them, and we are hopeful that we can move towards 6-5. As soon as the leader of the opposition briefs us, we will have a strategy ready for tonight and then we will contest tomorrow’s [Senate] elections,” Kundi said.
Earlier, the opposition MPAs could not take their oaths on reserved seats due to a lack of quorum in the provincial assembly.
At today’s assembly session, which had been called by the KP government, the 25 MPAs-elect on reserved seats for women and minorities were expected to be sworn in. The session had assumed importance as the non-administration of oaths could lead to the postponement of Senate polls set for tomorrow for 11 seats from the legislature.
The session was scheduled for 9am but began with a delay of two hours and 20 minutes, with KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati presiding over it. As soon as the session started, MPA Sher Ali Afridi of the ruling PTI pointed out a lack of quorum, leading to the session being adjourned till July 24.
Upon Afridi’s remarks, PML-N’s Sobia Shahid contended that a lack of quorum could not be pointed out between the recitation of the Holy Quran and the oath-taking. “You (KP government) have been making a joke out of this province for a year,” she said.
Swati asked her to point out the legal provisions for her argument instead of giving a speech.

Ahmad Karim Kundi, the PPP’s parliamentary leader in the KP Assembly, also spoke on the floor of the assembly, backing Shahid. He asserted that the administration of oath was “mandatory”, citing Article 255 of the Constitution.
The speaker also asked Ahmad to state the relevant provisions requiring so and issued a ruling to count the MPAs in attendance, at which it emerged that only 25 lawmakers were present.
Addressing PML-N’s Dr Ibadullah, Swati said: “Opposition leader sahib, there are 25 members present. The quorum is incomplete; ring the bells.”
The opposition lawmakers then came to the front of the speaker’s dais to protest. Swati then adjourned the session, saying: “As the quorum is incomplete, the sitting is adjourned till 2pm on Thursday, July 24.”
Governor to administer oaths after PHC order
The ECP had approached the Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday, requesting that Chief Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah appoint a person to administer the oath to the notified MPAs-elect under Article 255(2) (oath of office) of the Constitution.
Subsequently, after today’s session, the PHC registrar issued an order by Justice Shah that accepted the ECP request and nominated Governor Kundi to administer the oaths “at the earliest”.
It stressed that the governor should ensure that the oaths are “administered in the manner prescribed and proper record be maintained in accordance with the official procedure”. The judge also directed the KP Assembly secretary to facilitate the newly notified MPAs to sign the Roll of the Members.
A notification by the KP Governor’s secretariat, seen by Dawn.com, said Kundi would administer the oaths to the MPAs-elect at 6pm today.
The ECP has changed the timing for the Senate elections from 9am to 11am.
 






Earlier in the day, the ECP had issued a statement announcing that Kundi will administer the oaths at 9am tomorrow at Governor House. It ordered KP Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed, the chief secretary and the Federal Constabulary IG to ensure foolproof security arrangements for the ceremony.
Speaking outside the KP Assembly after the session, Ibadullah said he would approach the courts against the delay in the oath-taking, assailing the PTI government.
“Do not hand over whatever political space is left to others,” he said. “No one can stop these oaths […] at which forum will they (PTI) challenge it?” the PML-N lawmaker said.
Ibadullah stressed that the opposition’s women and minority members had not had representation in the Senate for one and a half years, since the 2024 general elections.
Terming the PTI “politically immature”, he pointed out that it was the PTI government’s “responsibility” to ensure a proper quorum, given their majority in the KP Assembly.
Before the assembly session, the PTI held a parliamentary party meeting, in which it decided that none of its MPAs would attend the proceedings, calling the oaths a “theft of its right”.
 


Oaths an insult to public’s opinion: Barrister Saif
In a statement, PTI’s Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, public relations adviser to KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, called it a “black day for parliamentary politics” and a “murder of democracy”.
“The oaths of opposition MPAs on reserved seats are an insult to the public’s opinion. […] The opposition is dissatisfied despite winning, while the PTI is satisfied even after losing as it has the public’s support,” Saif said.
 
 

The opposition now holds a total of 52 lawmakers in the KP Assembly. After the latest notifications by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the PML-N each hold 17 seats in the 125-member house, while the PPP holds 10 seats.
The Awami National Party (ANP) and PTI-Parliamentarians (PTI-P) each have three seats, while two seats were to be decided through a separate draw for each.
The PTI treasury and the joint opposition alliance had also agreed on a seat-sharing formula under which six seats will go to the treasury, which has 92 members in the KP Assembly, and five seats to the opposition.
Party will take action against ‘disgruntled’ Senate election candidates: Gandapur
KP Chief Minister Party Ali Amin Gandapur said that his party will take action against “disgruntled” Senate election candidates.
Speaking to reporters in Peshawar, Gandapur said, “Rejecting PTI founder Imran Khan’s decision is a defiance of his position as party founder.”
He added that the alliance with the opposition is only till the Senate elections.
Earlier, an agreement was reached with the opposition on the formula of PTI receiving eight seats and the opposition getting three in the upcoming Senate elections, he added.
“We suffered losses due to our candidates not withdrawing their papers,” he added, saying, “Now, we will get six seats and the opposition will get five seats.”

According to the Edhi rescue service, the bus overturned near the Thatta Bypass, following which a rescue team reached the site of the incident and transported the injured to a hospital.
“The bodies of the six victims were initially taken to a mortuary in Orangi Town,” the service said in a statement, adding that they were later transported to Edhi’s morgue in Karachi’s Sohrab Goth.
The bus was carrying a group of picnickers from Karachi to Keenjhar Lake when it overturned while taking a sharp turn, killing six passengers and injuring dozens others, state-owned Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“Local authorities and rescue teams were quick to respond, reaching the crash site within minutes. The injured were rushed to Karachi hospitals, with several reported to be in critical condition,” it said.
In another incident, at least one person was killed and several others, including women and children, were critically injured when a passenger bus overturned on the Gambat National Highway in Sindh’s Khairpur district.
According to APP, the incident took place while the bus was en route from Karachi to Swabi. Rescue teams, along with local police, reached the incident site and rushed the injured to nearby hospitals for medical aid.
 
 

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the bus accidents, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.
Expressing sympathy with the Makli incident victims, he issued directives to the Thatta deputy commissioner (DC) to ensure the provision of immediate medical assistance to the injured. The chief minister further told him to immediately contact their families and fully cooperate.
Expressing sorrow over the Khairpur coach accident, CM Murad issued similar instructions to the Khairpur DC to ensure medical treatment of the wounded. He urged people to drive carefully to protect precious lives.
In a separate incident, two cousins aged 15 and 12 died in a road accident near Tooba Masjid in the vicinity of Kala Pul in Karachi, according to Edhi officials.
The bodies of the cousins were transferred to Jinnah Hospital.
Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.
Earlier this month, four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a drain on Hawkes’ Bay Road in Karachi’s Mauripur area.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said the family was returning from the Hawke’s Bay beach, and the accident most likely happened as a result of speeding.
In an incident on July 15, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near Karachi’s New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.
On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, killing a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.
On June 11, a young man was killed and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway. The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p><small>2025-07-20 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2016352650b2003.jpg?r=163739' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925436/4-terrorists-killed-in-balochistans-kalat-operation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 terrorists killed in Balochistan’s Kalat operation: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed four terrorists during an operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
There has been an increase in the frequency of attacks against security forces in Balochistan in recent times. Earlier this week, three people were killed and seven others were injured as a passenger bus was fired upon in Kalat.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that the intelligence-based operation took place on the night of July 19-20, upon the “reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan”.
In May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna-Al-Hindu­stan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, [our] own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the statement read.
According to the ISPR, weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the dead terrorists, who were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.
Meanwhile, PTV News reported that security forces seized a Fitna Al Hindustan flag as well.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the statement concluded.
President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to security forces for killing the four terrorists in a statement from his office.
“The security forces are always determined to eradicate terrorism,” the president was quoted as saying. “Terrorism will be defeated at all costs with national unity.”
The statement added that operations against terrorism will continue.
“Fitna Al Hindustan will be pursued till the end,” the president was quoted as saying.
On Saturday, a senior officer belonging to the security forces was martyred in a bomb attack at the Western Bypass area, according to officials.
Police said a magnetic explosive device was attached to the officer’s vehicle, which exploded in the Jabl-i-Noor area, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta.
CCTV footage from a nearby camera showed a motorcyclist passing close to the vehicle moments before the explosion. He reportedly attached the explosive device to the driver’s side door. A few seconds later, the blast took place.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.
Meanwhile, on Friday, a Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred and two others suffered injuries when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on the National Highway in the Mastung district, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind said.
According to Rind’s statement, “A police convoy coming from Kalat to Quetta was targeted by terrorists.
“Acting DSP Inspector Abdul Razzaq and Constable Raza Muhammad Jam were martyred in the attack, while Constable Taj Muhammad and Constable Khursheed Ahmed were injured,” he said.
Rind further said that the dead bodies and injured personnel were transferred to Quetta by helicopter.
“Terrorist incidents are a manifestation of the despair of the enemies of peace. The morale of the people of Balochistan and the security forces cannot be diminished,” the spokesperson said.</p><small>2025-07-20 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/201609463c1b693.jpg?r=161348' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925434/seven-cops-abducted-in-south-waziristan-police' target='_blank'><strong>Seven cops ‘abducted’ in South Waziristan: police</strong></a><br><p>Seven police personnel of two police stations were allegedly abducted in two separate incidents on Sunday while patrolling in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan district, police said.
Upper South Waziristan District Police Officer (DPO) Arshad Khan confirmed the incident and said efforts are underway to locate the policemen who went missing during routine patrolling.
“Seven police personnel were patrolling when unidentified individuals took them away,” DPO Arshad told Dawn.com.
He said three policemen — Insaf, Abid and Ismail — were on patrol in the limits of Ladha police station when they went missing.
In a separate but similar incident, four policemen went missing from Tanga Chagmalai in the limits of Sarwakai police station. They include sub-inspector Abdul Khaliq, and constables Irfanullah, Habibullah and Imran.
The police officer said no information has been received about the missing policemen and a search operation is underway to locate them.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
This comes a day after nine terrorists were killed and three security officers were injured during an exchange of fire as security forces and police carried out a joint operation in Hangu’s Zargari Shinawari area.
“Hangu DPO Khalid Khan, the Doaba station house officer (SHO), and an officer of the security forces were injured in the exchange of fire,” a statement by KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed read.
On June 24, two soldiers were martyred and 11 “Indian Proxy” terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in South Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said.
 
 

A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and “11 Indian sponsored khwarij” were killed, while seven were injured. During the intense fire exchange, Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah and Lance Naik Jibranullah “fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice”, it added.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.

The USGS said it expected waves of between 30 centimetres and one metre (up to 3.3 feet) on Russian coasts, and less than 30cm (one foot) in Japan and the US state of Hawaii.
The epicentre of the quakes was in the Pacific Ocean, around 150 kilometres east of the city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, it said.
The initial earthquakes were followed by several aftershocks, including another 6.7-magnitude quake, said USGS.
Russia’s emergency situations ministry wrote on Telegram that it expected waves of up to 60cm in the Commander Islands in the southwestern part of the Bering Sea, and waves of 15 to 40cm in the Kamchatka peninsula.
The peninsula is the meeting point of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates, making it a seismic hot zone.
Since 1900, seven major earthquakes of magnitude 8.3 or higher have struck the area.</p><small>2025-07-20 12:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614904-four-indian-backed-terrorists-killed-in-kalat-ibo' target='_blank'><strong>Four Indian-backed terrorists killed in Kalat IBO</strong></a><br><p>

The WCL is an international cricket league where retired, non-contracted international players return to competitive T20 cricket, according to the league’s website. The tournament commenced on July 18 and is being held in Birmingham, England.
In a statement posted on X, WCL organisers announced that, “We have decided to call off the India vs Pakistan match,” saying that the match between the two countries was planned in light of recent positive development between India and Pakistan, indicating improved bilateral sporting ties.
 






The statement cited a recent volleyball match between the rival nations and speculations around Pakistan’s hockey team touring India later this year.
On Friday, Pakistan beat India 3-0 in the Asian Men’s U-16 Volleyball Championship semi-final being held in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand.
Earlier this month, Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that Pakistan is to review the security situation in India before taking a call on sending its hockey teams to the neighbouring country for the Asia Cup and Junior World Cup to be held later this year.
The decision to cancel the WCL match came after former Indian players, including veteran cricketer Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan. Dhawan posted a statement on his X account, showing a screenshot of an email sent to notify of his withdrawal from the match.
 






One of the sponsors of the tournament, an Indian travel company, also said in a statement posted on X that it “will not be associated with or participate in any WCL match involving Pakistan”.
The league’s statement cited the “current geopolitical situation and prevailing tensions between India and Pakistan” as the reasons for withdrawal.
WCL, in its statement, apologised for “hurting” people’s sentiments and causing discomfort to Indian players for WCL’s decision to hold the match in the first place.
The match — scheduled for Sunday (today) — was to be the first between the two nations in the tournament. The Pakistani team is being led by Mohammed Hafeez, while Yuvraj Singh is leading the Indian side.
According to WCL’s website, the tournament is set to run until August 2 with participation from England, India, Pakistan, Australia, the West Indies and South Africa.
WCL will be held across four English cities — Birmingham, Northampton, Leeds and Leicester.
Reacting to the development, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman condemned the cancellation: “Indian cricketers, following in [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi’s footsteps by refusing to play against Pakistan, have turned sports into hatred.”
“Defeat on the battlefield, failure in diplomacy, and now fleeing from sports, India faces embarrassment on every front,” Rehman, who was part of a delegation that conveyed Pakistan’s stance on the recent conflict with India, said in a post on X.
 






“The hate-filled and prejudiced behaviour of Indian players reflects their Modi-worshipping mindset.”
“Sports are ambassadors of peace, tolerance, and mutual respect, but India has demonstrated narrow-mindedness here as well. The Modi government shudders at the mere mention of Pakistan, and their players choose to flee the field,” Rehman quipped.
She stressed that Indians’ “hate-driven agenda rather than sportsmanship poses a threat to regional peace and the spirit of sports”.
In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day military confrontation — the worst in decades — in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam attack  in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching Operation Sindoor. Islamabad has strongly denied the accusations.
During the conflict, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir had called for a complete halt to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.
The recent tensions also briefly cast a shadow on this year’s Asia Cup, with speculation that India would pull out of the Asia Cup. However, the two teams are expected to face each other in the tournament in September this year.</p><small>2025-07-20 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614893-balochistan-cm-orders-probe-into-viral-honour-killing-video' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan CM orders probe into viral 'honour' killing video</strong></a><br><p>

During the conflict in June, Israel’s air force dominated Iran’s airspace and dealt a heavy blow to the country’s air defences while Iranian armed forces launched successive barrages of missiles and drones on Israeli territory, successfully hitting strategic targets.
“The Zionist enemy sought to destroy Iran’s defence capabilities, and some of our defence systems were damaged in this war; But with the efforts of my comrades, the damaged systems were replaced and deployed in predetermined locations,” Mousavi said.
Admiral Mousavi added that Israel was not able to achieve its objectives and that the United States and NATO helped Tel-Aviv in the war.
Prior to the war, Iran had its own domestically-made long-range air defence system Bavar-373 in addition to the Russian-made S-300 system. The report by Defah Press did not mention any import of foreign-made air defence systems to Iran in past weeks.
Following limited Israeli strikes against Iranian missile factories last October, Iran later displayed Russian-made air defences in a military exercise to show it recovered from the attack.
Iran could hold nuclear talks with European powers next week: report
Iran, Britain, France and Germany could hold talks next week on Tehran’s nuclear programme, Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency reported, following warnings by the three European countries that failure to resume negotiations would lead to international sanctions being reimposed on Iran.
“The principle of talks has been agreed upon, but consultations are continuing on the time and place of the talks. The country in which the talks could be held next week has not been finalised,” Tasnim reported, quoting a source informed on the matter.
The report on possible talks comes a few days after the foreign ministers of the so-called E3 nations, as well as the European Union’s foreign policy chief, held their first call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi since Israel and the US attacked Iranian nuclear facilities a month ago.
 
 

The three European countries, along with China and Russia, are the remaining parties to a 2015 nuclear deal reached with Iran — from which the United States withdrew in 2018 —that lifted sanctions on the Middle Eastern country in return for restrictions on its nuclear programme.
The E3 have said they would restore UN sanctions on Tehran via the so-called “snapback mechanism” by the end of August if nuclear talks that were ongoing between Iran and the US before the Israel-Iran air war do not resume or fail to produce concrete results.
“If EU/E3 want to have a role, they should act responsibly, and put aside the worn-out policies of threat and pressure, including the ‘snap-back’ for which they lack absolutely [any] moral and legal ground,” Araqchi said earlier this week.
The snapback mechanism can be used to restore UN sanctions before the UN Security Council resolution enshrining the deal expires on October 18.
Prior to the Israel-Iran war, Tehran and Washington held five rounds of nuclear talks mediated by Oman but faced major stumbling blocks such as uranium enrichment in Iran, which Western powers want to bring down to zero to minimise any risk of weaponisation.
Tehran maintains its nuclear programme is solely meant for civilian purposes.</p><small>2025-07-20 10:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/201403487c31e3f.jpg?r=141100' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925424/fc-personnel-martyred-as-unknown-gunmen-open-fire-at-checkpoint-in-gbs-diamer-police' target='_blank'><strong>FC personnel martyred as unknown gunmen open fire at checkpoint in GB’s Diamer: police</strong></a><br><p>A Federal Constabulary soldier was killed when unidentified gunmen opened fire at a forest checkpoint along the Karakoram Highway in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district, police said on Sunday.
Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Diamer Farrukh Rasheed said in a statement, “The deceased has been identified as Muhammad Gul Sher from Dera Ismail Khan.
“The motive behind the attack is not yet known, and the police are investigating the case. The suspects fled with the gun of the deceased.”
Senior Superintendent of Police Abdul Hameed told Dawn.com, “Unknown assailants opened fire at the checkpoint while the deceased was on duty and his colleagues were asleep.”
He added that police teams were raiding nearby areas to look for the suspects. In his statement, he speculated that the case appeared to be related to terrorism, ruling out personal enmity or a timber smuggling attempt.
The forest checkpoint was situated at the Thore Road, primarily to inspect vehicles for wood smuggling via the road, which connects the KKH with forest areas in the district.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan condemned the attack, saying, “Firing by terrorists on state personnel is an unacceptable act.”
According to a statement, he directed the police to bring the perpetrators to justice and sought a report on the incident from the home department.
GB government spokesman Faizullah Faraq said in a separate statement that funeral prayers for the martyred soldier were offered at the Police Lines in Chilas, and preparations were underway to send the body to his hometown.
In 2023, at least nine people lost their lives and 21 passengers received injuries after an Islamabad-bound bus came under fire in a terrorist attack near Chilas in Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan.</p><small>2025-07-20 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614881-bnp-m-chief-akhtar-mengal-offloaded-from-dubai-bound-flight' target='_blank'><strong>BNP-M chief Akhtar Mengal offloaded from Dubai-bound flight</strong></a><br><p>

The comment was ironic because Haris is known by the moniker ‘Mr Google’ among his teammates, because of his cricketing intelligence.
Such PR content is primarily used to display camaraderie among the players and to provide fans with wholesome moments to cherish. At times, it also provides a peek into the dressing room.
Haris, that night, had become the first non-opening batter from Pakistan to score a century in T20Is, while facing only 45 balls — the second least for any batter from his country — to reach the mark. It was also his first century across all T20s.
Haris had long been censured for being a reckless slogger and considered not good enough for international cricket. He averaged a paltry 13.46 runs per dismissal and lasted only 11 balls per innings before the home T20Is against Bangladesh. Does he think he has silenced his critics for now?
“This is just the beginning, as I have to do more to silence them,” he tells Eos in all humility.

Once derided as a reckless slogger who always played below his potential, Mohammad Haris seemed to be a different player in the recent Bangladesh home T20I series, where he scored his first T20 century. What changed him?

Haris had a sensational start to his international career and played an integral role in Pakistan’s run to the 2022 T20 World Cup final, with the scores of 28 off 11 in a high-pressure, must-win match against South Africa, 31 off 18 against Bangladesh, and 30 off 26 against New Zealand in the semi-final. He was being readied as a second-choice keeper behind Mohammad Rizwan in white-ball cricket, but then slipped into oblivion due to the turbulence that successive ad-hoc management committees brought to the PCB.
 
 

His return to the national side in March — after a gap of almost two years — was due to a paradigm shift in Pakistan’s approach towards the T20 format.
In fact, 2024 was a terrible year for Pakistan, as they mustered only nine wins from 24 matches and lost to the USA on their way to the group-stage exit in the T20 World Cup that year. Their sluggish rate of runs accumulation was deemed the reason behind the abject results. Since the start of 2022 until the end of 2024, Pakistan’s run rate of 8.04 was the fifth worst among the 12 full-member teams.
After the ignominy of the World Cup, Pakistan benched their two most consistent but slow run-getters in Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and doubled down on the philosophy of batting with intent and aggression by presenting their most recent set of changes — Agha as captain and Mike Hesson as head coach — as requisites for modern-day cricket.
But Pakistan’s first T20I series without Babar and Rizwan resulted in a 4-1 drubbing in New Zealand. (This was Aaqib Javed’s last series as Pakistan’s head coach and Agha’s first.) Haris, who had been added to the top-order to inject aggression, managed only 11 runs in 16 balls across the first two matches — a six-ball duck marking his first international outing since 2023. He posted his highest T20I score of 41 in the third match, but subsequently finished the series with an abysmal 2 and 11.
“There is enormous pressure when you are playing for your country and I could not sleep before the third T20I, as I kept thinking about how to score runs,” he recalls. “But, the coaches and the captain continued to show their trust in me, which motivated me.
“I spoke to the Pakistan fast bowlers about what possible bowling plans are against me. I talked to Naseem Shah, [Mohammad] Wasim Junior, Abbas Afridi and Hasan [Ali] Bhai and their insights were extremely helpful. They told me that aggressive batters like Fakhar Zaman and me do not have to go overboard with our shots.
“I used to try to hit the ball behind square unnecessarily or shuffle down the leg side without any reason. They told me to just stay on the wicket, as my presence was enough to create pressure for the opposition. I worked on that and realised that the bowlers bowled bad balls to me because of that pressure,” Haris says.
Haris’ astuteness against Bangladesh turned heads. He scored almost half of his runs in T20Is in those three matches and capped the series with a scintillating 107 not out off 46, smashing seven sixes and eight fours as Pakistan chased down 197 with 2.4 overs to spare.
“I entered the Bangladesh series under pressure. Previously, I had an excuse of being in alien conditions, but now I was playing at home and there was no hiding. But, the century gave me a lot of confidence. It assured me that I could play big innings. I have been tagged as someone who is only good enough for 25 to 30 runs. Even my coach here in Peshawar used to ask me when I would score more than 30 runs.
“I started to question myself too,” he says.
The line between batting with ultra or controlled aggression is often blurred and whether the brand that a team played with on a particular day was correct or not is determined only in hindsight, based on the result. That’s the sad reality of the result-oriented business. But, it is important that teams learn lessons.
“We were not smart enough in New Zealand and were slogging rather blindly,” Haris admits. “We had meetings with the coaches after the New Zealand series and discussed how we have to be smart while staying aggressive…
“We have ingrained smartness in our batting by keeping the scoreboard ticking, which puts pressure on the opposition. We now look to pick favourable match-ups, make sure we don’t take unnecessary risks when we have scored enough boundaries in an over, and communicate to build partnerships.”
 
 

Convincing players to adapt according to the new demands can often be a challenge, as elite players can be too arrogant to change their playing styles. But Haris has brought in a new philosophy. The first signs of that were on the night of May 28, when he scored only seven off the first eight balls to stabilise Pakistan’s innings after they had lost both openers in the first eight balls.
He plundered 24 off the next nine. He made 41 off 25 in the next game, as Pakistan posted 201 in both the first two matches.
“There will be failures with this approach, but now we have a captain and a team management who are ready to back us and own those failures,” he says. “Previously, that was not the case, and it used to sow thoughts in our minds that perhaps we should play to secure our places after a couple of failures.
“Our coaches have realised that we are capable players and they are working with us on how they can convert our potential into runs on the field. I am working very closely with our batting coach Hanif [Malik] Bhai. I tend to think over-aggressively when I bat, but now I communicate with him through different signals when I am in the middle and it helps me to stay calm. It has improved my game.”
Haris understands the message in the irony of what his captain, Agha, had said with reference to his moniker, Mr Google.
“That nickname has been applicable in every aspect of my cricket but the batting,” he says laughing. “I have no idea why that is the case. I give the best advice when I am in the dressing room, keeping the wickets, or captaining a side. My teammates, such as Saim Ayub, question where all my intelligence goes when I am batting.
“But, I am working towards bringing that intelligence in my batting now. It is 2025 and it is about time I had an update.”

THE delay in wheat supply has put an immense strain on locals who say they cannot afford to buy flour from open market.—Dawn

GILGIT: A severe wheat shortage is intensifying across Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), depleting the region’s reserve stocks and raising fears of a food crisis after the federal government failed to release subsidised supplies more than two weeks into the new fiscal year, GB food department has said.
Officials with the food department said that wheat stocks have been completely exhausted.
GB residents rely almost entirely on the subsidised wheat supplied annually by the federal government.
While the federal government allocated Rs20 billion in its budget to procure over 170,000 tonnes of wheat for Gilgit-Baltistan for the current fiscal year, officials said not a single sack has been delivered.
The delay is putting immense strain on locals who say they cannot afford to buy flour from the open market.

Officials say not a single bag delivered though federal govt allocated Rs20bn for the purpose in budget

“Local people make their monthly expenditure budgets according to the subsidised rate,” Imtiaz Hussain, a local resident, told Dawn. “The current shortage is causing trouble.”
Mr Hussain said the community is facing significant difficulty and demanded that the “federal government release the subsidised wheat without further delay.”
 
 

The situation has been worsened by recent flash floods and torrential rains, which have severely damaged road infrastructure and made transporting goods to remote areas extremely difficult.
An official with the food department told Dawn that the last of the small reserve stocks were distributed during the recent floods and are now gone.
He noted that frequent landslides on the Karakoram Highway, the Baltistan road, and other key routes have severely disrupted supply chains.
Transporting goods from Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) warehouses in Islamabad to GB can now take several weeks, the official said.
The delivery of the remaining limited wheat from regional warehouses in Gilgit to remote areas also remains delayed because of blocked roads.
Officials fear that any further delay in supplies could plunge GB into a full-scale food emergency.

The report reveals that during in June 2020, the hydro-meteorological and climate change services component was initially scaled back and later dropped.
Activities aimed at improving the service delivery capacity of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, private sector engagement and mitigation of seismic and glacial hazards were also removed from the plan.
 
 

Although the original project financing of $188m, approved in 2018, remained unchanged after the first restructuring, the second restructuring in June 2023 reduced the total budget to $168m due to exchange rate fluctuations. Despite this, the project was completed within the original budget, albeit after an 18-month extension — an outcome the Bank attributes to efficient resource utilisation.
However, the project underwent two significant restructurings, in June 2020 and June 2023, that altered both its objectives and scope.

He told reporters that approximately 40,000 pilgrims’ records remain in paper form and have not been transferred to the digital registry system.
“It was never said that thousands of Pakistanis are missing,” Mr Yousuf said.
“The records of around 40,000 pilgrims were previously maintained in paper form and have not yet been fully transferred to the central digital registry.”
The initial report, which said tens of thousands of pilgrims (zaireen) had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq, was first floated by the minister himself as he announced a travel system overhaul.
 
 

To prevent future errors and enhance security, the Ministry of Religious Affairs launched a modern online registration system for all pilgrims travelling to Iran, Iraq and Syria.
The move is also aimed at curbing instances where individuals use the pilgrimage as a cover to migrate illegally to Europe through Turkiye.
Under the new system, tour operators must be officially registered, a practice similar to the one implemented by Saudi Arabia for Umrah pilgrimages.
“Under the new system, every pilgrim and group organiser will be issued a QR code for easy identification and coordination,” Mr Yousuf said.
He added that the government will now share complete pilgrim lists with authorities in Iran, Iraq and Syria ahead of travel.
“This proactive step will eliminate the possibility of any misunderstanding or propaganda regarding the movement of Pakistani pilgrims,” the minister said.

These two pilot cooperation projects were discussed in detail by delegations of both countries during a video conference in Islamabad on Saturday.
Minister of State for Railways and Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani and Deputy Chairman of Azerbaijan Railways Closed Joint Stock Company Arif Aghayev led delegations of their respective countries during the talks.
 
 

The meeting discussed opportunities for cooperation in increasing freight volumes, port integration, joint investment projects, and transport routes that pass through Azerbaijan and Pakistan within the Middle Corridor, according to a press release by the Ministry of Railways.
Delegations of both countries agreed to establish joint working groups to finalise freight transport initiatives and advance mutual cooperation in rail and trade sectors. These working groups will comprise officials from railways, commerce, finance and communication ministries.

Project to boost regional trade and connectivity

Secretary of Railways Board Muhammad Yusuf provided an overview of Pakistan Railways’ network. Discussions also took place regarding the Uzbekistan-Afghan­istan-Pakistan Rail Agreement.
The Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR), known as the Middle Corridor, is a multilateral institutional development that links the containerised rail freight transport networks of China and the European Union through the Central Asia, the Caucasus, Turkiye, and Eastern Europe, a press release of Azerbaijan Railways says.
Both sides emphasised the potential use of various routes along the South Asia–Caucasus–Europe corridor for mutual cargo exchange and expressed support for the development of a multimodal transport corridor connecting continents via Azerbaijan, passing through China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.
 
 

Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afgh­anistan have already signed a framework agreement which will usher the region into a new era of prosperity. This agreement is considered a game-changer for the regional connectivity with a trade potential of $292 billion. Pakistan and Uzbekistan will finance the feasibility study by contributing $5 million each.
Speaking on the occasion, Minister Bilal Azhar Kayani stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is implementing a comprehensive strategy for the development and modernisation of Pakistan Railways. He emphasised that Pakistan attaches great importance to expanding trade relations with Azerbaijan through rail connectivity.
Karachi-Rohri track
Meanwhile, transport experts from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) inspected the 480km railway track between Karachi and Rohri, which is a part of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) upgrade package.
The track, when upgraded, will provide easy access to Reko Diq and speed up uninterrupted supply of coal from Thar.

• Notices issued to 10 MPAs for payment of damages caused during budget session withdrawn
LAHORE: In a significant step towards de-escalation of political tensions in the Punjab Assembly, PA Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan has formally rejected the petitions seeking the disqualification of 26 PTI members.
This decision followed successful negotiations between the government and the opposition, and is expected to pave the way for the swift reinstatement of these suspended lawmakers.
The ruling comes after weeks of parliamentary deadlock, which saw the opposition members suspended for “disorderly conduct” during the budget session on June 27. The suspension for 15 sittings was a direct response to protests that disrupted Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s speech and involved the use of “offensive, abusive, and unparliamentary language and slogans”, as well as alleged physical altercations.
 
 

In his detailed written decision, the speaker firmly rejected the petitions. He underscored that the speaker’s role was not merely to act as a “postman” by forwarding such requests to the Election Commission. He cautioned that such an unscrutinised process could “weaken the constitutional framework” and “curtail freedom of expression” within the provincial assembly.
He clarified that while disruptive behaviour in parliaments worldwide often faced stringent measures, the serious allegations of legal and constitutional violations, including those related to oaths, must first be proven in a competent court or tribunal. He asserted that only after a judicial verdict would he be in a position to determine if disqualification under Article 63(2) of the Constitution was warranted, and if the matter should be subsequently referred to the Election Commission.
Four separate applications had been submitted demanding the disqualification of these members, with petitioners citing precedents like the Panama Papers case involving then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif and alleging violations of the speaker’s ruling and constitutional oaths. However, the speaker dismissed the disqualification requests that referenced the Panama case and similar decisions made under Articles 199 and 184-3 of the Constitution.
He stated that the petitioners retained the option to approach his office again, but only after securing a definitive decision from a competent court. The speaker also decided to withdraw the notices issued to 10 PTI MPAs for payment of damages caused to the furniture and other assets of the house during the June 27 session. The opposition members obstructed the proceedings of the house on June 27 by tearing agenda papers, hurling them at the treasury, using extreme derogatory language and physically impeding members who approached the treasury benches, according to the ruling, which shared the background of the petitions.
 
 

It was learnt that the policy of removing opposition members from the chairmanship of 13 standing committees was also being reversed, and the four chairpersons already removed from their offices through no-trust votes would also be reinstated.
Meanwhile, the opposition has intensified its pressure tactics, holding a ‘public assembly’ on the road outside the Punjab Assembly. During this ‘outdoor session’, the opposition leaders, like Ahmad Khan Bhachar, criticised the government’s handling of recent floods, soaring prices of essential commodities like sugar and petrol, and alleged political victimisation.
Mr Bhachar reiterated that the opposition would not return to the assembly until their suspended members were reinstated. He also presented a resolution condemning the government’s actions, which was passed by the ‘outdoor assembly’. According to political analysts, the decision by the speaker stressed the importance of due process and constitutional principles in parliamentary affairs and aimed to foster a more functional and less volatile political environment in Punjab.
While the government and opposition have agreed on activating the Advisory and Ethics Committees and avoiding indecent language in future sessions, the full reinstatement of the 26 members is now the immediate next step in restoring full parliamentary cooperation.

• Says Armaghan planned to shift call centre operations to Lahore and Islamabad
• Seeks more time to file final report as record from crypto exchanges still awaited
KARACHI: The investigating officer (IO) of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has informed a judicial magistrate that the prime suspect in the credit card data theft case, Armaghan Qureshi, had rented two properties to set up call centres in Lahore and Islamabad after the murder of Mustafa Amir.
The IO of the case, Ameer Ali Khoso, submitted this information in an interim charge sheet before the judicial magistrate (South), stating that more time was needed to file the final report as records from Binance and Coinbase were still awaited. He added that some documentary and digital evidence also remained to be collected.
Regarding the call centre operations, the IO claimed that during interrogation, the suspect revealed that he had decided to shift his operations after Mustafa’s killing. He allegedly paid rent to set up two call centres — one near PIA Society in Lahore for a monthly rent of Rs300,000, for which he the paid amount in advance.
In Islamabad, he allegedly acquired a facility on Data Khan Ganj Bakhsh Road, for which a total advance of Rs1.9 million was paid through a combination of cash and a servant’s bank account used under the tenant’s name.
Regarding the modus operandi of “illegal” call centre, the NCCIA explained in the report that the agents — who were hired by using multiple job seeking platforms — collect the sensitive personal information of victims’ through spoofed caller IDs while impersonating representatives of legitimate entities.
After collecting the data, agents were instructed to store the data in a software, which was under control of Armaghan, the report said, adding that later the suspect used that information to initiate unauthorised transactions by using various payment gateways, including Authorize.net, Stripe, Maverick Payment and others.
“All of these gateways were linked to US based LLC accounts registered under the name of Armaghan, his father and his father’s friends in different banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo,” the NCCIA claimed. “After the transaction the amount was converted into cryptocurrency including Bitcoin by using digital wallets.”
The report alleged that the suspect had masterminded and operated a transnational cybercrime racket involved in financial fraud, electronic theft, forgery, unauthorised fund transfers, digital identity misuse, cryptocurrency laundering, and international scams.
It added that his use of digital wallets, dark web transactions, and identity fraud indicated premeditated and systematic criminal activity.
The NCCIA claimed that the digital forensics analysis report confirmed that incriminating evidences were available on these digital devices like VoIP software, VPN software, access to United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) portals and extraction of registered trademark serials.
 
 

The case was registered against Armaghan under Sections 3 (unauthorised access to information system or data), 4 (unauthorised copying or transmission of data), 13 (electronic forgery), 14 (electronic forger), 16 (unauthorised use of identity information), 24 (cyber stalking) and 26 (spoofing) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 read with Sections 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
 
 

It may be noted that Armaghan has also been facing a case pertaining to the murder of Mustafa Amir.
The police had already filed an interim charge sheet against him, stating that Mustafa was allegedly murdered by Armaghan and his accomplice Sheraz, alias Shavez Bukhari, in a house in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Jan 6. The suspects allegedly stuffed Mustafa’s body into the trunk of his own car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
The charge sheet stated that CCTV footage obtained from the Rangers allegedly shows the suspects travelling from Karachi to Hub in the victim’s car on the day of the incident. Another video purportedly shows them returning to Karachi in a Suzuki pickup.

• NDMA blames climate change, glacier melt for floods
• PDMA issues fourth spell alert as rivers swell
• Rs5m relief package announced in Punjab
ISLAMABAD: As the country grapples with a monsoon season that has intensified by up to 60 per cent over previous years, the national and provincial disaster management authorities have predicted further rains in the coming days.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), at least 180 people have already been killed and more than 500 injured so far since the rains began unusually early in July.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Saturday forecast further rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, in Sindh over the next 24 hours. Cities and districts likely to be affected include Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Thatta, Badin, Larkana, Jaco­babad, Nawabshah, Mirpurkhas and others.
The NDMA’s NEOC has also issued alerts for urban flooding in low-lying parts of Sindh. It advised citizens to stay indoors during intense rainfall, avoid travelling to vulnerable areas and ensure household drainage systems remain clear.
The Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) of Punjab also issued an alert about the fourth spell of monsoon rains starting from July 20 (today). It forecasted strong winds, dusty winds and rain in most districts of Punjab from July 20 to 25.
 
 

Rain with strong winds is predicted in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Hafizabad, Gujrat, Jhelum and Gujranwala. There are also chances of rain in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Sargodha, Mianwali, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur and Bahaw­alnagar from July 18 to 23.
The PDMA also issued a high-level flood pre-alert for all major rivers and associated streams acro­ss the province, warning of pote­ntial flooding from July 22 due to an incoming weather system.
 
 

According to the Flood Forecasting Division, increased water flows are expected in the Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, Sutlej and Indus rivers, along with their tributaries and low-lying areas, posing significant risks.
KP, Islamabad on alert
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the monsoon system and glacial melt pose serious risks of flash flooding, particularly in the rivers Kabul, Swat, Panjkora, Bara and Kalpani Nullah. The NDMA warned of potential disruptions in transport across hilly and mountainous regions.
In Islamabad and central Punjab, strong monsoon currents are forecast to bring moderate to heavy rainfall through July 24, increasing the risk of urban flooding.
Meanwhile, due to rising water levels from recent downpours, the Rawal Dam reached its full capacity of 1,748 feet. Authorities announced the opening of its spillways at 6am on Sunday to reduce the level to 1,746 feet. Residents nearby have been advised to stay cautious.
Three children die in Attock
In a series of rain-related incidents in Attock, three children lost their lives on Saturday. A six-year-old girl, Fatima, drowned in a water channel in Amanpur, 12-year-old Muhammad Suleman died when the roof of his house collapsed in Bhattar, and five-year-old Umer Ayub was electrocuted in Ghourghushti after touching a live electric pole.
Meanwhile, in an incident unrelated to the rains, a man was shot dead in Mirza village in a targeted attack. Police said Inayat Rehman, 45, was going towards the mosque when two men hiding in a restaurant opened fire, killing him on the spot.
Over 1,500 rescued in Punjab
In Punjab, Rescue 1122 has rescued 1,594 people since June 25 in rain and flood-related emergencies, according to Secretary Emergency Services Dr Rizwan Naseer. Of these, 449 were seriously injured and shifted to hospitals. Moreover, 119 deaths have been confirmed, the majority due to the collapse of dilapidated buildings.
Rescue efforts included pre-emptive evacuation of 444 residents from high-risk areas and the deployment of over 100 boats and 312 rescue personnel. Lahore recorded the highest deaths at 27, followed by 15 in Faisalabad, 11 in Sheikhupura and 10 in Rawalpindi.
Since June 25, 369 building collapse incidents, 23 electrocutions, 62 rain-related crashes and multiple other emergencies have been reported, Dr Naseer said.
He urged the public to inspect rooftops, avoid contact with electric poles during rainfall and check forecasts before travelling to flood-prone or mountainous regions.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif directed the immediate restoration of flood-affected roads. Key arteries including Pind Dadan Khan-Jhelum Road, Matta Khurd Road, and Chakwal-Kallar Kahar Road have been reopened. In Rawalpindi, the Crowley Dhok Bridge and Dhok Parwana Road, damaged by floodwater, were also made accessible.
The chief minister also visited Chakwal on Saturday, where she announced Rs5 million in compensation for families of the deceased.
Five lives were lost in Chakwal’s record-breaking 430mm downpour earlier in the week. CM Maryam chaired a briefing at the district complex and commended district officials for their round-the-clock rescue efforts.
She ordered the evacuation of families from houses deemed vulnerable ahead of the next spell, and ordered the installation of a steel bridge at Dumman on the Chakwal-Sohawa Road, a key artery damaged by soil erosion. She also sought reports on privately built mini-dams, which worsened flooding in parts of Chakwal and Talagang.
The Punjab government on Saturday decided to ensure drainage in private housing societies, install modern alarm systems around Rawalpindi Nallah Lei and evacuate people living near the basins of Ravi, Sutlej and Beas rivers.
Intensified monsoon
NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik stated that this year’s unusually severe monsoon season, which he said began a month earlier than usual in July, was forecast by the authority four months in advance.
He said the current monsoon season has intensified by up to 60pc compared to previous years. In an interview with PTV News, he emphasised that comprehensive disaster response measures had been put in place under the guidance of the prime minister, with coordinated efforts from the armed forces, PDMAs and key stakeholders including NGOs and industries.
He attributed the heightened rainfall and disaster risk to climate change and accelerated glacier melting.

• Islamabad, Rawalpindi and a few other cities remain normal
KARACHI/LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: Karachi and Lahore — Pakistan’s two largest commercial cities — witnessed a near-complete shutdown on Saturday as traders observed a strike against what they described as harsh and anti-business taxation measures introduced through the Finance Act 2025-26.
The strike, called by the Karachi and Lahore Chambers of Commerce and Industry, marked one of the most widespread protests by the business community in recent years.
In Karachi, nearly 90 per cent of commercial activity remained suspended, including wholesale markets, retail shops, industries, and fruit and vegetable markets. KCCI President Jawed Bilwani told Dawn that this was the first time in the chamber’s history that the city’s entire business community had voluntarily shut down operations in protest.
Mr Bilwani said industrial production had come to a halt in all seven industrial zones, while no export consignments were sent to the port. Goods transporters also suspended operations, halting the movement of imported raw materials and finished goods. While Karachi Port Trust (KPT) officials claimed port operations remained unaffected, they could not confirm the flow of consignments to and from industries.
He said the economic cost of the strike could be gauged from Karachi’s significant contribution — around 70pc of federal tax revenues and 54pc of national exports.
Explaining the choice of Saturday for the strike, Mr Bilwani said the decision was taken unanimously by stakeholders, despite the usual weekend closures in multinational and large private companies. He stressed the strike was not a rebellious act but a last resort following repeated government inaction.
Among the business community’s core demands are the immediate suspension of Sections 37A and 37B of the Sales Tax Act — provisions that allow for the arrest and prosecution of taxpayers without due process. Other demands include the withdrawal of Section 21(s), which penalises cash-based transactions, and the restoration of the Final Tax Regime for exporters.
 


Mr Bilwani said these concerns were shared in detail with a committee led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Finance Haroon Akhtar Khan, but only verbal assurances were received. “Frustration has reached a boiling point,” he warned, adding that failure to receive written assurances or progress by next week would prompt further nationwide consultations on future actions.
He expressed appreciation for the unity shown by the seven town associations of Karachi and other trade bodies including the PHMA, Knitwear Exporters, Electronic Dealers, and Petroleum Dealers Associations. He also thanked chambers from other cities for their solidarity.
Complete shutdown in Lahore
Lahore also witnessed a widespread shutdown, with traders from major markets strongly protesting against the new taxation regime and expanded FBR powers. Despite the FPCCI’s announcement of strike withdrawal, major Lahore markets observed a complete closure in support of the LCCI’s call.
 


Closed markets included Shah Alam Market, Hall Road, Urdu Bazaar, Anarkali, Azam Cloth Market and many others. Some markets, like Abid Market, remained partially open. Traders vowed to continue protests until their charter of demands is met.
LCCI President Mian Abuzar Shad called the strike a historic show of unity and resistance. “July 19 will go down as a defining day in the struggle for economic justice,” he said at a press conference.
“We have been left with no option but to protest either through shutdown strikes or rallies. And we will continue it till acceptance of our charter of demands,” commented a trader. “We will not surrender, and the government must listen to this well,” he warned.
Mr Shad noted that Lahore and Karachi together represent over 60pc of Pakistan’s economy. “Today, that 60pc was silenced by choice — not force — to send a clear message to the government,” he said.
He revealed that the LCCI held nearly eight hours of virtual talks with senior government officials, including SAPM Haroon Akhtar, FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial and others, but no written commitment was offered. The chamber had sought urgent revisions to Sections 37A/B, the e-invoicing and e-Bilty systems, the 16pc sales tax on property rent, and 20pc tax on transactions above Rs200,000.
Twin cities remain open
In contrast, business activity remained unaffected in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where markets continued to operate as usual. Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Nasir Qureshi stated that the chamber had chosen to wait for the outcome of the recent assurances given by SAPM Haroon Akhtar.
Ajmal Baloch, President of the All Pakistan Anjuman Tajiran, announced a nationwide protest campaign starting with demonstrations on July 26, followed by phased strike actions if their demands were not addressed.
He criticised the bureaucracy, accusing it of misleading the government and warned of intensifying protests if the new FBR powers are not revoked.

“Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” New York-based Astronomer said in a statement shared on LinkedIn.
“Andy Byron has tendered his resignation,” the firm said, after previously launching an investigation.
The company added that Co-founder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy, who was assigned the role of interim CEO, will continue to serve in that position.
During a Coldplay concert in Foxborough, Massachusetts on Wednesday, the jumbotron zoomed in on a man and a woman embracing in the stands.
But the canoodling pair appeared shocked and horrified when they spotted themselves on the big screen, with the man ducking out of frame and the woman covering her face with her hands and spinning around.
“Uh-oh, what? Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” joked Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.
 






Within hours, internet sleuths tracked down the man as Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and said the woman was the company’s chief people officer, Kristin Cabot, alleging that the two were having a not-so-discreet affair.
According to Reuters, a spokesman for the company said that the pair were the only employees of the firm caught on camera. The spokesman did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment on Cabot’s job status.
The video has garnered millions of views on TikTok and other social media, giving rise to memes discussing everything from the folly of having an affair at a Coldplay concert, to the hypocrisy of an HR representative seemingly caught in a workplace relationship.
“The craziest thing is about the Astronomer CEO cheating scandal is it was the HR lady,” said one X user. “The person who would warn you against fraternising with coworkers.”
 






Furry mascots of the Philadelphia Phillies Major League Baseball team jumped on the trend and recreated the scene for the jumbotron at a game after the video went viral.
 






However, an apology statement attributed to Byron, which spread rapidly online, was fake and appeared to have originated from a parody account.

The report, titled ‘Tax Stamps and Illicit  Cigarette Sales in Pakistan: Understanding Retailers’ Knowledge Gap’, was released by Umeed-i-Sehar, a non-profit organisation focused on public health initiatives. Based on a survey of 2,000 retailers in seven major cities — including Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad — the study  paints a troubling picture of regulatory neglect and widespread retailer  unawareness.
An overwhelming 97pc of retailers said they had  never been approached by Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officials for compliance guidance, while 86pc were unaware of the government-imposed  penalties for selling illicit cigarettes.
Only 27pc of retailers could differentiate bet­ween tax-paid and illicit cigarette packs.
Meanwhile, 73pc did not understand the placement or purpose of tax stamps, relying instead on price as the main indicator of legality. While 86pc cited low price as the deciding factor, just 12pc considered the presence of a tax stamp.
Regarding inventory, 59pc of retailers estimated that 30-60pc of the cigarette packs they sold lacked  tax stamps, while 29pc believed that over 60pc of their stock was  illicit.
The findings highlight the pivotal role retailers play in  sustaining the illicit cigarette trade, which continues to undermine  legitimate businesses. With over 50 local and international  manufacturers and an estimated annual consumption of 80bn sticks, Pakistan’s tobacco industry faces significant challenges as illicit  sales steadily erode the market share of tax-compliant firms.
The FBR had introduced the TransAct App to help retailers verify tax stamps, but the study revealed that 98pc of respondents were unaware of the app, and 99pc had never used it.
Additionally, 43pc of retailers  said that consumer promotions and advertisements promoting cheaper, untaxed cigarettes influenced their purchasing decisions. Another 31pc cited high demand and low pricing as key factors behind stocking illicit  brands.

The vessel was carrying 48 passengers and five crew members when it capsized in the Unesco World Heritage site because of sudden heavy rain, the VNExpress news site said. Most of those on board were families visiting from the capital Hanoi, with more than 20 children among the passengers, it said.
“Border guards rescued 11 people and recovered 34 bodies,” it added. Rescue efforts were set to continue into the night to find the eight still missing.
Ha Long Bay office worker Tran Trong Hung said the storm started in the afternoon.
“The sky turned dark at around 2 pm (0700 GMT),” he said. There were  “hailstones as big as toes with torrential rain, thunderstorm and lightning”, he said.
One of the rescued, a 10-year-old boy, told state media outlet VietnamNet:  “I took a deep breath, swam through a gap, dived, then swam up. I even shouted for help, then I was pulled up by a boat with soldiers.”
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh sent his condolences to the families of the deceased and called on the defence and public security ministries to conduct urgent search and rescue.
Authorities would  “investigate and clarify the cause of the incident and strictly handle violations”, a statement on the government website said. Torrential rain also lashed northern Hanoi, Thai Nguyen and Bac Ninh provinces on Saturday.

The projections show the number of poor could rise by up to 148.8 million, with those in South Asia projected to be at 48.8m by  2030.
As per the findings — part of the report titled ‘The Future of Poverty’: Projecting the Impact of Climate Change on Global Pov­erty  through 2050 — the number of people living in extreme poverty worldwide could be nearly doubled due to climate change.
 
 

The rise in poverty due to climate change is likely to be profound in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, where the effects of extreme weather events are likely to interact with existing structural vulnerabilities and weaker social protection systems.

High-income countries, which have contributed the most to global emissions, have a responsibility to support low- and middle-income countries in their efforts to adapt to climate change, it said.
This includes providing financial resources, technology transfer, and capacity-building support to help countries build resilience to climate shocks and transition to low-carbon development pathways.
The WB report said efforts to reduce income inequality must be central to any poverty reduction strategy, as the projections show, even small increases in inequality can lead to large increases in poverty.
 
 

Policies that promote inclusive economic growth, reduce barriers to education and employment and enhance social protection systems will be critical for ensuring the benefits of economic development are shared more broadly, according to the study.
It stressed the need to  streng­th­­­­en social safety nets and provide targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable populations.
This includes expanding access to healthcare, education, and financial services, as well as improving the resilience of livelihoods through investments in agriculture, infrastructure, and climate adaptation measures.
According to the report, climate change-induced rising food prices may significantly increase global poverty, particularly in the developing world, where food consumption accounts for a large share of household expenditures.
If nothing changes, the projections suggest that global economic output could be reduced by 23pc by 2100 compared to a world without climate change.
In most scenarios, projected global income losses exceed 20pc, underscoring the potentially severe economic consequences of inaction.
The report said even though rich and poor countries respond similarly to temperature chan­ges, the economic impacts are substantially larger for the latter, as these are predominantly located in already warm regions.

• Dar to visit US next week to attend high-level signature events
WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said that Pakistan and the United States are close to concluding a crucial trade agreement as negotiations in Washington entered their final phase.
Both sides expressed optimism that the deal would pave the way for a broader and more strategic economic partnership.
Mr Aurangzeb and his team returned to Pakistan early Saturday after two days of high-level talks in Washington.
In a statement after a key meeting on Friday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer, Mr Aurangzeb described the discussions as “very constructive” and pointed to “clear commitment from both sides” to resolve outstanding issues.
“We had a very constructive dialogue with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer,” said the finance minister. “There is a very clear commitment from both sides to get closure on the remaining items so that we can move towards the finishing line.”
 






Mr Aurangzeb was joined in the meetings by Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul.
“This is very important for us because the US is Pakistan’s largest trading partner,” he said. “It is critical that we move forward in the same positive spirit that has defined our discussions over the past few weeks and months.”
The talks are part of Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to shield its exports from steep US tariffs — currently at 29 per cent under President Donald Trump’s trade policy aimed at reducing American deficits with trading partners. Pakistan’s surplus stood at around $3 billion in 2024.
Islamabad has responded by offering to import more US goods, including crude oil, and by opening investment opportunities in key sectors such as mining, digital infrastructure, and technology.
A Pakistani delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, also visited Washington in early July with the aim of finalising a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of the 29pc tariff on Pakistani exports.
Officials familiar with the negotiations say the talks were successful, with both sides agreeing to a broad framework.
Mr Aurangzeb said both sides agreed that the relationship should not be limited to trade alone. “We have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative,” he noted. “For the Pakistan-US relationship to move to the next level, investment is the key — and we believe areas like minerals, AI, and crypto could be real game changers.”
 
 

He also said that ongoing trade talks would soon be followed by a new phase of dialogue focusing on bilateral investment. “Trade is the starting point,” he explained, “but it will very quickly be followed through with investment discussions and real execution of the investment upside available to both sides — so that it becomes a real win-win for Pakistan and the United States.”
Sources close to the talks say that while a broad understanding has already been reached, a formal announcement is expected only after the US concludes similar deals with other partners.
The renewed momentum in US-Pakistan ties follows last month’s White House meeting between President Trump and Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir — the first such meeting in recent memory — signaling a strategic reset in the relationship.
Since the start of his second term, President Trump has signaled a desire to improve relations with Pakistan. In his inaugural address to Congress, he publicly thanked Pakistan for capturing and handing over a notorious terrorist, a gesture that was well received in Islamabad.
 
 

Dar to visit US
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar, is scheduled to visit the United States next week to attend the high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency in New York, as well as to participate in various engagements in Washington. In New York, as part of Pakistan’s Security Council signature events, he will chair a high-level open debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”.
In addition, Mr Dar will preside over the quarterly open debate of the Security Council on the “Situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question”.
He will also chair a high-level briefing of the UN Security Council that will focus on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
The deputy prime minister is scheduled to attend the high-level conference on “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of Two-State Solution”.

The decline in raw food exports marks the end of a 20-month streak of uninterrupted growth, despite persistently high food inflation.
According to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the export of traditional value-added products saw only marginal growth during the fiscal year.
Rice exports fell by 14.72pc year-on-year to $3.353bn from $3.931bn. While the volume of basmati rice exports increased by 4.48pc to 808,643 tonnes, its value dropped by 5.3pc to $830.57 million. Non-basmati rice exports decreased by 17.42pc in value to $2.522bn, with a 4.65pc decline in quantity to 5.009m tonnes.
Meat exports also declined by 3.24pc in FY25. Domestic meat prices have surged significantly, with buffalo meat prices more than doubling from Rs700 to Rs1,600 per kg over the past three and a half years.
Exports of vegetables and fruits decreased by 14.53pc and 10.29pc, respectively. However, fish and fish product exports grew by 13.44pc during the same period.
In June 2024, the government allowed the export of 150,000 tonnes of sugar, but actual exports soared to 757,779 tonnes by March 2025. Since then, the government has imposed restrictions on further sugar exports.
Non-textile shows mixed trend
Non-textile exports were primarily driven by a few value-added segments, including leather, footwear, and engineering products. Engineering goods exports rose by 16.46pc, led by increased shipments of industrial machinery, transport equipment, auto parts, and rubber tyres.
Cement exports saw a 28.71pc increase in quantity and a 23.74pc rise in value. Footwear exports climbed 8.88pc, mainly due to a 10.12pc increase in leather footwear. Leather manufacturers’ exports rose by 4.87pc, with leather gloves contributing significantly with 11.8pc growth. Raw leather exports recorded a marginal rise of 0.45pc.
Pakistan remains a key global supplier of surgical instruments, but their export value remains low as foreign companies rebrand many products. This category saw only a modest 1.61pc growth.
Exports of carpets and rugs declined by 4.24pc, while sports goods dropped 2.74pc. Gur (jaggery) exports — not categorised under food — saw a steep fall of 34.82pc.
Jewellery exports rose by 10.59pc, handicrafts by 45.38pc, and furniture exports fell by 8.36pc. Molasses exports plunged by 68pc, while gem exports were down by 12.12pc.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi led the charge on Saturday, calling on Modi to address the nation regarding the fate of the jets.
“Modi ji, what is the truth about the five [jets]? The country has the right to know!” Mr Gandhi posted on X, as criticism from the opposition mounted over the government’s han­­dling of the brief but intense conflict.
 






The controversy erupted after Trump, speaking at a White House dinner with Republican lawmakers on Friday, said, “In fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,” referring to the hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours.

Indian premier asked to ‘speak truth’

Trump did not specify which side’s aircraft were downed, nor did he provide further details.
Following the India-Pakistan war, Trump has repeatedly taken credit — over 60 times — for brokering the ceasefire he announced via social media on May 10, after Washington engaged in backchannel diplomacy with both sides.
However, India has challenged his claim, disputing that the truce resulted from US intervention or the threat of cutting trade ties if hostilities continued.
Congress general secretary-in-charge (communications) Jairam Ramesh accused Modi of failing to address Trump’s repeated assertions.
“The Trump missile gets fired for the 24th time with the same two messages, two days before the Monsoon Session of Parliament begins,” Mr Ramesh said.
“The prime minister has to now himself make a clear and categorical statement in Parliament on what President Trump has been claiming over the past 70 days.”
As the Indian Parliament prepares to convene for the monsoon session, the opposition has signalled that it will continue to press Mr Modi for answers.
The escalation between India and Pakistan was triggered by an attack in Pahalgam in India-held Kashmir in April.
The attack, which killed 26 men, led to a rapid military escalation, with Islamabad responding to what it called New Delhi’s “unprovoked strikes”.  A ceasefire was brokered days later, following US intervention on May 10.
Pakistan has claimed it downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat, while India’s top military official acknowledged in late May that the country suffered losses in the air on the first day of hostilities before switching tactics and regaining the advantage ahead of the ceasefire.
On May 10, Mr Trump announced on social media that Washington had held talks with both sides.  “These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other,” he said.
“We said, you guys want to make a trade deal. We’re not making a trade deal if you’re going to be throwing around weapons, and maybe nuclear weapons.”
India, however, has pushed back against Trump’s claims, insisting that the ceasefire was the result of direct talks between New Delhi and Islamabad, without outside intervention.
India maintains that it does not accept third-party mediation in its disputes with Pakistan.
The US counts both India and Pakistan as important partners in the region, with Washington seeking to deepen ties with New Delhi as part of its strategy to counter China’s influence in Asia.
The attack in India-held Kashmir, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan, brought the two nuclear-armed countries to the brink of their fifth all-out war.  Islamabad has denied any involvement and called for a neutral investigation.

Police said a magnetic explosive device was attached to the officer’s vehicle, which exploded in the Jabl-i-Noor area, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta.
Dawn withheld the martyred officer’s name and rank as there was no official announcement regarding the martyrdom.
However, officials said CCTV footage from a nearby camera showed a motorcyclist passing close to the vehicle moments before the explosion. He reportedly attached the explosive device to the driver’s side door. A few seconds later, the blast took place.
Security forces cordoned off the area after the attack and moved the officer’s body to the Combined Military Hospital, Quetta.
Initial investigation revealed it was a remote-controlled explosion.  The window panes of nearby shops and buildings were smashed due to the intensity of the blast.
Police said the officer had gone to the Jabl-i-Noor graveyard to offer fateha on the grave of his father. He was leaving the graveyard when he was targeted.
No other casualty was reported in the blast.
Police and CTD officials were investigating the incident.
The martyred officer belonged to the Muslim Bagh area of Pishin and was serving in the army for the last 10 years. He is survived by a wife and three sons.

• Insiders claim oath-taking slated for today may get delayed due to ‘quorum’
• PPP leader says opposition alliance intact, will secure five seats
PESHAWAR: As the disgruntled PTI workers are adamant on contesting Senate polls despite an understanding between the KP’s ruling party and the opposition, the agreement on seat adjustment, however, seems to remain intact, with both sides now working on the panel of voters for their candidates.
The oath-taking of the 25 MPAs-elect, which is scheduled for today (Sunday), has also assumed importance, as non-administration of oaths to them could lead to postponement of Senate polls.
One of the ruling party MPAs told Dawn that there was a likelihood that oath-taking would not take place on Sunday, as the session might be adjourned at the outset due to “lack of quorum”.
The treasury and the joint opposition alliance had agreed on a seat-sharing formula under which six seats will go to the treasury, which has 92 members in the KP Assembly, and five seats to the opposition, which is 53-strong.
“The denial of Senate tickets to diehard workers has strengthened the doubts of the establishment’s involvement in the award of tickets,” one of the PTI insiders told Dawn. It was a good opportunity for the Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to stand with the ideological workers and dispel the impression that he was not the “establishment guy”. “We will not take part in the establishment game; rather, we will fully participate in the Senate elections,” PTI’s Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem said in his video message issued on Saturday.
This understanding had not sat well with the party’s Peshawar chapter, which had decided to oppose this agreement and vowed to contest the polls despite the party’s policy. On Saturday, they also released video messages, announcing they would stick to their stance. They said they would contest the elections in line with PTI founder Imran Khan’s vision. On the other hand, the PTI leadership has put their heads together on how to handle the situation, as party insiders believe that among the disgruntled candidates, Irfan Saleem will definitely score.
Gandapur asked to dispel impression
Referring to his party seat adjustment with the opposition, Mr Saleem said, “The plan is basically made to elect the pro-establishment candidates in the Senate elections”. He said that they would not withdraw and will fully resist the plan, adding that they didn’t tolerate blame on the Imran Khan vision under which the masses of KP and the entire country voted for him. Basically, the seat adjustment with the opposition is aimed at electing those people who have made the lives of the PTI workers and their leadership miserable after the May 9 incident, he said, adding that they would not bow down before such forces.
Another disgruntled candidate Khurram Shehzad said that a Senate ticket or other designations meant nothing to him, but “not contesting the elections is against Imran Khan’s ideology”. “I have been receiving different kinds of threats to withdraw from the race, but I will not, no matter if I am unable to get a single vote,” he said.
Another candidate Aisha Bano, who also refused to withdraw, said in her video message that, like her colleagues, she was going to contest the Senate election. “The Senate’s seats are a sacred trust of Imran Khan with us, and we will not let go easily,” she said, adding someelements wanted to favour those who were involved in the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
Against Imran’s ideology
Meanwhile, the opposition parties held a meeting at KP Governor House, attended by Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, leader of the opposition in KP Assembly Dr Ibadullah and senior leaders of the opposition parties.
The participants discussed the issue of oath-taking from the 25 MPAs-elect on reserved seats. PPP parliamentary leader Ahmad Karim Kundi told Dawn that the opposition alliance was intact and will secure five seats, including three general and one each for technocrat and women.
Sepa­rately, the Election Commission of Pakistan appointed eight polling officers to oversee the Senate elections set to take place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday. According to the ECP, Senate elections for eleven seats from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will be held on July 21.
