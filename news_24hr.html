Hamid was convicted in the case along with several PTI leaders on July 31. According to his brother, he was detained by Islamabad police earlier today while he was on his way to Faisalabad to court arrest.
He was later presented before the court, which issued an order, noting that Hamid had been convicted in the case registered at Civil Lines police station in Faisalabad by then-ATC Judge Javed Iqbal Sheikh.
He was produced before the court today by Inspector Mujahid Iqbal of Civil Lines police station, it added.
According to the order, a copy of which is available with Dawn, Hamid was sentenced in the case on multiple counts, with the maximum term being 10 years.
It said that the Faisalabad Central Jail superintendent was required and authorised to receive the convict in his custody for the completion of his sentences in accordance with the law.
“The sentences of imprisonment awarded to the convict for all the offences shall run concurrently,” the order read, adding that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Code of Criminal Procedure had been extended in favour of the convict.
The detention
Earlier today, Hamid’s brother, Sahibzada Hassan Raza, had said the SIC chief had been detained by Islamabad police while he was travelling to Faisalabad with the intention of surrendering himself before the court.
Police arrested him near a picket on Islamabad bypass road, Hassan said while speaking to the media outside the Faisalabad ATC, where Hamid was produced.
A separate post on Hamid’s X account also cited Hassan as saying that Hamid
was detained by Islamabad police as he was en route to Faisalabad.
“He was travelling from Peshawar to Faisalabad to surrender. Islamabad police arrested him,” the early morning post stated.
 






PTI leader Omar Ayub also posted about the development, saying that Raza was “abducted” from Islamabad late last night.
“Sahibzada Hamid Raza sahib, my dear friend and colleague, has been abducted from Islamabad late last night whilst en route to surrender in the conviction awarded by an anti-terrorism court [in] Faisalabad,” Ayub said, adding that he “strongly” condemned the move.
 






“Sahibzada Hamid Raza sahib is a brave and very loyal ally of PM Imran Khan (sic). He must be produced immediately in the relevant court,” the PTI leader added.
The development comes just two days after the Peshawar High Court rejected Raza’s plea seeking transit bail in the May 9 riots case.
Violent demonstrations had broken out in the country on May 9, 2023 following the arrest of ex-premier and PTI founder Imran Khan.
Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested. Later, the ECP had also deprived the PTI of its bat symbol, compelling party members to contest the 2024 elections as independent candidates. Subsequently, the PTI had allied with the SIC in a bid to get reserved seats, which are allocated on a party basis.
Raza’s conviction also led to his disqualification as a member of the National Assembly by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
After today’s court order, Hassan said while speaking to the media in Faisalabad that they would move the court for a stay order against election for the seat vacated after Hamid’s disqualification.</p><small>2025-11-07 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/071414220b833fe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953692/blast-injures-54-near-school-in-indonesian-capital-police' target='_blank'><strong>Blast injures 54 near school in Indonesian capital: police</strong></a><br><p>A blast injured dozens of people near a school in Indonesia’s capital on Friday, a senior police official said without disclosing the cause of the explosion.
Jakarta police chief Asep Edi Suheri said there was an explosion “in the vicinity” of a high school in the sprawling city.
“The initial data we have received indicates that there are approximately 54 individuals affected,” Asep told reporters in comments broadcast by Kompas TV.
“Some have minor injuries, some moderate, and some have already been discharged.”
Authorities had cordoned off the area and “were processing the crime scene”, Asep said, including a bomb squad from Jakarta police as they tried to determine the cause of the blast.
Asep said authorities had also set up posts in two hospitals to assist relatives in finding injured victims.
“We are still investigating, as this incident just occurred,” Asep said.</p><small>2025-11-07 09:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/071302227424de0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953688/lhc-orders-punjab-govt-to-act-against-smoke-emitting-vehicles' target='_blank'><strong>LHC orders Punjab govt to act against smoke-emitting vehicles</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday ordered the Punjab government to launch a rigorous campaign against smoke-emitting vehicles in the province in an effort to curb smog and air pollution.
“Whenever you go out, you see dozens of smoke-emitting vehicles on the roads,” Justice Shahid Karim said while hearing a set of petitions against smog and environmental pollution.
Justice Karim instructed authorities to run the campaign for at least two to three weeks and urged strict implementation. He also observed that vehicles travelling from Lahore to Karachi, in particular, were causing pollution.
Officials from the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the Parks and Horticultural Authority (PHA) and other departments also appeared before the court at today’s hearing.
However, the judge expressed his displeasure over the absence of a director-level officer from the EPA, as instructed at the previous hearing.
Taking exception to pollution caused by vehicles, Justice Karim directed the EPA to display banners across Lahore which warned commuters that smoke-emitting vehicles would be impounded.
The EPA official informed the court that such banners had indeed been placed around the city. At this, the judge ordered the agency to depute its officers alongside police personnel at inter-city bus terminals.
He also enquired if vehicles travelling through the motorway toll plazas were being inspected and ordered officials to ensure strict checking of vehicles plying GT Road from Lahore to Multan.
If the court’s previous orders had been implemented in letter and spirit, Lahore’s condition would have been different, he regretted, directing authorities to “take action against anyone responsible for spreading pollution.”
The judge also instructed the Punjab government’s law officer to arrange a joint meeting of the environment department, the chief traffic officer and the transport department.
Earlier, the EPA officer informed the court that at least 60 tons of old tyres had been seized from plants in South Punjab and other cities.
Over the past few weeks, Lahore has continued to remain high on the list of cities with the most polluted air. Today, it ranked as the fifth worst in the world in terms of poor air quality, according to global monitor IQAir. The city registered an air quality index (AQI) reading of 177, which the monitor considers unhealthy.
On Monday, the LHC had expressed its displeasure at the city administration’s lack of action to counter smog and pollution, questioning the use of anti-smog guns and tree cutting in the metropolis. Justice Karim had clarified that the proceedings were not against anyone but meant to guide and assist the government.</p><small>2025-11-07 08:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632485-pakistan-backs-unsc-resolution-lifting-sanctions-on-syrian-president-sharaa' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan backs UNSC resolution lifting sanctions on Syrian President Sharaa</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on social media platform X, state-run PTV said that Information Minister Attaullah Tarar was also accompanying the premier.
 






Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said PM Shehbaz would undertake the visit to participate in events being held in connection with the fifth anniversary of Victory Day, which commemorates Azerbaijan’s triumph in liberating its territories from Armenian occupation.
The statement said that the premier was undertaking the visit at the invitation of Azerbaijan President Aliyev. “During the visit, the prime minister will attend the official Victory Day celebrations and hold a meeting with President Aliyev,” the FO said.
“Discussions will focus on reviewing the entire gamut of bilateral relations and identifying new avenues to further deepen cooperation in diverse sectors, including trade and investment, energy, defence, education, and regional connectivity,” it added.
 






The FO said that Pakistan and Azerbaijan enjoy “long-standing fraternal relations, rooted in shared faith, history, culture, and mutual trust”.
“The visit by the prime minister will reaffirm Pakistan’s steadfast support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and to further advance the strategic partnership between the two brotherly nations,” the FO concluded.
The premier had visited Azerbaijan earlier this year in May as well while on a four-nation tour. He had met the Azerbaijan president, and the two had renewed their pledge to diversify the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues.
President Aliyev had also called PM Shehbaz in August and expressed his appreciation for Pakistan’s consistent support on the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.</p><small>2025-11-07 08:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632486-pm-shehbaz-departs-for-azerbaijan-on-two-day-official-visit' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz departs for Azerbaijan on two-day official visit</strong></a><br><p>

Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative, made the remarks while addressing the UN Security Council (UNSC). According to a press release issued by the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the United Nations (UN), the envoy sounded alarm over the “deliberate weaponisation of shared natural resources”, citing the suspension of the IWT as an example.
In his remarks, he warned that the move “should be of grave concern for every member of this council and for the international community as a whole”.
 


“For more than six decades, this treaty has stood as a model of cooperation, ensuring equitable and predictable sharing of the Indus basin’s waters between Pakistan and India even in times of war,” he said.
“India’s unlawful unilateral decision to suspend this framework undermines the letter and spirit of this treaty, threatens ecosystems, disrupts data sharing and endangers the lives of millions who depend on the Indus water system for food and energy security for their very survival,” he said.

The ambassador emphasised that “such acts do not just harm one country … they weaken confidence in international water law and set a precedent for resource-based and driven coercion elsewhere.”
The envoy asserted that “Pakistan has consistently maintained that no provision of the IWT permits unilateral suspension or modification”.
Reiterating Pakistan’s position on the matter, the ambassador called for “full respect for the treaty and an early return to compliance and normal functioning through the established channels.”
According to the press release, Ambassador Asim also highlighted the structural nexus between environment and security and advocated a paradigm shift toward preventive and sustainable peacebuilding.
He also urged “concerted international measures to integrate environmental considerations into conflict prevention, peacekeeping, and post-conflict recovery”.
He called on the UNSC to “fulfil its charter responsibility to address threats to international peace and security at their very inception”. Ahmad further cautioned that “environmental degradation in conflict is not just collateral damage but also a catalyst for instability.”
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s “determination to advance collective action for ecological restoration, strengthen compliance with international law, and transform shared natural resources into instruments of cooperation rather than vectors of division”.
Under the 1960 IWT, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers. In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
In April, India held the IWT in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”.
In June, the PCA issued a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the case, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
The court, in its August ruling in the case, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said, adding that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
Earlier this week, President Asif Ali Zardari said that the violation of the IWT by India could not and would not succeed, and warned against the weaponisation of water.</p><small>2025-11-07 07:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0711184767ea02c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953683/us-influencers-falsely-associate-nyc-mayor-elect-mamdani-with-islamic-state-group' target='_blank'><strong>US influencers falsely associate NYC mayor-elect Mamdani with Islamic State group</strong></a><br><p>US right-wing influencers falsely linked New York’s mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani to the militant Islamic State (IS) group, amplifying a fabricated statement that garnered millions of views on social media, researchers said on Thursday.
Mamdani — the first Muslim and South Asian elected to lead America’s largest city — secured a decisive victory this week in the face of fierce attacks on his policy proposals and religious background.
A slew of anti-Mamdani accounts on the Elon Musk-owned platform X have circulated a statement purportedly from IS titled “Operation Manhattan Project”, which alluded to an attack in New York City on Election Day against what it called “American aggression”.
Among the influencers who linked the fake communique to Mamdani was Laura Loomer, a conservative influencer who has Trump’s ear.
“The Muslims can’t think of a better way for the Muslims to celebrate the victory of a Muslim mayoral candidate today than by committing an ISIS (Islamic State) attack in NYC,” Loomer wrote in a post on X that racked up more than 200,000 views.
 






Other conservative accounts cited the purported statement to falsely claim that the militant group had endorsed Mamdani as mayor.
The posts collectively amassed millions of views across the platform.
The purported letter, which displayed the logo of the IS-affiliated Amaq News Agency, was fabricated, according to multiple researchers including the disinformation watchdog NewsGuard.
Meili Criezis, an American University academic, told the watchdog that the supposed communique did not bear the hallmarks of other statements that emanated from Amaq.
“Amaq is used [by the IS] to share news and claim responsibility for attacks,” Criezis said. “It doesn’t make threats like what is stated in the screenshot.”
The Information Epidemiology Lab, another research group, also said the circulated communique “sharply” diverged from established IS “media practices in language, style, formatting, and distribution”.
The fabricated statement appeared to first surface on the far-right message board 4chan, a known haven for conspiracy theories.
In recent months, Mamdani, a long-standing supporter of the Palestinian cause, has vocally denounced anti-Semitism as well as the Islamophobia he himself suffered following the September 11, 2001 attacks.
 
 

The 34-year-old state lawmaker — who appealed to voters by pledging to tackle the soaring cost of living — has repeatedly been targeted by racist tropes and misinformation.
In the weeks leading up to the highly anticipated election, AFP’s fact-checkers debunked several false internet claims targeting Mamdani, including that a non-citizen illegally voted for him and that one of his campaign staffers posed beside graffiti of Nazi swastika.</p><small>2025-11-07 06:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632470-commander-of-defence-forces-title-on-the-cards-as-part-of-key-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>'Commander of Defence Forces' title on the cards as part of key reforms</strong></a><br><p>

The 32-year-old pacer, in an interview on a YouTube channel, accused officials including then selector and manager Manjurul Islam of sexual harassment during the 2022 Women’s World Cup in South Africa.
Manjurul, who is currently in China, rejected the allegations as “baseless”.
Describing an incident during the 2022 World Cup, Jahanara alleged that Manjurul “made inappropriate physical contact”, claiming he “often hugged or pressed female players to his chest” under the pretext of encouragement.
“You can ask other girls in the team”, Manjurul said. “This is all false.”
Manjurul, 46, a former left-arm seamer, played 12 Tests and 34 ODIs for Bangladesh between 1999 and 2004, before serving in various coaching and managerial roles.
Jahanara took 48 wickets in ODIs, and 60 in T20s, across 135 white-ball matches for her country.
She also named other BCB officials, and said that she had previously written to the board, but that no action had been taken.
The BCB said a committee would submit its findings within 15 working days.
It reaffirmed its commitment to a “safe, respectful, and professional environment”, it said in a statement late on Thursday.
“We have to investigate this, since it’s a serious matter,” BCB vice-president Shakhawat Hossain said.</p><small>2025-11-07 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632473-sic-chief-sahibzada-hamid-raza-arrested-in-faisalabad' target='_blank'><strong>SIC chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza arrested in Faisalabad</strong></a><br><p>

Although it hasn’t been finalised yet, the idea has the backing of Asia’s football leader Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa.
FIFA confirmed at the end of last year that Saudis will fulfil their long-standing ambition of hosting football’s showpiece tournament after an unopposed bid and become the second country in the Arabian peninsula to host a World Cup after Qatar. The World Cup in Qatar was the first to be held in November-December to avoid the searing desert heat of the summer and Sheikh Salman, the Asian Football Confederation president, wants the Saudis to do the same.
“I don’t see it any other way but there is still a long way to 2034 and I think it depends on FIFA and the confederations to decide,” Sheikh Salman, who is also FIFA’s senior vice-president, told Dawn in an interview during his three-day visit to Pakistan as a state guest.
“The time will come for them to decide but I think I agree why the World Cup should not only be in the summer,” he added. “Like even in the United States [the joint-hosts of the 2026 FIFA World Cup alongside Canada and Mexico] in the summer, it’s too hot in some cities and if you want to play in the afternoon, it is very difficult for the players.”
Sheikh Salman pointed out that despite the winter scheduling of the World Cup resulting in a tweak in the calendar, it sees peak performance levels from the players who are midway into the season, especially those playing in European leagues.
“People will dispute [the timing] that it will interrupt the calendar but you know when you have players coming in after some months into the season, you can see the difference on the pitch,” he said, referring to performances by Argentina’s totemic forward Lionel Messi who guided his country to long-awaited World Cup glory in Qatar.
“I don’t think a player like Messi could have performed at his age in a World Cup if he’d played the whole season and come in the summer. He played magnificently, he won the best player, which I think we all agree he was.”
Sheikh Salman also had words of praise for Qatar, the city-sized country that delivered a spectacular World Cup without any hiccups.
“I don’t think Qatar even got what they deserved from their success,” he said. “I don’t think anyone wants to say positive things about how Qataris handled the World Cup, particularly in the West and we’ve noticed that. But to me, it was the best World Cup I’ve seen since I’ve been in football. I’ve been there, I saw the stadiums, and I saw how even the teams were back in their hotel within an hour after the match.”
The World Cup in Qatar was the last edition to be played with 32 teams, with the 2026 edition to see the number of teams increased to 48 teams. There has been growing talk to increase the number of teams to 64 for the 2030 edition — to be hosted in Spain, Portugal and Morocco with some matches in South America as well — and beyond.
In April this year, Saudi Arabia’s sports minister Prince Abdelaziz Turki bin Faisal said his country would be “more than happy” to hold an even more expanded World Cup but Sheikh Salman believes it is too early to decide with no guarantee of even the 48-team event being a success.
“I’m not against 64 teams,” he said. “But what I’m against is changing the regulations because you’ve already decided [48 teams] in the Congress and the [hosting] bids that were submitted for 2026, 2030 and 2034 and were approved on their own form, which is the 48 teams … There are obligations on the host countries to do what needs to be done.
“There are costs, there are stadiums, training facilities, all these things are involved. And when it is approved, you cannot keep changing them. You can talk beyond [the] 2034 [edition] if you want to take [the number of teams] to 64 or you want to come down to 32, that’s a different story.
“But we haven’t tried the 48 teams yet. The first event is going to be next year so we need to assess that a 48-team World Cup is good or bad and then we can decide whether to go higher or stay as we are or even go lower. It depends on whatever is best for FIFA and the 211 members.”
The push to go on the higher side remains unrelenting though, with the promise of more teams and wider interest. But further expansion brings other issues as well, most notably the countries that are able to host it. With the World Cup set to come back to Asia just 12 years after Qatar, Sheikh Salman believes the continent could well become the location of choice for the football showpiece.
“I think Asia is probably the second continent that can host the World Cups in the future,” he said. “We know Europe has the infrastructure but with the expansion of the World Cup, it’s not so easy for countries to host this event with the cost and the infrastructure that is needed. We’ve already seen what Qatar has done in 2022. I think it will be difficult to repeat that success with 32 teams. Maybe in the future, it will be back to 32 teams again, but we don’t know about it.”

“The government has really destroyed all of us economically. I can simply say it has killed us,” deplores a shopkeeper while talking to Dawn on Thursday.
“The LDA officials brought heavy machinery early on Wednesday morning and started razing all shops — 152 in total. They didn’t even care for several innocent birds and animals that were also killed after being buried under debris,” he said.
According to another trader, the shopkeepers were constantly in contact with the LDA, DC office and others through their representatives. And the officers were in favour of giving compensation to the shopkeepers first and then demolish the structure. But in the wee hours of Wednesday, the teams entered the area and started demolishing shops without giving ample time to the shopkeepers to at least shift their precious birds worth millions to safe place.
According to a spokesman for LDA, the shops had been built unlawfully at 16-kanal state land that was included in the Bhati chowk remodeling project aiming to get rid of the constant traffic mess and increasing noise and dust pollution in the area. “There are no reports of birds killed during operation, as the shopkeepers had already taken out all of them and other goods from their shops. And if they have any solid proof, show us,” he added.

The gathering was joined by several political and social activists, including a delegation of Bajaur Aman Jirga led by its chief Sahibzada Haroon Rashid.
The participants, who blocked the highway to vehicular movement by sitting on the road, claimed that a number of civilian houses and mosques in Kosar and its adjacent areas were targeted with heavy weapons last night.
The angered protesters asserted that the targeting of civilian houses had not only created fear and panic among the local communities but had also put the lives of their families, mainly children, women and elderly people, in grave danger, as they were living in their houses at the time of the firing.
Bajaur Aman Jirga head Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, Nawagai tehsil council chairman and PTI senior leader Dr Khalilur Rehman, ANP general secretary Shah Naseer Khan, party deputy general secretary Sayed Sadiq Akbar Jan, Hazar Hayat and Irshad Khan addressed the demonstration and expressed concerns over the alleged targeting of civilian houses.
Calling the attacks on the houses of residents intolerable, the speakers said such an act was not only against the civilians but also a violation of the agreement made by authorities to refrain from targeting the local population in the anti-terrorist operation in the region.
“The targeting of the residents’ houses in Kosar and its adjacent areas last night was a clear violation of the agreement made by authorities with them on August 14 before an operation was launched in Mamund tehsil that the civilian population wouldn’t be targeted,” Mr Rashid said.
He and other speakers asked authorities to ensure protection of public life and property during the ongoing operation.
They said that people across the district wanted an early end to the ongoing unrest and uncertainty in the region.
The speakers observed that the prolonged unrest and uncertainty had badly affected the lives of the residents.
The demonstration lasted several hours, forcing transporters to use a difficult alternative route. Protesters dispersed peacefully after Sahibzada Rashid informed them that authorities, through the deputy commissioner, had assured the Bajaur Aman Jirga that the civilian population won’t be targeted in the operation.

The announcement came after Trump said he had held a call with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kazakhstan’s President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.
“We will soon announce a signing ceremony to make it official, and there are many more countries trying to join this club of STRENGTH,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
 






The Kazakh government said in a statement that the matter was in the final stage of negotiations.
“Our anticipated accession to the Abraham Accords represents a natural and logical continuation of Kazakhstan’s foreign policy course grounded in dialogue, mutual respect, and regional stability,” it added.
Kazakhstan already has full diplomatic relations and economic ties with Israel, meaning the move would be largely symbolic, something Secretary of State Marco Rubio pushed back against on Thursday.
“It’s an enhanced relationship beyond just diplomatic relations,” he said.
“It is … with all the other countries that are part of the accord. You’re now creating a partnership that brings special and unique economic development on all sorts of issues that they can work on together.”
Trump met with Tokayev alongside four other Central Asian leaders from Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan at the White House on Thursday as the US seeks to gain influence in a region long dominated by Russia and increasingly courted by China.
“Some of the countries represented here are going to be joining the Abraham Accords … and those announcements will be made over the next little while,” Trump said.
Witkoff returning for announcement
US special envoy Steve Witkoff said earlier at a business forum in Florida that he would be returning to Washington for the announcement, without naming the country.
Axios first reported that the country would be Kazakhstan.
A second source familiar with the matter said the United States hopes that Kazakhstan’s entry will help reinvigorate the Abraham Accords, the expansion of which has been on hold during the Gaza conflict.
Trump has repeatedly said he wants to expand the accords that he brokered during his first term in the White House.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain established ties with Israel in 2020 under the Trump-brokered Abraham Accords. Morocco established ties with Israel later the same year.
Trump has been upbeat about the prospects that regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia will finally join the accords since a ceasefire went into effect in Gaza last month, but Riyadh has shown no willingness to move ahead without at least a pathway to Palestinian statehood.
Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is expected to visit the White House on November 18.
Other Central Asian countries such as Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, both of which have close ties with Israel, have also been seen as potentially joining the Abraham Accords, which is considered a signature foreign policy achievement of Trump’s first term.</p><small>2025-11-07 04:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/690d59c086dc5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953638/laws-and-rights-in-transition' target='_blank'><strong>Laws and rights in transition</strong></a><br><p>AS Martin Luther King once said, “An unjust law is no law at all.”
In recent years, Pakistan has witnessed constitutional changes and amendm­e­nts whose effects have rippled across the country, particularly in Balochistan.
These amendments have reshaped the structure of judicial authority and introduced laws that suppress fundamental rights under the guise of national security.
Every democratic state rests on the independence of its three pillars: legislature, executive and judiciary. But the 26th Constitutional Amendment disrupted this balance by directly interfering in the judiciary’s independence, effectively turning it into another arm of the executive.
This violates Article 175(3) of the Constitution, which states, “The judiciary shall be separated progressively from the executive”. Before the 26th Amendment, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan was composed mostly of judges: the chief justice of Pakistan (chairman), the four senior-most Supreme Court judges, a former Supreme Court judge nominated by the CJP, the federal law minister, the attorney general, and a senior advocate of the Supreme Court.
The 26th Amendment, however, amended Article 175(A), expanding the commission to include political members — two senators, two MNAs (one each from treasury and opposition), and a representative nominated by the Speaker. It also allowed the chief justice to be appointed from among the top three judges through a parliamentary committee.
These changes forced the judiciary to share its core function of appointing judges with political representatives, eroding its independence. The am­endment also curtailed the Supreme Court’s suo motu powers, while the new constitutional be­­n­­ch has since issued controversial rulings — permitting military trials of civilians, upholding jud­icial transfers, and denying PTI reserved seats.

Laws meant to uphold justice are being reshaped into instruments of control.

Last month, the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench heard petitions challenging the 26th Amendment. The matter is now fixed for hearing on Nov 10, when the court will decide whether the same bench will continue or a full court should be constituted to examine its legality.
While the legality of the 26th Amendment remains under challenge, the government is preparing to table the 27th constitutional amendment bill in the Senate. The proposed amendment seeks to create a federal constitutional court, effectively curtailing the Supreme Court’s powers and striking at the spirit of the 18th Amendment. If passed, there may be no constitutional bench left by the time the case resumes.
Ironically, the very bench constituted under the 26th Amendment is now tasked with examining its own legality. The judges had a chance to exercise damage control by referring the matter to a full court of judges appointed before the 26th Amendment — an act that could have restored public confidence. That opportunity was not taken. And now, before any formal order has been issued, the 27th amendment looms, threatening to fundamentally alter the judicial structure by introducing a parallel court system.
The erosion of judicial independence and the violation of fundamental rights did not stop there. This year, the Balochistan Assembly passed the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act 2025, granting sweeping powers to law enforcement, including detention of individuals for up to 90 days without informing families or granting a fair trial. This di­­­rectly violates Article 10, which requires a deta­inee to be produced before a court within 24 hours.
The amendment raises a constitutional issue: the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 is a federal law — can a province amend it? Under Article 143, federal law prevails in case of conflict. The federal Act mandates that detainees be presented within 24 hours, while the provincial amendment allows 90-day detention, clearly violating constitutional protections. Similar amendments have now been introduced at the federal level, further expanding the state’s power to curtail individual liberty.
These measures also undermine the principle of the presumption of innocence. Across the wor­ld, individuals are presumed innocent until pro­ven guilty. But under these amendments, the people of Balochistan are treated as guilty by default, forced to prove innocence during detention.
Both the 26th and proposed 27th amendments and the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act in Balochistan are unjust and unconstitutional. Both seek to institutionalise executive control by reducing the Supreme Court’s role as the final arbiter of constitutional interpretation. The Balochistan Bar Council, human rights groups, and international organisations such as Amnesty International and the UN have warned that these measures violate covenants like the ICCPR and undermine fundamental freedoms.
Recently, another anti-terrorism amendment act in Balochistan has been debated, though its text is yet to be published. From reported provisions, it appears even more draconian: a Grade-21 officer will have the power to choose judges for trials from names sent by the chief justice of the Balochistan High Court — giving final authority over judicial assignments to the executive.
It also introduces secrecy: judges, prosecutors, and lawyers will operate under codes rather than in open court. How can trials be considered fair when justice is hidden from public view? Such measures undermine the principle that ‘justice must not only be done but must also be seen to be done’.
Together, the 26th and proposed 27th amendments and the provincial anti-terrorism amendments reveal a disturbing trend — weakening judicial authority and eroding constitutional protections. Laws meant to uphold justice are being reshaped into instruments of control, suppressing dissent and undermining democracy.
So where does this leave us? Are these laws meant to strengthen democracy, or are they shaping a system that bends under its own weight? Can a society call itself free when its courts answer to politics and its citizens can be silenced without trial?
Perhaps the deeper question is not about law at all, but about power: who truly holds it — the people, the Parliament, or the silence written into law?

• UN chief says corporate interests are leading the world to ruin
BELEM: UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres tore into nations for their failure to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, delivering a blistering critique as Brazil hosted world leaders for a summit ahead of the COP30 climate conference.
Speaking at a high-level summit, Mr Guterres said that too many political leaders had become “captive” to fossil fuel interests, while companies continued to profit from environmental destruction.
“Too many corporations are making record profits from climate devastation, with billions spent on lobbying, deceiving the public and obstructing progress,” he said. “We can choose to lead — or be led to ruin.”
The summit opens at a stark moment. Scientists now expect the world to cross the 1.5C warming limit as early as 2030, a threshold long described as a line between severe climate disruption and irreversible harm. Yet governments still spend more than $1tn a year subsidising fossil fuels.
Outside the venue, indigenous communities sang and marched, urging delegates to protect the Amazon and other critical forests. A larger flotilla of indigenous leaders travelling down Amazon river routes was delayed and is expected to arrive next week.
Around 150 heads of state, regional leaders and international organisations are addressing the gathering on Thursday and Friday. But the leaders of the US, China, India and Russia — four of the world’s top polluting countries— are notably absent.
 
 

Only the European Union president is scheduled to attend, prompting some observers to suggest the summit may allow more candid exchanges in their absence.
Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the summit host, used the session to call for a “just transition” away from fossil fuels and the restoration of damaged ecosystems.
“We need a roadmap to undo deforestation, overcome fossil fuels and mobilise the resources needed for those aims,” he said.
Lula also warned that extremist political movements were undermining climate action for electoral advantage, trapping societies in outdated economic systems that fuel inequality and environmental collapse.
Calls for shared responsibility and financial fairness were echoed throughout the summit.
China’s vice premier, Ding Xuexiang, urged states to “strengthen solidarity” and maintain commitment to multilateral climate cooperation, while Britain’s Prince William described the moment as “pivotal in human history”, demanding courage and cooperation to safeguard the planet.
Chile’s president, Gabriel Boric, criticised the resurgence of climate denial, referencing a recent false claim by the US president at the UN that contradicted scientific consensus.
‘Second or third hottest year on record’
The summit coincided with a grim assessment from the UN’s weather and climate agency, warning that this year will likely be the second-or third-hottest ever recorded — part of more than a decade of extraordinary heat. Concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to hit record highs, “locking in” future warming.
Together, the developments “mean that it will be virtually impossible to limit global warming to 1.5C in the next few years without temporarily overshooting the Paris Agreement target”, WMO chief Celeste Saulo told leaders in Belem in northern Brazil.
The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — and to 1.5C if possible.
Mr Guterres, on the other hand, underscored the urgency. Every year above the 1.5C threshold, he warned, would deepen inequality, damage economies and lead to irreversible losses in ecosystems.

A new UN-OCHA report released on Thursday says the strategy, part of a broader support plan consolidated by the agency, will run through six months, ending in April next year, with activities based on findings from the Rapid Need Assessment (RNA).
The findings of the RNA were instrumental in identifying response and coverage gaps, and formed the basis for the district prioritisation of the current Support Plan for Relief and Early Recovery.
Following the assessment, the Punjab districts of Muzaffargarh, Multan, Khanewal, Jhang, and Bahawalpur were identified as high priority, while Bahawalnagar, Hafizabad, Okara, and Rahim Yar Khan were categorised as medium priority. Based on earlier but separate assessments in KP, the districts of Buner, Shangla, and Swat were prioritised, while in GB, Diamer and Ghizer were identified for this purpose.
Support plan
The support plan identifies the sector’s needs articulated in the RNA and the affected communities. It will be implemented through close coordination with the federal, provincial, and district governments.
 
 

As part of the support plan, $7.9 million in multipurpose cash assistance (MPC) will be distributed to support 1.2 million people, enabling vulnerable communities to meet their diverse needs in a flexible and dignified manner.
The MPC has been integrated across key sectors such as food security, agriculture, livelihoods, WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) project, shelter, and protection — providing both sector-specific and standalone support.
In an important sector like food security and livelihood, the response will adopt a dual-track approach. It will address immediate food and livelihood needs while laying the groundwork for early recovery and climate resilience.
The total funding requirement of the food security, agriculture and livelihoods sector to implement the above activities is $42.6m, of which $11.8m is required to provide relief and lifesaving assistance and $30.8m is required for early recovery.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said on Wednesday he would order steep cuts, citing air traffic control safety risks from the government shutdown.
The shutdown, now the longest in US history, has forced some 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 security screeners to work without pay, raising fear of travel disruptions during the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.
Staffing shortages have al­­rea­­dy caused tens of thousands of flight delays nationwide, with airlines estimating that 3.2 million travellers have been affected.
Industry sources said the first round of reductions, which cuts about four per cent of scheduled flights, will take effect as soon as Friday. The cuts will rise to five per cent on Saturday, six on Sun­day, and reach as much as 10pc next week if the shutdown persists.
Delta Air Lines said on Thursday it would begin reducing flights from Friday to comply with the directive, but expects to operate the vast majority of its schedule as planned, including all long-haul international services.
Holiday travel
Unless the government reopens, the drastic plan threatens to throw holiday plans into chaos for millions of Americans travelling for Thanksgiving, marking one of the most visible ripple effects yet from the record-long government shutdown.
“They (the airlines might) have some flexibility on prices, but if this shutdown goes on much longer, that should have a negative effect overall,” said David Morrison, a market analyst at Trade Nation, UK.
Airlines including United Airlines, American Airlines and Southwest were inundated with passenger queries on social media platforms like X, as flyers sought clarity on travel plans.
“Please, you and your fellow airlines — for Thanksgiving week — issue all cancellations at least a week in advance,” one X user urged in response to United’s post outlining flight reductions.
“Don’t make people wait to find out if they can fly home for the holiday.”
The reduction move aims to ease pressure on controllers, with the Federal Aviation Authority short about 3,500 staff and many working mandatory overtime and six-day weeks even before the shutdown.
“This is a fluid situation, but we believe the impact is more manageable than headlines imply,” Tom Fitzgerald, an aviation analyst, said.

• Israeli forces kill teenager in occupied West Bank
CAIRO: Hamas fighters holed up in the Israeli-held Rafah area of Gaza would surrender their arms in exchange for passage to other areas of the enclave under a proposal to resolve an issue seen as a risk to the month-old truce, according to sources familiar with the talks.
Since the US-brokered ceasefire took effect in Gaza on Oct 10, the Rafah area has been the scene of two attacks on Israeli forces. Hamas has denied responsibility.
Egyptian mediators have proposed that, in exchange for safe passage, fighters still in Rafah surrender their arms to Egypt and give “details of tunnels” there so they can be destroyed, an Egyptian security official said.
Israel and Hamas have yet to accept mediators’ proposals, the sources said. They confirmed that talks on the issue were underway.
The Israeli prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accounts; Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, declined to comment.
The attacks in Rafah left three Israeli soldiers dead. Subsequent Israeli strikes killed an unspecified number of Palestinians.
‘Unaware’ of ceasefire
The sources said the Hamas fighters in Rafah, which the group’s armed wing has said have been out of contact since March, might be unaware that a ceasefire was in place.
The ceasefire is the first part of President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict.
Hamas has released the last 20 living Israeli prisoners seized in the Oct 7, 2023, raid in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners; Israeli troops have withdrawn from western areas of Gaza, where Hamas remains in control.
Details of the next phase of Trump’s plan, which requires Hamas to disarm and give up control of Gaza, have yet to be agreed. The plan foresees Gaza being governed by a technocratic Palestinian committee with international supervision, and the deployment of an international force.
Since the ceasefire, Hamas has handed over the bodies of 22 of 28 deceased prisoners. Hamas has said the devastation in Gaza has made locating the bodies difficult. Israel has released to Gaza the bodies of 285 Palestinians.
Israeli forces kill teenager
The Palestinian health ministry said on Thursday that Israeli troops shot dead a teenager in the occupied West Bank.
The Ramallah-based ministry identified the 15-year-old as Murad Saifin, who had been killed late on Wednesday.
The ministry said the incident took place in the town of Al Yamun, west of Jenin.
Late on Wednesday the Israeli military said its troops had killed a militant in the area of Al Yamun.
In a separate incident, the Palestinian Authority reported the death of an elderly woman from a heart attack when Israeli forces raided her home on Thursday.
The PA’s media office identified the woman as Haniya Hanoun, and said she was pushed around by soldiers who had come to arrest her grandson in their home near Ramallah.
Violence in the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, has soared since the conflict in Gaza broke out in Oct 2023.
One thousand Palestinians have been killed in the occupied territory by Israeli forces or settlers over the last two years.
During the same period, 43 Israelis have been killed in occupied West Bank.

“When women contribute across education, administration, policy, health, and justice, institutions draw upon a broader spectrum of experience, enhancing the quality, legitimacy and responsiveness of governance,” observed Justice Syed Man­soor Ali Shah while setting aside the Feb 14, 2024, order of the Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Service Tribunal, Peshawar.
In March this year, Justice Shah had ruled in a similar case that a woman’s legal rights, personhood and autonomy were neither erased by marriage nor should they depend on it.
On Thursday, he explained that women’s equal participation in public life was not simply a means to personal financial independence, but it was a structural driver of socio-economic development, good governance, and constitutional democracy.

Justice Shah calls on legislators, policymakers to stop enacting or interpreting laws in a manner that subordinates women to patriarchal or marital constructs

This has been recognised internationally through the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and by comparative constitutional jurisprudence that advocates affirmative measures to correct gender imbalance in public services.
The dispute before a two-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Shah was whether marriage would disqualify a daughter from appointment under the quota reserved for children of civil servants who die or become incapacitated while in service.
The controversy pertains to petitioner Ms Farakh Naz, an employee of the KP education department, who was appointed in place of her mother after she retired from service on medical grounds in April 2022.
Ms Naz’s appointment order as a primary school teacher in Karak was withdrawn without any notice in 2023 after she got married. This termination was based on a clarification letter of February 2022, which stipulated that the benefit of appointment under the quota was not available to a female who has contracted marriage.
Further, an April 28, 2023, clarification provided that a married daughter may again be considered eligible for appointment if she has separated from her husband and is dependent on her parents. Aggrieved by her termination order, the petitioner filed a departmental appeal against the order, which was rejected in August 2023. Consequently, the petitioner preferred an appeal before the KP tribunal, challenging the impugned order, which was dismissed in February 2024.
 
 

In his 11-page verdict, Justice Shah asked legislators and policymakers to recognise women as autonomous individuals and refrain from enacting or interpreting laws in a manner that subordinates their personhood to patriarchal or marital constructs.
The exclusion or “othering” of women — particularly on the grounds of matrimony — constitutes a direct assault on their dignity and equality and denies them the fundamental rights that attach to their independent selves.
Terminations like that of the petitioner, resting upon patriarchal readings of the rule or policy, not only violate the identity and rights of women but also impoverish society and future generations, who are thereby deprived of the intellect, values, and perspectives that women uniquely bring to public life, the verdict explained.
Justice Shah observed that being married was not a disqualification that strips a woman of her personhood or her constitutional entitlements; marriage merely alters her legal status, not her fundamental rights.
A woman like a man is a “person” under the Constitution — and this constitutional status of her personhood remains undisturbed through marriage or divorce. The view that a daughter (and not the son) is always dependent upon her father and thereafter as a wife is always dependent upon her husband is constitutionally unsustainable.
Such a notion undermines her individuality and erodes her identity as a person in her own right, Justice Shah observed and cited Martha C. Nussbaum — an American philosopher — who had said: “A society that denies women equal opportunities for full human functioning denies itself justice.”

• Ruling elite has inflicted unprecedented harm on independence of judiciary, Akram Sheikh argues
ISLAMABAD: As speculations swirl around the controversial 27th Con­stitutional Amend­ment, legal experts have questioned the rationale behind such constitutional tweaks, especially after the previous 26th Amen­dment that had effectively brought the superior judiciary under the executive’s control.
The “final draft” of this Amendment has hitherto been kept under wraps, but its contours were recently shared by PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari when he said a prime minister-led delegation had sought the PPP’s support for its passage. In a statement, he said the proposal included setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, matters related to the transfer of judges, ending the protection of provincial shares under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, and amending Article 243, which pertains to the command of the armed forces.
While some see it as a continuation of the 26th Amendment, a senior counsel questioned the reason behind such a move at a time when the government had not lost even a single constitutional case in the superior court.
“Not a single case pertaining to constitutional interpretations, be it the reserved seat case, judges transfer matter, military courts case, or matters relating to taxes, has ever been lost by the federal government after the passage of the 26th Amen­dment,” remarked the cou­nsel on condition of ano­nymity. Then what is the rationale behind stirring up the controversy at this juncture, he wondered.
Except for enhancing the retirement age limit from the existing 65 years, that too of ‘a few friends’, what the proposed constitutional court will be doing when the federal government has not lost a single major case from the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court.
The need to establish the Federal Constitutional Court is understandable, had Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah or Justice Munib Akhtar also been included in the CB. But when these judges are not part of the bench, then what is the purpose of establishing this court, he asked.
About speculations that the executive magistracy may be restored through the proposed Amendment, the counsel conceded that the judicial magistracy had failed to meet the expectations since it was common knowledge that they never resisted the remand of an accused in important cases. The reverting back to the executive magistracy will effectively be used to control the streets, he said.
Regarding the transfer of judges, he said that when the CB through a majority judgement has already empowered the government to transfer any high court to another high court, what more does the government intend to achieve?
Inevitable continuation
Meanwhile, former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar was of the view that the proposed 27th Amendment was the inevitable continuation of the 26th Amendment.
The executive wants to tighten its grip on the judiciary: granting unfettered power to transfer high court judges, a federal constitutional court as the ultimate guardian of the Constitution with its head chairing the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), thus playing a pivotal role in the appointment and ouster of judges and reducing the present Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) to an ineffectual position, he said.
The nation must brace itself for a long struggle against praetorian judges, the rollback of the independent judiciary, and the weight of the executive on the scales of justice, he feared.
According to former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Muhammad Akram Sheikh, the result of the general election on Feb 8, 2024, stunned the electors, monitoring agencies and the media beyond reproach.
The ruling elite then impose ‘PCO’ by giving an oath to willing judges while relieving others and thus nailing down the entire superior court. The regime inflicted unprecedented harm on the most paramount state organ of an independent judiciary, Akram Sheikh regretted, adding that the ruling elite decided to punish the Supreme Court in a manner not ever thought about by the respective military regimes.
Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani, considered to be one of the architects of the 18th Amendment, feared that in the brittle political situation prevalent in the country, the proposed tweaks would cast a shadow over the federation that may also help regain an extra nationalist narrative.
The proposed Amendment that deals with the question of bringing changes to the removal of protection for the share of provinces in the divisible pool through the National Finance Commission (NFC), as well as restoring the devolved ministries back to the federal government, amounts to the rollback of the 18th Amendment.
In Jan 2015, Mr Rabbani regretted after a vote on the 21st Amendment, which provided for military courts to try terrorists, stating he was ashamed of voting for the bill, although he did so in line with his party’s discipline.

• Taliban leader asks Afghan team to only make ‘realistic’ commitments
• Flare-up at Chaman-Spin Boldak looms over talks; at least two killed
ISLAMABAD: The third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks opened in Istanbul on Thursday, surviving a brief exchange of fire along the border that tested a shaky ceasefire.
Mediated by Turkiye and Qatar and held at the Conrad Hotel with restricted media access, the two-day round is focused on finalising a framework for a “monitoring and verification mechanism” agreed in principle last week, and on addressing long-standing disputes linked to militant sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s delegation is led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik and includes senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials.
The Afghan Taliban side is headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and includes senior figures such as Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib.
The current dialogue process began after deadly clashes along the border last month — the worst since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul. Pakistan accused the Taliban of harbouring militants from Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), responsible for a series of cross-border attacks. The Taliban denied the accusations and accused Islamabad of airstrikes inside Afghan territory.
A ceasefire was brokered in Doha on Oct 19 through Qatari mediation, followed by two rounds of talks in Istanbul.
Before formal discussions resumed in Istanbul for the third round, Turkish and Qatari intelligence officials held separate consultations with both sides. The talks later continued in both direct and indirect formats.
A Pakistani official familiar with the delegation’s position said Islamabad’s demands remain “non-negotiable”.
“Pakistan’s position is clear,” the official said. “Our position is based on ground realities and solid information. We are seeking a verification mechanism to ensure that commitments made by Taliban representatives are kept. This includes the handover of all TTP leadership currently sheltered in Afghanistan.”
He added that the Pakistani delegation had proposed neutral, third-party observers to look into the presence of “terrorist groups” in Afghanistan and the action that is taken against them to prevent them from carrying out attacks in Pakistan.
“We have credible information that the (Afghan) Taliban regime is relocating TTP fighters within urban civilian populations,” he said. “This is a tactic designed to falsely portray any necessary action by Pakistan against TTP terrorists as an attack on civilians.”
According to Afghan sources, the Taliban delegation came to Istanbul with specific instructions from their leader, Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada. The Taliban chief reportedly told his negotiators to make only those commitments that could be realistically fulfilled and warned them against yielding to Pakistani demands.
Exchange of fire
Expectations for the Istanbul round were already modest, given the deep mistrust between the two sides and the little progress made in the previous two rounds. The situation worsened briefly on Thursday afternoon after two people, including a woman, were killed on the Pakistani side in a cross-border exchange of fire at the Chaman-Spin Boldak crossing, threatening to derail the fragile dialogue.
Both sides accused the other of initiating the gunfire, though no casualties were reported. The incident, which lasted for a short time, came just hours after the opening session of talks in Istanbul.
“Afghan forces opened fire at Tasadaq and Iqbal Posts located along the Chaman border around 5pm, and Pakistani troops immediately retaliated and returned fire,” an official told Dawn.
He said the mortars landed in the Vesh Mandi area. However, he said it was a brief exchange of fire and no loss of life or property was reported.
An Afghan official in Spin Boldak told Chaman-based journalists that the incident was a result of a misunderstanding arising from celebratory fire at a marriage ceremony.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, however, disputed the account, accusing Pakistani forces of violating the truce.
“While the third round of negotiations with the Pakistani side had begun in Istanbul, unfortunately, this afternoon Pakistani forces once again opened fire on Spin Boldak, causing concern among the local population,” he said in a statement. “The Islamic emirate’s forces, out of respect for the negotiation team and to prevent civilian casualties, have so far shown no reaction.”
However, Pakistan rejected Mr Mujahid’s claim as “baseless”.
“We strongly reject claims circulated by the Afghan side regarding today’s incident at the Pak-Afghan border at Chaman,” the Information Ministry said. “Firing was initiated from the Afghan side, to which our security forces responded immediately in a measured and responsible manner.”
It added that the situation was brought under control, and the ceasefire remains intact.

The regulator conducted a public hearing for additional recovery worth Rs8.4 billion from all consumers over the coming three months — December to February 2026 — under quarterly tariff adjustment (QRA) for the first quarter (July-September) that would result in a per unit additional charge of about 50 paise per unit.
Since a previous negative QTA of about Rs1.80 per unit is expiring this month, the consumers would be paying a Rs2.30 per unit net higher cost in the December-February period.
 
 

Separately, Nepra called a public hearing on Nov 11 on another government directive for slashing power rates on incremental consumption by Rs11 per unit to Rs22.98 per unit for industrial and agricultural users to revive consumption that has plummeted by 14pc and 47pc, respectively.
Both revisions, upon approval, would apply across the country, including all distribution companies (Discos) and K-Electric, under the government’s end-to-end national uniform tariff policy.

Power tariffs set to increase by Rs2.30 for users; govt pushes for Rs11 cut for incremental industrial, agricultural consumption

The public hearing was told that capacity charges had increased by Rs21.7bn in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, which was an alarming situation. However, the capacity charges were partly compensated by Rs13.3bn reduction in operation and maintenance costs, use of service charges and market operation fee and impact of technical losses in fuel costs, leaving a net additional financial burden of Rs8.4bn.
The hearing was also told that consumption in the July-September period increased by 1.5pc to 7pc in various Discos, while industrial consumption alone went up by 11 to 28pc, which was a good sign. All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) suggested that, in view of encouraging consumption patterns, the government should not impose fixed charges on net-metering consumers as demanded by some power companies.
 
 

Some industrial representatives said the consumers would get a net benefit Rs2.40 per unit through the proposed incentive package from the government because it would come into force only after 25pc increase in consumption. They said the incentive package was unfeasible given ambitious targets to become eligible for a discount, while there was no improvement in system losses and recoveries.
Nepra’s Member Technical Rafique A. Shaikh said the circular debt would not end unless recoveries improved and losses reduced, as evident from first quarter results showing Rs87bn increase in circular debt due to losses and Rs84bn due to lower recoveries.
On the other hand, the Power Division, in its petition for an incentive package for incremental consumption, the electricity demand across major consumer categories witnessed a noticeable contraction, reflecting broader macroeconomic adjustments, structural changes in consumption patterns, and increased adoption of alternative supply options such as net metering (6,035MW).
“The decline has been (particularly pronounced in the industrial and agricultural sectors, where consumption has reduced by 14pc and 47pc respectively”, it said, adding the demand reduction was leading to a vicious cycle where under-utilisation of system assets further increased the tariff due to under recovery of fixed cost.
It said the targeted incentive package in the past had worked well in stimulating demand and enhancing asset utilisation. The Industrial Support Package of November 2020-2023 helped increase industrial consumption by 14pc while Bijli Sahulat Package of December 2024-February 2025 recorded industrial growth of 6.9pc, 2.7pc and 10.2pc over three consecutive months.

• PPP rejects any cut to provinces’ NFC share; backs limited changes to Article 243
• Remains non-committal on constitutional court for now
• Tarar sees no ‘major roadblocks’ to new legislation
• PTI says current govt lacks mandate to amend Constitution
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday held consultations with ruling allies to secure support for the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment, with the government expected to table the bill in the Senate within days.
The prime minister has also convened a meeting of the federal cabinet today (Friday), with the 27th Amendment topping the agenda. Sources said the amendment could be introduced in parliament after cabinet approval.
The premier is due to depart for Azerbaijan later in the day for a one-day official visit.
Some media reports suggested PM Shehbaz has decided to establish a parliamentary committee bringing all parties together to fine-tune the draft and seek consensus. However, there was no confirmation from the Prime Minister’s Office.
It has been learnt that all government allies, except the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), have assured conditional support, provided the 18th Amendment is not rolled back.
The PPP leadership, which met the prime minister earlier this week, reiterated at its Central Executive Committee meeting on Thursday that it would safeguard the 18th Amendment.
On the other hand, the government is said to be adamant about getting the 27th Amendment passed next week. The plan is to move the 27th Amendment first in the Senate and then in the National Assembly.
As constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority in both houses, winning over the PPP remains pivotal. The next two days are said to be quite crucial in this regard.
Meetings with ruling coalition
Meanwhile, a delegation of Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) led by its convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui called on PM Shehbaz on Thursday.
A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said “discussion and consultation took place on the proposed 27th Amendment” during the meeting.
The delegation also included Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, MNAs Dr Farooq Sattar, Jawed Hanif Khan, Syed Aminul Haque and Khawaja Izharul Hassan, the statement added.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and others also attended the meeting. They were also present in PM Shehbaz’s meetings with the delegations of the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) and Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q).
The IPP delegation was led by party president and Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan and Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, while the PML-Q team was led by Overseas Pakistanis Minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain, with Senator Kamil Ali Agha and MNAs Mohammad Ilyas Choudhary and Farukh Khan in attendance. The premier also held separate meetings with Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) chief Khalid Hussain Magsi, PML-Zia president Ijazul Haq, and an Awami National Party (ANP) delegation led by Senator Aimal Wali Khan.
In a separate development, MQM has presented its own version of additions to the 27th Amendment, calling for strong, autonomous local governments across the country, and has sought JUI-F’s support for constitutional protection of the system.
An MQM delegation led by Mr Siddiqui met JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman at his residence to present the amendment’s draft. MQM leader Mustafa Kamal said the party’s proposal aims to ensure powers and resources “reach the people’s doorsteps”, arguing that the current federal and provincial set-up “fails to deliver services effectively”.
The party said it would now await JUI-F’s formal response.
Meanwhile, JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza confirmed that the MQM delegation had called on Maulana Fazlur Rehman and presented the draft amendment.
“The 27th Amendment relates to Article 140-A, which deals with local government powers,” he said. “We will review and study the draft carefully before giving our feedback,” he added.
PPP draws red line
Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Thursday drew a red line against any change to the provinces’ share under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, while indicating conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.
Announcing decisions of the party’s Central Exe­cutive Committee (CEC) at Bilawal House late in the night, PPP Chairman Bil­awal Bhutto-Zardari said discussions on the government’s proposed constitutional changes would continue on Friday but stressed the PPP “can never compromise on the financial rights of the provinces”.
 






“The PPP rejects the proposal for constitutional protection of the provinces’ share,” he said, adding that the CEC had, however, authorised support for specific adjustments in Article 243.
“The government has proposed giving the Joint Chiefs a new designation, creating a new position for Strategic Command and a position of Field Marshal. Only this amendment the CEC has allowed me to support,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari added.
On the question of establishing a constitutional court, the PPP remained non-committal, saying further internal deliberation was required before arriving at any decision.
‘No roadblocks to amendment’
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday said there are no major roadblocks and impediments with respect to the 27th Amendment, according to a Dawn.com report.
Speaking to Geo News, the minister said consultations among political parties on the proposed amendment were taking place in a “positive environment” and that a broad consensus appeared to be emerging.
“The feeling I got during today’s (Thursday’s) meetings, in which different political parties were present … I got the feeling that there is no major roadblock or impediment,” he said.
“There was no need for any further discussions or debate. Ideas were shared in a positive environment, some of which were agreed upon.”
‘Govt lacks mandate’
Separately, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan said the current parliament lacks the mandate and moral authority to amend the Constitution, arguing that such changes require a “genuine two-thirds majority”.
Speaking to the media at the Lahore High Court, he warned the proposed 27th Amendment would harm both the federation and the provinces, noting that the 18th Amendment had faced no provincial objections. He also pointed out that the fate of the 26th Amendment remains pending before the Supreme Court.
Mr Khan said an independent judiciary is essential to democracy and parliamentary sanctity and made clear the PTI would not support the government on the latest amendment.
Referring to the process adopted for the 26th Amendment, he said a committee had been formed, but “no draft ever surfaced”, adding that the PTI has resigned from that body.
He said the release of the party’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan would come “under the law, not through any deal”, and that no protest call had been given for November.
“We are working within the law for his release, and he is satisfied with the ongoing efforts,” Barrister Gohar said, dismissing rumours of foreign involvement.

According to the SBP, web portal InvestPak has been developed to digitise the process of investing in government papers for customers maintaining rupee accounts with banks, primary dealers (PDs) and microfinance banks (MFBs). 
Government securities are currently issued through auctions of Market Treasury Bills (MTBs) and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs). In addition, the government has recently begun raising funds through the stock market using Sukuk bonds. 
As of June 30, 2025, investment in government securities had reached Rs46.566 trillion. Scheduled banks held Rs38.7tr, or 83 per cent of the total, while corporates held Rs7.856tr, or 17pc. The inclusion of individual investors through InvestPak is expected to further increase investment in government papers and add to the government’s already substantial domestic borrowing. 

Individuals, corporates can now invest via InvestPak

The SBP said the portal enables customers of financial institutions (FIs) to digitally open Investor Portfolio of Sec­urities (IPS) accounts, place bids in primary auctions, and buy or sell securities in the secondary market — all without visiting a bank or financial institution. 
“All banks are mandated to facilitate their customers in registering on the portal. MFBs are also encouraged to help their customers register. All FIs must ensure high service standards and a smooth user experience,” the SBP said in a circular issued on Thursday. 
FIs have been granted access to the portal, which caters to both primary auctions and secondary market trading of government securities. They can also customise their treasury operations across front, middle, and back offices to align with the new system. 
All individuals, joint account holders, and corporates with rupee bank accounts are eligible to register digitally on the portal using their IBAN (International Bank Account Number). 
Customers who do not already hold an IPS account can request its opening through the portal when registering with their respective financial institution.
“The portal allows individuals and corporates to link and operate multiple rupee and IPS accounts across different FIs through a single registered account,” the SBP said. 
FIs are required to process each registration or onboarding request and communicate their decision to the customer within two working days.

Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held meetings with the delegations of multiple parties in what appeared to be efforts by the government to prepare the ground to get the 27th Constitutional Amendment approved by parliament. Tarar was present during these meetings.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, the minister said consultations among political parties on the proposed amendment were taking place in a “positive environment” and that a broad consensus appeared to be emerging.
“The feeling I got during today’s meetings, in which different political parties were present … I got the feeling that there is no major roadblock or impediment,” he said.
“There was no need for any further discussions or debate. Ideas were shared in a positive environment, some of which were agreed upon.”
The information minister added that the objective is “always to strengthen governance, defence and relations between the federation and the provinces”.
Tarar mainstained that he “looked forward” to the outcome of the PPP’s Central Executive Committee meeting, which was being held on Thursday night. “I feel that good ideas will emerge from that meeting,” he said.
The minister added that once the proposals are tabled in parliament, a joint committee comprising leaders of all parliamentary parties from both Houses would be formed to review them.
“The Constitution is a living document that can be updated in line with the country’s evolving needs,” he explained.
“The [idea of the] 27th Amendment was born from the 26th,” Tarar said, adding that debates on the idea of a constitutional court had been ongoing since around 2005, and based on the demands of lawyers, a constitutional bench had been formed.
The minister also “categorically” clarified that amid talks about the 27th Amendment, no one would be meddling with the 18th Amendment. He added that Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also previously assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the new legislation.
An ‘attack’ on the House
A day earlier, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking in the parliament, termed the proposed 27th amendment an “attack on the House” and said his party would continue to raise their voices against it.
“Whenever there is a constitutional amendment anywhere in the world, it happens with a consensus and amends things according to the country’s needs,” he had said.
The PTI chairman said the proposed amendment is “against the spirit of this House and the Constitution”, asserting that the country cannot have further division and urged that no amendments be presented that put more pressure on the courts.
Meanwhile, responding to some points raised by opposition members, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry called for bringing “negative and false propaganda” to a halt.
He assured the National Assembly that the 18th Amendment would not be rolled back through the 27th Amendment.
Chaudhry also denounced the attempts to make the proposed amendment controversial even before the official draft saw the light of day on the basis of assumptions and guesswork.</p><small>2025-11-06 19:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/062146067cf9bc2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953525/no-new-notification-needed-for-coas-5-year-term-says-state-minister' target='_blank'><strong>No new notification needed for COAS’ 5-year term, says state minister</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said on Thursday that there was no need for a notification to specify the army chief’s five-year term, as it was established in Section 8C [of the Pakistan Army Act].
“I do not think there is a need [for a notification] and the reason is the lawmaking we did, which specifies that [section] 8C, will be read in the same manner as it has always been part of this legislation and hence, it is five years,” said the state minister.
Section 8C of the Pakistan Army Act outlines the “retirement age and service limits prescribed for a general, under the rules and regulations made under this Act, shall not be applicable to the Chief of the Army Staff, during his tenure of appointment, reappointment or extension, subject to a maximum age of sixty-four (64) years. Throughout such tenure, the Chief of the Army Staff shall continue to serve as general in the Pakistan Army”.
In November 2024, the government passed six bills, including three related to the extension of the terms of armed services chiefs, amid deafening protests by the opposition. The three bills were The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill, 2024, The Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill, 2024 and The Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, 2024.
The salient features of the bills stated that the tenure of all three services chiefs (chief of army staff, chief of air staff and chief of naval staff) will be five years, instead of three. The retirement age bar of 64 years (for generals, air chief marshals and admirals) won’t apply to these three functionaries and
extensions, re-appointments for these posts (if any) will also be for five years.
However, the tenure of chairman joint chiefs of staff remained unchanged, at
three years.
In an interview with Independent Urdu today, Barrister Malik said no new notification is required for the COAS’ 5-year term and the section has always been a part of legislation.
When asked his opinion on whether the government intends to keep the designations of field marshal and army chief separate, Malik pointed out that army chiefs are 4-star generals while the field marshal’s rank is a 5-star position.
“When there are ranks, other things are associated with them, and they should be considered as well,” he said.
When asked about the possibility of Pakistan becoming a part of the Gaza International Stabilisation Force, the state minister said a definitive answer at this time would be premature.
He highlighted that the foreign ministers of eight Muslim countries met in Istanbul and any announcement would be made accordingly. “My comment would be premature,” Barrister Malik said.
Field Marshal Asim Munir was appointed the army chief on November 29, 2022. He is the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
The government promoted the COAS to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India during the war in May this year.</p><small>2025-11-06 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632428-ppp-cec-meeting-underway-to-discuss-proposed-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>27th Amendment: PPP CEC meeting rejects proposed amendments to NFC Award</strong></a><br><p>

The announcement was made as Muqam held a joint press conference alongside PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser in Islamabad.
Earlier this week, the PTI decided to convene a peace jirga in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly (KPA) on November 12 to discuss the volatile law and order situation in the province.
“We have conveyed our requests to the federal government and are grateful that they accepted our invitation,” Qaiser said while jointly addressing reporters after the meeting.
“We have come together and we know what policy we want. Whatever it is, the province’s people and leadership need to come together to create a concerted plan of action,” he added.
In response to a question, Muqam said that the PTI presented “the reason why we are here” and that the government accepted it.
“They said they wanted peace and that we are all one,” he added.
Meanwhile, Qaiser wrote a post on X announcing that a delegation he led also met with National Awami Party Chairman Aftab Sherpao today.
“The delegation invited Aftab Ahmad Sherpao to attend the peace jirga organised by the KP provincial government on November 12,” he wrote.
 






In another post, Qaiser wrote that Sherpao was an “important leader of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and has also served as chief minister”.
“We desire that he inform the provincial government of his views and experiences. Peace and security are our common issues, which transcend politics,” Qaiser wrote.
 






ANP to hold ‘consultations’ before accepting jirga invitation
President of the ANP’s KP chapter, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said that he will hold consultations and then inform the PTI and the press about accepting the invitation to the peace jirga.
He made these remarks at a joint press conference flanked by PTI leader and Adviser to the KP chief minister, Shafiullah Jan.
“The jirga we held was successful and we formed an organising committee with all political parties,” he said in response to a question. “To look after it, we implemented a procedure.
“When we called an All-Parties Conference, we made a decision, and the ANP called another conference in Islamabad,” he added. “After the floods, we decided to suspend that decision under the situation improved.”

Hussain said that there has been no contact with some parties, adding that ANP President Aimal Wali Khan told KP CM Afridi that the party would only make a decision after consultations.
“We are grateful for their (the PTI) invitation and we will reply once we have had consultations,” he stated. “You will find out who is going [to the jirga].”
The PTI’s KP Secretary General, Ali Asghar Khan, took the floor and said that the previous jirga was called by the chief minister, and the party had reservations about being part of a jirga with the federal government.
“This time, the jirga has been called by the [KP] speaker,” he stated. “He formed a committee and will hold meetings with parliamentarians from all parties. He has done so because we, as a party, have come to extend the speaker’s invitation and to ask that you positively respond.”</p><small>2025-11-06 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/061729307bc7522.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953492/british-army-chief-meets-coas-munir-both-discuss-enhancing-bilateral-defence-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>British army chief meets COAS Munir; both discuss enhancing bilateral defence cooperation</strong></a><br><p>The British Army’s Chief of the General Staff (CGS) Gen Sir Charles Roland Vincent Walker on Thursday met Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir in Rawalpindi, where the two discussed boosting bilateral defence cooperation.
The meeting between the army chiefs took place at the General Headquarters (GHQ), a press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“During the meeting, matters of mutual interest, regional security and measures to further enhance bilateral defence cooperation were discussed,” it said.
“Both sides reiterated the need for continued collaboration to ensure peace and stability in the region,” the military’s media affairs wing added.

Gen Walker “appreciated Pakistan Army’s achievements and sacrifices in the fight against terrorism and its efforts for regional peace and stability”, according to the ISPR.
Upon his arrival at the GHQ, the British CGS laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-i-Shuhada to pay homage to the martyrs. He was presented with a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army.
 






The field marshal’s meeting today comes about two weeks after his visit to Egypt, where he held discussions with the Egyptian Armed Forces’ Chief of Staff Lt Gen Ahmed Khalifa Fatehi and Minister of Defence and Defence Production Gen Abdul Maged Saqar.
COAS Munir had last met with Gen Walker during his five-day official visit to the United Kingdom in February, where he attended and delivered a keynote address at the annual 7th Regional Stabilisation Conference at the Royal Military Academy in Sandh­urst.
During his visit, the army chief had also engaged with the UK’s then-chief of defence staff Admiral Toney Radikin and National Security Adv­i­ser Jonathan Nicholas Powell, and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss shared security challenges and the importance of enhanced collaboration between the two nations.
 
 

In May 2024, then-CGS Gen Sir Patrick Sanders had paid a visit to Pakistan, where he met COAS Munir, with Gen Walker present as well as the CGS-designate. Gen Sanders had also addressed the sixth Pakistan-UK Regional Stabilisation Conference at Islamabad’s National Defence University.
COAS Munir and then-CGS Gen Sanders had also met in May 2023 as the latter visited Rawalpindi, where he acknowledged the Pakistan Army’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism.
CJCSC vows to boost defence cooperation with Brunei
Separately, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has held meetings with the sultan of Brunei Darussalam and other officials during an official visit to the country, expressing the commitment to “further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”, the ISPR said today.

According to the ISPR, apart from meeting the sultan of Brunei, Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu’izzaddin Waddaulah Ibni Al-Marhum Sultan Haji Omar ‘Ali Saifuddien Sa’adul Khairi Waddien, General Shamshad also held meetings with  Yang Berhormat Pehin Datu Lailaraja Major General (Retired) Dato Paduka Seri Awang Haji Halbi bin Haji Mohd Yussof, Brunei’s minister at the PM’s office and minister of defence-II, as well as Major General Dato Paduka Seri Haji Muhammad Haszaimi bin Bol Hassan, commander of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
During the meetings, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional security environment in the meetings, the ISPR statement said, adding that the CJCSC “underscored Pakistan’s cordial relations with Brunei Darussalam and expressed his commitment to further strengthen military-to-military ties and defence cooperation”.
The CJCSC also visited the ship KDB Darulaman at Muara Naval Base and the Defence Academy of the Royal Brunei Armed Forces.
At the defence academy, he “delivered a talk on ‘Pakistan’s contributions to regional peace and stability’ and interacted with the students of command and staff course, including officers from 19 foreign countries”.
According to the ISPR statement, the sultan and civil-military leadership of Brunei Darussalam “appreciated [the] high professional standards of Pakistan’s armed forces and their achievements and sacrifices in [the] fight against terrorism”.
The statement also said that upon his arrival at the Royal Brunei Armed Forces headquarters, “a smartly turned-out military contingent presented a ‘Guard of Honour’” to the CJCSC.
The CJCSC’s Brunei’s visit comes roughly around a week after his trip to Bangladesh, where he called on Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman at Army Headquarters in Dhaka. The two leaders expressed appreciation for the “positive trajectory” of growing defence cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh during the meeting, the ISPR said.
During the visit, the CJCSC also met with Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Nazmul Hassan, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan and Principal Staff Officer (PSO) of the Armed Forces Division Lt Gen S.M. Kamrul Hassan.</p><small>2025-11-06 13:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632381-pia-dismisses-president-secretary-general-of-aircraft-engineers-body-amid-ongoing-dispute' target='_blank'><strong>PIA dismisses president, secretary general of aircraft engineers' body amid ongoing dispute</strong></a><br><p>
