Providence Mayor Brett Smiley announced the detention during an early morning news conference, confirming the campus shelter-in-place order had been lifted.
Speaking alongside Sm­iley, Police Colonel Oscar Perez said authorities were “not at this point” looking for anyone else in relation to the attack.
Of the nine wounded, Smiley said one is in critical condition, seven are in stable condition and one has been discharged.

‘Shelter-in-place’ lifted as authorities cease search for suspects

Brown University Pres­ident Christina Paxson confirmed in a letter to community members that all 11 victims were students. At the time, the university had sent an emergency alert regarding an active shooter near the Barus and Holley Engineering building.
“Nine members of our community who were transported to local hospitals are all students,” Paxson wrote on the school’s website. “And we lost two students to today’s devastating gun violence.”
The attack triggered a terrifying lockdown on Saturday afternoon. Witness Katie Sun told the Brown Daily Herald student newspaper she was studying nearby when she heard gunfire and fled to her dormitory.
“It was honestly quite terrifying. The shots seemed like they were coming from where the classrooms are,” Sun said.
Student Lydell Dyer, who was working in the gym, told CNN he hid in the dark with 154 others.
“We had to go gather everybody, bring them up to the top floor, turn off the lights, and put down the blinds,” Dyer said.
Officials have postponed final exams scheduled for Sunday. Smiley noted the incident has left the Ivy League community “incredibly shaken up”.
“This should not be normal,” Smiley said. “This should not be the case that every community needs to prepare for something like this to happen.”
President Donald Trump called the shooting a “terrible thing” after being briefed. “All we can do right now is pray for the victims,” he said.
The incident is the latest in a series of attacks across the country. According to the Gun Violence Archive, there have been more than 300 mass shootings in the United States this year.

Both LeT and JeM were declared proscribed organisations by Pakistan in 2002.
The proposed sanctions — a global asset freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo — signal closer US-India counterterrorism cooperation. Yet, strikingly, the joint statement does not mention Pakistan.
That omission has not gone unnoticed, especially given India’s frequent charge that such groups operate from Pakistani soil — a claim Islamabad denies.

Joint call makes no mention of Islamabad, despite India’s wishes

Observers interpret the omission as deliberate and revealing of Washington’s strategic balancing act in South Asia.
As Washington-based analyst Shuja Nawaz noted: “The US may have avoided naming Pakistan. It has named India as a partner in the Indo-Pacific theatre. I wonder how long this straddling policy will last.”
The US and Indian delegations, led respectively by Monica Jacobsen of the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism and India’s Counterterrorism Joint Secretary Vinod Bahade, emphasised cooperation in training, cybersecurity, judicial coordination, mutual legal assistance and intelligence-sharing.
They condemned recent attacks notably the April 22 Pahalgam attack and the Nov 10 Red Fort incident in New Delhi — stressing that “those responsible for terrorism should be held accountable”.
They also welcomed the US designation of The Resistance Front (TRF), which India blames for being behind the Pahalgam attack, as both a Foreign Terrorist Organisation (FTO) and Specially-Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).
But as observers noted, the silence on Pakistan reflects a US desire to continue counterterrorism cooperation with India, while keeping open diplomatic space with Pakistan, whose utility Washington appears to value anew.
The broader context helps explain this approach. According to a Dec 8 Foreign Policy article titled ‘Trump’s Pivot to Pakistan’, the warming of US-Pakistan relations since mid-2025 has been dramatic.
The piece noted that President Trump has “developed a close relationship with senior Pakistani leadership, including the country’s powerful military chief, Asim Munir, whom he hosted at the White House in June and again in September, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, whom he met three times this year.”
As the article reports, “The Pakistanis have done a very good job of developing a positive relationship with President Trump,” according to a former US diplomat who requested anonymity.
The logic seems tactical: Islamabad has offered “things of value” from cooperation on counterterrorism (including high-profile arrests of militants), to access to critical minerals, to interest in emerging sectors such as energy, mining, and even cryptocurrency — aligning with some of Trump’s strategic and personal predilections.
According to one former Pakistani ambassador to the US, the outreach has been carefully crafted: “They gave him the praise that he wanted,” the diplomat said.
In this context, the joint US-India terror-designation statement can be read as tactical: the US still wants to maintain the appearance of cooperation with India on counterterrorism, but avoids confrontation with Pakistan, preserving for Islamabad a renewed space in US foreign policy.
That’s why observers argue the omission of Pakistan in the joint statement is not a mere oversight, but a reflection of evolving US strategy in South Asia, where alliances are becoming more transactional, fluid and hedged.
The next session of the India-US JWGCT and Designations Dialogue scheduled in the United States will offer an early test of whether this balancing act can hold. In the meantime, the strategic triangle between Washington, New Delhi and Islamabad appears more complex and fragile than ever before.

LAHORE: The Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC), a broad coalition of clerics from various Sunni schools of thought, has urged the Taliban interim government to implement the resolution recently passed by more than 1,000 Afghan clerics against indulging in militancy abroad.
“It is now the responsibility of the Afghan interim government to ensure the implementation of the recent declaration issued by its scholars,” PUC Chairman Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi said here on Sunday, terming the resolution a “positive step in the right direction”.
He said there was no difference between the stance of Afghan clerics and that of those belonging to Pakistan.
“There are two basic points in the declaration. First, they [Afghan clerics] say that aggression against Afghan soil is unacceptable, and we say that terrorism in Pakistan is unacceptable. Second, they say that Afghan soil should not be used against any other country, and we hold the same opinion. There should be no attacks on Pakistan from Afghanistan and vice versa,” he added.
Stressing that peace and stability in the region are in the collective interest, he thanked Turkiye, Qatar and Saudi Arabia for their attempts to negotiate between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Mr Ashrafi warned that any attempt to raise voices against the armed forces would be strongly resisted.
He said that if the need arose, religious seminaries and mosques would stand ready to defend the country, its security and stability. He emphasised that safeguarding the homeland was a collective responsibility.
Calling for political maturity, Mr Ashrafi urged all political parties to sit together and engage in dialogue to strengthen the country’s defence, economy and internal stability.
He criticised the use of abusive language in politics, saying that those who resorted to hate speech did not want peace in the country. He said scholars from all schools of thought had unanimously declared that violent behaviour was unacceptable. “Our objective is to take the country towards the caliphate system through peaceful means,” he added.
He also strongly condemned attacks and criticism directed at the ISPR director general following his recent press conference.

ISLAMABAD: Truck driver Muhammad Afzal was not expecting to be stopped by police, let alone fined, as he drove into Islamabad this week because of the thick diesel fumes emanating from his exhaust pipe.
“This is unfair,” he said after being told to pay Rs1,000, with the threat of having his truck impounded if he did not “fix” the problem. “I was coming from Lahore after getting my vehicle repaired. They pressed the accelerator to make it release smoke. It’s an injustice,” he said.
Checkpoints set up this month are part of a crackdown by authorities to combat the city’s soaring smog levels, with winter months the worst due to atmospheric inversions that trap pollutants at ground level.
“We have already warned the owners of stern action, and we will stop their entry into the city if they don’t comply with the orders,” said Dr Zaigham Abbas of Pakistan’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as he surveyed the checkpoint at the southeast edge of the capital.

Checkpoints are part of plan to combat capital’s soaring pollution

For Waleed Ahmed, a technician inspecting the vehicles at the site, “just like a human being, a vehicle has a life cycle. Those that cross it release smoke that is dangerous to human health”.
Self-inflicted crisis
While not yet at the extreme winter levels of Lahore or the megacity Karachi, where heavy industry and brick kilns spew tons of pollutants each year, Islamabad is steadily closing the gap.
So far in December it has already registered seven “very unhealthy” days for PM2.5 particulates of more than 150 microgrammes per cubic meter, according to the Swiss-based monitoring firm IQAir.
Intraday PM2.5 levels in Islamabad often exceed those in Karachi and Lahore, and in 2024 the city’s average PM2.5 reading for the year was 52.3 microgrammes — surpassing the 46.2 for Lahore.
Those annual readings are far beyond the safe level of five microgrammes recommended by the World Health Organisation.
“The capital region is choked overwhelmingly by its transport sector,” which produces 53 per cent of its toxic PM2.5 particles, the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative, a research group, said in a recent report.
“The haze over Islamabad… is not the smoke of industry, but the exhaust of a million private journeys — a self-inflicted crisis,” it said.
Crackdown
Announcing the crackdown on Dec 7, EPA chief Nazia Zaib Ali said over 300 fines were issued at checkpoints in the first week, with 80 vehicles impounded.
“We cannot allow non-compliant vehicles at any cost to poison the city’s air and endanger public health,” she said in a statement.
The city has also begun setting up stations where drivers can have their emissions inspected, with those passing receiving a green sticker on their windshield.
“We were worried for Lahore, but now it is Islamabad. And that is all because of vehicles emitting pollution,” said Iftikhar Sarwar, 51, as he had his car checked on a busy road near an Islamabad park.
“This is not the Islamabad I came to 20 years ago,” said Sulaman Ijaz, an anthropologist.

It is impossible for the country to achieve any reasonable growth with this economic model, and the only way out is pivoting towards greater investments in the economy, which are largely concentrated towards export-oriented industries.
Even the export problem is no longer about “more textiles” or a generic push towards industrialisation, with a headless chicken strategy being a better fit for a policy than an industrial policy. It is now about where we industrialise and what kind of export model we ought to be building. The future is different from the past, and therefore making the same mistakes that were made in the past will also result in surprisingly similar outcomes.

 

Pakistan sits close to the bottom of Global Value Chain (GVC) integration. Any serious effort to actually grow or increase incomes would require moving up the GVC, which implies using more imports for generating even greater exports.
Our export base remains heavily tilted toward traditional sectors with relatively lower imported intermediate content and weaker participation in complex cross-border production networks. This inadvertently shows up in the broad trade-in-value-added view, where Pakistan’s foreign value-added share of exports appears far below manufacturing GVC hubs like Vietnam and Malaysia.

A South-first, export-oriented industrial strategy is an economically efficient way forward — ignoring it would result in more years of flat-to-no export growth

The future of competitive exports is inherently import-intensive, and as an economy upgrades beyond basic commodities or traditional manufacturing, it starts importing more components, machinery, specialised chemicals, precision inputs, etc. The value-addition that leads to export happens during assembly, processing, design-to-manufacture, etc. Vietnam did not become a manufacturing magnet because it avoided imports. It became one because it moved imports cheaply, assembled fast, exported efficiently, and then gradually localised upstream segments.

 

Essentially, the uncomfortable truth remains that any successful export upgrade would require even greater imported content. You cannot export more without importing more. The same story has been repeated time and again throughout non-resource-based, export-oriented economies, and the same pattern holds across successful Asian exporters.
Pakistan’s industrial gravity historically lives in the centre of the country, around inherited ecosystems, labour pools, and domestic market proximity. It made sense in an earlier phase of development. If we want to diversify into higher-value, more import-reliant segments, locating export-oriented industry far from the coast imposes a silent tax.
Distance to ports is not a one-time cost in a GVC model; it is a two-legged cost wherein imports must move inland to the factory, while exports must move back to the port. This is a “double logistics penalty” that shows up brutally in the margins.
Pakistan’s logistics burden is high relative to emerging market standards, and our freight system is heavily road-dominated (and thereby more expensive). It is even more expensive when you base import-dependent export growth more than a thousand kilometres away from the main seaports.
The “double logistics penalty” would eat up margins for exporters in the range of 2pc to 5pc — which becomes sizeable when compared to other markets. Export competitiveness requires the seller to be ruthlessly efficient and fast, and having a structural logistics penalty only makes it worse.
The issue compounds once the import content in exports increases more as we move up the GVC. Being close to the port means being close to actual customers while saving the precious 2-5pc spread, which can be the differential between a successful export order and an export order that got away.
Another benefit that the South belt (more specifically, Karachi) provides, which we refuse to capitalise on for literally no logical reason, is the availability of surplus power at a marginal cost in the range of Rs15 per kWh. There is close to 4,000 MW of surplus baseload power capacity available in the South (Hub, Port Qasim, and Jamshoro) that is barely being utilised (less than 30pc dispatch) because of the grossly inefficient and inequitable economics of the uniform power price. The coal-fired power plants available in the South, literally next to the Arabian Sea, can generate power at a marginal cost of Rs15 per kWh.
Any coherent and economically sound industrial policy would want to maximise the benefits available from the low-cost unused power. The capacity costs of it are already being paid — selling incremental power at marginal cost would lead to higher power generation, which would actually reduce capacity costs for everyone.
More importantly, availability of power at marginal cost would unlock industrial activity and economic growth, eventually leading to more jobs and higher exports. There is no case against providing incremental power at marginal cost for industrial growth, other than a myopically political and economically irrational one.
A lower cost of power and lower logistics costs make our export base more competitive and enable the country to grow upwards on the GVC. Such a structure improves export margins by 7-9pc, while having positive externalities for people across the country.
A South-first, export-oriented industrial strategy, that focuses on areas that are closer to the port and power-generation capacity, is an economically efficient way forward. Ignoring it would well result in more years of flat-to-no export growth.
If Pakistan wants to move into assembly-heavy, import-intensive export segments, then the default location for new capacity should be the coastal areas, closer to the port, whether that is Thatta, Nooriabad, Karachi, Port Qasim, etc. With a lower marginal cost of power as an anchor, the South belt can also host power-intensive industries and high-load-factor manufacturing that needs cost certainty, and new industrial ecosystems that can scale without tariff volatility, among others. This provides the core industrial base, without which any export-oriented growth will remain a pipe dream.
The export-oriented future that can actually generate jobs for the people and increase incomes for all will not happen spontaneously through slogans or speeches. It can be unlocked through carefully calibrated structural arithmetic that prioritises a coastal, power-competitive, logistics-first industrial spine.

ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Sunday urged the Afghan Taliban to rid their country of all militant groups, while Iran stressed the need for regional cooperation, rather than foreign intervention, at a multinational Afghanistan-foc­used mee­t­ing in Tehran.
The calls for action came during a meeting of Special Representatives for Afghanistan from neighbouring countries, plus Russia.
The Taliban were invi­ted to participate, but declined to attend, according to statements from both Iranian and Taliban officials.
The high-level gathering in the Iranian capital brought together special representatives from Paki­stan, China, Russia, Tajiki­stan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan to discuss shared security concerns and strategies for engaging with Afgha­nistan’s de facto authorities.
Pakistan’s Special Rep­re­sentative for Afgha­nistan Mohammad Sadiq made the country’s position clear, emphasising the persistent threat of terrorism originating from Afghan territory.
“The continued threat of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil is a big challenge for the region,” Mr Sadiq said, according to a statement.
He highlighted that a stable Afghanistan, free from terrorist elements, was essential for gaining the trust of its neighbours and unlocking its vast economic potential.
“It is, therefore, imperative that the current de-facto rulers take steps to ameliorate their suffering. And the foremost step in this regard would be to rid their soil indiscriminately of all types of terrorists,” he stated.
He later posted on X that “the people of Afghanistan have already suffered enough and they deserve better”.







Only an Afghanistan that does not harbour terrorists, he explained, will inspire confidence in neighbouring countries to meaningfully engage, which would in turn help realise the country’s immense potential for economic connectivity.
The regional forum was first initiated and hosted by Pakistan in September 2021, just weeks after the Taliban seized control of Kabul as US and Nato forces completed their withdrawal after a 20-year conflict. Iran hosted the second foreign ministers’ meeting of the group in late October 2021.
However, the forum has struggled to achieve its goals. According to Pakistan’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Khan, the original intent was for the group to make collective decisions, including the possibility of a coordinated recognition of the Taliban government.
“The grouping could not become an effective forum as the Taliban did not positively respond,” Mr Khan told Dawn on Sunday.
He added that Pakistan had hoped the neighbouring countries would adopt a unified approach on critical issues such as counter-terrorism, political inclusivity, girls’ education, and human and women’s rights in Afghanistan.
Separately, Ambassador Sadiq held a bilateral meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Araghchi. According to Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran, Muhammad Muddasir Tipu, Sadiq expressed hope that the meeting would play a useful role in promoting regional peace.
“Recalling closer interactions taking place between leaderships of both countries at the highest levels in the past two years, Mr Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to further deepen and widen its ties with Pakistan,” Mr Tipu wrote on X.







Regional solutions
Mr Araqchi, addressing the meeting, argued that Afghanistan’s stability hinges on its integration into regional political and economic structures, not on external involvement.
“Experience has shown that ‘imported prescriptions and trans-regional decisions’ have failed to bring stability to crisis-hit countries,” he said, according to Iran’s Press TV.
He highlighted the primary role of neighbouring states, describing them as the “most natural and reliable” actors capable of addressing Afghanistan’s complex challenges.
Mr Araghchi pointed to Afghanistan’s strategic geoeconomic position at the intersection of Central, West, and South Asia, highlighting its potential to serve as a vital corridor for trade, energy transit, and regional connectivity.
The Iranian foreign minister argued that the security and prosperity of Afghanistan are inseparable from the interests of the entire region. “Afghanistan’s stability and development are not only a humanitarian necessity but also a strategic imperative for the entire region,” he noted.
He called for collective responsibility and confidence-building measures among regional nations, warning against an over-reliance on security-centric approaches and the neglect of Afghanistan’s social and cultural realities.
Mr Araghchi attributed past failures to these factors, as well as the marginalisation of regional actors and the chaotic foreign military withdrawal in 2021 and said the integration of Afghanistan into regional political and economic processes would help establish long-term stability and reduce tensions.
Reaffirming Iran’s commitment, he said his country was ready to expand cooperation with Afghanistan’s neighbours in transportation, trade, energy, and consular services, arguing that regional convergence could create a sustainable framework for cooperation centred on Afghanistan.
“At the heart of all these efforts are the people of Afghanistan, who deserve a secure and dignified future,” he said.
Taliban decline invitation
Iran’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Esmaeil Baqaei, confirmed at a briefing that the Taliban had been formally invited, stating that Iran believed their participation would enhance mutual understanding and help resolve issues between Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries.
“Afghanistan, however, chose not to attend the meeting, a decision that Iran respects,” Baqaei said, according to the IRNA news agency. He noted that the meeting allowed participating countries to discuss regional developments, including recent border tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Baqaei stressed Iran’s concerns over regional stability, saying, “Iran shares a total border of nearly 2,000 kilometres with Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any tension that arises between the two countries will inevitably affect us as well.”
Kabul’s decision to stay away was criticised by Asif Durrani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to Iran.
“The Taliban regime’s decision not to participate in tomorrow’s Tehran meeting of senior officials from Afghanistan’s immediate neighbours and Russia is further proof of the Taliban’s lack of political maturity,” Durrani wrote on X.
“This decision reinforces the argument that the Taliban cannot negotiate an issue; a mere ‘Na-manu (don’t accept)’ is a head-in-the-sand attitude and will not resolve the serious problems.”

Every year, new visions promise a “Digital Pakistan”, an “empowered youth”, and a “modern economy”. Yet beneath the lofty language lies a stubborn contradiction: the state taxes broadband as if it were a luxury product rather than the backbone of the 21st century. This single contradiction explains why Pakistan continues to lag behind regional peers in digital adoption, economic modernisation, and technological capacity. The country claims it wants digital growth, but it taxes the very oxygen that allows digital ecosystems to breathe.
To understand how self-defeating this policy is, one must begin with the tax structure itself. After the 18th Amendment, sales tax on services became a provincial matter, and broadband taxation now varies across the country. These differences only add confusion; they do not change the core problem.

 

Punjab, the largest province and home to more than half the country’s population, continues to impose a 19.5 per cent sales tax on internet and telecom services — the highest among all provinces. Sindh taxes corporate broadband at 19.5pc but offers conditional exemptions for residential users below certain billing thresholds. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan apply lower or conditional rates; in some categories, residential broadband is exempt.
On paper, this produces a patchwork of rates. In practice, the effective burden on consumers remains heavy, because provincial taxes stack on top of a 15pc federal advance income tax applied uniformly to all telecom bills. Even low-income households and students who do not fall under the income tax net are forced to pay this federal levy. Once all taxes are added, broadband prices for millions of Pakistanis are grossly inflated.

Taxing connectivity is one of the least efficient ways to raise revenue as it suppresses adoption, reduces investment, slows GDP growth, and ultimately shrinks the long-run tax base

This regressive structure is not a technical oversight. It is a policy choice; one with severe consequences. Pakistan’s fixed-broadband penetration stands at roughly 1.3pc — among the lowest in Asia. Mobile broadband, though more widespread, still does not provide the reliability or capacity required for serious digital work. The result is an economy where the majority of citizens participate in the digital world through unstable connections, high costs, and frequent outages undermining productivity in every sector.

 

What makes this failure particularly tragic is that Pakistan does not lack demand. It lacks affordability as surveys consistently show. Internet usage statistics show that the country has well over 110m users, yet even this figure is misleading. A large portion of users rely on sporadic mobile data packages instead of stable broadband connections. When a consumer’s monthly bill is swollen by provincial sales tax and federal withholding tax, upgrading to broadband becomes an unaffordable luxury.
The provincial variations in tax policy exacerbate the problem rather than alleviating it. A student or micro-entrepreneur in Lahore faces a significantly higher tax burden than someone in Peshawar or Quetta. A small business in Karachi may benefit from conditional exemptions, while a similar business in Punjab pays full tax. Telecom companies, already burdened by spectrum fees, energy costs, currency depreciation, and regulatory delays, ultimately pass these variations onto consumers.
Yet, the economic cost of this policy extends far beyond the consumer. It affects investment, productivity, and long-term competitiveness. Operators expand fibre networks where commercial returns justify it. High taxes shrink the revenue base, slow customer acquisition, and weaken the investment case for expanding into underserved areas.
Pakistan already allocates far less spectrum than what international benchmarks recommend. Its fibre infrastructure trails far behind regional peers. Investors look at this environment — high taxes, unpredictable shutdowns, sectoral fragmentation — and move capital to more rational markets. The result is a structural digital deficit that compounds over time.
The social consequences are equally worrying. Pakistan has one of the largest digital gender gaps in the world. Women are significantly less likely to own a smartphone, use mobile internet, or access online platforms. When broadband becomes a taxed commodity, it disproportionally excludes women, rural households, and low-income families. A female entrepreneur in rural Sindh cannot compete on e-commerce platforms if she cannot afford a stable connection.
Pakistan’s policymakers often justify broadband taxation as a revenue necessity. But this logic collapses under scrutiny. The revenue generated is modest relative to provincial budgets, while the economic damage caused by digital exclusion is enormous. Taxing connectivity is one of the least efficient ways to raise revenue. It suppresses adoption, reduces investment, slows GDP growth, and ultimately shrinks the long-run tax base.

 

Countries that adopted aggressive broadband expansion policies have seen increases in productivity, exports, and employment that far outweighed short-term tax reductions. Pakistan’s reluctance to follow this path is rooted not in economics but in inertia.
If the country is serious about building a modern digital economy, it must begin with a simple premise: broadband is not a luxury. It is a public utility. It is as essential as electricity or clean water. It enables education, healthcare, commerce, financial inclusion, and governance. A country fighting to overcome low productivity, low exports, and low investment cannot simultaneously impose high taxes on the fundamental infrastructure of the modern world.
Abolishing or drastically reducing sales tax on broadband across all provinces would declare that digital inclusion is not an afterthought but a central pillar of economic policy. It would encourage telecom operators to accelerate network expansion. It would narrow the gender gap and empower freelancers, startups, and small businesses. It would even align Pakistan with global best practices and enable the digital economy to emerge as a genuine driver of growth.
The choice is stark: either continue taxing broadband as a luxury and watch another decade slip by in underperformance, or treat digital access as the foundation of national development.

It was stipulated that the Federal Board of Revenue will boost its tax collection by 3–3.5 percentage points to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio to 13pc, with the provinces expected to enhance their share from the existing 0.28 per cent to 3pc of GDP through effective taxation on services, property and farm income.

 

PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto, on Dec 9, urged the federal government to transfer sales tax on goods to the provinces, as the collection of sales on services has significantly increased through devolution to the federating units after the 18th Amendment. He said centralised control was not only inefficient but also draining national revenue.
On the spending side, the provinces declined to share their expenditure details on legal and technical grounds. Sindh pointed out that the commission is a forum to discuss, decide and distribute the tax resources vertically between the Centre and the provinces and horizontally among the provinces, and not to dictate how the federating units should spend their money.

Business and economy journalist Khurram Husain aptly explains, “The funds being divided up under the NFC award belong to the federation, which includes the federal government as well as the provinces. The relationship between the Centre and province in a federation is not that of a senior and junior partner. It is a relationship of equals.”
The Centre’s own spending continues to rise. Fiscal data released by the Ministry of Finance indicates a 13pc increase in ‘Running of the Civil Government’ expenditure from July to September this fiscal year to Rs161.2 billion compared to Rs142.5bn during the same period last year. The expenses rose despite some staffing and structural reforms.
Attributing its fiscal problems to the NFC Award, say analysts at Dawn, is an attempt to obscure the deeper expenditure problems embedded in the federal structure. Islamabad’s fiscal challenges stem less from the NFC formula than from its own inability or unwillingness to reform. Blaming the provinces for its budgetary distress, they argue, will not solve the structural weaknesses driving federal finances into deficits.
Pakistan’s weak public finances predate the 7th NFC Award, recalls Sakib Sherani. He argues that the real issue is not how the resources are distributed but how they are raised and where they are spent. “Redistributing the federal divisible pool from mis-spending provinces to a mis-spending Centre will not address Pakistan’s fiscal woes,” Mr Sherani writes in a Dawn opinion piece.
The merit of the horizontal sharing 7th NFC formula, Dr Hafiz A Pasha notes, was that it implied a larger per capita transfer to the smaller provinces and lesser-developed Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

‘Redistributing the federal divisible pool from mis-spending provinces to a mis-spending Centre will not address Pakistan’s fiscal woes’

To further build upon what has been achieved, the Policy Research and Advisory Council (PRAC) meeting chaired by Mohammad Younus Dagha recommends reducing the weight for the population from 82pc to 50pc to shift from a population-centric to an efficiency-orientated horizontal distribution model; increasing the inverse population density ratio from 2.7pc to 5pc; introducing a multi-poverty index with a 5pc weight replacing poverty backwardness to better capture regional disparities in health, education and other areas of deprivation.
The provinces should take full responsibility for the Benazir Income Support Programme and subsidies for agriculture and low-income groups, including energy subsidies totalling Rs1.82 trillion in the FY26 budget, reflecting the fact that social welfare, agriculture and industrial development are provincial subjects.

 

Furthermore, PRAC calls for a 15pc weight for revenue generation to reduce provincial dependence on federal transfers and strengthen fiscal autonomy and 5pc weight for carbon credits earned by the provinces for ensuring adequate financing for environmental initiatives. It also links the provincial share of NFC to the operationalisation of the Provincial Finance Commission Awards with 20pc weight to ensure efficient resource allocation to local governments.
The proposed framework, PRAC asserts, will help achieve fiscal devolution in its true spirit, ensuring that local governments have the means to lead their own growth effectively.
The resource generated from exploiting Balochistan’s mineral resources or electricity from dams built in one province and supplied to another requires a further refining of distribution of resources, says a Business Recorder editorial.
While noting that the 7th NFC award is at best a compounding factor but not a proximate cause, Mr Sherani says in federations such as Pakistan, the NFC award anchors the project of federalism itself. “Hence, technocratic proposals to roll back the vertical distribution formula are relics of non-democratic setups and thinking and must be resisted.” n

“A tweet, circulated by certain anti-Pakistan quarters, claiming that [the] whole crew of a particular PIA flight is missing, is entirely baseless,” the flag carrier said in a post on X, adding that the purpose was to “malign PIA and Pakistan”.
“There has been no such incident, and the news is fake,” it added.







Meanwhile, a PIA spokesperson issued a separate statement also denying the news, claiming that the information had been circulated by an “Afghan and anti-Pakistan account”.
“The misleading tweet is part of a well-conceived plan based on hostility towards Pakistan and is aimed at damaging the reputation of the national airline and the country,” the spokesperson said, clarifying that the news held no truth.
Missing PIA crew members, particularly in Canada, have been reported in the past, too.
On November 21, a PIA flight attendant reportedly went missing in Canada, prompting the airline to launch an inquiry into his disappearance.
​According to PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez Khan, the attendant did not report for flight PK-798 from Toronto to Lahore.
“When contacted, he cited ill health as an excuse,” the spokesperson said, adding that the matter is being investigated. “In case of illegal disappearance, departmental action will be initiated against the flight attendant.”
Last year in October, a cabin crew member was reportedly gone missing while on duty. The missing crew member, based in Islamabad, had disappeared during a layover in Toronto.
Similarly, a 47-year-old PIA steward was reportedly gone missing in Canada in March 2024.
In February 2024, another member of the airline’s cabin crew was reported missing while on duty. The member had arrived in Toronto on PIA flight PK-782 from Islamabad but failed to report for duty on the return flight, PK-784 to Karachi.</p><small>2025-12-15 02:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/15072015a524d3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961211/ctd-official-found-shot-dead-in-panjgur' target='_blank'><strong>CTD official found shot dead in Panjgur</strong></a><br><p>GWADAR: An official of the Counter-Terrorism Dep­­artment (CTD) was found shot dead in an aba­ndoned area of the Panjgur district, while two individuals were gunned down in separate attacks in Turbat, police said on Sunday. 
Authorities identified the CTD official as Khalil Ahmed, who was kidnapped at gunpoint from the Tusp area of Panjgur. His body, which showed signs of torture and gunshot wounds, was later found dumped in an abandoned site in Tusp. 
Locals informed the authorities about the presence of a body, prompting police to rush to the Chakul locality on the outskirts of Panjgur town. Police took custody of the body and shifted it to the district hospital. 
Later, family members protested in front of the district police officer in Panjgur to press the police for immediate arrest of the kidnappers and killers. The protesters alleged police had been informed about the abduction of the official, but they did not rescue him. However, after negotiations with police officials and the district administration, the demonstrators ended their protest and dispersed peacefully. Police said an investigation into the incident is underway. 
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the killing of the official.
Meanwhile, two other people were killed in Turbat, police said. 
They said armed men riding motorcycles targeted Muhammad Naeem in the Kahirabad area, killing him on the spot before speeding away. 
In a similar shooting, armed men killed a man in the Absar area of Turbat before fleeing. The body was shifted to the Turbat hospital. “In both incidents attackers fired at their targets from close range, which caused their instant death,” police said.

The announcements were made during a PCB investor roadshow in New York, part of an overseas promotional campaign aimed at attracting commercial interest ahead of a potential expansion of the league from six to eight teams.
The PCB has previously indicated that expansion is under consideration, though the addition of new franchises has not yet been formally ratified.
Addressing attendees at the event, Mohsin said the PCB had taken administrative control of the Muzaffarabad Cricket Stadium and intended to begin renovation work.
He added that efforts were under way to have the venue ready in time for the PSL, though he acknowledged that completion before the tournament was not guaranteed.
“We are starting Muzaffarabad’s stadium, which we have taken over, and our target is to get it ready before the PSL. If not, then work will be initiated within this year,” he said.
Mohsin also stated that the deadline for submission of bids for the new franchises had been extended to December 22, citing interest from prospective investors.

On Sunday, the PSL trophy was displayed at Times Square, where members of Pakistan’s cricketing diaspora gathered for photographs and brief interactions with players and officials.
The PCB said the event was intended to raise the league’s profile among overseas audiences. Several Pakistan cricketers attended the engagement, including Shan Masood, as well as former players Wasim Akram and Ramiz Raja.
The PCB also said members of the current national setup were present, though no official matches or cricketing activities were scheduled as part of the programme. Singer Ali Zafar, who has previously been associated with PSL anthems, was also in attendance.



The New York event followed a similar promotional stop at Lord’s Cricket Ground in London earlier this year. The PCB has described these activities as part of a broader effort to enhance the league’s commercial value and visibility beyond traditional markets.
Launched in 2016, the PSL has grown into Pakistan’s flagship T20 competition, initially staged entirely overseas before returning to home venues in phases.
While the league has attracted international players and broadcasters, it has also faced scheduling challenges due to Pakistan’s crowded international calendar and competition from other T20 leagues.
The PCB has yet to release detailed information regarding venues, player drafts or confirmation of new teams for the 2026 season.</p><small>2025-12-14 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14224958a1af717.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961096/ukraines-zelensky-drops-nato-ambition-as-berlin-peace-talks-begin' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine’s Zelensky drops Nato ambition as Berlin peace talks begin</strong></a><br><p>Ukraine has relinquished its aim to join the Nato military alliance in exchange for Western security guarantees as a compromise to end the war with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday as peace talks got underway in Berlin.
Zelensky aired the concession as he flew to the German capital, where he began meetings with US President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in efforts to end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World War Two.
The move marks a major shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia’s war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.
Zelensky met the US envoys at talks hosted by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who, a source said, had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday.
Security guarantees from the United States, Europe and other partners instead of Nato membership represented a compromise on Ukraine’s side, Zelensky said ahead of Sunday’s discussions.

“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join Nato; these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” he said in answer to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat.
“Thus, today, bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the US, Article 5-like guarantees for us from the US and security guarantees from European colleagues, as well as other countries, Canada [and] Japan are an opportunity to prevent another Russian invasion,” Zelensky said.
“And it is already a compromise from our part,” he said, adding that the security guarantees should be legally binding.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its Nato ambitions and withdraw troops from about 10 per cent of Donbas, which Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country and that no Nato troops can be stationed there.
Russian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by major Western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards — shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.
Zelensky had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.
Under pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow’s demands, Zelensky accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities and Ukraine’s power and water supplies.
Sending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.
Zelensky said Ukraine, the Europeans and the US are looking at a 20-point plan and that at the end of it there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has no direct talks with Russia.
A ceasefire along the current front lines would be a fair option, he added.
‘Critical moment’
Britain, France and Germany have been working to refine the US proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its Nato ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.
European allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine’s future, and sought to shore up Kyiv’s finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.
Putin hosted Witkoff and Kushner at a meeting earlier in December that the Kremlin praised as “constructive”, although no major breakthroughs were reached.
Zelensky said hundreds of thousands were still without power after Russian strikes on energy, heating and water supplies across Ukraine.
“Russia is dragging out the war and seeks to inflict as much harm as possible on our people,” he said.

Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused relations with the West to plummet and has cranked up warnings from Nato and European leaders that Putin would not stop there.
Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech in Berlin on Thursday that Nato should be “prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured” and asserted that “we are Russia’s next target”.
The Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed such claims.
“This seems like a statement by a representative of a generation that has managed to forget what World War Two was actually like,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television reporter Pavel Zarubin on Sunday.
“They have no understanding, and unfortunately, Mr Rutte, making such irresponsible statements, simply does not understand what he is talking about,” Peskov added.</p><small>2025-12-14 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14153319ce629ab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961076/suspect-involved-in-australia-bondi-beach-shooting-identified-police' target='_blank'><strong>Suspect involved in Australia Bondi Beach shooting identified: police</strong></a><br><p>One of the suspected shooters in a gun attack at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on Sunday has been identified by police, a senior law enforcement official told the public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
Ten people were killed and around a dozen were wounded when gunmen opened fire during a Jewish holiday event at the beach, Australian officials said. New South Wales police said two people had been taken into custody, and the ABC said one of at least two gunmen was among those killed.
According to the law enforcement official, the suspect was identified as Naveed Akram, who lives in the Sydney suburb of Bonnyrigg.
ABC gave no information on his nationality.
“The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr Akram’s home … was being raided by police on Sunday evening,” ABC reported.
Australian police said an “improvised explosive device” had been found in a car linked to a suspect in the deadly shooting.
“We have found an improvised explosive device in a car which is linked to the deceased offender,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a news conference.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the incident “shocking and distressing”, adding that “emergency responders are on the ground and working to save lives”.
“I saw at least 10 people on the ground and blood everywhere,” 30-year-old local Harry Wilson, who witnessed the shooting, told the Sydney Morning Herald.
According to The Sydney Morning Herald, 43-year-old fruit vendor Ahmed el Ahmed disarmed one of the attackers and wrestled his weapon away from him.
“Ahmed placed himself in the line of fire to take a rifle from the shooter, and was later hit by at least two bullets himself,” the newspaper reported, adding that Ahmed’s cousin told the media that he was shot in his hand and upper arm.
“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” the cousin, Mustafa was quoted as saying. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 per cent.”

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Jewish people who had gone to light the first candle of the Hanukkah holiday on the beach had been attacked by “vile terrorists”.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was appalled by the shooting.
“These are the results of the anti-Semitic rampage in the streets of Australia over the past two years, with the anti-Semitic and inciting calls of ‘Globalise the Intifada’ that were realised today,” he alleged.
One of the world’s most famous beaches, Bondi is typically crowded with locals and tourists, especially on warm weekend evenings.
“If we were targeted deliberately in this way, it’s something of a scale that none of us could have ever fathomed. It’s a horrific thing,” Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News, adding his media adviser had been wounded in the attack.
Videos circulating on X appeared to show people on the beach and nearby park scattering as multiple gunshots and police sirens could be heard.
One video showed a man dressed in a black shirt firing a large weapon before being tackled by a man in a white T-shirt who wrestled his weapon off him. A different man was seen firing a weapon from a pedestrian bridge.
Another video showed two men pressed onto the ground by uniformed police on a small pedestrian bridge. Officers could be seen trying to resuscitate one of the men. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.
The attack came almost exactly 11 years after a lone gunman took 18 people hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney. Two hostages and the gunman were killed after a 16-hour standoff.
Sussan Ley, the leader of Australia’s opposition Liberal party, said the loss of life in the incident was “significant”.
“Australians are in deep mourning tonight, with hateful violence striking at the heart of an iconic Australian community, a place we all know so well and love, Bondi,” she said.
President, PM express solidarity with Australia
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and extended their condolences to the victims in separate statements.
In a statement from the Presidency, President Zardari expressed sorrow over the incident, praying for the victims’ families and wishing the injured a speedy recovery.
“Pakistan, itself a victim of terrorism, stands in solidarity with Australia and condemns violence against innocent civilians,” the statement read.







Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz extended his condolences and said Pakistan condemns terrorism in all of its forms.
“We stand in solidarity with the people and government of Australia in this difficult time,” he wrote.

According to a statement issued by the FIA on Saturday, the suspect was taken into custody during a major operation at the airport.
Initial investigations revealed that the suspect was involved in organised migrant smuggling and online fraud activities operating out of Cambodia.
The FIA said the suspect had travelled from Pakistan to Cambodia in September 2024, where he worked for an online fraud company. “He later began recruiting individuals from Pakistan as agents, allegedly facilitating their movement to Cambodia under false pretences,” the statement said.
During forensic analysis of the suspect’s mobile phone, investigators recovered passport photographs of several individuals, payment receipts and records of financial transactions.
The agency said the suspect received money through personal bank accounts as well as cryptocurrency accounts, indicating the use of multiple channels to move illicit funds.
The FIA said the suspect has been handed over to its anti-smuggling circle in Karachi for further legal proceedings.
“Further investigation is underway to identify other members of the network and potential victims,” the statement said.
In January, more than 30 officers of the FIA were booked and dismissed from service over their alleged collusion with human smugglers in sending Pakistanis abroad illegally.
The FIA began the purge following the capsizing of a boat carrying illegal immigrants near Greece in December last year. According to estimates, more than 80 Pakistanis drowned in the accident, and 36 were rescued. The remaining were presumed dead.
In response to the tragedy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered the authorities to take action against the human smugglers and officials aiding them. Since then, a countrywide crackdown has been launched against human smugglers, leading to the arrests of dozens of suspects.
Consequently, FIA Lahore arrested 177 human smugglers in the following months.

“On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell.”
It added that the second IBO was conducted in the province’s Bannu district, where security forces neutralised six more terrorists.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as a relentless counterterrorism campaign under [the] vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement said.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.</p><small>2025-12-14 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14201053279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961094/pti-demands-cessation-of-imrans-solitary-confinement-following-un-experts-report' target='_blank'><strong>PTI demands cessation of Imran’s ‘solitary confinement’ following UN expert’s report</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Saturday expressed grave concern over a report issued by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Jill Edwards, saying it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”
The report, released on Friday, claimed the PTI founder is being held in conditions that could “amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on authorities to comply with international norms and standards.”
In a statement issued by PTI’s Central Media Department, the party said the UN report unequivocally confirmed what it has consistently maintained for a long time: that Imran Khan was being subjected to “inhuman, unlawful, and degrading treatment motivated entirely by political vendetta.”







The PTI asserted that the report reaffirmed Imran’s 23 hours of solitary confinement, constant CCTV surveillance, isolation from the outside world, obstruction of meetings with legal counsel and family, denial of religious practice, and deprivation of basic human necessities, which constituted a blatant violation of prison rules and a flagrant breach of international human rights law.
“According to the United Nations, solitary confinement exceeding 15 days falls under the category of psychological torture, while Imran Khan has been subjected to this agonising process for months,” the PTI added in its statement.
The party said that subjecting a 72-year-old suffering from serious medical conditions, a spinal injury and wounds from a prior assassination attempt to such conditions, while denying adequate medical care, amounted to deliberate and calculated cruelty.
PTI demanded the immediate cessation of solitary confinement, the provision of detention conditions consistent with human dignity and international standards, unrestricted access to personal physicians and the removal of all barriers to meetings in strict compliance with judicial orders.
“This matter is no longer just about a political prisoner but has become a test of the credibility of law, justice, and human rights in Pakistan. If the treatment being meted out to Imran Khan is not stopped, it will be considered the worst example of state-sponsored violence,” the statement concluded.
However, Prime Minister’s aide Rana Ihsan Afzal dismissed the rapporteur’s findings and insisted that Imran is being treated “according to prison rules and the jail manual”.
“His children have access, and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide.
He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner.
“He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available, and ample space is also available.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.</p><small>2025-12-14 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639364-security-forces-kill-13-terrorists-in-two-kp-ibos-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 13 terrorists in two KP IBOs: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases, with the highest number of cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 19.This will be the last polio campaign of the year, which will conclude on December 21.
“The success of the campaign depends on our collective responsibility, so we must ensure that every child under five years of age receives polio drops,” she said in a statement.
The campaign aims to vaccinate 45.4 million children nationwide, including 23.3 million in Punjab, 10.6 million in Sindh, 7.3 million in KP and 2.66 million in Balochistan, with the remaining children covered in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad Capital Territory.
The drive is being conducted in coordination with Afghanistan’s December polio campaign to curb cross-border virus transmission.
Recalling the legacy of late Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Aseefa said “Pakistan’s first nationwide polio eradication campaign was launched under her leadership in 1994, and her vision continued to guide national efforts to eliminate the disease.”
She shared that she feels a deep personal connection to the cause, remembering that her mother, as the former prime minister, personally administered the first polio drops to her.
“That moment marked the beginning of Pakistan’s national fight against polio and shaped my lifelong commitment to the effort,” she said.
Aseefa Bhutto shared that the campaign will follow a three-day house-to-house vaccination drive with one catch-up day. In high-risk areas, community-based vaccination and special mobile team strategies will be implemented, and the  five-day campaign will be conducted with two additional catch-up days.
A total of 408,484 frontline polio workers, including area in-charges, union council medical officers and mobile, fixed and transit teams, have been deployed across the country.
Aseefa also called upon elected representatives, local government officials, religious leaders and community elders “to stand with polio teams, facilitate access to communities and help counter misinformation and hesitancy.”She urged citizens to welcome vaccinators, report missed children and support frontline workers, saying that only united action can stop the virus and protect the future of Pakistan’s children.

Over the past several days, multiple media bodies came together and condemned the 13-month ban, which initially affected the newspaper but extended to DawnNewsTV and the radio channel City FM 89.
In its press release today, the PFUJ condemned the ad ban and called it “an attempt to control media and stifle free expression”.
“In a joint statement, PFUJ President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari expressed deep concern over the government’s decision, stating that it is an attack on freedom of expression and an attempt to financially cripple a respected media outlet,” the union said.
“Dawn was founded by the father of the nation, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and the paper is respected globally for its unbiased reporting,” it added, quoting its president and secretary general.
The PFUJ urged the government to withdraw the ad ban for the promotion of “free and responsible journalism” and emphasised the importance of traditional media’s role amid the ubiquity of fake news.
“[The] PFUJ views this as an attempt to force the media group to change its editorial policy, which is unacceptable,” the press release read, adding that the union would stand in solidarity with the Dawn Media Group and called on the government to “respect the principles of press freedom and freedom of expression”.
Earlier this year, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) noted in its ‘Islamabad Declaration’ that Dawn has been denied advertisements by the federal and Punjab governments since October 2024 “because of its professional and critical approach in reporting and editorials”.
The Sindh government, too, has periodically withheld its ads for arbitrary reasons.
This was not the only way in which authorities have tried to obstruct Dawn’s reporting – after the so-called ‘Dawn Leaks’ saga, the paper’s circulation was blocked in large parts of the country, especially the cantonment areas, on the orders of certain individuals.</p><small>2025-12-14 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/141904487dc8340.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961089/exhausted-from-socialising-recharge-your-social-battery' target='_blank'><strong>Exhausted from socialising? Recharge your social battery</strong></a><br><p>You may feel worn out after a busy weekend of conversations and appointments, as though your social battery has run out.
“The more we move around in large groups, engage in conversations or are exposed to conflicts, the more our energy levels drop, similar to a smartphone battery when used frequently,” says Dr Steffen Häfner, medical director of a hospital in Germany’s Bad Saulgau and specialist in psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy.
Everyone feels exhausted after a lot of socialising, says British author Amy Arthur, whose book Pace Yourself: How to Have Energy in an Exhausting World is dedicated to the issue.
“The upper limit varies from one person to the next.”
Experts agree that everyone, even extroverts who often draw energy from social interaction, needs time out to recover.
“The key is to strike a balance between activity and relaxation,” says Dr Häfner.
Only by retreating, resting or engaging in relaxing activities can you recharge your social battery.
Good strategies for regeneration include:

Restful sleep: Getting enough sleep is the basis for recharging your social battery.
Exercise in nature: Walking helps to recharge your inner battery.
Creative activities: Painting, playing music, or other creative activities have a relaxing and regenerating effect.
Meaningful conversations: A good conversation in which you feel understood can also contribute to relaxation.

All these things help to recharge your inner battery in everyday life, Dr Häfner says.
Retreating is the most obvious method.
Being alone can help if it is the exchange and interaction with others that tires us, according to Arthur.
However, if social anxiety or depression makes being with other people so exhausting, being alone may also exacerbate the problems.
And if you still feel exhausted despite rest and relaxation, this could be a sign of mental illness, Dr Häfner says.
People suffering from burn-out also report that they find it difficult to recover, even after long breaks, “like a smartphone plugged into a power outlet, but with a broken charging cable”.
Warning signs that you should take seriously include:

Permanent overload: The feeling of being permanently overwhelmed does not go away.
Social withdrawal: You increasingly withdraw from social contacts.
Lack of recovery: Even after breaks, you do not feel refreshed.

If you notice these signs or warning signals, it could be “that there is more to it than just everyday exhaustion”, says Dr Häfner.
“In such cases, it is advisable to seek professional support”, and with help, work on strengthening your resources, mitigating stress reactions and finding a healthy balance between withdrawal and social activity again.

Afridi’s intimation came during a PTI rally in Kohat, where he reminded the crowd that incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, had delivered the message from jail of “freedom or death”.







“So if we go this time around, we will either return in shrouds or after getting freedom,” he said, adding that Imran had given the responsibility of making decisions — be it about talks with the government or protests — to Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas.*
The two leaders are part of the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) along with the PTI, which has also nominated them as the opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate.
“For my part,” Afridi said, “I met them and assured them of any kind of support.”
He added, “So whenever a call comes from them, you have to be ready. And we will together seize Haqiqi Azadi from them (country’s current rulers).”
The CM claimed that “all institutions and the government want to eliminate the PTI”.
Even the judiciary did not heed PTI’s grievances, he said.
Without naming anyone, the CM further stated: “Those supposed to protect us turn into out killers, and those raised to protect our mandate, stole it. Tell me then, what solution do we have?”
He said Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz had been issuing advice to him lately but she should focus on her province instead.
“I will listen to them now?” he remarked, adding that “our leader is Imran, and we will listen to only him. There will be only Imran’s policy and rule here”.
He said Maryam should focus on her province, where, according to a recent survey, police had turned out to be the most corrupt department in the country.
CM Afridi also urged the people to report corruption cases to authorities and his government in KP would take action on the complaints. He also asked the divisional and district administrations to keep their doors open and listen to public issues.
Provincial Minister for Law, Parliamentary Affairs, and Human Rights Aftab Alam Afridi lamented that Imran’s family and CM Afridi were not allowed to meet the incarcerated party chief.
He also condemned Imran being called a “security threat” to the country, saying, “Yes, Khan was a threat, but only to those who had owned business empires in this country.”
Referring to today’s rally, he said these were just “warm-up matches”.
“And this time, when we leave, we will not come back empty handed,” he said, seemingly implying the possibility of a protest.
Speaking to the participants of the rally, PTI’s provincial president and MNA Junaid Akbar said the workers of the party “could never be threatened with police cases or press conferences.”
He also said that the party and its workers were ready to protect CM Afridi’s government.
“If someone tries to impose governor’s rule in KP, you must reach and lay siege to the governor’s house. We protected our vote, and we will protect our government, too,” he said.
He also said that the PTI was did not expect that “bullets, purchased from funds meant for development”, would be fired on its protesters on November 26, 2024.
“But I assure you, this time, we will come to face bullets.”
Akbar also mentioned that Achakzai would make decision regarding any dialogue or call for a protest.
Special Assistant to the Chief Minister Shafi Jan warned that if CM Afridi was removed, powers that be would not be able to control the masses.
Meanwhile, MNA Shehryar Afridi said that the PTI will take Imran’s case to every corner of the country.
“No power on earth could challenge Pakistan if the country were united,” he said, adding, “Imran Khan is a matter of pride for us.”</p><small>2025-12-14 14:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/141627020171ded.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961077/8-suspects-part-of-extortion-network-arrested-during-raid-at-sunni-tehreek-chiefs-residence-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>8 suspects part of extortion network arrested during raid at Sunni Tehreek chief’s residence in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>Karachi police said on Sunday that eight suspects, “involved in running an extortion network” were arrested during a raid at the residence of Pakistan Sunni Tehreek (PST) chairman Muhammad Sarwat Ejaz Qadri in Karachi.
Special Investigation Unit (SIU) Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Imran Khan confirmed Saturday night’s development during a press briefing in Karachi today.
At the same time, he also clarified that Qadri was neither wanted by police nor had he been arrested. Moreover, the official said police had no evidence of the suspects’ association with any party.
The SSP also clarified that police had found no evidence of the involvement of the PST chief or any other member in the extortion network.
SSP Khan said multiple cases had been registered against the arrested suspects, who were associated with an extortion network run by two men, who he identified as Wasiullah Lakho and Abdul Samad Kathiawari.
These two “most-wanted” suspects were reportedly “in hiding abroad”, the official said, adding that three other suspects had been playing a key role in running the extortion network in Karachi. The official identified those three suspects as Mullah Shahzaib, Jawwad alias Waja Qadri and Rehanuddin.
The SSP said the Karachi additional inspector general had constituted a special task force for action against extortion last week. The team comprised west zone deputy inspector general (DIG), Crime Investigation Agency DIG, central SSP and SIU SSP, he added.
Two days ago, he continued, the SIU arrested suspect Rehanuddin in an injured condition. “He is named in a case of extortion and firing at a car showroom, which was registered at the Jamshed Quarters police station a month ago.”
“During initial interrogation, the suspect revealed the names of other members and heads of the [extortion] group,” the official said, adding that based on the information shared by him, the SIU and central police conducted a joint raid in the jurisdiction of Rizvia police station on Saturday night.
Seventeen people were detained during the raid, he said, adding that nine weapons, including G-3 rifles, submachine guns and pistols, were also confiscated.
Initial investigation showed that eight of the detained suspects had criminal records, including Mullah Shahzaib and Jawwad. Apart from them, three suspects accused of firing while carrying out extortion activities and three “facilitators” were arrested, he added.
Ten cases had been registered with the SIU against nine suspects involved in extortion, including Rehanuddin, the SSP said.
He said further investigation of the matter was under way.
Replying to a question, he said if it was established that anyone had provided shelter to the suspects or kept them in hiding, action would be taken against that individual as well.
He also confirmed that among the suspects, Rehanuddin had contested elections in 2024 as an independent candidate for an MNA seat.</p><small>2025-12-14 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639300-dsp-haider-confesses-to-killing-wife-daughter' target='_blank'><strong>DSP Haider confesses to killing wife, daughter</strong></a><br><p>

The ministry’s clarification follows reports of the government agreeing to 11 new targets, including additional tax measures and expenditure cuts from early next month, to make up for rising revenue shortfalls and to keep the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on track.
This was revealed in documents released by the IMF earlier this week, according to which commitment to the new or revised structural benchmarks, together with completion of two “prior actions”, enabled the conclusion of a staff-level agreement on the second review of the EFF and its approval by the IMF Executive Board for the disbursement of about $1.2bn for Pakistan on December 9.
A press release issued by the finance ministry today said that it had “clarified the intent, context, and continuity of reform measures under Pakistan’s IMF Extended Fund Facility programme, particularly in response to recent commentary regarding so-called “new conditions”.

 

“The purpose is to reaffirm that the measures referenced are part of a phased, medium-term reform agenda agreed with the IMF, many of which are extensions or logical progressions of reforms already initiated by the Government of Pakistan,” the press release read.
It said that the EFF was designed to support countries in implementing medium-term structural reforms aimed at achieving agreed policy objectives.
“These reforms are implemented in a sequenced and step-by-step manner over the duration of the programme,” it said. “Each review builds upon prior actions to ensure that the ultimate policy goals agreed at the outset of the program are achieved.
“Accordingly, actions under the EFF are structured as logical steps, with additional measures incorporated at each successive review.”
The press release said the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) with the IMF finalised after the second EFF review supplemented the MEFP agreed during the first review and reflected this phased approach.
During IMF discussions and negotiations, the government presented its planned policy reform initiatives, it said. “Where the IMF assesses that these initiatives contribute to the agreed programme objectives, they are incorporated into the MEFP.
“As a result, many of the structural benchmarks and actions included in the latest MEFP are derived from reforms already undertaken or initiated by the government of Pakistan, rather than being externally imposed or newly introduced conditions.”







The ministry issued clarifications for each of the 11 measures characterised as “new conditions”.
Regarding the public disclosure of asset declarations of civil servants, it said that this reform had been part of the EFF programme since the initial MEFP in May 2024.
“The current structural benchmark represents the second step, following the successful legislative amendment to the Civil Servants Act, 1973,” it said.
Commitments to strengthening the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) operational effectiveness and independence were also agreed during earlier reviews, it said, including coordination with provincial anti-corruption establishments.
“The development of action plans for high-risk agencies is a continuation of this commitment and runs parallel to, rather than stemming from, the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment Report,” the ministry added.
On empowering provincial anti-corruption establishments, it said that allowing these bodies access to financial intelligence aligned with the ongoing Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) reform agenda, which had been “integral to the EFF since its inception”.
The ministry further said that strengthening remittance inflows was “critical to Pakistan’s external stability”.
“Following measures to curb informal channels, remittances increased by 26 per cent year-on-year from FY24 to FY25, with a further increase of 9.3 percent projected for FY26.
“The government, in coordination with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), has been working to remove structural bottlenecks in cross-border payments. The IMF has built upon these efforts by incorporating them into the MEFP,” it added.
The ministry also said that the IMF staff report that had been published in May 2025 had recommended a comprehensive study to identify bottlenecks in the local currency bond market to broaden the investor base. This recommendation has now been formalised as a structural benchmark, according to the press release.
On the deregulation of the sugar industry, it said that the initiative originated from the government.
“A task force, notified by the prime minister’s office and chaired by the minister for power, has been mandated to recommend full liberalisation of the sugar market and propose a national policy in consultation with provinces. Given its alignment with the EFF objective of reducing government intervention in commodity markets, the IMF has included this initiative as a structural benchmark,” it said.
The ministry added that the development of a comprehensive roadmap for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was part of a broader domestic resource mobilisation reform agenda led directly by the prime minister.
“Key actions already taken include approval of the transformation plan, establishment of the Tax Policy Office, and strengthening of compliance risk management. This structural benchmark builds upon commitments made with the IMF in May 2024 and March 2025,” it said.
Further, the ministry called the requirement to develop and publish a medium-term tax reform strategy “a logical extension of earlier reforms, particularly the establishment and operationalisation of the Tax Policy Office to separate tax policy formulation from FBR’s operational functions”.
It said that the privatisation of distribution companies (Discos) had also been a core component of the EFF programme since its inception, adding that it was “envisaged to occur in phases”.
“Finalising preconditions for private-sector participation in Hesco (Hyderabad Electric Supply Company) and Sepco (Sukkur Electric Power Company) represents the next step following initiation of the process for the first batch of Discos. Additionally, the signing of Public Service Obligation (PSO) agreements with the seven largest entities reiterates an earlier programme commitment,” it added.
Regarding regulatory reforms and corporate compliance, it said, “Amendments to the Companies Act, 2017 to strengthen compliance for unlisted firms are part of the broader regulatory reform agenda aimed at improving the business climate, an objective embedded in the EFF from the outset.”
It added that, similarly, the structural benchmark related to a concept note for amendments to the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Act follows the successful completion of a prior benchmark involving an SEZ assessment study.
Finally, it said that contingency measures to address potential revenue shortfalls had also been part of the MEFP framework since May 2024, adding that the initial MEFP itself included a structural benchmark for introducing a 5 per cent Federal Excise Duty on fertiliser and pesticides.
“In conclusion, the measures outlined in the latest MEFP represent continuity, sequencing, and deepening of Pakistan’s agreed reform agenda under the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility, rather than the imposition of abrupt or unprecedented conditions,” the ministry said.</p><small>2025-12-14 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14120517aff365f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961074/nocs-to-binance-htx-not-blanket-approvals-but-first-step-under-supervised-entry-framework-bilal-bin-saqib' target='_blank'><strong>NOCs to Binance, HTX not ‘blanket approvals’ but first step under supervised entry framework: Bilal bin Saqib</strong></a><br><p>Chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) Bilal Bin Saqib has said that the no-objection certificates (NOCs) issued to global cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and HTX were not a “blanket approval” but the “first step under a risk-mitigated, phased, supervised entry framework”.

         View this post on Instagram            

Saqib’s video statement, televised on Sunday, comes after Pakistan gave initial clearance for Binance and HTX on Friday to register with regulators to set up local subsidiaries and begin preparations for full exchange licence applications.
The clearances allow the exchanges to register on the Anti-Money Laundering system, set up local units and prepare full applications.
Speaking about the development, Saqib said the issuance of the NOCs to Binance and HTX was the “first practical step” that reflected a “new mindset”.
He further said that the step was based on the “Pakistan-first” approach.
Saqib detailed that by working under a supervised entry framework, authorities had been able to establish “control” in three areas, namely money laundering and terrorism financing; transparency of ownership and fitness and propreitary checks; and paving the way for licensing through the enforcement of timelines.
“It is mandatory for every platform to register on the AML [system] and have direct linkages with the financial monitoring unit,” he said, further asserting that no platform would be allowed entry in the country without “disclosures and verification”.
Moreover, he said, the process of licensing would be initiated for entities after they would “move forward in line with Pakistan’s law and with its oversight”.
Saqib said this model was not unique to Pakistan and the world’s leading financial centres had been approaching new industries in a phased manner.
Reiterating that a “Pakistan-first approach” was being employed in the crypto sector, he said, “We will first control this industry and then scale it.”
He said Pakistan ranked among the world’s top three “crypto-adoption countries”, adding that it was estimated that there were 30 to 40 million crypto users in the country.
“They have adopted this industry without any regulatory framework, classroom and education,” he said. “The good thing here is that this shows that our youth is world class. But are our systems world class? Are our regulations world class?”
Saqib further questioned whether it would be wise for the state to stay out of a sector in which people were involved on an extensive scale.
“You cannot ignore innovation,” he said, stressing that not introducing the “right policies will weaken the country and make people unsafe”.
Keeping this in view, he continued, “our country’s leadership has tried to narrow this gap”.
Stressing the need for regulation, he said countries that would take an early initiative in this regard would be able to attract capital.
“Few countries have the opportunity that Pakistan has,” he said, adding, “We are not trying to promote crypto but to regulate it as people here have already adopted it.
“Our country is the fifth-most populous country with tech-savvy youth and where digital adoption is growing fast. But, the [country will be able to] benefit from this talent when they have a legal, structured path [to follow]. When they will have a framework. Otherwise, they will leave.”
He said it was the responsibility of the state to create an enabling environment for emerging technologies. “There needs to be smart regulation here so that capital from [around the world] flows into the country.”
He said that through the framework devised for the crypto sector, the government aimed to prepare for the “industries of 2035 and 2025”.
“We do not want the Pakistani youth to be just consumers but evolve into builders and global experts.”
Saqib emphasised that the country needed to prepare for the future and be globally trusted. “So that we are able to strengthen our sovereignty and economy through technology.”
He said his message to the international community was that Pakistan was open to business and welcoming innovation in the area of digital assets, but only from those entities who would follow the country’s rules, create opportunities for the youth here and operate in line with a “Pakistan-first approach”.
Coming back to the NOCs for Binance and HTX, he said while addressing the youth, “This is not our destination. This is the foundation of a building that you have to construct.”
“Pakistan’s future should not be imports. It should be built here, by your hands. Pakistan should emerge as a global case study in the area of global assets.”</p><small>2025-12-14 08:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639273-islamabad-puts-drivers-on-notice-as-smog-crisis-worsens' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad puts drivers on notice as smog crisis worsens</strong></a><br><p>

At first glance, the idea feels compelling.
If machines can scrape information across multiple feeds in real time, summarise parliamentary proceedings, monitor political developments, crunch data, and respond to user queries in conversational language, why would end users still need traditional journalism outlets, or even digital platforms as intermediaries for news? The argument implies a future where individuals bypass traditional journalism outlets entirely and receive information directly from intelligent systems in a conversational, real-time format.

 

Those who make this argument often point to changing audience behaviour, especially among younger users. Consumers are steadily turning away from conventional news platforms and gravitating toward faster, more personal, and more direct sources of information.
And to be fair, the trend is clear.
The latest Reuters Institute Digital News Report shows a consistent decline in trust, viewership, and platform dependence on mainstream news outlets. Users, particularly young people, increasingly prefer to consume information from influencers, content creators, and niche commentators rather than from professional journalists. Their relationship with news is personal, interactive, emotional, and algorithmically curated.
Thus, many in the industry look at this shift and assume that AI-mediated information access will make journalism redundant faster than we imagine.
But this prediction misunderstands both journalism and technological disruption.
Journalism has never merely been about transmitting information from point A to point B. If journalism were equivalent to distribution, then journalists would already have become irrelevant when blogs, Twitter, and user-generated content exploded over a decade ago. Yet even as more voices entered the digital information space, the public’s need for verification, investigation, context, scrutiny, and accountability only grew stronger.
Every time a major national or geopolitical event unfolds, the world still turns to journalists to understand what actually happened, who benefits, who is responsible, and what it means.

How will journalism evolve to meet the challenges ushered in by AI?

AI does not eliminate the need for this work. On the contrary, AI multiplies it.
We are moving into a period where the volume of available information will exceed human comprehension by several orders of magnitude. Generative systems will not just surface facts; they will hallucinate, remix, misattribute, and infer things that never happened at all.

 

Political actors, commercial interests, and even the state authorities now possess the ability to manufacture narratives, emotional atmospheres, and public sentiments on an industrial scale, with minimal cost and high precision. The idea that ordinary users will be able to navigate that universe alone, without a professional class dedicated to verification, investigation, and ethical interpretation, is, to say the least, misplaced.
If AI is going to rewrite the information environment, then journalism is not becoming less necessary; it is becoming structurally essential. In five years, the hardest problems in public communication will not be about finding information. It will be about establishing what is real, what is synthetic, what is manipulated, and what is politically engineered for attention and outrage.
For me, the question was never whether journalists would become irrelevant. They won’t.
The real question is two-fold: how the profession will evolve to meet the challenges ushered in by AI, and whether journalists will be able to meaningfully integrate these technologies into their workflows, their verification practices, and their investigative muscle.
To begin with, journalists will need an expanded skillset that goes far beyond traditional verification or deepfake detection. As AI becomes embedded in governance, bureaucracy, law enforcement, welfare delivery, and public administration, journalistic storytelling will have to evolve as well.
In the past, governance reporting focused on the effectiveness of systems, corruption, procurement flaws, or regulatory gaps. In the future, many of those stories will be about data bias, algorithmic discrimination, opaque model assumptions, automated decision-making, and the ways poorly designed AI systems can harm citizens at scale. And journalists will only be able to report on these issues meaningfully if they understand how these systems work.
For instance, they will have to learn algorithmic auditing, network analysis, and the ability to interrogate opaque systems. Similarly, they will need to be able to trace financial and political incentives behind influence operations, scrutinise the training data that powers decision-making models, and investigate how platforms, corporations, and governments deploy automated systems to shape public sentiment, marginalise voices, or suppress inconvenient truths.
In an ‘automated’ information environment, human accountability must become more rigorous, not less. If, for example, a government uses predictive policing, automated welfare systems, or algorithmic surveillance, someone must investigate who designed the system, what assumptions it encodes, whose rights it affects, and whether its outputs reinforce bias or injustice. No machine can perform that function independently. It requires reporters with access, independence, courage, and analytical skill.
Thus, I believe one of the biggest democratic risks in the near future is not that AI will make journalists irrelevant, but that there will be too few trained journalists capable of interrogating AI-driven systems.
Which brings me to the second part of the issue: are we, the journalists, integrating AI into our workflows the right way? The answer is complicated. AI offers extraordinary efficiencies that can support research, transcription, analysis, visualisation, and verification at a scale that traditional newsrooms have never experienced. But integration without standards is risky.
If journalists outsource too much judgement to opaque systems, we risk importing algorithmic bias into editorial choices, eroding verification practices, and unintentionally weakening our core responsibility: the independent assessment of facts.
My take on the question of whether journalism as we know it will ‘survive’ the AI boom is simple: journalism will be just fine; it is the journalists who refuse to evolve who should be worried, not the craft itself.

This presents a big challenge for the government in identifying individuals not paying their taxes, with 2.262 million out of 5.912 million filed up to Oct 31, potentially concealing their taxable income. This means that only 3.650m taxpayers declared incomes in their returns for tax year 2025 (TY25).
The pattern of nil-filers are across the three main categories — individuals, associations of persons (AoPs) and the corporate sector. The nil returns are submitted for one-time financial transactions or to take advantage of lower tax rates for placement on the Active Taxpayers List (ATL).
Concerns are mounting within the FBR that Pakistan’s income tax system is failing to capture the true wealth of its citizens, as approximately half of taxpayers continue to declare nil incomes far below the lavish lifestyles they maintain.

In TY25, the number of nil-filers, both salaried and non-salaried individuals, remained significantly high. Out of 5.805m total individual returns filed, 2.206m were nil-returns, declaring no taxable income.
This means 38pc of all individual filers fell into the nil-filer category, highlighting a growing trend of non-contributory filings and raising concerns about the quality of the tax base. In TY24, almost a similar trend of nil-filers was recorded, which shows consistency of the trend.
Despite being considered a highly documented segment, the corporate sector posted the highest proportion of nil-filers in TY25. Of the 17,873 corporate returns filed, 13,739 companies, accounting for 76.87pc, declared nil income.
This means only 4,134 companies reported any taxable income, raising concerns over underreporting and the effectiveness of enforcement within the formal business sector.
The second-largest category of nil-filers in TY25 was Associations of Persons (AOPs). Out of 89,510 AOP returns filed, 42,834, or 47.85pc, declared nil income. This indicates that only 46,676 AOPs reported any taxable income, highlighting significant underreporting within this segment of taxpayers.
This pattern appears to be continuing for the last few years owing to the government’s introduction of the higher rates for non-filers. It was also proposed that non-filers be prohibited from engaging in any financial or investment activities. As a result, the junk filing has become a routine practice, which gives a feel good figure of returns filing to FBR.
People are living in palatial houses, enjoying 24/7 air conditioning, riding fancy cars, wearing branded clothes, making multiple international trips, buying branded watches/jewellery and other luxuries but their income tax returns do not reflect their lifestyles. Income declared and tax paid is not reflective of their living standards, as pointed out after an internal analysis of the tax returns filed with the FBR.
A senior tax officer told Dawn that junk returns resulted from tax policy lacunas. He stated the existing policy encourages people to submit tax returns without paying taxes to benefit from reduced tax rates. He said the FBR would have to redefine the terms filer and non-filer and relate tax return filing exclusively to tax payment.
He went on to say that the present system suffers from data integration issues.
Pakistan’s cash-driven and largely undocumented economy continues to shield undeclared wealth from formal scrutiny. This undocumented economy continues to frustrate efforts to broaden the tax base.

A ninth person was hurt by bullet fragments, the mayor said.
Streets around campus remained blocked and packed with emergency vehicles hours after the shooting and law enforcement officials heightened security around the city as police continued their manhunt.
“The individual responsible is still at large,” Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters at a 9:30pm (7:30am PKT) press conference. Deputy Police Chief Timothy O’Hara said the suspect had not been identified.
Officials said they are looking for a male dressed in black and were releasing a video of the suspect, who O’Hara said may have been wearing a mask. He said officials had retrieved shell casings from the scene of the shooting, but that police were not prepared to release details.
Officials said the gunman escaped after shooting students in Brown’s Barus & Holley engineering building, where exams were taking place at the time.
“We are a week and a half away from Christmas. And two people died today and another eight are in the hospital,” Smiley said earlier in the evening. “So please pray for those families.”
Brown is on College Hill in Providence, Rhode Island’s state capital. The university has hundreds of buildings, including lecture halls, laboratories and dormitories.
“This is the day one hopes never happens, and it has,” Brown’s president Christina Paxson told reporters, confirming all or nearly all of the victims were students.
As news of the shooting spread, the school told students to shelter in place.
Brown student Chiang-Heng Chien told local TV station WJAR he was working in a lab with three other students when he saw the text about the active shooter situation a block away. They waited under desks for about two hours, he said.
Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee vowed that the shooter would be brought to justice. “We’re going to make sure that we catch the individual that brought so much suffering to so many people.”
The search for the suspect was hampered in part because downtown Providence was crowded with holiday shoppers and thousands of people attending concerts, local media said. Federal law enforcement and police from surrounding cities and towns were assisting in the search, officials said. According to local news reports, venues across the city were bringing in extra security.
President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that he had been briefed on the situation, which he called “terrible”.
“All we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt.”
Compared to many countries, mass shootings in schools, workplaces, and places of worship are more common in the US, which has some of the most permissive gun laws in the developed world. The Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as any incident in which four or more victims have been shot, has counted 389 of them this year in the US, including at least six such shootings at schools.
Last year the US had more than 500 mass shootings, according to the archive.</p><small>2025-12-14 03:56</small></div><hr>
