Escalating tensions have pushed the subcontinent into uncharted territory heightening the risk of a full-blown crisis as bilateral mechanisms are cast aside and diplomatic relations further downgraded.
Following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, India announced a raft of punitive measures against Pakistan. They included suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs the sharing and management of trans-border rivers between the two neighbours. Other steps involved closing the Attari border crossing, cancelling visas and shrinking the size of the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.
These so-called retaliatory steps were taken without any investigation into the terrorist incident and absent any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement. The Indian foreign secretary’s announcement only mentioned “cross-border linkages of the terrorist attack”. But an orchestrated campaign in the Indian media pointed the accusing finger at Pakistan.
 
 

More significantly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of “unimaginable punishment” for the attackers and their backers. This intensified speculation in India that his government was planning some kind of kinetic action to avenge the killings. It recalled memories of the 2019 Balakot crisis when Indian planes crossed the border to launch strikes inside Pakistani territory ostensibly against militant hideouts. Pakistan retaliated by air strikes in Jammu. The crisis was defused with the help of friendly countries after Pakistan repatriated an Indian pilot captured when his plane was shot down by Pakistan.
Islamabad’s response to India’s April 23 announcement was carefully calibrated to match Indian moves. A statement issued after a meeting of the National Security Committee announced a slew of retaliatory actions. It described Indian measures as “unilateral, unjust and irresponsible”. It rejected the Indian decision to suspend the IWT and warned any attempt “to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan” will be “considered an act of war and responded with full force”. Pakistan, it said, reserved the right to hold “all bilateral agreements with India”, including the Simla Agreement, “in abeyance” but stopped short of suspending any. Pakistan also shut down the Wagah border crossing and its airspace to Indian overflights as well as halted all trade. These steps mostly mirrored Indian actions.

Escalating tensions have pushed the region into uncharted territory and towards a full-blown crisis.

India’s announcement about putting the IWT “in abeyance” was not made in a vacuum. For the past several years New Delhi has been raising doubts about the fate of the 1960 treaty, that has for over six decades survived wars, confrontations and tensions to provide a framework for water-sharing.
The two countries disagreed in recent years over the treaty’s dispute settlement mechanism. India, for example, boycotted a court of arbitration hearing in January 2023 at The Hague on Indian hydroelectric projects on the Chenab and Jhelum rivers disputed by water-stressed Pakistan. It wanted a neutral expert instead. In January 2023, India notified Pakistan of its intention to amend the treaty’s dispute settlement provisions. Islamabad responded at the time by expressing willingness to discuss any concerns in the relevant body, the joint Indus Waters Commission, while calling on India to comply with the treaty.
 
 

In August 2024, New Delhi formally asked Islamabad for a review and renegotiation of the IWT. In its communication to Pakistan, India called for modifying it on grounds of what it called “fundamental and unforeseen change” in circumstances as well as security concerns. It mentioned concerns over issues including “demographic changes, environmental challenges, and the need to accelerate clean energy development”. India’s letter of April 24 to Pakistan echoed the same points but significantly added “sustained cross-border terrorism by Pakistan” as justification for putting the treaty in abeyance.
India’s decision to suspend the treaty is neither consistent with treaty provisions nor international law. The treaty does not allow either party to unilaterally put it in abeyance or abrogate it. Both parties have to consent to any treaty modification or its termination according to its provisions. India’s announcement says the IWT “will be held in abeyance with immediate effect until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”.
For now, abeyance means India will cease sharing water flow data and exchanging information about project designs. But it already stopped doing that years ago. It can take other steps to mount pressure. But India cannot immediately halt the flow of water or significantly divert it as it lacks the infrastructure at present to do so. So, the near-term impact of this action will be limited. Of course, in the longer term it has serious implications.
The imminent danger is from any military action New Delhi is tempted to take, encouraged by what its officials see as ‘effective’ Indian coercive diplomacy in play, which needs reinforcement. Modi’s speech in Bihar on April 24 in which he said terrorists and their backers will be pursued to the “ends of the earth” is being widely construed as strong indication of that possibility. Speculation is running rife that conventional kinetic strikes may be combined with cyberattacks and asymmetrical actions by India.
Already deployment of heavy weaponry is reported close to the Line of Control and international border. Prime Minister Modi may think he can borrow from the Israeli playbook to ‘punish’ Pakistan but any Indian kinetic action will be met by a strong military response from Pakistan, with uncertain and unpredictable consequences for New Delhi. This will likely set off an escalatory cycle and trigger an all-out crisis, which could be on a larger scale than what happened in 2019.
 
 

In 2019, a third party helped to defuse the crisis. Will this happen again? If no such help is forthcoming in a timely way it would make the situation between two nuclear neighbours more dangerous than in the past.
The notion of limited war waged under the nuclear threshold is fraught with untold risks. Such a scenario should be avoided at all costs. Even though there is little appetite for this by the Indian side, a backchannel must be re-established without delay to avoid any miscalculation, manage the crisis and prevent it from spinning out of control. The alternative is too terrifying to contemplate.

This extreme weather is expected to persist till the end of the month, with some regions already experiencing highs of 49°C. What was once considered rare has become alarmingly common, as climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of such events. Yet, despite repeated warnings from scientists and international bodies, Pakistan remains woefully unprepared for the escalating climate crisis.
 
 

The effects of the heatwave are rippling through every sector. Agriculture, the backbone of Pakistan’s economy, is under severe stress as excess heat kills crops and worsens water scarcity. Reports of early wheat crop failures are already emerging, threatening both food security and rural livelihoods.
At the same time, water resources are being strained to the limit. Faster-than-normal snowmelt in the northern mountains, spurred by high temperatures, raises the spectre of flash floods while jeopardising water availability during the critical summer months.
Public health infrastructure is also under immense pressure. Hospitals are seeing an increase in heat-related illnesses, particularly among vulnerable groups such as outdoor labourers, the elderly and children. The memory of the 2015 Karachi heatwave, which claimed over 1,200 lives, looms large and must not be ignored. Meanwhile, power outages in various areas highlight the fragility of the energy grid at a time when uninterrupted supply is a matter of life and death.
 
 

The government must roll out relief measures without delay. As highlighted by the NDMA, cooling centres should be established in urban and rural hotspots. Water resources must be managed and prioritised for essential needs and work hours for outdoor labour should be adjusted to minimise exposure. Public health services need to be fully equipped to manage heatstroke and related conditions, and power must be prioritised for hospitals and essential water infrastructure.
Beyond these short-term interventions, there is a pressing need for a long-term strategy to adapt to the warming climate. This includes investing in water storage and management, promoting climate-resilient crops and efficient irrigation techniques, and expanding urban greenery to reduce heat absorption. Early warning systems must be enhanced, and local disaster response mechanisms strengthened to ensure timely action.
The current heatwave is not merely a temporary discomfort; it is a dire warning of what lies ahead if Pakistan fails to confront the realities of climate change. Policymakers must treat this crisis as a national emergency. The most vulnerable citizens cannot afford the cost of inaction. As temperatures continue to rise, so too must our commitment to building climate resilience. Rather than half-measures, the situation demands bold, coordinated action to safeguard lives, livelihoods and the country’s future.

Most headed home with more questions than answers.
Many participants in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank Spring Meetings had a sense that Trump’s administration was still conflicted in its demands from trading partners hit with his sweeping tariffs.
During the whirlwind week, many finance and trade ministers sought to meet US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other key Trump administration officials, to no avail.

Foreboding persists as financial leaders unable to meet Trump admin officials

Those that did were often told to be patient — even as the clock steadily ticks down on the 90-day pause Trump had granted on the steepest levies.
“We know that they think — that it won’t be that bad,” said Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski.
“They think it’s a short-term pain, long-term gain. And I’m afraid that we’ll have short-term pain, long-term pain.”
 
 

The Trump administration’s most substantial trade negotiations during the week were with Japan and South Korea, but the results were inconclusive as Bessent cited “productive” talks with both countries.
The IMF took a slightly more optimistic view of the economic fallout from the US tariffs, slashing growth forecasts for most countries in its World Economic Outlook but stopping far short of predicting recessions — even for the US and export-dependent China.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva acknowledged that member countries were anxious about the uncertainty shock to a global economy buffeted by pandemic, inflation and wars but held out hope that trade negotiations would ease the tariff strains.
Several finance officials told Reuters that odds of recession were higher than the IMF’s 37 per cent chance, citing private sector forecasts.
Debt risk rises
Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA Network, a faith-based nonprofit group advocating debt relief, said that the IMF’s forecasts were clearly aimed at preventing market panic, even as officials in private meetings expressed concerns about new debt crises emerging.
“It was a do-nothing kind of week,” LeCompte said, adding that debt discussions were inconclusive and overshadowed by tariff talks.
Reza Baqir, a former Pakistan central bank governor who now heads sovereign debt advisory at Alvarez & Marsal, said: “For many developing countries, especially in the Global South, there is a real sense of despair that the agenda on Financing for Development is really not center-stage. And who is going to be there to champion that debate?”
World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill also sounded an alarm on rising debt levels for emerging markets, noting that tariffs had prompted a sharp slowdown in trade and foreign direct investment that are crucial to developing country growth.
No US withdrawal
Policymakers did breathe a sigh of relief when Bessent expressed US support for the IMF and the World Bank, declaring that they have “enduring value” but criticising their “mission creep” into climate, gender and equality issues.
Participants at the meetings, along with financial markets, were encouraged by Bessent’s comments early in the week that US tariffs on Chinese goods and vice versa were unsustainable, suggesting a deal to ease them could be reached soon.
But China denied Trump’s assertions that tariff negotiations were underway with Beijing, adding to the confusion over tariffs.

• Kh Asif calls for int’l probe
• No official word on Nawaz-Shehbaz huddle
ISLAMABAD: The country’s political leadership continued to engage with foreign capitals over the weekend to highlight India’s attempts to cloak its provocative actions and false accusations in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
In separate calls with leaders from China, UK and Iran, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar drew attention to the “baseless propaganda and unilateral measures” taken by New Delhi, including the decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, which is a clear violation of the country’s international obligations.
Mr Dar, who also hold the foreign affairs portfolio, spoke to his counterparts from the UK and China and stressed Islamabad’s unwavering resolve to defend its national interests, while continuing to promote peace and stability in the region.
According to the Xinhua news agency, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told Mr Dar that Beijing was paying close attention to the evolving situation between Pakistan and India.
He reaffirmed China’s consistent support for Pakistan’s firm counterterrorism efforts.
 
 

“As an ironclad friend and an all-weather strategic cooperative partner, China fully understands Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and supports Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty and security interests,” Xinhua quoted Wang as saying.
“China advocates for a swift and fair investigation and believes that conflict does not serve the fundamental interests of either India or Pakistan, nor does it benefit regional peace and stability,” Wang noted.
The Chinese foreign minister, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China’s Central committee, hoped that both sides would remain restrained, move toward each other, and work together to de-escalate the situation.
In a separate call with the UK foreign secretary, Mr Dar briefed David Lammy on “India’s false accusations, baseless propaganda, and unilateral measures”, while reiterating Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to promote peace and stability in the region.
According to a Foreign Office readout of the call, the UK foreign secretary emphasised the imp­o­rtance of de-escalating the situation thro­ugh dialogue and peaceful resolution of issues.
Appreciating these efforts, Mr Dar conveyed Pakistan’s readiness to participate in any independent and transparent investigation to ascertain the facts.
Both leaders agreed to maintain active contact regarding the evolving situation.
Call for int’l commission
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khaw­aja Asif called on India to stop levelling baseless allegations against Pakistan.
Speaking to the media in Sialkot, he said the UN Security Council and key regional powers should investigate the Pahalgam incident, warning that if two nuclear powers collided, world peace would also be destroyed.
Calling for the formation of an international commission to investigate the incident, he said that the UN should consider including China, Russia, Iran and Arab countries in the body. Who could better understand the issue than the UK, he said, referring to the region’s colonial past.
He accused Indian PM Narendra Modi of staging a political drama to save his skin, just as he had done after the Pulwama incident in 2019.
Call with Iranian president
Speaking to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday, the prime minister shared Pakistan’s position on India’s provocative actions, adding that Pakistan desired peace in the region and would welcome it if Iran also wanted to play a role in this regard.
During their call, the two leaders exchanged views on recent developments in the region, a PM Office statement said. Both also extended invitations to each other to visit their respective countries.
Referring to India’s unilateral decision on the Indus Water Treaty, PM Shehbaz said the use of water as a weapon was unacceptable and Pakistan would defend its right at all costs.
The PM said that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, reaffirming that the country had no linkage, either direct or indirect, with the Pahalgam attack, adding that Islamabad was ready for a neutral investigation into the incident.
PM Shehbaz also conveyed Pakistan’s condolences on the loss of precious lives in the tragic explosion at Bandar Abbas, which claimed dozens of the lives and left more than 500 people injured.
 
 

Pakistan stood with the brotherly people of Iran at this difficult hour and would extend all possible assistance, the PM said.
Separately, media reports suggested that PM Shehbaz Sharif had met his elder brother, PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, at Jati Umrah on Sunday to brief him on the Pahalgam attack and its aftermath.
However, there was no official word from the PM Office or PML-N circles in this regard.

• Condition applies to both contract, regular re-employment after age 60
• Move aims to curb rising pension costs under IMF requirements
• Govt pension bill estimated at over Rs1tr in current fiscal year
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has formally notified that retired public servants rejoining government service, whether on a contract or regular basis, will now have to choose between drawing a salary or receiving their pension and may no longer claim both simultaneously.
“It has been decided that henceforth, in an event where a pensioner of the federal government after the age of 60 years, is reemployed/appointed in public service after retirement whether on regular/contract or whatsoever mode of employment, the pensioner shall have the option to retain either pension or to draw the salary of said employment during the currency of that employment,” said a notification issued by the regulation wing of the Ministry of Finance.
Earlier, rehired government employees used to avail of the salary of the incumbent employment, whether on contract or regular, and pension simultaneously — and in some cases, multiple pensions. This not only had an additional financial burden on the government exchequer but also hampered the career progression of other employees.
The latest measure is part of pension reforms the government has taken in hand to contain ever-increasing pension liabilities, a key requirement of the IMF programme.
 
 

The measure was initially announced by the then finance minister Ishaq Dar in the 2022-23 budget, but it could not be implemented until reannounced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in last year’s budget before the IMF signed off a new programme.
One of the key decisions of these reforms — a contributory pension scheme for armed forces personnel — may be further delayed until 2026 despite a notification for its implementation with effect from June 2025, according to sources.
In September last year, the government notified the introduction of a contributory fund scheme for new entrants in the civil government and armed forces. In a notification, the Ministry of Finance said last year that federal government employees would contribute 10 per cent of their respective basic pay while the government would contribute 20pc of the basic pay of the employees.
According to the Sept 3, 2024, notification, the scheme would apply to civil servants joining after July 1, 2024, and armed forces personnel appointed after July 1, 2025. The government has allocated Rs10 billion for the pension fund in the 2024-25 budget.
The scheme had been introduced on the advice of the international lending agencies, particularly the World Bank, to contain rising pension liabilities described as a “ticking bomb”. The new scheme does not apply to existing employees. The government believes the contribution pension fund would slow down the growth in pension liabilities in future budgets.
The federal government’s total expenditure for pensions has been estimated at Rs1.014 trillion for the current fiscal year, up from Rs821bn in FY24, up by almost 24pc in a single year. This included pension liabilities of the armed forces at Rs662bn for the current fiscal year, up from Rs563bn, showing an increase of about 18pc.
On the other hand, the pension expenditure of civilians has been budgeted at Rs220bn for the current year against Rs228bn last year, a reduction of 3.5pc.
Subsequently, in January this year, the government notified further pension reforms, including abolishing multiple pensions and shifting future pensionable benefit calculations to an average of the past 24 months of salaries instead of the last pay drawn before retirement.
It had been notified that “in the event where a person becomes entitled to more than one pension, such person shall only be authorised to opt to draw one of the pensions”.
This was subject to the provision that “where a federal government employee becomes entitled to a pension, such federal government employee shall not be eligible to receive such pension”.
However, certain quarters were still pushing for a salary for re-employment and one pension.

• Ports anticipate crisis; manufacturers face raw material shortages
• President wades in to resolve situation
KARACHI: Efforts to disperse protesters, who have paralysed cross-country traffic by blocking national highways in parts of Sindh, remained futile on Sunday, with manufacturers saying they have been forced to halt production due to a shortage of raw material, while port authorities also anticipate serious congestion.
The road closures in several parts of Sindh are due to continuing protests against the controversial proposal to build new canals on the River Indus.
Although the federal government and the PPP regime in Sindh have agreed to postpone the project, nationalist parties, lawyers and other civil society groups do not appear convinced by the assurance and have vowed to continue their protests until the government makes the postponement official.
According to Dawn’s correspondent in Sukkur, thousands of heavy vehicles are stuck in long queues on different roads in the Kandhkot, Kashmore, Ghotki, Sukkur and Khairpur areas.
Manufacturers and transporters are surprised by the persisting impasse, even though the provincial government has been calling on protesters to clear the roads.
 
 

On Sunday, President Asif Ali Zardari met with Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, where the issue of the controversial projects and its fallout also came under discussion.
Sources privy to the meeting said the chief minister expressed concern over attempts by some political parties to exploit the issue for what he termed “vested interests”, referring to the ongoing protesters, staged mainly by nationalist parties in different parts of the province.
The CM also briefed the president about measures the Sindh government was taking to address public concerns and restore normalcy in affected areas, sources said.
To protest the continued blockade, the All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance has announced plans to hold a demonstration outside the Sindh CM House at 4pm today (Monday).
Transport at a standstill
An official at the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) told Dawn that export cargo was not arriving, while imported cargo was piling up and not moving out of the port due to the closure of roads in Sindh.
“We are managing this situation to avoid congestion at the port, especially with the continuous arrival of imported goods . But in case goods movement remains held up, the port will face severe congestion, the official said.
Transporters say that in addition to worrying manufacturers and exporters, their drivers and helpers are also in a dire situation. Nisar Jafry of the All Pakistan Goods Transporters Associa­tion said that the movement of around 30,000 trucks and oil tankers was impeded.
He said that on average, one vehicle carries goods worth Rs10 million, be their meant for import, export or locally produced.
Giving an estimated headcount, he said that around 90,000-100,000 drivers and their helpers have been stranded alongside their vehicles on the highways for over 10 days now. They are also facing food and water shortages.
 
 

Transporters also alleged that protesters had damaged dozens of vehicles parked on the roads, and that over 100 sacrificial animals that were part of their cargo had already died.
Mr Jafry said he had received a call from Sindh transport minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, requesting him to call off Monday’s rally with the assurance that the roads will be cleared soon.
In a statement on Sunday, Mr Memon called on all political parties and the legal community to reopen the roads to ensure the smooth flow of goods transport, so that no one suffers any further financial or economic loss.
Due to the closures, the public, livestock, import and export sectors, farmers, and the poor are being severely affected, he said, adding that if the sit-ins must continue, the roads should be opened so that the flow of traffic is not hampered.
Representatives of the Overseas Investors Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the Oil Companies Advisory Council and the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council have all warned that the disruptions to the logistics supply chain are creating a severe crisis.
Although around 800-1,000 oil trucks are also stranded, the OCAC representative ruled out the possibility of a fuel shortage just yet.

Between February 1 and April 20, 2025, election tribunals decided 24 petitions related to the 2024 general elections, bringing the total number of decided petitions to 136, or 36.5 per cent of the total 372 matters being heard across four provinces. Of these, 26pc relate to Nati­onal Assembly seats and 42pc to provincial assembly seats.
Of the 24 petitions decided, 21 were from Punjab, two from Baloc­histan, and one from Sindh. In Punjab, two tribunals in Lahore decided eight cases, one in Rawa­lpindi decided seven, and one in Bahawalpur decided six.
The two tribunals in Quetta disposed of one case each, while a tribunal in Karachi disposed of only one case. No petitions from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were decided during this period.
 
 

Despite an increase in the number of petitions decided in Punjab compared to previous months, the overall pace of decisions has slowed, Fafen said.
This may be because four tribunals remained largely dysfunctional during the reporting period, including two in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one in Punjab, and the sole tribunal of the Islamabad Capital Territory.
To date, Balochistan’s three election tribunals have collectively decided 43 (83pc) of the total 51 petitions filed for national and provincial constituencies in the province. Punjab’s eight tribunals have decided 66 (34pc) of 192 petitions. Sindh’s five tribunals have decided 18 (22pc) of 83 petitions. KP’s six tribunals have decided nine (21pc) of 42 petitions.
Of the 136 petitions decided so far, 133 were dismissed and three were accepted. Among the 133 dismissals, 52 were dismissed on non-maintainability grounds, including 10 related to National Assembly constituencies and 42 to provincial assembly constituencies.
Petitioners
The independent candidates supported by PTI make the largest group of petitioners, with 55pc of total petitions filed by them, followed by PML-N candidates (13pc), PPP candidates (8pc), unaffiliated independent candidates (7pc) and JUI-F candidates (6pc).
As many as 16 other party candidates cumulatively account for the remaining 11pc of the petitions.
Around 56pc petitions of independent candidates, 50pc of PPP candidates, 42pc each of PML-N and JUI-F candidates, and 58pc of those by other parties have been decided so far.
The returned candidates belonging to PML-N make the largest group of defendants with 39pc of the petitions challenging their victory, followed by PTI-backed candidates (16pc), MQM-P candidates and PPP candidates (13pc each), unaffiliated independents (6pc), and JUI-F (5pc).
As many as 11 other defendant parties’ candidates cumulatively acc­o­unt for the remaining 8pc petitions.
Around 58pc petitions filed against unaffiliated independents, 45pc against PTI-backed independents, 39pc against JUI-P candidates, 36pc each against PML-N and PPP candidates, 27pc against MQM-P candidates, and 21pc against other parties’ candidates have been decided so far.
Appeals
According to the Fafen report, 54 decisions of election tribunals have been contested before the Supreme Court. Among these, three appeals were initiated by the winning candidates against whom election petitions were accepted.
Additionally, 51 appeals have been filed against the rejection of election petitions by respective election tribunals. Among these, four have been heard and dismissed by the Supreme Court. The remaining 47 appeals are still under adjudication.
Of the 51 petitions filed against the dismissal of election petitions, 11 were lodged by losing candidates of the National Assembly elections. Similarly, 40 were submitted by losing candidates of provincial assembly elections, including 24 from Balochistan, 12 from Punjab, and four from Sindh.
Among the 51 appeals filed against the rejection of election petitions, 22 have been filed by PTI-backed independent candidates, six by PPPP candidates, five by the PML-N candidates, four by JUIP candidates, three by independent candidates, and two each by the National Party, Awami National Party, and Jamhoori Watan Party candidates.
Similarly, one petition each was filed by candidates from the Hazara Democratic Party, Balochistan National Party, Balochistan National Party Awami, Khadameen-i-Sindh, and Balochistan Awami Party candidates.
In terms of the respondents, 25 appeals were filed against the winners of PML-N, six against PPP, five against independent candidates backed by the PTI, four each against the MQM-P, JUI-F, and unaffiliated independent candidates, two against National Party, and one against the winner belonging to Balochistan Awami Party.

“It needs to happen soon,” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’. “We cannot continue to dedicate time and resources to this effort if it’s not going to come to fruition.”
Rubio said the US would consider in the coming week whether to continue mediating talks “or if it’s time to sort of focus on some other issues”.
Trump and Zelensky, in Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, met in a Vatican basilica on Saturday to try to revive faltering efforts to end Russia’s war with Ukraine.
 


The meeting was the first between the two leaders since an angry encounter in the Oval Office in Washington in February and comes at a critical time in negotiations aimed at bringing an end to the conflict.
In a Truth Social post later on Saturday, Trump rebuked Russian President Vladimir Putin over recent attacks on Ukraine, saying “there was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days.”
In a pre-taped interview that aired on CBS News programme ‘Face the Nation’ on Sunday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would continue to target sites used by Ukraine’s military.
When asked about a Russian strike on Kyiv last week that killed civilians, Lavrov said “the target attacked was not something absolutely civilian” and that Russia only targets “sites which are used by the military”.
 


Zelensky wrote on the messaging app Telegram that his top military commander had reported that Russia had already conducted nearly 70 attacks on Sunday.
“The situation at the front and the real activity of the Russian army prove that there is currently insufficient pressure on Russia from the world to end this war, he said.
Differing proposals
Ukrainian and European officials pushed back last week against some US proposals on how to end Russia’s war in Ukraine, making counterproposals on issues from territory to sanctions, Reuters reported on Friday.
The primary areas of difference in the two proposals were over the sequencing for resolving questions over territory, the lifting of sanctions on Russia, security guarantees and the size of Ukraine’s military.
American proposals called for US recognition of Russia’s control over Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula Moscow seized and annexed in 2014, as well as de facto recognition of Russia’s hold on other parts of Ukraine.
In contrast, the European and Ukrainian proposal defers detailed discussion about territory until after a ceasefire is concluded.
German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said on Sunday that Ukraine should not agree to the US proposal, saying it went too far in ceding swathes of territory in return for a ceasefire.
Despite the divergent views, Trump’s national security adviser on Sunday said the meeting with Zelensky showed his determination to reach a deal.
“That meeting is going to go down in the history books for President Trump, to be a president of peace,” National Security Adviser Mike Waltz told Fox News’ ‘Sunday Morning Futures’.
Waltz said Trump has “expressed his frustration” at the leaders of both nations but remained determined to help negotiate an agreement. He also said the US and Ukraine would eventually reach an agreement over rare earth minerals and that talks continued over the weekend.
 


Democrats in the US Congress have criticised Trump’s approach to the conflict and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday that he was concerned Trump would “cave in to Putin”.
“To just abandon Ukraine, after all the sacrifice that they made, after so much loss of life, and with the rallying of the whole West against Putin, it would just be a moral tragedy,” Schumer said on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’.
Schumer said siding with Russia in the conflict would tear apart alliances with Europe and embolden dictators around the world.</p><small>2025-04-27 18:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/27211947ef83268.jpg?r=212015' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906915/iran-port-blast-death-toll-rises-to-40-as-fires-continue-blazing' target='_blank'><strong>Iran port blast death toll rises to 40 as fires continue blazing</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from a powerful explosion at Iran’s biggest port of Bandar Abbas has risen to at least 40, with more than 1,200 people injured, state media reported on Sunday, as firefighters worked to fully extinguish the fire.
The blast occurred on Saturday at Shahid Rajaee Port in southern Iran, near the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world’s oil output passes.
The port’s customs office said in a statement carried by state television that the explosion probably resulted from a fire that broke out at the hazardous and chemical materials storage depot. A regional emergency official said several containers had exploded.
The New York Times quoted a person with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, as saying that what exploded was sodium perchlorate — a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles.
However, Iran’s defence ministry denied media reports that the blast may be linked to the mishandling of solid fuel used for missiles. A spokesperson for the ministry told state TV the reports were “aligned with enemy psyops”, saying that the blast-hit area did not contain any military cargo.
Earlier, Red Crescent chief Pirhossein Koolivand, in a video shared on the government’s official website, gave on Sunday an updated toll of 28 people killed and more than 1,000 injured.
Live footage on Sunday showed thick black smoke still visible at the scene. “The fire is under control but still not out,” a state TV correspondent reported from the site around 20 hours after the blast.
The explosion was so powerful that it was felt and heard about 50 kilometres away, the Fars news agency reported.
Speaking on Sunday at the scene, Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni said that “the situation has stabilised in the main areas” of the port.
He told state TV that workers had resumed loading containers and customs clearance.
Images from Iranian news agency IRNA on Saturday showed rescuers and survivors walking along a wide boulevard carpeted with debris after the blast at Shahid Rajaee, more than 1,000km south of Tehran.
Flames could be seen engulfing a truck trailer and blood stained the side of a crushed car, while a helicopter dropped water on massive black smoke clouds billowing from behind stacked shipping containers.
“The shockwave was so strong that most of the port buildings were severely damaged,” Tasnim news agency reported.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered a thorough investigation to find the causes of the blast.
“Security and judicial officials are obliged to thoroughly investigate, uncover any negligence or intent, and follow up in accordance with regulations,” Khamenei said in a message carried by state television.
Mourning
Citing local emergency services, state TV reported that hundreds of casualties “have been transferred to nearby medical centres”, while the provincial blood transfusion centre issued a call for donations.
Saturday is the start of the working week in Iran, meaning the port would have been busy with employees.
Three Chinese nationals were “lightly injured”, China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported, citing its Bandar Abbas consulate.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed sympathy for the victims of the deadly blast, adding he had “issued an order to investigate the situation and the causes”.
State TV reported, “The president is heading to the region to review the latest situation regarding the explosion at Shahid Rajaee Port in Bandar Abbas.”
The United Arab Emirates expressed “solidarity with Iran” over the explosion and Saudi Arabia sent condolences.
With choking smoke and air pollution spreading throughout the area, all schools and offices in Bandar Abbas, the nearby capital of Hormozgan province, have been ordered closed on Sunday to allow authorities to focus on the emergency effort, state TV said.
The health ministry urged residents to avoid going outside “until further notice” and to use protective masks.
Authorities declared three days of public mourning across the province.
The state-owned National Iranian Oil Products Distribution Company said in a statement carried by local media that the explosion “has no connection” to its facilities, reporting no interruption to its work in Bandar Abbas.
The explosion came as Iranian and US delegations met in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, with both sides reporting progress.
While Iranian authorities so far appear to be treating the blast as an accident, it also comes against the backdrop of years of shadow war with regional foe Israel.
According to The Washington Post, Israel in 2020 launched a cyberattack targeting the Shahid Rajaee Port.
Putin orders Russian emergency planes to Iran
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered several planes to be sent to Iran to help deal with the aftermath of a blast at Iran’s port of Bandar Abbas, Russia’s emergency ministry said.
Putin has expressed his condolences over the loss of life and offered to provide help to Iran dealing with the aftermath of a blast, the Kremlin said. It said Putin had conveyed “words of sincere sympathy and support to the families of the victims, as well as his wishes for a recovery to all those injured.”
The emergency ministry said a Beriev Be-200 amphibious aircraft specialising in firefighting, as well as an Ilyushin Il-76 military transport plane, would be sent to Iran to help out.

Needing only a point to ensure a record-equalling 20th English title with four games remaining, Liverpool were rocked in the 12th minute as Dominic Solanke headed Tottenham in front.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

But the title party was only temporarily silenced as Liverpool struck back with a Luis Diaz tap-in, an Alexis Mac Allister thunderbolt and a Cody Gakpo shot before halftime.
A one-sided second half saw Mohamed Salah end a six-match scoring drought by firing a low shot past Guglielmo Vicario in the 63rd minute — celebrating his 28th league goal of an outstanding season by snapping a selfie with a fan.
Tottenham’s Destiny Udogie then bundled in an own goal to complete a miserable afternoon for the visitors, who have lost 19 Premier League games this season.
Liverpool, who have now matched Manchester United’s English titles record, have 82 points from 34 games played, with Arsenal a distant second on 67.
Dutchman Arne Slot is only the fifth manager to win the Premier League title in his debut season in English soccer and while it was a formality before kickoff on Sunday, there was still the small matter of Liverpool ensuring the cake was iced in front of their own adoring fans.
Five years ago, when Juergen Klopp’s Liverpool ended a 30-year wait for a 19th title, the Covid pandemic meant an anti-climactic finale inside an empty stadium. Sunday more than made up for that as the fans went through their choir book of club anthems.</p><small>2025-04-27 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2715362518d5198.png?r=153823' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906924/8-wounded-as-police-protesters-clash-near-karachis-gulshan-i-hadeed-over-canals-project' target='_blank'><strong>8 wounded as police, protesters clash near Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed over canals project</strong></a><br><p>Eight people, including two policemen and a lawyer, were injured and a police vehicle was torched in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed area on Sunday when police clashed with members of the legal fraternity during an attempt to end their five-day sit-in against the canals project, according to officials and witnesses.
Earlier this week, the government halted the controversial Cholistan canals project, which was inaugurated in February by Army Chief Gen Asim Munir and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. The decision came after months of protests, a unanimous Sindh Assembly resolution against the project, and concerns over India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. The government said work on the canals would remain on hold until a consensus is reached in the Council of Common Interests.
Despite the announcement, protests against the issue continued across several towns in Sindh on Saturday, alongside a strike called by Jamaat-i-Islami. Lawyers staged a sit-in at Babarloi in Khairpur district, and the demonstration in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed entered its fifth day today.
Karachi East-Zone DIG Usman Ghani told Dawn.com, “The police were removing tents blocking the main road in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Hadeed for the past five days when they came under attack by a lawyer, injuring a policeman, who in retaliation also injured the attacker.”
He added that the police “dislodged the tents from the road and registered an FIR (first information report) against the violent members of the crowd”.
DIG Ghani continued that the police and Rangers deployed at the site later came under stone pelting and baton charges by a mob, allegedly incited by members of the legal community, calling it “very unfortunate” behaviour from those expected to uphold the law.
He further recalled that three days ago, a sub-inspector of the investigation police was also attacked by members of the lawyers’ community while he was attending court. “The police have shown utmost restraint to avoid any untoward situation,” said the senior officer.
The DIG, however, emphasised that “given the current domestic and international cross-border terrorism and war threats, this repeated lawlessness by a community well-versed and sworn to uphold the law is unacceptable.”
He vowed, “It will be dealt with legally according to the emerging situation to uphold law and order and public safety. Law will take its own course.”
In response to a question, DIG Ghani confirmed that six protesters had been detained but were injured, so “we sent them to a hospital.” He clarified that no one was in police custody, but an FIR was being registered against them.
Meanwhile, Steel Town Police Station House Officer, Allan Khan Abbasi, told Dawn.com, “One policeman was injured in the morning while another was injured in the afternoon.”
“A police mobile was torched by the mob,” he added.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Khan told Dawn.com that when riot police attempted to disperse the protesters, they set the police mobile alight.
“It was completely destroyed by the time firefighters reached the scene,” Hassan said. “The remains of the torched vehicle were also destroyed by the mob.”
The rescue official added that no shops were set on fire, but rescue teams were informed that shops and other businesses in adjoining areas were forcibly closed.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar issued a statement today urging lawyers to protest peacefully.
“The Sindh government recognises the people’s right to peaceful protest, but the lawyers should keep an eye on miscreants around them,” he was quoted as saying.
The home minister assured that no action would be taken against people protesting peacefully and urged people to ignore “rumours”.
“I request that lawyers not cause problems for citizens,” he added. “Given the national situation and circumstances, we must promote unity.”
Meanwhile, a political worker, who wished to remain anonymous, told Dawn.com that early in the morning, when only a few protesters had gathered on a road linking the National Highway with the Superhighway near Gulshan-i-Hadeed, the police took action, resulting in injuries to one lawyer and the detention of several other protesters.
“The police removed the tents set up for the sit-in and cleared the road for traffic. However, lawyers and political workers mobilised their supporters through social media, urging them to join the protest,” he said.
The activist added that a few hundred people arrived and attacked the police with stones, damaging their vehicles.
“Over two hundred protesters later resumed the sit-in, blocking the link road again,” he said.
SHO Abbasi also confirmed that the protestors staged another sit-in on the link road in the evening.
The anonymous activist said that some lawyers visited Steel Town police station and met with Malir SSP Kashif Abbasi to “pacify” the situation.
“SSP Malir informed the lawyers that police had not taken action against the sit-in for the last five days,” the activist said. “But now, it was the government’s policy to vacate the highways and roads.”
Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) Secretary-General Dr Safdar Ali Abbasi,
in a statement, condemned the police crackdown on “peaceful protest sit-ins against the construction of canals and illegal land allotments in various cities of Sindh, which resulted in injuries and arrests of dozens, including lawyers”.
“Police action on peaceful protests by the Sindh government has revived the memories of dictatorial rule,” the statement quoted him as saying. “The protest movement ongoing in Sindh for the past eight months had remained peaceful.”
He claimed that there had neither been any damage across Sindh, nor stone pelting. “Not even a single vehicle window had been broken during the protests,” he added.
“The PPP is trying unsuccessfully to crush the peaceful movement through police brutality,” he said, urging the rulers to come to their senses and warning that such tactics would not suppress the ongoing movement.
Dr Abbasi vowed that peaceful protests in Sindh would continue.
“We demand the immediate release of all detainees. The legal fraternity is not alone and the people of Sindh stand with them.”</p><small>2025-04-27 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602099-pakistan-slams-india-for-seeking-hydro-war-on-pretext-of-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan slams India for seeking hydro war on pretext of Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>

According to The Express Tribune, the high commission was vandalised by a group of Indian protesters who threw saffron-coloured paint on the building’s exterior and smashed windows.  It said that hundreds of Indian protesters were gathered outside the Pakistani mission, while two individuals were arrested for their alleged involvement in the attack.
Addressing a press briefing for international media outlets about the Pahalgam incident in Islamabad today, Tarar accused India of using its “extremist ideology” to encourage people to attack Pakistan’s foreign missions.
“A very unfortunate incident took place in London, our high commission was attacked twice, and stones were thrown,” Tarar said. “The people who are responsible are being sponsored by Indian agencies and the Indian state.”
The minister said that suspects had been arrested by London’s Metropolitan Police, but highlighted that the incident was a product of the “kind of mindset that the Indian state has”.
He did not specify how many people had been arrested or give any further details about the attack.
“If you can kill people internationally in Canada and the US, then nothing will stop you from attacking a few foreign missions,” he said, referring to transnational assassinations of Sikh leaders.
 


During the briefing, Tarar highlighted weaknesses in India’s account of the Pahalgam attack, adding that they “jumped to conclusions” about Pakistan’s involvement.
“This Pahalgam episode to me seems like a distraction,” Tarar said, adding that Pakistan was seeing success against terrorists. “Pahalgam is more than 150 kilometres away from the Line of Control.
“Do you have credible evidence? Do you have any argument that is substantiated by proof?” he asked. “Why is it that the first information report … was registered in the Pahalgam police station within 10 minutes of the incident?”
Tarar explained that for an FIR to be lodged, officials must visit the area, collect evidence, conduct a complete scan of the scene, carry out forensic analysis, and account for the usual time lag between the occurrence and the registration of the report.
“Why is it that right after 10 minutes an FIR is registered and the blame is put on Pakistan?” he asked. “The reason that we have called for an independent, impartial and transparent inquiry is because our hands are clean. I think our eastern neighbour was quick to jump to conclusions.”
The minister echoed allegations by other Pakistani leaders that India was funding terrorist activities within Pakistan.
“Why was there hesitation on the part of our eastern neighbour to issue a simple statement of condemnation condemning the episode?” he asked, speaking about the attack on the Jaffar Express last month.
“Why is it that whenever we face terrorism and we counter terrorists and blood is spilt … why is it that the eastern neighbour always celebrates?
“There is a reason behind that … India is involved in state-sponsored terrorism.
“Had we not apprehended Kulbushan Jadhav, had we not obtained incriminating and irrefutable evidence against him, I would not have been making this argument today,” he said, referring to the Indian spy caught in Pakistan in 2016.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and is one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000. Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).
 
 

Following the attack, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
India has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan strongly denied any involvement.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said Pakistan was open to any “neutral and transparent” investigation into the Pahalgam attack, criticising India for continuing with a “pattern of exploitation, levelling baseless allegations and false accusations without credible investigation or verifiable evidence”.
“Our valiant armed forces remain fully capable and prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and its territorial integrity against any misadventures, as clearly demonstrated by our measured yet resolute response to India’s reckless incursion in February 2019,” he added, referring to ‘Operation Swift Retort’.</p><small>2025-04-27 15:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/272048302b393dc.jpg?r=205310' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906943/napoleon-letter-denying-he-ordered-pope-kidnapping-sold-at-auction' target='_blank'><strong>Napoleon letter denying he ordered pope kidnapping sold at auction</strong></a><br><p>A hand-written letter from Napoleon denying his role in the kidnapping of Pope Pius VII in 1809 was sold at auction on Sunday outside Paris for €26,360 ($30,000), the auctioneer said.
The letter, signed “Napole”, went on sale the day after the funeral of Pope Francis, who died on Monday. The sale price exceeded the estimate of €12,000-€15,000, according to the Osenat auction house.
The auction’s location in Fontainebleau, south of Paris, was highly symbolic as the town was where the head of the Catholic Church was imprisoned after being initially held in Savona in Italy.
“This arrest is one of the events that will define Napoleon’s reign, at a political and religious level,” Jean-Christophe Chataignier, an expert in the Napoleonic era at Osenat, told AFP. “Napoleon knows this letter will be made public and that it’s intended for authorities everywhere,” he added.
French forces kidnapped Pope Pius VII in his private apartments in the Quirinal Palace in Rome. He remained a prisoner of Napoleon for five years.
The pontiff had sought to maintain the Vatican’s sway over the French Catholic Church and resisted Napoleon’s desire to exert control over the clergy.
‘Against my will’
In the letter addressed to French nobleman and ally Jean-Jacques-Regis de Cambaceres, Napoleon feigns ignorance of Pius VII’s detention.
“It was without my orders and against my will that the pope was taken out of Rome; it is again without my orders and against my will that he is being brought into France,” he wrote.
“But I was only informed of this 10 or 12 days after it had already been carried out. From the moment I learn that the pope is staying in a fixed location, and that my intentions can be made known in time and carried out, I will consider what measures I must take,” he added.
Napoleon memorabilia regularly comes up for sale at auction in a flourishing trade marked by intense interest from collectors.
Two pistols that he once intended to use to kill himself were sold in France last July for €1.7 million, while one of his trademark ‘bicorne’ hats set a record price for his possessions when it was acquired for €1.9 million in November 2023.
A sword that belonged to Napoleon and was specially ordered for the personal use of the French emperor is to be auctioned in Paris next month, with an estimated price of €700,000 to €1 million.</p><small>2025-04-27 15:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/27181146f025f21.jpg?r=181709' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906939/54-terrorists-killed-as-infiltration-attempt-thwarted-in-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>54 terrorists killed as infiltration attempt thwarted in KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), this is the highest-ever number of khwarij killed by security forces in a single engagement throughout the campaign against terrorism.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
“On night 25/26 and 26/27 April 2025, [the] movement of a large group of khwarij, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was detected by the security forces in [the] general area [of] Hassan Khel, North Waziristan District.
“[Our] own troops effectively engaged and thwarted their attempt to infiltrate. As a result of precise and skilful engagement, all fifty-four khawarij have been sent to hell,” the statement added.
The ISPR added that a large cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was also recovered from the slain khawarij, a term the state uses to refer to terrorists.
“Intelligence reports indicate that this group of khawarij was specifically infiltrating on [the] behest of their ‘foreign masters’ to undertake high-profile terrorist activities inside Pakistan”, the ISPR statement read.
Referring to India’s “baseless accusations against Pakistan”, it added that such actions by Fitna al Khwarij — a term the state uses to refer to the banned TTP — “clearly implies on whose cues FAK (Fitna al Khwarij) is operating”.
“Such actions amount to treason and betrayal against the state and its citizens,” said the press release.
Mentioning the National Security Council meeting that took place earlier this week to discuss a response to India downgrading diplomatic ties with Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, the ISPR highlighted how “distracting Pakistan’s security forces from their focus on the war against terror seems to be the strategic intent of India to allow a breathing space to FAK which is reeling from the onslaught of our Armed Forces resolute offensive against them”.
The ISPR commended “the exceptional professionalism, vigilance, [and] preparedness” demonstrated by security forces in preventing a “potential catastrophe”.
It asserted that the security forces of Pakistan “remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and to eradicate the menace of terrorism.”
“Such bold and decisive actions further strengthen our collective resolve and underscore that Pakistan is winning the war against terrorism while achieving significant successes against terrorists”, the press release said.
On Saturday, the ISPR said that two soldiers were martyred and 15 terrorists killed in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
A statement said the intelligence-based operations (IBO) were conducted on Friday and Saturday, and that eight terrorists were “sent to hell” after troops engaged them at their location during an IBO in Karak district.
Four more were killed by the security forces in another IBO in North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing stated. It added that troops “successfully neutralised” three more terrorists in another encounter in the South Waziristan district’s general area of Gomal Zam.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, two brave sons of soil, Lance Naik Usman Mohmand (age: 28 years, resident of Charsadda district) and Sepoy Imran Khan (age: 26 years, resident of Kurram district) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced martyrdom,” the ISPR said.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-04-27 13:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/27114355c9dcd24.jpg?r=115757' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906917/9-people-dead-multiple-injured-in-vancouver-after-vehicle-plows-into-filipino-festival' target='_blank'><strong>9 people dead, multiple injured in Vancouver after vehicle plows into Filipino festival</strong></a><br><p>Nine people were killed when a driver plowed into a crowd at a Filipino cultural celebration in Vancouver, police in the Canadian city said on Sunday.
“As of now, we can confirm nine people have died after a man drove through a crowd at last night’s Lapu Lapu Festival,” the police said on X.
 






A 30-year-old local man was arrested at the scene, Vancouver police posted on X. The driver was a “lone suspect” known to police, a police spokesperson told journalists at the scene.
“At this time, we are confident that this incident was not an act of terrorism,” Vancouver police said on X early on Sunday morning.
Footage posted online and verified by AFP shows a black SUV with a damaged hood parked on a street littered with debris, meters from first aiders tending to people lying on the ground.
Eyewitness Dale Selipe told the Vancouver Sun that she saw injured children on the street after the vehicle rammed into the crowd.
“There was a lady with her eyes staring up, one of her legs was already broken. One person was holding her hand trying to comfort her,” Selipe told the newspaper.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was “devastated” by the “horrific events.”
“I offer my deepest condolences to the loved ones of those killed and injured, to the Filipino Canadian community, and to everyone in Vancouver,” he wrote on X.
“We are all mourning with you.”
 






Britain’s King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla were “profoundly saddened” by the incident in Vancouver.
“Our hearts and prayers go out to all those whose lives have been shattered by such a desperate tragedy and we send our deepest possible sympathy at a most agonising time for so many in Canada,” the monarch, who is also head of state in Canada, said in a statement.
The incident happened as members of the Filipino community gathered to celebrate Lapu Lapu Day, Vancouver mayor Ken Sim posted on X.
The festival, which commemorates a Filipino anti-colonial leader from the 16th century, falls this year on the weekend before Canada’s election.
“Our thoughts are with all those affected and with Vancouver’s Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time,” Sim wrote.
 






Police said the incident happened shortly after 8:00 pm on Saturday (8am PKT, Sunday) in the city’s Sunset on Fraser neighborhood.
The Philippine consulate in Vancouver said in a Facebook statement it “expresses its deep concern and sympathies to the victims of the horrific incident.”
Photos published by Canadian broadcaster CBC showed emergency crews at the scene as well as large crowds at the block party earlier on Saturday.
Festival security guard Jen Idaba-Castaneto told local news site Vancouver Is Awesome that she saw “bodies everywhere”.
“You don’t know who to help, here or there. It’s so shocking,” she said.
British Columbia Premier David Eby said he was “shocked & heartbroken” by the news in a post on X.
 






Election season
Saturday’s event featured a parade, a film screening, dancing and a concert, with two members of the Black Eyed Peas featured on the lineup published by the organisers.
“Our thoughts are with the victims and their families — and Vancouver’s Filipino community,” Jagmeet Singh, leader of the left-wing New Democratic Party said on X.
 






Lapu Lapu Day is celebrated in the Philippines in remembrance of indigenous chief Lapulapu, who led his men to defeat Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in battle in 1521.
The deadly incident comes a year after Canadian Nathaniel Veltman was sentenced to life in prison for running down a Muslim family with his truck on the street in London, Ontario in 2021.
The ruling in Veltman’s case was the first in Canada to make a link between white supremacy and terrorism in a murder case.
Canadians go to the polls on Monday after a frenetic election race where candidates have wooed voters on issues including US President Donald Trump’s tariffs and rising living costs.
Sunday is the final day for Carney and Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre to make their pitches to voters. Carney delayed election campaigning on Sunday after the incident took place.
Prime Minister Mark Carney is favoured to win after assuring voters he can stand up to Washington’s barrage of sweeping tariffs.
His Liberal Party trailed the Conservatives by more than 20 points in most polls on January 6, the day former prime minister Justin Trudeau announced his plans to resign.</p><small>2025-04-27 13:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602068-pakistan-india-standoff-islamabad-beijing-oppose-unilateralism-hegemonic-policies' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-India standoff: Islamabad, Beijing oppose ‘unilateralism, hegemonic policies'</strong></a><br><p>

While Pakistan has made efforts to exploit its natural resources and has invited foreign investment in different projects, the security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa often poses challenges, with foreign nationals being attacked over the past couple of years.
According to the press release, the interior minister met with a delegation of foreign investors in Lahore and discussed steps to ensure their security, noting the delegation’s input and assuring them that steps would be taken.
“Pakistan is a safe country for all kinds of investments,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. “The protection of investors is our government’s top priority and we will fulfil our responsibility of protecting investors at all costs.”
The press release quoted Naqvi as saying that the government had taken steps to ensure the security of investors and has taken “strict action” against violent miscreants.
“Action is being taken against these miscreants according to the law,” Naqvi emphasised. “A strategy has been formed to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.”
The press release did not refer to any incident in particular.
Earlier this month, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir assured that the military would ensure a robust security framework and proactive measures to protect the interests and confidence of Pakistan’s partners and investors in Balochistan.
He made this assurance while addressing the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025, a two-day event to promote mining and mineral investment opportunities across the four provinces, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
“I firmly believe that Pakistan is poised to emerge as a leader in the global mineral economy,” the army chief said, according to PTV News.
He added that the army welcomed international institutions to share their expertise with Pakistan, explore investment opportunities and partner with the country in developing its vast resource potential.
In November last year, a suicide attack near Karachi’s airport, claimed by the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, left two Chinese citizens dead and injured ten others.
Separately, at least 20 miners were killed and seven were injured in an attack by armed men on a private coal mine in Balochistan’s Duki area in October.
In March 2024, Chinese workers were targeted in Besham, reportedly carried out by affiliates of either Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), resulting in five Chinese fatalities.
Five Japanese nationals were unhurt after their vehicle was targeted by a suicide bomber in Karachi in April last year.
At least four people, including three Chinese nationals, were killed while four others were injured in a suicide attack outside the University of Karachi’s (KU) Confucius Institute in 2022.
In January 2021, 11 coal miners belonging to the Shia Hazara community sleeping in their room were held at gunpoint, blindfolded and trussed up before being executed by unidentified attackers in the Mach coal field area. The militant Islamic State group had claimed responsibility for the killing.</p><small>2025-04-27 12:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/271154414a3df1a.jpg?r=115521' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906916/pm-shehbaz-welcomes-irans-willingness-to-help-ease-pakistan-india-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz welcomes Iran’s willingness to help ease Pakistan-India tensions</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had a telephonic conversation on Saturday evening, during which the former welcomed Iran’s readiness to help de-escalate tensions between Pakistan and India, Tehran’s state-run IRNA reported.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and is one the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000. Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
India has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan strongly denied any involvement.
According to the report, PM Shehbaz reiterated his official invitation to the Iranian president and welcomed Iran’s readiness to help ease tensions.
The premier also emphasised that Pakistan sought peace in the region and that if Iran wishes to play a role in this regard, Islamabad would welcome it.
“Pakistan condemns all forms of terrorism and has no connection to the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam, located in the India-held Kashmir region,” the statement read.
Moreover, the prime minister also repeated that Pakistan is ready to “participate in a transparent and unbiased investigation into the terrorist attack”, saying that the country has been one of the greatest victims of terrorism over the past two decades, with thousands of its citizens losing their lives and the government spending billions of dollars to combat this menace.
Regarding India’s decision on the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, he said that weaponising water was “unacceptable and that Islamabad will defend itself at any cost”.
The agency also reported the prime minister “expressed solidarity with the Iranian government and people following the powerful explosion at Shahid Rajaee port, saying Islamabad is ready to assist Tehran in addressing this incident”.
Iran’s President Pezeshkian, for his part, thanked the premier “for his solidarity regarding the incident at Shahid Rajaee port” and praised Pakistan’s efforts for “peace in the region”.
“The Iranian president invited the Pakistani prime minister to visit Tehran, and in return, Sharif renewed his invitation to Pezeshkian to visit Islamabad,” the report read.
Dar appreciates China’s support
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Sunday spoke with his Chinese counterpart and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Wang Yi, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.
Briefing the Chinese minister on the current regional situation, Dar “categorically rejected India’s unilateral and illegal actions, as well as its baseless propaganda against Pakistan”.
Expressing deep appreciation for China’s consistent and unwavering support, Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s “strong commitment to the iron-clad  friendship” between the two countries and the “shared vision of an all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.
“He emphasised Pakistan’s determination to further deepen bilateral cooperation across all spheres,” the statement read.
It added that both sides “reiterated their firm resolve to uphold regional peace and stability, promote mutual respect and understanding, and jointly oppose unilateralism and hegemonic policies”.
“They agreed to maintain close communication and coordination at all levels to advance their shared objectives of peace, security, and sustainable development in the region and beyond.”
‘Farmers ready to stand at the border’
Pakistan Kissan Ittehad President Khalid Mahmood Khokhar reaffirmed support for the country’s armed forces saying that farmers are ready to stand at the border if needed, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Addressing a press conference today, Khokhar said, “The civil society and farmers across the country stand united with the armed forces and are ready to give a befitting reply to Indian aggression.”
Vowing to defend Pakistan at all costs, he was quoted as saying, “Every farmer is a soldier. We are ready to fight with our sickles and weapons for our country.”
He warned that farmers will “demolish” Indian dams in case New Delhi tried to block Pakistan’s water.</p><small>2025-04-27 11:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/271542232af29b3.jpg?r=154234' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1906927/44-magnitude-earthquake-hits-kps-swat-surrounding-areas' target='_blank'><strong>4.4-magnitude earthquake hits KP’s Swat, surrounding areas</strong></a><br><p>A 4.4-magnitude earthquake struck Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat and its adjoining localities on Sunday afternoon, sending tremors across the area.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — according to geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.
Today, a 4.4-magnitude earthquake jolted Swat and adjoining areas with a depth of 185 kilometres and epicentre in Hindukush, a private news channel reported, citing the National Seismic Monitoring Centre.
People came out of their homes in panic and started reciting verses from the Holy Quran.
No loss of life or property was reported from any part of Swat, according to the report.
On April 19, tremors were felt in parts of KP and Punjab — including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore — for the second time in as many weeks as a 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border region.
Pakistan witnessed around 20 low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.
However, experts have pointed out that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.
In the Himalayan region, major seismic activity takes place on a roughly 100-year cycle, experts have said.
The last major seismic events in the region were the earthquakes of 2005 and 2015.</p><small>2025-04-27 11:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602041-as-pakistan-india-tensions-soar-military-ill-preparedness-exposes-modis-challenge' target='_blank'><strong>As Pakistan-India tensions soar, military ill-preparedness exposes Modi's challenge</strong></a><br><p>

Alongside world leaders and reigning monarchs, an estimated 400,000 people turned out on Saturday for the Argentine pontiff’s funeral at the Vatican and burial in Rome.
The crowds were a testament to the popularity of Francis, an energetic reformer who championed the poorest and most vulnerable.
Many of those mourning the late pope, who died on Monday aged 88, expressed anxiety about who would succeed him.
“He ended up transforming the Church into something more normal, more human,” said Romina Cacciatore, 48, an Argentinian translator living in Italy.
 


“I’m worried about what’s coming.”
On Monday morning, at 9:00am (0700 GMT), cardinals will hold their fifth general meeting since the pope’s death, at which they are expected to pick a date for the conclave.
Held behind locked doors in the frescoed Sistine Chapel, the election of a pope has been a subject of public fascination for centuries.
Cardinal-electors will cast four votes per day until one candidate secures a two-thirds majority, a result broadcast to the waiting world by burning papers that emit white smoke.
Luxembourg Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich said last week he expected the conclave to take place on May 5 or 6 — shortly after the nine days of papal mourning, which ends on May 4.
German Cardinal Reinhard Marx told reporters on Saturday the conclave would last just “a few days”.
Left his mark
Francis’s funeral was held in St Peter’s Square in bright spring sunshine, a mix of solemn ceremony and an outpouring of emotion for the Church’s first Latin American pope.
More crowds gathered on Sunday for the opening for public viewing of his simple marble tomb at the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, his favourite church in Rome.
Francis was buried in an alcove of the church, becoming the first pope in more than a century to be interred outside the Vatican.
“It was very emotional” to see his tomb, said 49-year-old Peruvian Tatiana Alva, who wiped away tears after joining hundreds of others filing past the burial place.
“He was very kind, humble. He used language young people could understand. I don’t think the next pope can be the same but I hope he will have an open mind and be realistic about the challenges in the world right now.”
 
 

A couple of hours after opening, the large basilica was packed, the crowds periodically shushed over speakers.
Among the mourners were pilgrims and Catholic youth groups who had planned to attend the Sunday canonisation of Carlo Acutis, which was postponed after Francis died.
Raphael De Mas Latrie, 45, from France, had been bringing his nine-year-old son to the canonisation but they attended the funeral instead, saying they “really appreciated” Francis’s defence of the environment.
“Today in this material world his message made a lot of sense, particularly to young people,” he said.
He added that Francis’s successor did not have to be his likeness, for “every pope has a message for the world today”.
In his homily at the funeral, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re highlighted the Jesuit pope’s defence of migrants, relentless calls for peace and belief that the Church was a “home for all”.
“I hope we get another pope as skilled as Francis at speaking to people’s hearts, at being close to every person, no matter who they are,” 53-year-old Maria Simoni from Rome said.
Many of the mourners expressed hope that the next pope would follow Francis’s example, at a time of widespread global conflict and growing hard-right populism.
Marx said the debate over the next pope was open, adding: “It’s not a question of being conservative or progressive… The new pope must have a universal vision.”
Pray for ourselves
More than 220 of the Church’s 252 cardinals were at Saturday’s funeral. They will gather again on Sunday afternoon at Santa Maria Maggiore to pay their respects at Francis’s tomb.
There will also be a mass at St Peter’s Basilica at 10:30am (0830 GMT) on Sunday, led by Pietro Parolin, who was secretary of state under Francis and is a front-runner to become the next pope.
Only cardinals under the age of 80 are eligible to vote in the conclave. There are 135 currently eligible — most of whom Francis appointed himself.
But experts caution against assuming they will choose someone like him.
Francis, a former archbishop of Buenos Aires who loved being among his flock, was a very different character to his predecessor Benedict XVI, a German theologian better suited to books than kissing babies.
Benedict in turn was a marked change from his Polish predecessor, the charismatic, athletic and hugely popular John Paul II.
Francis’s changes triggered anger among many conservative Catholics and many of them are hoping the next pope will turn the focus back to doctrine.
Some cardinals have admitted the weight of the responsibility that faces them in choosing a new head of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics.
“We feel very small,” Hollerich said last week. “We have to make decisions for the whole Church, so we really need to pray for ourselves.”</p><small>2025-04-27 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602050-adnan-sami-fawad-chaudhry-engage-in-heated-clash-over-indian-citizenship' target='_blank'><strong>Adnan Sami, Fawad Chaudhry engage in heated clash over Indian citizenship</strong></a><br><p>

A formal expression of interest will be submitted to World Athletics in September, with the bid contingent on securing 45 million pounds ($59.91 million) in government support.
A feasibility study projects a record-breaking economic and social impact of over 400 million pounds, UK Athletics, Mayor Sadiq Khan and Athletic Ventures said in a statement on Sunday.
Athletic Ventures is a joint venture between UK Athletics (UKA), Great Run Company and London Marathon Events.
London followed up on the 2012 Olympics by hosting a successful world championships in 2017, with sell-out crowds for all the evening sessions at the Olympic Stadium.
“London 2017 showed the world what this city and this country can do,” said UKA President Denise Lewis, who was part of the team that secured the 2017 bid.
“It was an incredible example of how we can unite behind a vision full stadiums, global energy, and a lasting impact. I know we can do it again in 2029.”
Sunday’s London Marathon provided the springboard for the announcement, with 56,000 runners expected to take part.
The bid for 2029 is part of a wider vision to redefine the delivery of major international events in the UK, said Lewis, the Olympic heptathlon gold medallist in 2000 in Sydney.

Pakistan established its first DNA test laboratory in Islamabad in 2006 with the assistance of China to investigate complicated terrorism and criminal cases.
The Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) will collect DNA samples from all over the province including prisoners in jails as well as criminals, especially habitual ones.
The database aims to enhance the efficiency of the criminal justice system and “timely” identification of crime suspects, said the spokesperson.
In this regard, on the instructions of Punjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin, a working group of experts has been formed to suggest a model for setting up the central DNA database.
The group will be headed by PFSA Director General Dr Muhammad Amjad, while its others members include Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology Director Prof Dr Muaz-ur-Rehman, King Edward Medical University Head of Biomedical Sciences Prof Dr Nighat Yasmin, DIG Athar Waheed and PFSA Director (Administration) Mirza Waleed Baig.

As players and officials of the participating teams were eligible for free accommodation and meals during their stay for the event in Johor Bahru, then PHF president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar with his close relatives and friends — five persons — also went to Malaysia to witness the matches. But the organisers had not included them in the list of persons who had been invited.
A letter written on Feb 27, 2025, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was received at the PHF but addressed to the junior team’s manager, sought a deposit of 45,770 Malaysian ringgit ($10,349.35) for the hotel stay and meals.
When contacted, PHF secretary Rana Mujahid confirmed that the letter was received and added that the same had been forwarded to the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) citing all the expenditures of the said tour were borne by them.
Asked if the payment of $10,349.35 was not the bone of contention that denied Pakistan an invitation to participate in this year’s Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, Mujahid dispelled the impression saying that Azlan Shah Cup’s organisers and Johor Hockey Association were different identities.
“The Malaysian Hockey Federation has also not invited Japan this time, which has no case of default. In fact, Malaysians had sought higher-ranked teams this year and unfortunately [currently] Pakistan is not included among world’s top teams,” the PHF secretary said when contacted by Dawn.
According to a letter, then acting PHF secretary general Shahid Parvez Bhandara had requested the PSB to organise a camp for the Azlan Shah Cup and also demanded TA/DA, food and accommodation for the camp.
Meanwhile, it is learnt that Brig Khokhar during the 2023 event went to Malaysia with some family members and PHF officials. The visit was not compulsory, particularly if he was not invited.
“I don’t know if the PHF president was invited by the organisers but yes we received a letter and it was forwarded to the PSB,” the PHF secretary said.
 
 

It may be mentioned here that the PHF due to the country’s unprecedented decline in international hockey and corruption scandals from 2008 to 2022 is already facing severe criticism by several former Olympians and hockey lovers.
The Auditor General of Pakistan had included 113 paras as objections in its audit reports for the 2008-2022 period and the cases in this regard had been handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). However, it seems that the FIA for several years has been working at a snail’s pace in all cases.

According to the Met department’s data, Dadu was the hottest place in the country with 48°C — 8°C higher temperature than the city’s average temperature in Aprils.
The maximum temperature in Shaheed Benazirabad was 46°C, followed by Jacobabad, Paddidan, Khairpur and Larkana (45.5°C), Mohenjo Daro and Rohri (45°C), Sakrand, Sukkur, Mirpurkhas and Chhor (44.5°C), Mithi (44°C), Hyderabad (43°C), Tandojam (42.5°C), Badin (42°C) and Thatta (41°C).
 
 

The data also indicated that the cities are also experiencing warm nights — a significant deviation from their respective monthly average temperatures in previous Aprils.
The ongoing heatwave across the province compelled the provincial government to set up hundreds of relief camps equipped with cold drinking water, shaded resting areas, and first aid facilities.
Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah directed the authorities to ensuring immediate relief to citizens with special focus wasis being given to the needs of vulnerable groups, including senior citizens, children, and outdoor workers.
The health department has been directed to operationalise heatwave prevention centres at all hospitals across the province, ensuring the availability of necessary medical staff and supplies to handle heatstroke and heat exhaustion cases, a spokesperson for the CS said, adding: “The Rescue 1122 services, municipal authorities, and district health teams have been placed on high alert.”
In addition, the energy secretary has been tasked with ensuring uninterrupted power supply across Sindh.
“Public awareness campaigns have also been launched to sensitise the population about preventive measures, such as staying hydrated, limiting outdoor activities during peak heat hours, and recognising early signs of heat-related illnesses,” the spokesperson said.
Heatwave to persist till 30th: Met Office
In Karachi, hot and humid conditions prevailed, with the temperature reaching 39°C during the daytime. Parts of the city, such as the areas of Gulistan-i-Jauhar and Jinnah Terminal with 40°C, were relatively hotter than Bin Qasim Town (33.3°C) and Sharea Faisal (37.5°C).
The department has forecast the continuation of heatwave conditions till April 30.
“The daytime maximum temperature is likely to remain 6-8°C above normal in Dadu, Kambar, Shahdadkot, Shaheed Benazirabad, Jacobabad, Kashmore, Ghotki, Shikarpur, Khairpur, Naushahro Feroze, Larkana, Sukkur, Jamshoro, Matiari, Tando Mohammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad and Badin districts,” the department’s advisory says.
Similar weather conditions are likely to prevail in Tharparkar, Umerkot and Mirpurkhas districts with daytime temperature soaring to 4-6°C above normal, it adds.
In Karachi, the maximum temperature is expected to range from 36°C to 38°C, whereas relative humidity is likely to be 70-80 per cent and 45-55pc in the morning and evening hours, respectively.
In an attempt to provide relief to citizens, Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah has directed all divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners to take immediate action by establishing heatwave camps and initiating comprehensive precautionary measures to protect people from the effects of extreme heat.
According to a spokesperson for the chief secretary, 73 heatwave camps have been set up in Karachi.
Twenty each have been established in Shaheed Benazirabad and Naushahro Feroze while 24 and 19 camps have been set up in Nawabshah and Sanghar, respectively.
A total of 122 heatstroke wards are set up at healthcare facilities — including 45 in Nawabshah, eight in Naushahro Feroze and 69 in Sanghar.
In Sukkur division, 47 camps have been set up, including 12 in Sukkur, seven in Ghotki and 28 in Khairpur.

“Those who dare to attack the integrity of nuclear Pakistan will have to face consequences beyond their imagination,” president of the Pakistan Ex-servicemen Society (PESS) retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum said while talking to reporters at a book launch on Saturday.
He made it clear that Pakistan will not be intimidated by the hollow threats of India.
“In 1965 war, the Indian army, which wanted to occupy the city of Sialkot and have a gala at the Lahore Gymkhana Club, had to face humiliating defeat both at BRB link canal and in Chawinda tank battle,” he recalled.
“Pakistan Ex-servicemen Society like the entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces,” he declared.
Slamming India for attempts to malign Pakistan by unleashing a propaganda against it soon after the incident, he said it was clearly a false-flag operation.
He pointed out that the incident took place as deep as 400 kilometres inside held Kashmir.
Mr Qayyum said the timing of the incident made the entire episode of shooting all the more suspicious as it took place during a visit to India by US Vice President J.D. Vance.
 
 

He criticised India for “unilaterally” suspending the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty which even survived two wars between India and Pakistan.
The former army officer  termed the steps taken by the Modi government following the attack “an attempt to divert world’s attention” from death and destruction in the disputed territory.

These guidelines aim to promote trust, transparency, and accountability in AI-driven financial services while protecting the rights and interests of consumers.
In its Financial Stability Review 2024, the central bank noted that with AI adoption surging across different sectors, the global banking industry is also increasingly embracing these technologies.
 
 

In the case of Pakistan, financial institutions are also embracing AI technology. The most commonly adopted AI technologies by banks include robotics, process automation (for structured operational tasks), virtual assistant (for customer service), and machine learning techniques (for fraud detection and risk management).

SBP survey finds half of regulated entities have adopted AI tools

In 2024, the SBP surveyed 55 regulated entities (REs) to explore the current state, challenges, and future prospects of AI adoption within Pakistan’s financial services sector. The surveyed REs included commercial banks (conventional and Islamic), microfinance banks, digital banks, Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) and Payment Service Operators/Payment Service Providers (PSOs/PSPs).
The results of the SBP’s survey on using AI in banks reveal that about half of the REs have either deployed AI in financial services or are in the development process.
Moreover, the survey indicates that AI is being used for various financial services, including fraud detection, customer services, marketing, credit risk assessment, process automation, etc. In this context, banks need to take care of the associated risks of AIs and incorporate the carbon footprint of AI into their risk management frameworks, introducing it as a specific risk category.
This requires relevant risk identification, assessment, development and implementation of adequate risk mitigation strategies.
“The foremost step is to recognise the potential environmental risks associated with adopting AI systems,” said the report.
The most commonly used AI technologies in the banking sector are among the most energy-intensive owing to real-time processing and high accuracy requirements.
“After risk identification, banks need to measure the emissions associated with AI models throughout their life cycle,” said the report.
“Banks must implement risk mitigation strategies to contain the environmental impact of their AI systems. The energy-efficient AI models and algorithms could help address climate concerns,” said the report.
Notably, International Financing Reporting Standards (IFRS) S1 and S2 also require companies to disclose information about all sustainability-related risks and opportunities, specifically about climate-related exposures.
“In Pakistan, the adoption of these standards have been proposed in a phased manner, initially starting with listed companies based on certain criteria, such as total assets, turnover and number of employees,” said the report.
It deserves emphasis that banks must define risk appetite and tolerance level of AI’s carbon footprint, the report added. By setting thresholds, banks would ably deploy AI system balancing operational efficiency with environmental concerns, it added.
The report said that a highly important aspect of AI is to assess the systemic risks on financial institutions and their customers. For instance, high technological penetration and supplier concentration could expose financial institutions to losses arising from operational failures, cyber-attacks and supply chain disruptions affecting key vendors. Further, increased use of AI models with similar characteristics could augment asset price vulnerabilities due to increased correlations in financial markets.

In a statement on Saturday, the minister said that despite having a population seven times larger than Pakistan, an expansive landmass and centuries of statehood experience, India continues to suffer from an insecurity syndrome.
In contrast, he added, Pakistan, with just 77 years of statehood and a comparatively smaller geography and population, exhibits greater composure and maturity.
 






Referring to the tragic Jaffar Ex­­press terrorist attack in Balo­chis­tan, Ahsan Iqbal noted that Pakis­tan responded in a responsible and mature manner by acknowledging internal security lapses and committing to addressing them, even while credible evidence pointed towards foreign involvement.
Conversely, he observed, India’s reaction to the Pahalgam tragedy in held Kashmir was impulsive and reactive, and rather than acknowledging its own security shortcomings, it hastily shifted blame onto Pakistan without any substantiated evidence.

PFUJ slams Modi govt for fuelling war-like atmosphere

‘War-like atmosphere’
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has strongly condemned the Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for pursuing a policy that fosters a war-like atmosphere in the region and undermines peace and harmony.
In a joint statement, PFUJ Acting President Khalid Khokhar and Secretary General Arshad Ansari called for an immediate halt to India’s uncalled for decision to suspend relations with Pakistan, particularly in areas such as the Indus Waters Treaty, trade and commerce, over an incident that remains under investigation and appears to be a false flag operation staged in Pahalgam, seemingly for political gains and to stir regional tension.
They pointed out that Pahalgam is located nearly 200km from the LoC and is heavily patrolled by Indian Bor­d­­er Security Force and the army, ma­­king the incident highly suspicious.
The PFUJ leadership warned that hostilities between the two nei­ghbouring countries would only wo­­rsen bilateral relations rather than help bridge the already wide gap — created solely by the policies of India’s BJP-led government, which they said prioritises Hindutva ideology over secularism, a value India has upheld since its independence.
“Investigate the cause of the Pahalgam incident first, instead of blaming Pakistan for your own incompetence,” they added.
The PFUJ leadership also criticised the Indian media for promoting a policy of hate-mongering through the dissemination of false and fake content, a hallmark of Indian media during times of heightened tensions.

• Commissioner says flood wave passes Muzaffarabad without causing damage
LAHORE/MUZ­AFFARABAD: An unusual surge in the water level of River Jhelum — attributed by officials to snowmelt but feared by locals as flash floods released by India after suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — has triggered panic among the residents of Muzaffarabad and surrounding areas.
“A rise in the water level in River Jhelum at Muzaffarabad was recorded, leaving residents panicked. They thought it was a flash flood released by India upstream,” a local resident told Dawn. “People kept watching the river, trying to check if any debris had come, like it does during flood seasons, but they couldn’t find anything,” he added.
A daily water situation report issued by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) also confirmed an increase in water flow levels in River Jhelum. However, an officer from the Met Department’s Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) dismissed the concerns, stating the rise was part of usual seasonal flows.
 
 

“Typically, these days we see up to 50,000 cusecs in River Jhelum. As of now (April 26), we have 47,000 cusecs, which doesn’t even qualify as a low flood in the river,” Akhtar Mahmood, the FFD deputy director, explained to Dawn on Saturday. “A low flood in River Jhelum ranges between 75,000 and 110,000 cusecs,” he added.
He further clarified that water levels in all rivers typically rise during this period due to snowmelt and rainfall in the catchment areas. “The water level in River Jhelum at Manga always rises this time of year (until June 15) due to snowmelt, followed by monsoon rains. Similarly, water rising in the Indus at Tarbela is 80 per cent due to snowmelt,” he said.
“At times, the rise in Jhelum’s water level could also be due to the cleaning of a mini-reservoir at the Kishanganga run-of-the-river hydroelectric project. But I believe this rise is due to increased temperatures melting snow,” he concluded.
Unusual surge
The Muzaffarabad division commissioner said on Saturday that an unusual surge in the flow of River Jhelum was recorded after India released water into the river.
Speaking to Dawn, Chaudhry Guftar Hussain said that while the normal flow of the river in Muzaffarabad remained around 18 cumecs (cubic metres per second), it swelled to 26.4 cumecs at around 12:15pm. However, the flow reduced to 22 cumecs within an hour, he added.
Despite the sudden increase, the flood wave passed through the territorial limits of Muzaffarabad without causing any loss or damage, he said.
Mr Hussain said that so far, no adverse impact had been reported from the low-lying areas adjacent to the river, which are generally vulnerable to such surges. Nevertheless, he advised residents to continue exercising caution, particularly while moving near the riverbanks, as a preventive measure.
Water release
The Indus River System Authority (Irsa) on Saturday released 118,500  cusecs of water from various rim stations with inflow of 129,400 cusecs,  APP reported. According to data, the water level in River Indus at Tarbela Dam was 1431.43 feet, which was 29.43 feet higher than its dead level of 1402.00 feet. Water inflow and outflow in the dam was recorded as 39,100 cusecs and 43,300 cusecs, respectively.
The water level in River Jhelum at Mangla Dam was 1129.60 feet, which  was 79.60 feet higher than its dead level of 1,050 feet. The inflow and  outflow of water was recorded 47,100 cusecs and 32,000 cusecs,  respectively.
The release of water at Kalabagh, Taunsa, Guddu and Sukkur was recorded as 62,700, 44,300, 34,800 and 7,400 cus­ecs, respectively. Similarly, from River Kabul, 22,400 cusecs of water were released at Nowshera and 12,500 cusecs from River Chenab at Marala.
