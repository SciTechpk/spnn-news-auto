The camel, now named Cammie, had her front leg allegedly chopped off by a landlord in Sindh’s Sanghar district in June 2024, as punishment for foraging in his field for fodder, for which six suspects were remanded.
She was taken in by the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) Benji Project for Animal Welfare in Karachi, where she has spent over a year.
 
 

Today, the shelter provided an update that Cammie had stood up for the first time since her mutilation, along with a video showing her getting used to walking with her new prosthetic leg.
“It’s been a year of tears, setbacks, rehab, pain, and quiet perseverance. A year where we were told to give up, to move on, to stop delaying the inevitable. But we chose to stand by her. And today, she stood for us all.”
The shelter thanked its team and supporters, as well as PPP MNA Shazia Marri, PPP Senator Quratulain Marri and the Sindh government for their “unwavering support and trust in [the team’s] mission”. The Sindh government had previously committed to covering the cost of the treatment.
Both sisters had taken stern notice of the camel mutilation incident. In a joint statement last year, they said that veterinary doctors referred them to CDRS, and rescuing the camel was a “joint effort”.
Shazia said today that there was “no greater feeling than when months of hard work, care and consistent efforts pay off!” while the latter said: “Dedicated service over momentary outrage any day. You stuck to this long after the temporarily infuriated had forgotten her existence. Everyone on the team who continues to care for Cammie - they are the superstars!”
 






The shelter also thanked the founder of Bionic Pets, Derrick Campana, who designed and created the custom prosthetic to fit Cammie.
“We still have a long road ahead as Cammie adjusts to her prosthetic, but today is for celebration, for hope, and for all the silent victories that happen when you refuse to give up,” the shelter said.
 
 

Pakistan has almost no animal welfare policy or service in place. The most prominent law for animal protection, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1890) — which dates back to the colonial era — is limited in scope and lacks understanding of animal welfare in today’s context.
The federal government did pass a law in 2018, increasing the fines for animal cruelty. It increased the maximum fine to Rs100,000 for animal cruelty, which had remained at the Rs50 level since the law was first passed in 1890, for first-time offenders. The minimum fine was raised to Rs10,000. There was a similar increase in fines for other offences against animals.
However, the law is only applicable in the federal capital, and does not extend to the rest of Pakistan. This is because animal welfare became a provincial subject after the 18th Amendment, and provinces are required to enact their own laws.
That is yet to happen, resulting in punishment for offences against animals in the rest of Pakistan staying the same as they were under the 1890 law.</p><small>2025-07-15 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614133-disqualification-row-pa-speaker-halts-action-against-oppositions-lawmakers' target='_blank'><strong>Disqualification row: PA speaker 'halts' action against opposition's lawmakers</strong></a><br><p>

The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group’s foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the annual summit of its leaders, which will be hosted by China this autumn in Tianjin.
On June 13, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran that targeted military and nuclear sites as well as residential areas, and killed senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians. The attacks began days before a planned meeting between Tehran and Washington aimed at reviving nuclear negotiations. The US, which had been in talks with Iran since April 12, joined Israel in carrying out its own strikes on June 22, targeting Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. Iranian authorities say the Israeli strikes killed at least 1,060 people.
Addressing the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers today, Dar said: “We have strongly condemned the unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Such illegal actions directed against SCO member states are unacceptable.”
Continuing his criticism of Israel, he said: “Israel has shown a reckless disregard for international norms and humanity through its relentless and disproportionate use of force in Gaza, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of civilians causing the worst humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We call for immediate halt to Israel’s atrocities. The only viable remedy to Palestine dispute is the realisation of two-state solution which includes the establishment of Palestine as a viable, secure and contiguous state on the basis of pre-1967 borders with Al Quds as its capital.
“Unilateral and illegal measures to change the status of disputed territories in violation of UN Security Council resolutions must be strongly condemned and opposed by all.”

Dar said Pakistan was “increasingly concerned at the trends of using aggression as a tool of policy.”
Instead, he called for the resolution of longstanding disputes through peaceful means, dialogue, diplomacy and according to the principles of international law, justice and fairness.
 






On regional issues, FM Dar said Pakistan sought a relationship of peace and stability with all its neighbours.
“However, the last three months witnessed extremely disturbing developments in South Asia. It is most unfortunate that the attribution of the Pahalgam Attack to Pakistan — without a credible investigation or verifiable evidence — brought the two nuclear-armed states to the brink of a major conflict. In the wake of mounting tensions, Pakistan’s restrained and responsible approach was met with legal transgressions, rhetorical belligerence, and strategic recklessness.
“Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to the ceasefire and the cultivation of a stable regional equilibrium. However, we cannot accept that the arbitrary use of force is normalised. We believe that disputes and differences are resolved through dialogue and diplomacy, instead of conflict and coercion. In that backdrop, initiation of a comprehensive and structured dialogue can meaningfully address the full spectrum of issues that have long bedevilled the peace and security in South Asia. Strict adherence to bilateral agreements would be equally important in this regard.”
He said the events unfolding in the region since the April 22 terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam reaffirmed a “central truth” of South Asian geopolitics: the peaceful settlement of longstanding unresolved disputes was “imperative for an enduring peace” in the region.
Dar added that enduring peace and stability in Afghanistan also constituted a cornerstone of the SCO members’ shared aspiration. He pointed out that the revival of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group could serve as a valuable platform for pragmatic and results-oriented cooperation.
“Terrorism is the common concern of humanity that threatens global security. All forms of terrorism, including state terrorism are condemnable. We must shun the use of terrorism for political purposes and combat this menace through a cooperative approach, including addressing its root causes.”
He said the SCO was a vital platform for realising the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), pointing out that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship BRI project, not only supplemented the SCO’s vision of regional connectivity and economic integration but also complemented its common objective of shared development and prosperity.
“We need to take concrete steps within existing SCO’s mechanisms for trade and development and promote the use of national currencies for mutual settlement within SCO region to avoid international financial shocks. We support the proposal to create SCO alternative development funding mechanism to give needed impetus to various stalled development initiatives.
“As the permanent chair of the SCO’s Special Working Group dedicated to combatting poverty, Pakistan is fully committed to providing the necessary momentum to our collaborative endeavours to address poverty.”
Dar called on the SCO members to also collectively address the “existential threat” of climate change.
“At a time when the global order is experiencing profound challenges, SCO has emerged as a stabilising force. Its inclusive approach underscoring the sovereign equality of states and seeking peaceful resolutions to disputes, offers a compelling alternative to aggression, confrontation and zero-sum rivalries. The SCO’s commitment to consensus, development, and mutual respect is a beacon of hope for building a better and equitable world.”
Stressing Pakistan’s commitment to the organisation and its principles, Dar said: “In our pursuit to peace and security, we believe in non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force or threat of its use in international relations, as well as seeking no unilateral military superiority in the region.”
In a post on X after the meeting, Dar said: “At the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting today, we reaffirmed our shared commitment to multilateralism, mutual respect and regional stability. The Shanghai Spirit continues to guide us towards dialogue, mutual trust and the pursuit of a more just and inclusive international order.”
 






Meeting with Xi
Earlier today, Dar met with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing as he represented Pakistan in a joint call of the SCO foreign ministers.
In a post on X, the deputy PM said he was “delighted” to meet with Xi and conveyed the “warm greetings of the leadership, government and people of Pakistan”.
“As iron-clad brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners, we remain committed to deepening Pak-China enduring friendship and advancing shared regional goals,” he posted on X.
 






The Chinese president, welcoming the heads of delegations, underlined the “salience of regional cooperation” under the ambit of the SCO, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa).
Shortly later, Dar arrived in Tianjin along with other foreign ministers to lead Pakistan’s delegation to the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers’ meeting, according to Mofa.
 






The deputy premier arrived in Beijing last night, where he was received at the airport by Ambassador Yu Hong and other senior officials of the Asian Affairs department of China’s Mofa, as well as Pakistan’s ambassador to China, Khalil ur Rehman Hashmi.
India’s Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia’s Sergei Lavrov and Iran’s Abbas Araghchi are among the top diplomats arriving in Beijing for the SCO moot.
Meetings with SCO members’ ministers
Dar also met with the foreign ministers of various SCO member states on the sidelines of the joint call on Xi.
“Always good to exchange views for strengthening regional understanding and cooperation in such a challenging time,” he said on X about his meeting with his Iran, Uzbekistan and Belarus counterparts.
 






“Both leaders reviewed bilateral cooperation across diverse areas and discussed the evolving regional situation following the recent Israeli aggression against Iran,” the Foreign Office said of FM Dar’s meeting with his Iranian counterpart.
 






Da also met Russian FM Sergei Lavrov. “Both sides expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties and agreed to further enhance cooperation in trade, energy, agriculture and defence,” the FO said, with Dar reiterated the invitation for FM Lavrov to visit Pakistan.
 






In separate meetings with Kazakhistan FM Murat Nurtleu and Kyrgyzstan’s Zheenbek Moldokanovic, Dar and the ministers reaffirmed a commitment to the enhancement of positive bilateral ties and expanding collaboration across areas of interest.
According to an earlier statement from the Mofa, Dar is set to hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from the SCO member states during his visit to China.

A few days ago, a video of Sajid riding a motorcycle in the rain went viral on social media, in which he could be heard using abusive language against the chief minister.
A sessions court on Monday sought a reply from Johar Town police on a habeas corpus petition seeking his recovery. Sajid’s son Muhammad Umar had filed the petition for the recovery of his father.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, “No incriminating evidence is present against the accused person to be sent to judicial remand.
“Hence, the request of the investigating officer (IO) has been turned down, the accused person is discharged from the instant case … first information report, and the IO is ordered to release the person forthwith”.
The Lahore court discharged Sajid after he was nominated in a June 2024 case filed by the Green Town police station. Police subsequently released the senior citizen from handcuffs.
Police had arrested the citizen on July 14, according to a request for his judicial remand and presented him in the Model Town court today.
The accused’s counsel, Advocate Noman Sarwar Dogar, argued that his client had been wrongfully nominated in the 2024 FIR by the police.
The court observed in its order that all the facts and circumstances of the case create doubt in the police’s version of events.
In the habeas corpus case, the petitioner, Advocate Sameer Khan Khattak, alleged that Johar Town police had illegally detained his client’s father for the past two days.
He had claimed that Sajid had been arrested without any registered case and had not been produced before any court.
The counsel also stated that the police had forced the petitioner’s father to record apology videos, which were later circulated on social media.
He asked the court to order the recovery and release of the petitioner’s father.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Ghulam Farid had issued a notice to the Johar Town station house officer and directed him to file a reply by July 15.</p><small>2025-07-15 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151801062ea01ab.jpg?r=180146' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924360/fact-check-china-has-not-removed-pakistan-from-list-of-countries-with-visa-free-entry-pakistan-was-never-part-of-the-list' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: China has not removed Pakistan from list of countries with visa-free entry; Pakistan was never part of the list</strong></a><br><p>Posts from users and Indian accounts on social media platform X on Monday were claiming that China has removed Pakistan from its list of countries allowed visa-free entry. However, no such development has occurred since Pakistan was never included in China’s list of countries with visa-free entry.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and media collaboration, with initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor symbolising a shared vision for development.
On July 14, a user, who appears to be a PTI supporter based on his previous posts, claimed in a post on X that China has removed Pakistan from its list of visa-free countries.
A social media graphic from a news outlet accompanying the post reads: “China just announced visa-free entry for 74 countries, but Pakistan didn’t make the list.”
The post garnered over 19,000 views.
The same post was shared by several other PTI supporters as well, as can be seen here, here, here, here, and here, gaining over 18,000 collective views.
The same claim was shared on X by an Afghan-based user, gaining over 95,000 views.
The same claim was also circulated by several Indian accounts, with individual posts garnering over 557,000, 180,000, 27,000, 24,000, and 14,000 views, respectively.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in matters related to Pakistan-China relations.
To investigate the claim, the July 9 news article published by Media Bites, whose social media graphic was being shared, was reviewed.
The news report was titled: “China offers 30-day visa-free access to citizens of 74 countries, but Pakistan misses out”.
The story cited US-based news outlet ABC News, which reproduced a report by US wire news agency The Associated Press (AP)
AP published the report on July 9 with the following headline: “Citizens of more than 70 countries can now visit China without a visa.”
According to the report, China has expanded its visa-free policy to allow citizens of 74 countries to enter for up to 30 days without a visa as part of efforts to boost tourism and strengthen its global image. The list includes most European countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, along with select nations from Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Additionally, citizens of 10 other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, are eligible for a 10-day entry under China’s limited transit visa policy.
Pakistan was not mentioned anywhere in the report as being removed from the list of countries.
Checking the official website of the China Visa Application Centre Islamabad showed that not only does it mention the various types of visas that Pakistanis can apply for, but also, its page of the online visa application procedure was last updated June 24 — well before the July 9 AP report.
The procedure shows the detailed steps and documentation needed to apply for a Chinese visa, confirming that Pakistan has always required a visa to enter China and was never among the countries granted visa-free entry.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that China has removed Pakistan from its list of visa-free countries is misleading.
Pakistan has not been removed from any list because it was never among those countries with visa-free entry in China and Pakistanis have always been required to apply for various types of visas to gain entry. While Pakistan was not included in the recent list, omitting the fact that Pakistanis have always required a visa for entry in China has the potential to misguide the public into thinking it is a new development or that Pakistan has been removed.

In its latest report on Pakistan’s Digital Ecosystem issued yesterday, the ADB cautioned that steep and inconsistent taxes on digital infrastructure in the country pose a serious risk to foreign investment, growth, and the expansion of digital services.
“Pakistan’s digital infrastructure faces a major challenge from high taxation. Taxes on this sector, both federal and provincial, are some of the highest globally and regionally, and the tax policies tend not to be very consistent,” the report said.
“The cost of service provision exacerbates the digital divide, especially for women and marginalised groups, who face asymmetric cost and cultural barriers to accessing the internet.”
The report further added that the telecom sector in Pakistan “experienced a decline in revenues and foreign investment, which reflects a very challenging business environment”.
It called for a “renewed focus is needed by the government on engaging with investors and industry stakeholders to address their concerns and provide incentives and facilitation to invest and operate in the country”.
In its recommendations on the digital economy, the report also advised to cut corporate income tax rates and the cost of doing business for SMEs by 10pc for the next 10 years, conditional on the businesses registering themselves and using digital platforms for their transactions.
Other recommendations included simplifying taxation and foreign exchange regimes for ICT export companies; capping income tax for staff of ICT-export companies to 15pc; tax credits for women-led digital businesses; single window regulation; providing low-interest loans; and mandating through the State Bank of Pakistan that commercial banks allocate at least 15pc of their loan portfolios to SMEs with a minimum of 50pc emphasis on digital and ICT businesses.
The ADB urged the government to “rationalise all digital infrastructure taxes, both direct and indirect, making them competitive against a basket of countries, and fix sector tax rates for at least 10 years”.
Pakistan currently has 56.5pc broadband penetration with 137 million subscriptions. Every province charges a regressive sales tax of 19.5pc on internet service usage which is higher than any other service, ADB added.
“High capital investment; regulatory obstacles; costly and cumbersome Right of Way (RoW) arrangements; and high, unpredictable taxes hinder new investments in Pakistan’s digital infrastructure,” the report stated.
Pakistan has the world’s lowest average revenue per user due to fierce competition among service providers, the report noted, adding that revenues of operators and telecom companies have been “shrinking” in real terms.
It recommended mandating a flat countrywide optimal RoW fee per meter — permission granted to telecom companies to install and maintain their infrastructure (like fiber optic cables, mobile towers, etc) — and provide for a predictable rise over a longer period.
It also recommended prioritising early-stage investments in digital infrastructure projects, promote local manufacturing of smartphones, and provide 3pc research and development allowance on exports of locally produced smartphones.
The ADB advised the government to create a “robust enabling legal and regulatory framework for development and implementation of public–private partnerships (PPPs) for digital infrastructure”.
It also called for expanding internet access and device ownership for citizens, especially women, working with local and global partners to design tailored PPP programmes, and providing low-cost or easy installment-based smartphones.</p><small>2025-07-15 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151459089314149.jpg?r=150306' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924364/4-of-a-family-among-5-killed-in-karachi-road-accidents' target='_blank'><strong>‘4 of a family’ among 5 killed in Karachi road accidents</strong></a><br><p>Five people — four from the same family — were killed in two separate road accidents in Karachi on Tuesday, according to police and rescue officials.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
At least four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a nullah on Hawkesbay Road in the city’s Mauripur area, according to Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza.
DIG Raza speculated that the family was most likely returning from the Hawke’s Bay beach. The incident took place at 9am on Tuesday, he added.
“The accident most likely happened as a result of speeding,” said the DIG, adding that further investigation was underway.
The deceased included a man and woman — identified as Yousuf and Khalida — along with two children, six-year-old Zainab and 10-year-old Ayesha.
The injured were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, three of whom were in critical condition, according to Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
 
 

In a separate incident, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway, according to rescue officials.
The injured were rushed to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, as per rescue officials.
The deceased has been identified as 39-year-old Gaya Chand, rescue officials said.
On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, killing a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.
On June 11, a young man was killed and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway. The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p><small>2025-07-15 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614127-indonesia-expresses-desire-to-enhance-defence-ties-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia expresses desire to enhance defence ties with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

On April 22, 26 tourists were killed at a hill station in India-occupied Kashmir’s (IoK) Pahalgam. India has blamed Pakistan for the horrific attack, an accusation the latter denies. Islamabad has called for an international independent probe into the massacre.
In an interview with the Times of India on Monday, IoK Lieutenant Governor and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Manoj Sinha said, “I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure.”
In response to the admission, numerous Indian politicians slammed him for negligence and for his delay in taking accountability and called for his resignation.
The Indian National Congress |(INC) suggested that Sinha intended to shield “unspecified officials” in the union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, The Wire reported.
Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said in a post on X, “He (Sinha) finally takes responsibility for Pahalgam after 82 days of the attack. In doing so, who is he protecting in Delhi? How many days, weeks, months to also be held accountable and resign or get sacked?”
 






Similarly, INC national spokesperson, Shama Mohamed asked: “Since [Sinha] has taken full responsibility for the security lapse during the Pahalgam attack — when is he resigning? In a democracy, the next step after taking the responsibility is resignation!”
 






Meanwhile, Imran Nabi Dar, spokesperson for IoK ruling party National Conference, told The Wire that the “next logical step for him (Sinha) should be to step down and apologise to the people of Jammu and Kashmir whose lives, livelihood and dignity were put at stake due to his blunders”.
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and general secretary MY Tarigami said that his party had been demanding accountability from the union government since the attack. He called for the government to provide details about the lapses that resulted in the deaths of 26 civilians.
“All those responsible should be held accountable. Acceptance means certain action against those who have committed such a grave mistake,” he was quoted as saying by the report.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman also reacted to the interview today, saying the admission came “well after two months and after going to a whole war over it”.
She added, “The opposition in the Lok Sabha should really take down this regime for the spectacular incompetence that jeopardised Indian lives, credibility and reputation. The momentum is right there.”
 






New Delhi ‘lied’ to public about Pahalgam attack
In an exclusive interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar last week, PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had said the Indian public was “lied to” by New Delhi about Pakistan’s alleged involvement in the Pahalgam attack.
In an interview with The Wire’s Thapar, the PPP chief said that had Pakistan been involved in the attack, evidence would have surfaced and the perpetrators identified.
“As far as the Pahalgam terrorist attack is concerned, Pakistan has been willing to be part of an impartial international investigation; your government refused that,” Bilawal said.
“To this day, the Indian government has not shared with Pakistan, with the international community, with the Indian public … who exactly are these individuals that were involved in this terrorist attack that are from Pakistan?”
When pressed on the issue, Bilawal said that if Pakistan was truly involved, the international community would endorse India’s perspective.
“It’s very uncomfortable for you that I point out the truth to the Indian public, that they have been lied to … that Pakistan was involved in this attack when we were not,” he asserted.
“The government has been unable to provide the evidence. That’s why during this war, the Indian media and the Indian government launched a campaign of disinformation to continue to bamboozle the people of India,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-15 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151159287a3405e.jpg?r=120425' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924347/psx-breaks-record-rally-sheds-500-points' target='_blank'><strong>PSX breaks record rally, sheds 500 points</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) plunged over 500 points on Tuesday, failing to continue its upward trajectory despite crossing the 137,000 barrier in intra-day trading.

Earlier today, Samiullah Tariq, head of Research and Development at Pakistan Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, had attributed the early gains to strengthened macroeconomic indicators.
“Improvement in macroeconomic indicators and better result expectations, especially in commercial banks, is the primary reason for the increase in the [stock] market,” he told Dawn.com.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said: “Investors are booking profits in companies that posted significant returns during the recent bull run, while delays in clarity regarding the clearance of circular debt payments have kept energy sector stocks under pressure.”
He said the recent rally was “likely to continue, supported by attractive stock valuations and expectations of further monetary easing”.
Yesterday, the PSX had continued its upward trend from last week, crossing the 136,500 level due to value-hunting by investors and optimism over strong corporate earnings.
The rally was supported by active participation from local mutual funds and institutional investors.
 
 

A surge in workers’ remittances, robust auto sales, and improved foreign exchange reserves provided a solid backdrop for investor optimism, helping offset subdued participation and minor currency depreciation.
Workers’ remittances rose to a historic $3.4bn in June, up 8pc year-on-year, taking full-year FY25 inflows to a record $38.3bn — a 27pc increase over the previous year. The State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves surged by $1.8bn to $14.5bn for the week ending July 4, marking a 39-month high.
The previous week saw the stock market continue its record-breaking bullish run, crossing the 134,000-point threshold amid strong macroeconomic fundamentals and persistent buying by local mutual funds.</p><small>2025-07-15 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614116-facilities-imran-khan-is-availing-at-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Facilities Imran Khan is availing at Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>

China and India should “adhere to the direction of good-neighbourliness and friendship” and “find a way for mutual respect and trust, peaceful coexistence, common development and win-win cooperation”, Wang said, according to Xinhua.
The two foreign ministers met in Beijing on Monday as the two rivals seek to repair ties following a 2020 clash on their border.
The world’s two most populous nations are intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia, and their 3,500-kilometre frontier has been a perennial source of tension.
The 2020 clash between their troops led to a four-year military standoff, but they agreed in October on patrols in disputed areas.
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping met for the first time in five years later that month, agreeing to work on improving relations.
New Delhi is concerned over Beijing’s increasing presence in the Indian Ocean, seeing the region as firmly within its sphere of influence.
Another source of tension is the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader India has hosted since he and thousands of other Tibetans fled Chinese troops who crushed an uprising in their capital Lhasa in 1959.
The 90-year-old Dalai Lama says only his India-based organisation has the right to identify his eventual successor.
China insists that it would have the final say on who succeeds the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p><small>2025-07-15 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614105-ecp-disqualifies-mna-jamshed-dasti-over-fake-degree' target='_blank'><strong>ECP disqualifies MNA Jamshed Dasti over fake degree</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and Indonesia maintain strong bilateral relations rooted in shared religion and culture, with both countries cooperating in trade, education, and health.
Gen Sjamsoeddin called on PM Shehbaz at the PM Office today, where he reiterated Indonesia’s desire to “further strengthen defence ties with Pakistan and to explore possible areas for cooperation, especially in defence production”, according to a statement from government-run PID.
 






The Indonesian minister conveyed the best wishes of President Prabowo Subianto for the prime minister and people of Pakistan, the press release added.
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz “reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to explore and expand collaboration with Indonesia in joint ventures of investment in mutually beneficial projects”, the statement said.
The prime minister also reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to enhance bilateral cooperation with Indonesia in all avenues, including economic, strategic and trade sectors, along with defence and defence production.
He highlighted that Pakistan and Indonesia enjoyed a “longstanding friendship rooted in shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, supporting each other at international forums”.
Both sides stressed the importance of “enhancing multifaceted bilateral cooperation”, according to the PID.
“The meeting underscored the deep-rooted historical, brotherly and friendly bilateral relations between Pakistan and Indonesia,” the statement noted.
Recalling his meeting last year with Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto on the sidelines of Developing-8 Summit in Cairo, PM Shehbaz conveyed his best wishes for the Indonesian president.
The prime minister also reviewed ongoing initiatives under the Pakistan-Indonesia Defence Cooperation Agreement and agreed to “accelerate the implementation of key areas of mutual interest”, the PID added.
In June, the two countries decided to increase cooperation in areas such as vaccine production in Pakistan, the establishment of medical institutions in Indonesia, pharmaceutical development and human resource exchange.
Last year, Indonesian Charge d’Affaires Rahmat Hindiarta hosted an exclusive dinner for Pakistani business leaders and their spouses at the Indonesian Embassy to enhance bilateral finance and trade relations.</p><small>2025-07-15 10:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151303528f03fbd.jpg?r=130523' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924354/uk-introduces-e-visa-for-pakistani-students-workers' target='_blank'><strong>UK introduces e-visa for Pakistani students, workers</strong></a><br><p>The United Kingdom’s government on Tuesday launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
The announcement came just a day after the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
In a statement today, the British High Commission (BHC) in Islamabad said: “The UK Government is replacing physical immigration documents for most student and worker visas with a digital proof of immigration status, an e-visa.”
British High Commissioner Jane Marriott said on X that the facility was for “most students and workers applying for more than 6 months”.
 






An e-visa is an online record of a person’s immigration permission in the UK and will make the visa process easier and more secure, the BHC noted in its statement.
“E-visas are tried and tested, with millions of people already using them on select immigration routes,” it highlighted.
Students and workers who intend to stay in the UK for a period longer than six months will be eligible to apply for the e-visa. The UK government plans to expand the scheme to all visa applications, according to the statement.
In 2024, the UK government announced that the country’s immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.
The BHC outlined the following eligibility criteria for the e-visa:

Students, including short-term study for 11 months
Global Business Mobility routes (specifically, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Service Supplier, Secondment Worker)  
Global Talent   
International Sportsperson   
Skilled Worker (including health and care)  
Temporary Work routes (specifically, Charity Worker, Creative Worker, Government Authorised Exchange, International Agreement, and Religious work routes) 
Youth Mobility Scheme  

Applicants applying as dependents or for visas other than study or work, eg. general visitor visa, will still need a physical visa, the statement noted.
Those with existing in-date physical visas do not need to take any action.
Marriott noted that the changes were set to make the visa process simpler for students and workers. “It also means applicants can hold onto their passports, saving time,” she pointed out.
 
 

She clarified that updating from a physical visa to an e-visa will have no impact on a person’s present immigration status.
“Holders can link their travel document (such as passport) to their UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) account to facilitate straightforward international travel,” the statement read.
The UKVI — introduced in 2024 — is an account that visa holders staying in the UK for longer than six months are required to create. It serves as an online record of people’s immigration status.</p><small>2025-07-15 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614086-fm-dar-meets-iron-clad-brother-president-xi-as-sco-leaders-converge-in-beijing' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar meets 'iron-clad brother' President Xi as SCO leaders converge in Beijing</strong></a><br><p>

The store opened its doors to select visitors after its inauguration by Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in India’s financial capital Mumbai.
Tesla has for years signalled its interest in India but held back due to the country’s steep tariffs on electric vehicles.
 
 

Musk, who once described India as having “more promise than any large
country”, has also criticised its import duties, calling them among the “highest in the world”.
New Delhi has offered to cut import taxes on electric vehicles for global automakers only if they commit to investing hundreds of millions of dollars and make cars locally.
Tesla has yet to announce plans to set up a plant in India.
For now, local media reports say, the company will likely sell cars imported from China, with deliveries projected to start from late August.
Its Model Y variants start from an on-road price of around $70,000 in India, according to its website, compared with a US price of $37,490 after a $7,500 federal tax credit.
Tesla’s India debut comes at a critical time for the company, which is seeing demand wane for its cars in countries around the world.
The recent slump in Tesla’s sales partly reflects the highly competitive nature of the EV market, which the company once dominated but now also features BYD and other low-cost Chinese players.
While Tesla is looking to tap the world’s third-biggest car market, experts say it is unlikely to see huge volumes in the short term due to the nascent nature of India’s EV industry and the hefty price tag of its vehicles.
India’s EV market is fast-growing but remains small, with automakers reporting sales of around 100,000 vehicles in 2024 or less than three per cent of total car sales.
 

People are seen outside the Tesla showroom ahead of its opening in Mumbai, India on July 15, 2025. — Reuters

Soumen Mandal, a senior analyst at Counterpoint, said the high price tag will likely place it out of the price range of most Indian customers and see it compete against offerings from luxury carmakers instead.
“We don’t expect Tesla to play the volume game right away given the price tag,” Mandal told AFP.
“We project 500-700 units sold in the initial months and then that to taper off to 200-300 (per month).”
India is currently negotiating a trade deal with the United States, including a potential reduction in tariffs on automobiles.
In February, Musk held a one-on-one meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington.</p><small>2025-07-15 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151621108069b93.jpg?r=162203' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924352/worlds-oldest-marathon-runner-fauja-singh-dies-aged-114-in-road-accident' target='_blank'><strong>‘World’s oldest marathon runner’ Fauja Singh dies aged 114 in road accident</strong></a><br><p>India’s Fauja Singh, believed to be the world’s oldest distance runner, has died in a road accident aged 114, his biographer said on Tuesday.
Singh, an Indian-born British national, nicknamed the “Turbaned Tornado”, died after being hit by a vehicle in Punjab state’s Jalandhar district on Monday.
“My Turbaned Tornado is no more,” Fauja’s biographer Khushwant Singh wrote on X.
“He was struck by an unidentified vehicle… in his village, Bias, while crossing the road. Rest in peace, my dear Fauja.”
 






Singh did not have a birth certificate but his family said he was born on April 1, 1911.
He ran full marathons (42 kilometres) till the age of 100.
His last race was a 10km event at the 2013 Hong Kong Marathon when 101, where he finished in one hour, 32 minutes and 28 seconds.
He became an international sensation after taking up distance running at the ripe old age of 89, after the death of his wife and one of his sons, inspired by seeing marathons on television.
Although widely regarded as the world’s oldest marathon runner, he was not certified by Guinness World Records as he could not prove his age, saying that birth certificates did not exist when he was born under British colonial rule in 1911.
Singh was a torchbearer for the Olympics at Athens 2004 and London 2012, and appeared in advertisements with sports stars such as David Beckham and Muhammad Ali.
His strength and vitality were credited to a routine of farm walks and a diet including Indian sweet “laddu” packed with dry fruits and home-churned curd.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tribute to Singh on social media.
“Fauja Singh was extraordinary because of his unique persona and the manner in which he inspired the youth of India on a very important topic of fitness,” said Modi on X.

Speaking at a joint press conference at Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, members of the business community warned that the strike would be changed into a prolonged agitation if the demands were not met.
Chamber president Fazal Moqeem Khan, along with senior vice president Abdul Jalil Jan and members of the SCCI’s executive committee at the Chamber House here, rejected the “alarming” provisions of the Finance Act, which came into force on July 1, 2025, said in the prevailing situation, the business community had been left with no option but to take even more drastic steps, including suspending the filing of sales tax and income tax returns.
He noted that those sentiments were increasingly echoed by SCCI’s members, who had lost faith in the prevailing economic environment due to the government’s oppressive policies.

Business community threatens prolonged agitation if govt doesn’t meet demands

Fazal voiced solidarity with the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which identified 30 “harsh tax and customs measures” as a serious threat to the survival of businesses across the country.
He emphasised that the SCCI stood shoulder to shoulder with all business organisations demanding the immediate reversal of these unjust laws.
The SCCI leader said the introduction of Sections 37A and 37B of the Income Tax Ordinance was a draconian and unprecedented move.
“The Finance Act also has an amendment introduced through Section 21(s), which effectively disallows any cash transaction amounting to Rs200,000 or more for tax deduction purposes. This means that if a customer pays a supplier in cash, even by depositing cash directly into the supplier’s account, the supplier could be penalised by losing 50 per cent of the expense in tax calculations,” he noted.
The SCCI chief voiced serious reservations about the mandatory implementation of e-bilty and digital invoicing systems for all sales tax-registered entities.
He criticised the FBR for attempting to enforce complex digital systems in a country where general and computer literacy remains significantly low.
“Why are taxpayers being forced to perform the FBR’s duties at their own expense? This will only widen the gap between the business community and tax authorities,” he said.
Fazal said businessmen should be encouraged to focus on productivity and revenue generation rather than bureaucratic red tape that stifled operations and increased costs.
The SCCI chief also flayed the government’s complete disregard for the established consultative process traditionally followed before the passage of the Finance Bill.
He said historically, the Business Anomaly Committee engaged with stakeholders and the FBR in a series of meetings to address anomalies and formulate mutually agreed-upon recommendations.
“These discussions are held with the participation of Member Inland Revenue, Member Customs, and eventually the Finance Minister and Chairman FBR.”
The SCCI president said this year, the process was unilaterally bypassed for the first time, leaving no room for dialogue or consensus.
He added that in protest, several committee members resigned and walked out.
“Despite vocal objections from the business community and the parliamentary standing committees, the Finance Bill was rushed through the house,” he said.
Fazal urged the prime minister to immediately withdraw sections 37A and 37B, the Rs200,000 cash transaction penalty under Section 21(s), the digital invoicing requirement under SRO 709, and the mandatory e-bilty provision under Section 40(c).
“Section 8B of the Sales Tax Act, which also grants discretionary powers to the FBR commissioner to disallow complete input tax adjustment, is completely unacceptable,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Swat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) on Monday decided to launch an anti-tax movement to unite all political parties of Malakand Division, trader federations, business associations, chambers, lawyers, journalists and people from other walks of life on a single platform to initiate a public movement.
The decision was made during a SCCI meeting held in Swat under the chairmanship of president Noor Mohammad Khan.
The session included a detailed discussion on the imposition of a 10pc sales tax and the resulting public reaction. The participants stressed that while the government was taking steps to restore Fata, the former status of the Provincially Administered Tribal Areas should also be reinstated.
The participants said there was a severe lack of employment opportunities in Malakand Division, while the residents had long suffered due to natural disasters and conflicts.
They added that if the government couldn’t provide employment to youth, it must not impose taxes.
The participants also complained about the demolition of public property in the recent anti-encroachment operations and said the administration used the crackdown to cover up their inefficiency and negligence. They demanded immediate relief for the affected individuals.
The participants formed a committee to consider selling the land previously purchased for the Swat Chamber of Commerce and Industry and acquiring more suitable land.

According to district police officials, the crossfire erupted after militants launched a sudden attack on an FC checkpost and a nearby police station using heavy weaponry. During the assault, a mortar shell landed inside the Azam Warsak police station, causing partial damage to the building.
DSP Wana Imranullah confirmed the incident, saying that the attackers, whose identity and affiliation remain unknown, opened fire from an undisclosed location. In response, FC and police personnel retaliated, and the firefight continued for an extended period. The assailants, however, managed to flee under the cover of darkness.
DSP Imranullah further said that one of the mortar shells struck a residential house nearby, leaving three civilians injured.
All three injured were rushed to District Headquarters Hospital, Wana, for immediate medical attention.
According to medical superintendent Dr Jan Mohammad, two of the critically wounded were later referred to Dera Ismail Khan via Rescue 1122 ambulance service, while the third victim is reported to be out of danger.
In the aftermath of the attack, law enforcement agencies launched a search operation in the surrounding areas. Authorities said an investigation has been initiated, and efforts are underway to trace the perpetrators.

The conservative-dominated court, in an unsigned order, lifted a stay that had been placed by a federal district judge on mass layoffs at the department.
The three liberal justices on the nine-member panel dissented.
Trump pledged during his White House campaign to eliminate the Education Department, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979, and he moved in March to slash its workforce by nearly half.
Trump instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “put herself out of a job”.
 






Around 20 states joined teachers’ unions in challenging the move in court, arguing that the Republican president was violating the principle of separation of powers by encroaching on Congress’s prerogatives.
In May, District Judge Myong Joun ordered the reinstatement of hundreds of fired Education Department employees.
The supreme court lifted the judge’s order without explanation, just days after another ruling that cleared the way for Trump to carry out mass firings of federal workers in other government departments.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, said in the Education ruling that “only Congress has the power to abolish the Department”.
“The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naïve, but either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave,” Sotomayor said.
Traditionally, the federal government has had a limited role in education in the US, with only about 13 per cent of funding for primary and secondary schools coming from federal coffers, the rest being funded by states and local communities.
But federal funding is invaluable for low-income schools and students with special needs. And the federal government has been essential in enforcing key civil rights protections for students.
 
 

After returning to the White House in January, Trump directed federal agencies to prepare sweeping workforce reduction plans as part of wider efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — previously headed by Elon Musk — to downsize the government.
Trump has moved to fire tens of thousands of government employees and slash programmes — targeting diversity initiatives and abolishing the Education Department, the US humanitarian aid agency USAID and others.</p><small>2025-07-15 06:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1507520242280c9.jpg?r=075208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924275/ecp-seeks-kp-assembly-session-to-swear-in-mpas-on-reserved-seats' target='_blank'><strong>ECP seeks KP Assembly session to swear in MPAs on reserved seats</strong></a><br><p>• Writes to KP governor, chief minister; says delay in oath taking would prevent it from holding Senate elections on schedule
• Commission reserves verdict on plea seeking redistribution of reserved seats in provincial assembly
ISLAMABAD: With Senate elections in Kh­yber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) just a week away, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has written to the province’s governor and chief minister, asking that the provincial assembly be convened immediately so that new members can be sworn in on reserved seats.
Also on Monday, the ECP reserved its verdict in a case related to reallocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly.
The letter, addressed to the KP governor’s principal secretary, stated that the commission was obligated to conduct Senate elections in the province, which had been set for July 21.
“But the matter of administration of oath is still pending and dela­yed,” it said.
The correspondence no­ted that the KP Asse­mbly speaker was requ­ested to administer the oath to the newly returned candidates, enabling them to complete the electoral college for Senate elections.
In response, the speaker has conveyed that the oath will be administered when the assembly is in session.
“The Commission has also received a copy of the letter of the Leader of the Opposition, attached with the application submitted by Mr Suresh Kumar MPA and others in this Comm­ission, wherein the Spe­aker has stated that neither the Constitution nor the Provincial Asse­mbly of Khy­ber Pakht­unkhwa Proce­dure and Con­duct of Business Rules, 1988, contain any provision empowering the Speaker to summon a session of Assembly on his own,” it said.
Noting that the administration of oaths has already been delayed considerably, it asked the governor to summon the assembly at the earliest.
Through another letter, the KP chief minister has been requested to issue advice to the governor to summon the assembly immediately, so that new members can take oath and the Senate elections can be held.
Verdict reserved
Meanwhile, an ECP bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, reserved its verdict in a case related to the re-allocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly, after hearing arguments from all parties.
Five political parties — the PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, Awami National Party and PTI-Parliamentarians — and 71 individuals had been issued notices, as the ECP fixed the case for hearing after receiving the order of the Peshawar High Court.
The PHC had on July 8 ordered the ECP to redistribute reserved seats after hearing all parties, while declaring the ECP’s notifications on distribution of reserved seats of KP Assembly null and void. The PHC verdict came on a petition filed by the PML-N.
Later, talking to reporters, JUI-F counsel Senator Kamran Murtaza said the PML-N was demanding a greater share of reserved seats after independent candidate, Tariq Awan, joined the party belatedly.
Mr Murtaza said that an independent lawmaker who joins a political party after the time stipulated in the law has expired, continues to be an independent, and this in no way affects the share of a political party in terms of reserved seats.
The PTI-led government currently holds 92 seats in the KP Assembly, while the opposition, which was only able to win 18 out of the total of 115 general seats, has seen its numbers swell to 53.

• Extreme rainfall will become ‘more common and stronger’ by end of the century
ISLAMABAD: Calling the 2022 floods “a forewarning of elevated future flood risks”, a study published in a leading scientific journal warns that Pakistan is likely to experience more frequent and severe floods due to extreme rainfall events and human-induced development encro­aching on floodplains.
Published in Nature, the article comprehensively evaluates the complex interplay of pluvial (direct rainfall) and fluvial (riverine) conditions, upstream snow cover dynamics, and anthropogenic changes in the natural landscape that contributed to the unprecedented 2022 flooding.
 
 

The study says the Indus Plain in Pakistan experienced 19 flood disasters between 1950 and 2012, affecting an area of 599,459km², causing 11,239 deaths, and resulting in economic damages exceeding $39 billion.
“A significant proportion of these flood events were predominantly attributed to monsoon rainfall, with around 10 out of 20 occurrences taking place after the 2000s,” it added.
According to the paper, after a multi-year drought, the pre-monsoon rainfall in 2022 was 111 per cent higher than the long-term average of 1951–2021, increasing soil moisture by 30pc in the Indus Basin floodplains.
“Monsoon rains were 547pc above average, with record-breaking cumulative weekly rainfall in July (200mm) on already saturated soils. Upstream drainage catchments (e.g., Chenab, Jhelum, and Ravi) received 33pc and 41pc more rain in pre-monsoon and monsoon periods, respectively,” it said, adding that August 2022’s streamflow at Sukkur Barrage, just upstream of the floodplains in Sindh, was 170pc larger than the historical average, due to the compounding effects of rain-on-snow and warmer temperatures accelerating snowmelt.
It said the 2022 flood was triggered by pre-monsoon rainfall followed by an intensified monsoon system, adding that during the monsoon season (July-Sep), rainfall in Sindh and Balochistan surged to “between 600 and 1800mm, far exceeding historical average”.
 
 

Anthropogenic changes
According to the study, riverine flooding was amplified by anthropogenic changes, extreme streamflow, and antecedent soil moisture conditions.
“The river water level during the 2022 flood surpassed the levels recorded during the historical catastrophic floods of 2010 and 2015 by 2.4m and 2.79m in Aug. For example, Jun 2022 flows at Sukkur Barrage were 32pc lower than the long-term average (1994–2021), while subsequent months saw increases of 26pc, 105pc, and 170pc, respectively.”
The study revealed human activities were land use adjacent to riverine ecosystems, characterised by intensive agricultural practices and high population density along riverbanks.
For instance, Larkana has consistently expanded toward the riverbanks, with cropland extended from about 37,000km² to 47,500km² between 2001 and 2022.
Another factor that contributed to these floods was the accelerated upstream snowmelt and rain-on-snow events.
‘Adding fuel to fire’
According to the authors of the study, Dr Ali Mirchi and Dr Arfan Arshad, flooding risks in Pakistan could “increase dramatically” under a high-emission scenario, with intense rainfall events, especially 5-day extreme rainfall events in southern Pakistan projected to become “more common and stronger by the end of the century up to 58pc”.
“For example, the frequency of rainfall totals of more than 400mm over five days in this region would increase. At the same time, single-day rainfall extremes (RX1day) could rise by 44pc, pushing already vulnerable regions beyond their coping capacity,” they told Dawn via email.
They said Pakistan could focus on adaptation to mitigate these risks, such as restoring natural floodplains, improving drainage, and shifting development away from riverbanks.
“Pakistan cannot solve global warming alone, but local emission reductions combined with smarter land planning can reduce damage and save lives,” they said.
“To reduce the rainfall-induced direct flooding from urban runoff, we have to fix and upgrade drainage systems in both cities and rural areas to reduce flooding. These are practical, actions that can be done quickly and can go a long way in preventing the kind of widespread damage we saw during the 2022 floods,” the authors said, while stressing the need to improve early warning systems.

Muhammad Umar filed the petition for the recovery of his father, Muhammad Sajid.
Representing the petitioner, Advocate Sameer Khan Khattak alleged that Johar Town police had illegally detained his client’s father for the past two days.
He claimed that Sajid had been arrested without any registered case and had not been produced before any court.
The counsel also stated that the police had forced the petitioner’s father to record apology videos, which were later circulated on social media.
He asked the court to order the recovery and release of the petitioner’s father.
Additional District & Sessions Judge Ghulam Farid issued a notice to the Johar Town station house officer (SHO) and directed him to file a reply by July 15.
A few days ago, a video of Sajid riding a motorcycle in the rain went viral on social media, in which he could be heard using abusive language against the chief minister.

The virtual data room — an online repository used for document stora­­ge and sharing — facilita­tes due diligence proces­ses typically associated with mergers and acquisitions, loan syndication, private equity and venture capital transactions.
A meeting of the standing committee, chaired by Muhammad Farooq Sat­tar, also passed the Priv­a­tisation Com­mis­­sion (Am­­endment) Bill 2024 — a government-sponsored bill — by a majority vote.
A finance ministry official informed the committee that Rs3 billion had been approved for Postal Life Insurance Company Limited, while an additional Rs3bn will be disbursed in the third and fourth quarters of the current financial year, as per the committee’s directive.

The issue at hand was a PTCL announcement in which the company said it would auction a property situated on I.I. Chundrigar Road, Karachi. Committee’s Chair­man Syed Aminul Haq exp­ressed displeasure, saying the PTCL was not providing the proof of powers that allowed it to sell properties.
The chairman of the committee asked the PTCL team about the specific clauses of the sale and purchase agreement that allowed PTCL to sell its properties without seeking permission from the government. The company did not provide information to the panel, but in a response to the IT ministry it stated that the PTCL’s Memoran­dum of Association allowed the company to sell its properties.
At this, the lawmakers asked if the company had such powers to sell land and wondered whether other government entities could do the same without seeking prior authorisation. Meanwhile, Sher Ali Arbab also expressed concerns that the PTCL had not responded to the queries by the committee.

Chairman says all stakeholders will be invited to in-camera meeting to clear ambiguity

Mazhar Hussain, adviser to the PTCL president, said that the company was not bound to respond to the questions posed by the committee and the reply had been forwarded to the IT ministry. He added that the committee could approach the ministry or Etisalat which retains the management control of the PTCL.
The situation in the committee room turned tense due to this response and Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani suggested taking the matter to a logical end to clear the ambiguity.  The members said the panel had powers to hold the company accountable since it was owned by the government.
The PTCL team was led by Zahida Awan,  Group Chief Legal Officer and it included Naveed Butt and Mazhar Hussain, advisor to President PTCL.
Meanwhile, the representative of the Privatization Commission informed the committee that under Clause 6 of the agreement between the government and Etisalat, the commission was legally bound not to share the details of the agreement unless mutual consent was obtained from both the government of Pakistan and Etisalat.
Amid concerns that the members might have been given ‘incomplete information’ by the company representatives, the chairman said that the matter would be discussed in an in-camera meeting to be attended by the representatives of the IT ministry, the law ministry, the Privatisation Commission, and Etisalat. They will be invited so that the sale and purchase agreement could be thoroughly reviewed.
The next meeting is likely to be held by the end of this month.
Another agenda item pertained to the upcoming projects of the Universal Service Fund (USF) in District Tharparkar and Sargodha Division.
While briefing the committee regarding complaints received from LDI (Long Distance and Inter­national) operators, PTA Chairman retired major general Hafeezur Rehman informed that 9 LDI operators defaulted on their payments, amounting to approximately Rs19 billion. Additionally, more than 100 cases involving these operators were pending in various courts.
The PTA issued notices to the LDI operators and at least six operators had expressed their willingness to clear their outstanding dues, he said, adding that there was a need to formulate a clear mechanism for recovery. According to one of the suggestions, an instalment-based payment plan could be used for recovery.
To address the overall issue, a subcommittee was constituted under the convenorship of Sher Ali Arbab.

According to informed sources, the ex-depot price of petrol is projected to rise by about 2pc to Rs272.04 per litre, while HSD is likely to see a 2.5pc increase to approximately Rs279.48 per litre. The final prices will be announced after government approval.
Currently, petrol is priced at Rs266.79 per litre following a Rs8.36 per litre hike on June 30. Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households.
Diesel, which fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains, stands at Rs272.98 per litre after a Rs10.39 hike earlier this month. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods. Transporters have already begun adjusting fares in anticipation of the expected increase.

Petrol and diesel rates may rise by Rs5.25 and Rs6.50 per litre

In contrast, the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil are projected to decline by Rs3.80 and Rs2.25 per litre, respectively.
Despite zero general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products, the government is currently collecting close to Rs98 per litre in total levies on both petrol and diesel. This includes a petroleum development levy (PDL) of Rs78.02 on petrol and Rs77.01 on diesel and HOBC, along with a Rs2.25 per litre climate support levy (CSL). Additionally, a customs duty of Rs20-21 per litre is levied on both fuels, whether imported or locally refined.
Oil marketing companies and dealers are earning around Rs17 per litre as combined distribution and retail margins.
Petrol and diesel remain the primary drivers of fuel consumption, with monthly sales between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.
In FY24, the government collected Rs1.161tr through the petroleum levy and aims to increase this by 27pc to Rs1.470tr in FY25. Despite zero GST, petroleum products continue to serve as a significant source of revenue.
Oil falls 1pc
According to a Reuters report, oil prices edged lower on Monday, as investors weighed new threats from US President Donald Trump for sanctions on buyers of Russian oil that may affect global supplies, while still worried about Trump’s tariffs.
Brent crude futures fell 79 cents, or 1.12pc, to $69.57 a barrel by 1:04 pm EDT (1704 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down $1.07, also 1.56pc, to $67.38.
Trump announced new weapons for Ukraine and threatened to hit buyers of Russian exports with sanctions unless Russia agrees to a peace deal in 50 days.
Oil prices rallied early, on expectations that Washington would impose steeper sanctions. But prices retreated as traders weighed the 50-day deadline.
“The market took it as a negative because there seemed to be a lot of time to negotiate,” said Phil Flynn, senior analyst with Price Futures Group.

In Naseerabad’s Ghafoorabad and Tamboo areas, heavy rainfall accompanied by strong winds caused multiple mud houses to collapse. 
The boundary wall of a school in Ghafoorabad was damaged along with numerous solar panels installed in the area. Though the downpour brought some relief from the intense summer heat, the destruction left many residents struggling with damaged property and limited access to basic facilities.
Officials from the local administration confirmed that loss assessment and emergency relief efforts have begun in the affected areas.
Teams have been dispatched to survey the damage and provide immediate assistance to affected families.

Widespread destruction in Naseerabad, Dhadar, Sohbatpur; dozens of mud houses collapse

In nearby Dhadar, intermittent rain continued throughout the day, raising concerns about rising water levels. According to the Irrigation Department, a flood wave of 6,000 cusecs is currently flowing through the Nari River, while another surge of 4,850 cusecs is passing through the Mushkaf Weir, increasing the risk of flash floods in vulnerable regions.
Sohbatpur faced some of the most severe impacts, with torrential rain and storm winds flooding low-lying neighborhoods and causing local streams and drains to overflow. 
Although the weather improved after the rain, the city’s communication and power infrastructure was severely disrupted. Multiple electrical feeders tripped, mobile networks went offline, and the Sohbatpur grid station sustained critical damage. According to Quetta Electric Supply Company, a high transmission line tower collapsed and the grid station’s boundary wall was also brought down by the storm.
Despite improving weather conditions, affected communities in all three districts — Naseerabad, Dhadar, and Sohbatpur — continue to face difficulties. Authorities have launched restoration and relief efforts, though challenges remain as the full scale of the damage is yet to be determined.

The initiative, launched under the auspices of the Law and Justice Commi­ssion of Pakistan (LJCP), will be implemented acr­oss all levels of the judiciary, from magistrate courts to the Supreme Court.
The counsels in such cases would be given up to Rs50,000 in remuneration, which would be provided to them through the Dis­trict Legal Empo­werment Commi­ttees, to ensure equi­table access to justice for all citizens.
The decision was taken during a meeting presided over by the chief justice at the Supreme Court Branch Registry in Quetta. The meeting reviewed institutional linkages between the bar associations of Balo­c­histan and LJCP in strengthening justice delivery.
During the meeting, the CJP shared insights from his visits to some remote districts, where he noticed a gap in coordination bet­ween bar associations and the LJCP. He said that despite the availability of funds, they were not being properly utilised for uplifting the district judiciary.
As the commission has limited outreach capacity, LJCP  has decided to post a senior-level representative in every province who will be stationed at the respective high courts. These representatives will act as front desk to maintain liaison with district bar associations, identify local priority areas, raise awareness, and supervise grassroots-level justice sector initiatives.
 
 

The bars associations may present their development project proposals to District  Development Committees. Moreover, representatives of federal and provincial development departments have also been taken on board to ensure speedy execution and to avoid resource duplication.
Moreover, CJP encouraged the bar representatives to ensure that their members benefit from the Continuing Legal Education programmes offered by the Federal Judicial Academy.
Balochistan High Court Bar Association President Attaullah Khan Langov apprised the meeting about various facilities provided by the provincial government to the bar associations across the province.
It included 100 scooties for women lawyers, digital library at High Court Bar, shuttle services from high court to District Court Quetta, a 100-acre housing scheme for lawyers of high court and grant-in-aid by the federal government to 28 districts bars of Balochistan and the High Court Bar Association.
All federal and provincial stakeholders present at the meeting assured their full cooperation and support in advancing the shared goal of accessible and efficient justice.

• New system will automatically pull data linked to filer’s CNIC, at-source deductions, bank details
• PM seeks early release of income tax refunds for salaried individuals; wants Raast chairman, board to be appointed by September
ISLAMABAD: In a move to simplify tax filing procedures for the salaried class, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has introduced a new interactive return form, which will incorporate an auto-fill system that seamlessly integrates data about purchases, asset details and tax deductions at source etc. — ultimately generating a single-form return upon completion.
The new return form is currently available in English, while the Urdu version is set to come out by the end of this month.
During the first rollout phase, the form will also be available in two regional languages, Sindhi and Pashto. More versions in regional languages — Punjabi and Balochi — are expected to be rolled out subsequently.
Under the Income Tax Ordinance, individual taxpayers are required to file their returns by September 30.
The new return form consists of eight digital windows, each containing one input column. The process is designed to be step-by-step, with each screen containing a single question prompt to guide users through the filing process.
In the first window, entering one’s employer’s name will automatically populate the fields of tax deduction at source.
All deductions of withholding taxes based on the Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) numbers will also appear on the form.
Similarly, providing bank account details will prompt the form to display closing balances.
Registered purchases linked to the filer’s CNIC will also appear automatically, streamlining data entry and minimising manual input.
 
 

According to an official annou­ncement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the FBR to launch a digital invoicing in Urdu. He said tax reforms should focus on facilitating citizens.
He asked the FBR to expedite the release of income tax refunds for salaried individuals of those amounting to less than Rs50,000. These refunds are to be issued within one month of return submission. The total disbursement under this directive is estimated at Rs10 billion.
While chairing a meeting to review progress on FBR reforms on Monday, the PM instructed the FBR to establish a helpline aimed at assisting the filing process. The meeting was informed that simplified digital tax returns for salaried individuals would be available from Tuesday, with access for other taxpayers beginning by July 30.
PM Shehbaz said tax returns had been made digital, concise, and linked with a central database for public convenience. He believed the salaried class would benefit the most from the new simplified tax returns system. He noted that implementation of AI-based tax assessment system was a major success, calling for raising awareness to encourage taxpayers to use the new system.
 
 

He also emphasized a third-party validation to ensure transparency in all FBR reforms. The premier directed the officials concerned to provide special facilities to small and medium-sized businesses to join the digital invoicing system.
The meeting was briefed on progress regarding digital invoicing, e-Bilty, simplified tax returns, the AI-based assessment system, the central command and control centre, and the cargo-tracking system. It was shared that FBR’s Command and Control Unit would become operational by September, enabling centralized data access and facilitating efficient decision-making.
Regarding the digital invoicing system, it was noted that all small and large businesses would issue receipts through FBR’s online platform at the point of sale and purchase. Approximately 20,000 businesses are expected to be integrated into the system in the coming months.
Customs automation
The meeting was briefed on the AI-driven assessment system that would allow traders to submit advance goods declarations prior to the arrival of ships, with full exemption from upfront duties and taxes. This measure is expected to increase advance declarations from three per cent to over 95pc, allowing containers to be transported directly from ships to factories.
The meeting was informed that within just one month, 8,000 invoices worth Rs11.6bn were issued. The system includes a taxpayer portal and a monitoring dashboard. Integration with PRAL is free of cost, and traders’ training is being actively facilitated. Once fully implemented, traders will no longer need to file separate sales tax returns, as transactions would be automatically recorded in the system.
Digital economy
The PM said the digitisation of the economy was the government’s top priority as it would bring transparency to the system. He said that digitalising payment systems between the public and the government would enhance transparency and ease of use for citizens.
 
 

He directed that progress towards a digital economy be accelerated and instructed that the processes of digitisation and the shift towards a cashless economy be simplified for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). He also emphasised that all state-owned enterprises should be integrated into the digital framework.
The PM advised the relevant officials to complete the process for the appointments of the board of governors and chairman of Raast by September. He noted that RAAST’s Board of Directors must comprise business experts.
The meeting was informed that the number of users of mobile apps and digital banking services was expected to increase from 95 million to 120m, with the volume of digital payments projected to rise from Rs7.5bn to Rs15bn. A nationwide public awareness campaign on Raast and digital payments would be launched next month.
To align Pakistan’s economy with those of developed nations, a Digital Payments Index will be introduced within one month. Additionally, the Capital Development Authority Board has approved the right of way for digital public infrastructure in Islamabad.
It was also noted that the remittance system was being digitised, ensuring that all funds sent from abroad would be received through the formal banking system. Coordination is ongoing with the governments of all four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir to promote digital payments.
