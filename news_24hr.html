• Local businesses face mounting losses as sit-ins in Gulmat Nagar and Sost sever vital commercial links
GILGIT: Local traders protesting import-export policies continued to block the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at Gulmat Nagar for a fifth consecutive day on Tuesday, with a separate demonstration also halting traffic in Sost town near Khunjerab Pass.
The KKH Hunza-Nagar section remained blocked at two locations, causing difficulties for tourists and passengers amid long queues of vehicles.
Protesters, led by the Pak-China Traders Action Committee, vowed not to call off their sit-in until their demands concerning trade with China and what they termed “exploitative policies” by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) are met.
The committee is an alliance comprising the Gilgit-Baltistan Importers and Exporters Association, the Nagar Chamber of Commerce, and small trade associations from Nagar, Hunza, and Gilgit.
Key demands include the clearance of 240 consignments imported from China, stuck at Sost Dry port for seven months, through an amnesty scheme, and a waiver of all port charges.
They also seek an exemption for consignments at Sost Dry Port from misdeclaration cases, facilitation of barter trade between Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Xinjiang province under a 1985 border agreement, and an exemption for GB residents from sales and income taxes on goods imported from China, citing the region’s disputed status.
The protest has drawn support from GB political and religious parties, with opposition members in the GB Assembly announcing their solidarity.
Javed Ali Manwa, an opposition member who joined the protest, said, “The demands of protesters are fundamental rights of GB people.”
He accused the federal government of making “people of this [region] jobless and economically attacked”.
GB opposition leader Kazim Mesum, in a statement, noted “the only land route with China [is] blocked” and urged the federal government to “resolve the demands of the traders before the entire GB people will take to streets”.
Protesters said they initially planned to march towards Sost but were stopped by the administration, compelling them to stage the KKH sit-in.
They said the federal government is “reluctant to settle the genuine issues of the local people” and warned “the situation will be dangerous if their demands are further delayed”.
Protesters highlighted that GB people “had annexed the region with Pakistan without getting status and rights of constitutional citizens”.
Organisers of the protest closed the KKH to all traffic except ambulances, disconnecting the road link with China and leaving local passengers and tourists stranded.

In a working paper for the federal budget 2025-26, the Planning Commission also attributed the lower-than-targeted GDP growth to a poor performance of the agriculture sector. “GDP growth for FY25 is recorded at 2.7pc against the target of 3.6pc, primarily due to a massive contraction in key commodity-producing sectors, including important crops, which witnessed a 13.5pc contraction due to adverse weather conditions, reduced rainfall, input challenges, and policy shift”, the Planning Commission candidly placed on record.
Last year, the government announced a lucrative minimum support price (MSP) for wheat, but the Punjab government subsequently withdrew its support for farmers, leaving them at the mercy of middlemen and market forces. The federal government, as part of the IMF negotiations, later announced its intention to end commodity market interventions and refrain from implementing minimum support prices.
The subsequent policy changes, including extended fertiliser subsidies, added salt to the farmers’ pain, causing input challenges as pointed out by the Planning Commission.

Planning Commission foresees higher food imports next year

“During FY25, the crop sector showed mixed trends as production of important crops declined by 13.5pc, whereas other crops showed growth of 4.8pc. Production of cotton declined by 30.7pc, maize by 15.4pc, sugarcane by 3.9pc, rice by 1.4pc, and wheat by 8.9pc”, the commission noted.
The outcome could not have been expected to be different. “Yields of sugarcane and rice declined despite a slight increase in cultivated area. This could be attributed to erratic weather patterns or input issues during the growing season”, the commission said, warning that the overall data highlighted falling yields and the need for better policy support and climate-resilient practices.
On top of that, cotton ginning contracted by 19pc in FY25 compared to a growth of 47.2pc last year. “This was mainly due to decline in cotton production and closure of ginning factories in the country”, the working paper reads.
This helped the federal government contain the expansion of net domestic assets to a marginal Rs145.6bn in 2024-25 compared to Rs1.588 trillion last year. “This was largely due to the government’s net retirement of SBP borrowings, reduced demand for budgetary support from scheduled banks owing to lower fiscal deficit and a net retirement of financing for commodity operations, mostly driven by repayment of loans availed for wheat procurement”, the commission said.
“It mainly reflects the impact of reforms in commodity operations to stem the accumulation of commodity debt. These measures included rationalisation of wheat procurement, gradual abolition of MSP” besides the timely payment of subsidies, and transitioning to targeted subsidies, mostly in the energy sector.
Conversely, the planning commission appreciated the livestock performance and gave its credit to the government. “Livestock maintained its growth streak to 4.7pc during current year compared to 4.4pc last year. This was mainly due to key initiatives like vaccination programmes for livestock, both by the federal and provincial governments” in the improvement in surveillance programmes and disease control mechanisms in the country.
This also had a cascading impact on manufacturing sector that underperformed, slowing from 3pc growth in the previous year to 1.3pc in FY2024-25 against a target of 4.4pc. The Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector was a key contributor to this slowdown, which reversed its modest 0.9pc growth from last year and contracted by 1.5pc in FY2024-25, underscoring persistent weaknesses in industrial output and subdued demand.
LSM groups like food production, chemicals, non-metallic mineral products, iron and steel, electrical equipment, machinery, and furniture recor­ded a decline, which offset the growth in the output of tobacco, textiles, wearing apparel, coke and petroleum products, automobiles, and other transport equipment, indicating resilience in consumer-oriented and energy-related industries.

ISLAMABAD: The capital police on Tuesday announced the arrest of the suspect in the murder case of a social media influencer, who was gunned down at her house in G-13 on Monday.
Addressing a hastily-called news conference, Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said after the murder of 17-year-old Sana Yousuf, seven police teams were formed under the supervision of DIG Operations Jawad Tariq. These teams conducted a technical investigation, analysing social media accounts and more than 300 call records. Footage from Safe City Islamabad and private cameras was also obtained.
The suspect was arrested from Faisalabad within 20 hours of the incident. Additionally, the victim’s mobile phone and the murder weapon were recovered from his possession.
“The ruthless killer took the phone with him after the murder to destroy evidence. In order to apprehend the accused, raids were conducted at over 11 locations in three cities. The accused is a 22-year-old unemployed man who repeatedly attempted to contact the victim. Upon her refusal to respond, he committed the murder.”

IGP says there was immense pressure on police, but identifying suspect was a complex process

The IGP said the murder of Sana caused a wave of concern across Islamabad and the entire country. The brutal killing of the young girl was a significant challenge for the police. There was immense pressure to arrest the killer, but identifying him was a complex process.
He added that a strong case would be built against the suspect, ensuring a thorough investigation and collection of solid evidence so that the competent court awards him the appropriate punishment.
The IGP held the press conference at Rescue 15 and was accompanied by DIG Mohammad Jawad Tariq and other police officers.
 
 

Sources close to the investigation told Dawn that the suspect, the son of a retired grade-16 officer, and the victim had known each other for the last one year. The suspect came to Islamabad on the night between May 28 and 29 to wish her a happy birthday and reached her house in G-13; however, they could not meet due to unknown reasons.
Later, both the girl and the suspect talked on the phone with the latter complaining about her unavailability to meet him on her birthday. However, they decided to meet on June 2, and he again arrived in Islamabad. When he reached outside her house, she did not come out.
Somehow, the suspect managed to enter the house, where an argument ensued during which he pulled out a weapon and shot her, killing her on the spot.
At the time of the incident, the victim’s aunt was present in the house while her parents had gone out.
After registration of the case, the investigators collected CCTV footage from cameras installed around the victim’s house and from Safe City, which revealed that the suspect had reached Chungi No 26 and boarded a passenger vehicle to Faisalabad.
Geo-fencing of the area also confirmed the suspect’s presence at G-13 and later at Chungi No 26. Police conducted a raid in Faisalabad, arrested the suspect and brought him to Islamabad.
NCSW demands transparent investigation
Meanwhile, the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) condemned the cold-blooded murder of the young TikToker and said the heinous act was a stark reminder of the deep-rooted patriarchal violence that continues to deprive women and girls of their fundamental right to life.
NCSW Chairperson Ume Laila Azhar demanded an immediate, transparent and thorough investigation into the crime. She said the perpetrators must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
“We will not let this case be buried under social stigma, false narratives of honour, or procedural loopholes. This senseless killing highlights the vulnerability of women and girls, even in their own homes. We demand justice for Sana and her family, and expect the state to ensure accountability of the perpetrators.”
Burial in Chitral
The body of the victim was laid to rest in her ancestral graveyard in Chuinj village of Upper Chitral on Tuesday.
Touching scenes were witnessed during the burial as villagers and relatives burst into tears over the tragic death of the girl.
Her father, Yousuf Hassan, who works in a government office in Islamabad, said the Chitrali community residing in Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Peshawar had started feeling insecure as incidents of cold-blooded murders had increased in the past few years.
Earlier, hundreds of people had gathered to condole with the bereaved parents in a hotel in Chitral city, where they stayed for an hour on Tuesday morning before leaving for the village in Upper Chitral with the body.— Our correspondent contributed to this story from Chitral

Thomas Barrack, who President Donald Trump named special envoy last month shortly after he unexpectedly lifted US sanctions on Syria, made the comments in an interview with Turkish broadcaster NTV late on Monday.
The US military has about 2,000 US troops in Syria, mostly in the northeast. They are working with local forces to prevent a resurgence of the militant Islamic State group, which in 2014 seized large swathes of Iraq and Syria but was later pushed back.
 
 

Since rebels ousted Syria’s former President Bashar al-Assad in December, the United States and other countries are re-engaging with Damascus under new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. Barrack, also US ambassador to Turkiye, raised the American flag over the ambassador’s residence in Damascus last week for the first time since 2012.
When asked how the Trump administration will shape its Syria policy and whether the US is considering troop withdrawal from Syria, Barrack said:  “What I can assure you is that our current Syria policy will not be close to the Syria policy of the last 100 years, because none of these have worked.”  Reducing the number of bases to one from eight was an important part of that shift, he said, according to an interview transcript.
Two security sources in bases where US troops are deployed said in April that military equipment and vehicles had already moved out of eastern Deir el-Zor and were being consolidated in the province of Hasakah.

Lee’s victory stands to usher in a political sea change in Asia’s fourth-largest economy, after the backlash against the martial law brought down Yoon Suk Yeol, the conservative outsider who narrowly beat Lee in the 2022 election.
Nearly 80 per cent of South Korea’s 44.39 million eligible voters cast their ballots, the highest turnout for a presidential election in the country since 1997, with Lee terming the polls “judgement day” against Yoon’s martial law and the People Power Party’s failure to distance itself from that decision.
 
 

With more than 99pc of the votes counted, the Democratic Party’s Lee stood at 49.3pc to PPP candidate Kim Moon-soo’s 41.3pc, according to National Election Commission data. A subdued Kim conceded the race and congratulated Lee in brief remarks to reporters.
Lee had long been favoured to win, and his supporters erupted in cheers as exit polls by the country’s major broadcasters showed him defeating Kim by wide margins.
In a brief speech to supporters gathered outside parliament after the polls closed, Lee said he would fulfil the duties of the office and bring unity to the country.
“We can overcome this temporary difficulty with the combined strength of our people, who have great capabilities,” he said.
He also vowed to revive the economy and seek peace with nuclear-armed North Korea through dialogue and strength.
The martial law decree and the six months of ensuing turmoil, which saw three different acting presidents and multiple criminal insurrection trials for Yoon and several top officials, marked a stunning political self-destruction for the former leader and effectively handed the presidency to his main rival.
Yoon was impeached by the Lee-led parliament, then removed from office by the constitutional court in April, less than three years into his five-year term, triggering the snap election.
Lee has accused the PPP of having condoned the martial law attempt by not fighting harder to thwart it.
Kim was Yoon’s labour minister when the former president declared martial law on Dec 3.
“I was here on Dec 3 after martial law was declared and Dec 14 when Yoon was impeached,” said Choi Mi-jeong, 55, a science teacher who gathered outside parliament to hear Lee speak. “Now Lee Jae-myung is becoming president. I hope he will become a leader who supports ordinary people, not vested interests, not a small number of riches.”
Need for change
Park Chan-dae, acting leader of Lee’s Democratic Party, told a TV channel that the projections suggest voters rejected the martial law attempt and are hoping for an improvement in their lives.
“I think people made a fiery judgement against the insurrection regime,” he said. The winner must tackle a host of challenges, including a society deeply scarred by divisions made more obvious since the attempt at military rule.

• CM Murad calls incident ‘unacceptable’, regrets jail authorities did not reach out to govt or law enforcement agencies for assistance
• One prisoner killed, four others injured in melee; officials say prisoners bolted after being let out of barracks following tremors
KARACHI: At least 83 of the 216 inmates — who managed to break out of the Malir District Prison — have been rounded up and teams have been formed to bring in those still at large, police said.
In the wake of the jailbreak, dubbed as “one of the largest-ever in Pak­istan” by Law Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah removed the provincial prisons chief and suspended the deputy inspector general of prisons, as well as the superintendent of the chaos-hit penitentiary.
The jailbreak began just before midnight and continued into the early hours of Tuesday after hundreds of prisoners — spooked by low-intensity quakes — were allowed into the prison courtyard, Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar later told reporters at the scene.
Police said the prisoners snatched guns from prison staff and forced open the main gate after a shootout, evading paramilitary soldiers. At least one prisoner was shot dead and two others were injured, said Sindh IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn the body of one deceased prisoner, along with four other inmates with gunshot injuries and two policemen, were brought to a hospital.
IGP Memon, who visited the jail on Tuesday morning, said that as per his assessment and briefings from jail and police officials, the jail administration brought an estimated 2,000 prisoners out of their barracks for counting shortly after midnight, following low-intensity tremors.
“Most of the prisoners were drug addicts,” he noted. “The addicts’ state of mind is such that they tend to develop mob psychology. Thus, when such an atmosphere was created inside the prison, the prisoners ran by opening the door of the jail,” he elaborated.
The police chief said FC personnel deployed at the prison resorted to aerial firing to push them back.
Subsequently, law enforcers launched an operation, managing to recapture 78 prisoners.
The Sindh police head said they are setting up teams to re-arrest the remaining 138 escaped prisoners. “One of the escaped prisoners was brought back to the jail by his mother,” he added.
He said the Sindh government has decided to set up an inquiry committee to ascertain the circumstances that led to the incident and fix responsibility for it.
Heads roll
In the wake of the incident, Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah ordered the removal of IG Prisons Qazi Nazir and suspended DIG Prisons Hassan Sehto and Malir Jail Super­intendent Arshad Hussain.
Terming the incident “completely unacceptable”, the chief minister said it demonstrated gross negligence and inefficiency on the part of the prison administration.
 
 

Presiding over an emergency meeting at the CM House, the chief minister directed the chief secretary to conduct a thorough investigation of the Malir Jail incident by engaging Commissioner Karachi Hassan Naqvi and Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho.
He emphasised that the jail authorities should have immediately contacted the local district administration and law enforcement agencies for assistance. “There appears to be a complete breakdown in communication and preparedness,” he observed.
“Those responsible will be held accountable,” he said, while directing the home secretary to conduct a comprehensive security audit of all prisons across the province.
CM Murad was informed that most of the escaped prisoners were involved in minor offences, and none were facing heinous charges.
The chief minister appealed to the fugitives to surrender voluntarily. “My request to them (escaped prisoners) would be to surrender, otherwise, their involvement in the jail break incident will amount to terrorism or bigger cases,” he added.
Superintendent’s account
In his report, the now-suspended prison superintendent said that prisoners became agitated due to tremors and started raising a commotion and shouting from the barracks just after midnight on Tuesday.
He claimed that security staff rushed to control the situation and tried to convince the prisoners to remain calm, but many of them instigated their fellow inmates to break down the doors of the barracks at Circle No IV.
The report claimed that the rushing inmates overpowered him and other security staff and rushed to the main ‘Marri’ (security point) as well as other circles and broke the locks of many barracks in circles No. V and No. II.
This resulted in hundreds of prisoners rushing the office block, prison hospital and main marri, interview booths, E-Court and other rooms.
The prisoners also succeeded in entering the main Marri, where they beat the security staff and rushed towards the outer gate of the prison compound around 1:30am.

The fines have been imposed in violation of Section 4 of the Competition Act 2010.
Following a suo motu inquiry initiated in 2021, the CCP found that the companies, in coordination with FMPAC, had issued a joint advertisement setting a uniform maximum retail price of Rs1,768 per 50 kg bag—despite variations in input costs, gas prices, and market conditions.
The CCP declared this a clear act of cartelisation, and not a lawful awareness campaign.
The decision was made after a four-year process that involved an initial inquiry and several hearings with the fertiliser companies.
The CCP announced that fines of Rs50m each were imposed on Engro, Fauji Fertiliser, FFBL, Fatima Fertiliser, Fatima Ltd, and Agritech, while a penalty of Rs70m was levied on FMPAC.
The commission rejected the firms’ argument that they acted under a government directive, stating no formal instruction existed.
The CCP emphasised that business associations cannot fix or recommend prices, and warned that long-standing subsidies cannot justify anti-competi-tive conduct.
Highlighting broader concerns, the CCP noted that despite the expiry of subsidised gas contracts in 2021 and deregulation under IMF reforms, price uniformity persists, which raised serious red flags about competition in the sector.
The CCP urged the federal government to review the outdated Fertiliser Policy of 2001, disengage from direct coordination with trade bodies, and allow market forces to prevail.
Audit reports
Separately, the Islamabad High Court has reserved its verdict in a CCP case seeking cost audit reports from fertiliser companies.
The companies challenged the directive, claiming confidentiality, though they submit the same data to the SECP.
The CCP cited a Supreme Court ruling (in the Dalda Foods case) affirming its legal authority to investigate and demand information.
Under the law, cartelisation can result in penalties of up to 10 per cent of turnover or Rs75m, with repeat violations attracting criminal liability.

The committee, formed on the direction of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, is headed by Sharjeel Murtaza, Chief Digital Officer of Karandaaz Pakistan, and includes Ali Jan Khan, consultant on digital reforms at the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), along with senior nominees from the FBR, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority, Oil Companies Advisory Council, and the State Bank of Pakistan.
Karandaaz Pakistan would be responsible for providing technical and secretarial support to the committee and submitting a final proposal to the FBR and the Ministry of Finance.
This is part of the government’s plan to declare “war on cash” in the upcoming budget by introducing differential tax and transaction rates for cash and digital payments across various sectors, including fuel pricing.

Seven-member panel will be headed by Karandaaz Pakistan CDO

Sources also said that policymakers had already been working on the technical and administrative asp­ects of the move to support the FBR, which has failed miserably so far to document retail businesses in a ma­­nner that could yield revenue outcomes over the past two decades, despite repeated attempts and models.
The finance minister is believed to have held at least three successive consultative sessions with the FBR, the Ministry of Petroleum, banks, financial institutions, and a few hired or co-opted consultancy firms to explore technical solutions.
The campaign against the cash-based economy would work both ways — from top-down and bottom-up — to encourage and compel both consumers and businesses to reduce costs for documented transactions and increase expenses for cash. It aims to gradually shift the current high-cash economy to a low-cash and, eventually, cashless economy, where technically feasible.
An official said that all petrol pumps across the country — from Chaman to Khyber and Karachi to Azad Kashmir — would be required by law to provide digital options, including QR codes, debit and credit cards, and mobile payment services, in addition to cash.
The government-notified petroleum prices would apply only to digital transactions, while cash sales would involve an additional cost of about Rs2-3 per litre. Consumers would be free to conduct cash transactions at a higher rate but would be encouraged to opt for digital payments instead.
The concept is already tried and tested in the shape of a 25 per cent higher cost on cash payments at motorway tolls compared to cheaper rates on M-Tags.
Likewise, the FBR has been using a lower GST rate of 5pc for payments to restaurants through credit and debit cards in Islamabad compared to standard tax rates on cash payments.
There are widespread leakages nevertheless, as restaurant owners encourage their customers to avoid both tax rates without computerised receipts. Some of them even issue computerised receipts without their digital connection to the FBR.
Different rates for cash and digital payments at petroleum outlets are anticipated to help track petroleum supplies from borders and ports to refineries and depots. The FBR chairman is reported to have offered not to consider the process for revenue objectives and suggested that the revenue so collected from petrol stations could be passed back to consumers through subsequent fortnightly or monthly price revisions.
On the other hand, importers and manufacturers would have to charge a standard 18pc general sales tax on digital payments from their suppliers or retailers, with an additional 2pc GST applicable on sales settled in cash.

The committee met under the chair of Senator Aon Abbas and discussed the state of EV prevalence and the status of policy.
The committee members noted that climate change is currently a serious issue, and if vehicles continue to run on fossil fuels, the situation will worsen significantly; therefore, immediate and serious efforts are required in this regard.
Members pointed out that even major cities like Lahore lack EV charging stations, and this is even more pronounced in distant areas.
Briefing the committee, the officials of the Engineering Development Board (EDP) informed that a comprehensive EV policy has been prepared and is ready for presentation.
However, they are awaiting time from the prime minister.
Consequently, the committee recommended that a formal letter be sent to the premier requesting that time be allocated for EDP to present its EV policy.
The meeting decided to constitute a subcommittee under the chairmanship of Senator Saifullah Sarwar Khan Nyazee to suggest an effective EV policy to the government.
The meeting also discussed the role, functions and achievements of Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC).
The committee was told and briefed that at the time of its creation, Pakistan did not inherit any indus-trial base.
East & West Pakistan combined had only 34 factories out of a total of 921 industrial units in the Subcontinent, which is merely 3.6 per cent of the total.
The committee was informed that the East wing produced 70pc of the world’s jute, but there was not a single jute mill and West Bengal (India) was almost the sole buyer.
In the west wing, only 16,000 of the total 1,500,000 cotton bales produced could be processed domestically.

“Subjecting local supplies to 18 per cent sales tax while bestowing zero-rated on imports is an anti-Pakistan policy that is bleeding the economy wi­­thin,” Aptma Central Cha­irman Kamran Arshad, Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) Vice Chairman Mahesh Kumar and Karachi Cotton Asso­ciation (KCA) Chairman Khawaja Mohammad Zub­air told a joint press conference at Aptma House on Tuesday.
The government in bud­get FY25 removed sales tax exemption on local inputs under EFS making imports sales tax and duty-free.
However, the 18pc sales tax on local inputs is refundable, but refunds have been delayed, especially disadvantaged SMEs.
Only 60-70 cent of refunds are issued while the rest are stuck in manual processing with no progress in the last four to five years, they claimed.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMEA) has strongly reacted to the misconception created by Aptma about EFS 2021 and its irrational anti-export demand to impose sales tax on import-stage in EFS which will sabotage the export and industry.

In absolute terms, Pakistan’s exports to the European Union (EU) reached $7.553 billion in July-April FY25 from $6.954bn last year due to a slight increase in demand for textile and clothing products in western, eastern and northern Europe, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
In FY24, Pakistan’s exports to the EU decreased by 3.12pc to $8.24bn, despite holding the GSP+ status, which allows duty-free entry into most European countries.
Western Europe, comprising countries such as Germany, the Nether­lands, France, Italy, and Belgium, accounts for the largest share of Pakistan’s exports to the EU. Exports to this region increased by 10.04pc to $3.791bn in 10MFY25, up from $3.445bn a year ago.
There is also a slight increase in exports to eastern and northern Europe. Exports to the north of Europe saw a rise of 17.39pc to $620.63m in 10MFY25, up from $528.66m in the corresponding months last year.
Exports to southern Europe grew 3.62pc to $2.552bn in 10MFY25 from $2.463bn in the corresponding period last year.
In this region, exports to Spain rose 2.75pc to $1.232bn from $1.199bn in 10MFY24.
Exports to Italy increased 1.62pc to $934.04m in 10MFY25 compared to $918.09m in the same period last year. Exports to Greece increased 12.81pc to $123.05m against $109.07m in 10MFY24.
However, exports to eastern Europe grew 13.96pc to $590.02m from $517.74m in the corresponding period last year.

Renewed value buying across all sectors pushed the benchmark KSE 100 index to an all-time high, closing above 120,400.
Bulls maintained a firm grip on the market, propelling the benchmark KSE-100 index to a record close of 120,450.87, with a gain of 1,573 points or 1.32 per cent, supported by renewed investor confidence and an improving macroeconomic outlook.
According to Topline Securities, the index surged to an intraday high of 1,816 points as momentum picked up sharply after news broke that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a $800 million loan under Pakistan’s public finance programme — a major vote of confidence in the country’s economic reform trajectory.
Adding further fuel to the rally, the IMF gave its nod to Pakistan’s budget proposals, reinforcing hopes of continued fiscal discipline and policy continuity. Key index movers were Fauji Fertiliser, Habib Bank, Engro Fertiliser, Lucky Cement, and Bank Al-Habib, which collectively added 691 points.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation attributed the scaling of a new peak to expected budgetary relief for oil refineries, real estate, and agriculture sectors.
The government has set a GDP growth target of 4.2pc and a Rs880 billion Public Sector Development Programme in the budget 2025-26, which will be announced on June 10.
Ali Najib, Deputy Head of Trading at AHL, said the significant breakthrough above the 120,000 mark reflects robust investor confidence and a strong bullish sentiment in the market.
Media reports regarding the prime minister’s acknowledgement of the IMF’s pre-approval of the upcoming budget further reinforced investor optimism by reducing uncertainty around the fiscal direction.
The market momentum suggests that the PSX may be poised to test the 125,000 level in the near term. However, a decisive and sustained close above 121,000, a key resistance, is essential to confirm this upward trajectory, Mr Ali observed.

With the provinces contributing Rs2.8tr — which is more than two-thirds of the planned development spending — the federal share has shrunk to just Rs1tr or 21.4pc.
Some might rightly argue that the federating units, with their enhanced share from the federal tax pool after the passage of the 18th Amendment in 2010, should foot a bigger part of the development bill, as Islamabad bears the full cost of debt-servicing and national defence.
 
 

However, they must also remember that the provinces have steadily increased their development spending over the last several years, while simultaneously fulfilling the condition of generating an annual cash surplus each year to help the centre contain the fiscal deficit and generate a primary budget surplus to fulfil the demands of multilateral lenders.
Besides, federal development investment is needed to build large infrastructure that cuts across provincial boundaries, while the provinces focus on the provision of essential public services like health and education, in addition to local transport and other infrastructure.
The reasons for the slowdown in federal development expenditure are multiple: the need for managing the primary budget surplus for debt sustainability in line with IMF stipulations, a low tax-to-GDP ratio, dwindling foreign official and private capital flows, etc.
Meeting public aspirations and the harsh demands of external creditors is a precarious balancing act for a government with few resources. Still, the challenge can be addressed if Pakistan’s policymakers show the political will to drastically slash the wasteful current expenditure and undertake reforms to boost tax revenues to create space for bigger development allocations.
That said, both the federation and provinces must ensure their development spending is efficient to achieve the maximum returns from limited resources.
The government must also stop liberally handing out development funds to keep the loyalties of lawmakers; instead, it should ensure that schemes once begun are completed within the given time frame in order to avoid cost overruns and corruption.
Our annual infrastructure spending of 2-3pc of its GDP is one of the lowest in the region, and well below the requirement of 10pc. So a growing backlog demands not just a substantial increase in public development expenditures but also effective and efficient use of those funds.
Beyond that, the authorities need to rope in investors to finance new projects by creating an ecosystem where banks and capital markets are willing to finance such ventures in the private sector.

• NFC meeting in August, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to keep receiving funds to fight terrorism
• CM Gandapur wants tribal districts’ share in finance award, KP’s input in talks with Afghanistan
PESHAWAR: As India’s move to place the Indus Waters Treaty into abeyance puts Pakistan’s water security in peril, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday asked authorities to speed up construction of the Bhasha Dam, while also hinting at inter-provincial consultations to increase the country’s storage capacity.
The premier made these remarks while addressing a jirga at the Corps Headquar­ters Peshawar, in which he stressed the need for tough decisions for the development and prosperity of the country.
PM Shehbaz, while talking about the hostile measures taken by the Modi government, said that under the Indus Waters Treaty, every drop of water was the right of the Pakistani people. He said that India had tasted its own medicine after attacking Pakistan and would be taught a lesson if it attacked again.
 
 

However, the country needs to make a decision on water, he said, adding, “We will invite provinces to discuss how to increase the country’s water storage capacity to defeat India’s nefarious designs.” The PM said Pakistan was building Diamer-Bhasha Dam and other reservoirs to store water, adding that there was a need to take well-considered decisions soon in this regard.
The premier said that KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, in his speech, took up the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award issue, saying the last award was announced in 2010. The premier said that when this issue was taken up in a meeting in Islamabad some time ago, he had formed a committee in this regard. “I have been told this that the provinces have given their names to represent them and the NFC meeting would be convened in August,” the premier said.
He said that under the 1 per cent of the divisible pool, which KP is getting for fighting the war against terrorism, Rs700 billion has been provided to the province to boost its law enforcement capacity, set up a Counter-Terrorism Department, and the safe city projects. He said that KP would continue to receive this fund till the elimination of terrorism.
The premier said that he would form another committee, which would meet the tribal elders, the KP governor, and the chief minister to discuss the issues raised by CM Gandapur to draft recommendations. He said that the federal government would also take the same to parliament.
‘Don’t tax ex-Fata’
A statement issued from the KP Chief Minister’s House said that the CM urged the federal government not to impose taxes on the erstwhile Fata and Pata regions, arguing that the local population was not financially capable of bearing such burdens. “These areas have been severely affected by the war on terror and require significant investment,” he stressed.
The CM asked the federal government to fulfil all promises made to the ex-Fata people. He demanded immediate release of compensation funds for displaced persons from these regions and called for an end to drone strikes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, citing civilian casualties.
He also demanded the immediate inclusion of the merged districts’ share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award. “We are not asking for another province’s share—we’re demanding our rightful due,” he said.
The CM also urged the federal government to release all pending dues owed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including net hydel profits and the province’s full share in the tobacco cess.
In his address, the CM urged the reinstatement of the traditional jirga system to sustainably resolve disputes in the merged districts. He also demanded KP’s inclusion in peace talks with neighbouring Afghanistan, warning that excluding the province would render the negotiations incomplete.
Bhasha dam meeting
In a separate meeting on the Bhasha dam, the PM asked the authorities to remove hurdles in the completion of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam, saying that the country’s self-reliance was linked to affordable electricity and agriculture. “The country’s self-dependence is linked with affordable electricity and agriculture, which requires increased water storage and efficient water usage,” the PM was quoted as saying in a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
The prime minister directed prioritising the completion of projects like Diamer-Bhasha Dam to establish an effective system for energy production and abundant water storage.
It may be noted that the energy and the water sectors will face significant cuts in the development budget, after the government planned to reduce the energy sector’s allocations to Rs144bn from Rs169bn this year, while slashing the water sector allocation to Rs109bn from Rs135bn this year.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal had said that until 2018, the estimated construction cost of the dam was Rs479bn, and Rs120bn had already been spent on land acquisition. However, the project cost increased significantly due to delays and unnecessary postponements during the previous government.
He suggested the dam and power projects be separated and the financing of the power project be obtained from the private sector. He further said that even after six years, the revised PC-1 of the project still had not been prepared.
He also said the future projects would be completed under the public-private partnership model to avoid delays in funding and completion. Diamer-Bhasha Dam will provide storage of 6.4 million acre-feet of water.

• Delegation meets UN chief, UNSC president
WASHINGTON: Coope­ration between Pakistan and India’s intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said on Tuesday.
The PPP chairman, who is currently leading a high-powered delegation as part of Pakistan’s diplomatic push to highlight India’s “unilateral aggression”, was speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters.
“I am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,” he said.
He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.
“With the intervention of the international community — and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio — we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,” said Mr Bhutto-Zardari. “This is a welcome first step, but it’s only a first step.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari emphasised that diplomacy and dialogue were the only “viable path to peace,” and reiterated Islamabad’s willingness to engage in a broad dialogue with New Delhi — including cooperation on counterterrorism.
“Pakistan would still like to cooperate with India to combat terrorism. We can’t leave the fate of 1.5 billion, 1.7 billion people in the hands of non-state actors and terrorists,” he said. “For them to decide, at a whim, that (when these) two nuclear-armed powers will go to war.”
He also criticised India’s effort to set a dangerous precedent by linking any terrorist attack in the region to the threat of war with Pakistan. “That’s untenable,” he said. “You can’t have no dispute resolution mechanisms between two nuclear-armed countries.”
He proposed the establishment of a mutually agreed platform where both sides could raise complaints, investigate terrorist incidents jointly, and work together to ensure accountability.
He also expressed alarm over India’s attempt to “weaponise water,” calling it a dangerous escalation.
“The mere threat to cut off the water supply of 200 million people is a violation of the UN Charter. Acting on this threat will be seen as an act of war by Pakistan,” he warned.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari compared India’s actions with Israel, saying: “India is being inspired by the Israeli government in all the wrong ways. Modi is the butcher of Kashmir and aspires to be the butcher of the Indus Valley civilisation.”

He warned that India’s actions threaten not only regional stability but also “undermine international treaties with global implications”.
UN meetings
Earlier, the Pakistani delegation met with UN Secretary-General Ant­ónio Guterres and the President of the UN Security Council, Amba­ssador Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett of Guyana, in New York.

Musk left his role as an official government employee last week, lauded by Trump for spearheading a federal spending cuts programme, but disagreements between the duo have been building.
“This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,” Musk posted on X, in by far his most caustic remarks on Trump’s spending plans.
 






“Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.” It was not Musk’s first comments on Trump’s so-called  “big, beautiful bill” which is set to add $3 million to US deficits over a 10-year horizon, despite deep cuts to health and food aid programmes.
But Musk’s previous criticism was restrained, with the ex-head of Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) task force offering only that it undermined his cost-cutting efforts.
On Tuesday he said that the bill — being considered by Congress — would burden  “citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.” The escalation in rhetoric indicated bitter hostilities between the White House and Musk, who donated almost $300 million to Trump’s election campaign but has recently voiced frustrations.
 
 

“The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill, it doesn’t change his opinion,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in a rapid response to Musk’s tweet.
“This is one big, beautiful bill, and he’s sticking to it.” As the world’s richest person bowed out of his role as Trump’s cost-cutter-in-chief, their relationship appeared on an even keel as the Republican hailed his fellow billionaire’s  “incredible service.”
Once inseparable
Trump even insisted that Musk was  “really not leaving” after a turbulent four months in which the South African born tycoon cut tens of thousands of jobs, shuttered whole agencies and slashed foreign aid. Musk was once almost inseparable from Trump, glued to his side on Air Force One, Marine One, in the White House and at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
The right-wing magnate’s DOGE led an ideologically-driven rampage through the federal government, with its young  “tech bros” slashing tens of thousands of jobs.

This was revealed by PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Tuesday.
Talking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after meeting the former prime minister, he said Mr Khan would himself lead the protest campaign announced by the party, from jail.
He said all instructions regarding the protest would be conveyed through opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan.
Mr Khan, through a message shared via his official X (formerly Twitter) account, had called on the public last week to prepare for a countrywide protest movement.
 







Gohar denies reports he is being removed from party chairmanship; says Gandapur won’t lead upcoming protest

The post had come a day after his sister, Aleema Khan, had proposed a “give-and-take formula” for his release.
Although the ex-premier does not have direct access to his social media account, PTI has not disclosed who manages his posts.
The message, posted in Mr Khan’s name, urged the masses to get ready for a nationwide protest movement, to be launched soon.
Roles of Gohar, Gandapur
Barrister Gohar also rejected “rumours” that he was being removed from the position of party chairman.
Replying to a question, he said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur would not lead the upcoming protest, adding that different personalities would be assigned different responsibilities.
In response to a query, Barrister Gohar said he had always favoured the dialogue and claimed that PTI had not closed its doors for the talks with the establishment.
When contacted, PTI’s political think-tank’s head Raoof Hasan explained that the title of the “founding chairman” gave the impression that he was “a retired person”.
“As Khan sahib has to lead the protest so he has decided to become patron-in-chief, which is a functional post. He is the boss and the position will further give an impression that Imran Khan is the boss of PTI,” he said.
Without elaborating, Mr Hasan said that after this decision, efforts would be made to keep Mr Khan in isolation and he may face further restrictions.
Similarly, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser defended Mr Khan’s decision to become patron-in-chief, saying that the decision had been made because of legal limitations, as he could not become the party chairman.
“Declaring him a patron-in-chief is no different from declaring himself a Rehbar, just as Khan Abdul Wali Khan became Rehbar of his party. Imran Khan will give the policy and direction,” he told Dawn.
Besides Wali Khan, Nawaz Sharif had also assumed the role of patron when he was disqualified from leading the PML-N following his conviction.
It may be recalled that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is hearing petitions challenging the PTI’s third intra-party in less than two years which was filed in March 2024 by one of PTI’s founding members Akbar S. Babar and four others. The PTI argues that the ECP has no powers to interfere in the internal affairs of any political party.
Raoof denies rifts within party
Mr Hasan also denied reports that Mr Khan had decided to become the patron-in-chief in an effort to save PTI from possible disintegration, due to groupings within the party.
A rift between the leaders of PTI has been visible for last over one year. Initially, a controversy over the appointment of Public Accounts Committee chairman started but it could not be settled till date.
On the other hand, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur was the head of the PTI’s provincial chapter, but recently, this responsibility has been given to Junaid Akbar and he was also nominated as the PAC chairman.
Surprisingly, Mr Khan initially directed Mr Akbar to resign as the PAC chairman and focus on the party’s provincial chapter, but later allowed him to continue to head the most powerful parliamentary committee.
Also, Mr Gandapur used to lead the protests and marches earlier, but this time it was decided that he would not lead the protests, while rift and press conferences by the KP ministers against each other and the chief minister are on record.

Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza’s Khan Yunis received 35 of those killed on Tuesday. Six others were received by Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah. In Gaza City, al-Shifa Hospital received 14 bodies, and three more were delivered to al-Ahli Arab Hospital, medical sources told Al Jazeera.
More than 180 Palestinians were wounded when Israeli forces opened fire on a group of Palestinians who were trying to approach the distribution centre in Rafah.
While the attacks on aid operations continued for a third consecutive day, a spokesperson for the Israeli military said, “We are trying to understand what happened”.

UN rights agency says obstructing access to food ‘constitutes a war crime’

The UN human rights office in Geneva said the impediment of access to food relief for civilians in Gaza “constitutes a war crime” and described the attacks on people trying to access food aid as “unconscionable”.
Head of the UN agency Volker Turk urged a prompt and impartial investigation into the killings.
A spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross said its field hospital in Rafah had received 184 casualties, adding that 19 of those were dead upon arrival, and eight died of their wounds shortly afterwards.
Video showed injured people being rushed to a medical centre on carts drawn by donkeys.
The US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation launched its first distribution sites last week in an effort to alleviate widespread hunger amongst Gaza’s 2.3 million people, most of whom have been forced to abandon their homes to flee fighting. The Foundation’s operation, which bypasses traditional aid groups, has been fiercely criticised by the UN and established charities which say it does not follow humanitarian principles.
The private group, which is endorsed by Israel, said it had distributed 21 truckloads of food on Tuesday and claimed that the reported violence had not happened on its site.
“This was an area well beyond our secure distribution site and control. We recognise the difficult nature of the situation and advise all civilians to remain in the safe corridor when travelling to our distribution sites.”

Dadu Deputy Commissio­ner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah said that initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by the rough landscape and strong winds.
However, he added, the winds eventually lost velocity allowing the fire to die down naturally. “Smoke is still rising from some areas, but flames have subsided,” he said.
The DC said it was not possible to bring in fire tenders due to the mountainous terrain. 
He said there were no casualties in the fire.
Residents of nearby villages, including Karo Koat, said the fire began on Monday evening and swiftly engulfed bushes and small mountain trees, creating thick plumes of smoke.
Since there was no motorable road in the mountainous terrain to reach the fire-hit area, aerial firefighting was the only option to control the blaze, the villagers said.
Shahoo Bozdar, a nomadic herder from the area, said wild animals were seen fleeing the affected area to safety.

The address came amid the visit of a high-level team — consisting of three former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec­­retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister —  for consultations at the United Nations. The team arrived in New York on Sunday.
Ex-FMs Bilawal, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua are members of the delegation.
Bilawal said Pakistan’s position was to hold a “comprehensive dialogue” with India that would include the issue of terrorism as well. Bilawal said Pakistan was the country where the “single largest number of terrorist attacks” occurred and was also the country with the single largest number of victims of terrorism.
Bilawal said the Pakistani delegation was concluding its visit to New York and the UN and had appealed to the international community to assist the country in its pursuit of peace. “Just as the international community played its role in encouraging India to agree to a ceasefire, it should also encourage to engage in a comprehensive dialogue with Pakistan so that we can address our issues and achieve peace,” he added.
 


Bilawal said he wanted to use the opportunity to share Pakistan’s perspective on the recent military conflict with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack, as well as the way forward.
Reiterating the “illegal strikes” launched by India as part of its ‘Operation Sindoor’ “in violation of the UN Charter, international law”, Bilawal said the attacks had targeted civilian infrastructure, places of worship, energy infrastructure and innocent women and children.
He said India had used the April 22 terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam as a premise for the strikes.
“We expressed our sympathy with the victims of terrorism and Pakistan has consistently and unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” he said, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had immediately expressed Pakistan’s willingness to India and the global community to be part of any impartial international investigation.
“We did so because we were confident our hands were clean and we had nothing to do with this terrorist attack. The Indian government refused Pakistan’s offer and chose instead to conduct their illegal strikes.
“Pakistan only ever acted in self-defence, we never initiated any violence against India,” Bilawal said, adding that the Pakistani military had responded with precision the night of the first Indian attack and “only targeted and downed six planes because we believed those were the ones to release their load on Pakistan”.
He said India subsequently launched missile strikes into Pakistan in the next two days and the latter “responded in kind”. “Due to the intervention of the international community, and I’d like here to particularly mention the role of US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State [Marco] Rubio, we did manage to achieve a ceasefire,” Bilawal added.
He said the above was a “welcome first step” but was “only a first step”. “I must emphasise that the global community today is less safe post this ceasefire and conflict than we were before simply because the threshold for full-blown military conflict between two nuclear-armed states has come down, it has not gone up,” the former FM added.
“We’ve seen during the course of this conflict how quickly the escalation ladder between our two countries rose and the concern is that the next time there is such an incident, there may not be time for the international community to intervene before things get alot worse. That is why it is absolutely important for Pakistan and the international community to continue to pursue dialogue and diplomacy as the only viable path to peace.”
“The military and political leadership of Pakistan and the country are not the caricature that India would like to paint of us,” he said, adding that politicians had fought terrorists on the frontline and paid a heavy cost while the military had confronted them on the battlefield and earned their honours and promotions.
He also pointed out that the Financial Action Task Force — the international watchdog against money laundering and financing of terrorism — had endorsed Pakistan’s taking measures to combat terror financing.
“It’s become too easy for wannabe hegemons to use the wolf whistle of terrorism to justify illegal actions and violent actions in Muslim countries and communities,” Bilawal said, adding that terrorism could not be confronted by India while using it as a political tool to demonise Muslims within, in occupied Kashmir and Pakistan.
Despite that, he said Pakistan would still like to cooperate with India in combatting terrorism and the fate of the region’s people could not be left in the hands of non-state actors and terrorists for them to decide that two nuclear-armed powers go to war.
“This is the new normal or abnormal that the Indian government is trying to impose on the region that if there is a terrorist attack anywhere in India or occupied Kashmir, it means war with Pakistan.”
Bilawal said a reciprocal attitude would mean war with India and such a situation was untenable, adding that nuclear-armed countries could not go without dispute resolution mechanisms.
He said there should be a mechanism in which Pakistan and India could bring any complaints to a mutually agreed forum where both worked together to identify, track and deliver justice to terrorists.
“In addition to this, there is a root cause [which] in this case in occupied Kashmir is the unresolved agenda of Kashmir before the UN Security Council” and the promises made by the international community and India to Kashmiris.
“If we continue to ignore this issue and allow that wound to fester, there will forever be a bone of contention between India and Pakistan.”
In addition, he said the most recent front opened by India was the weaponisation of water, adding that the violation of the Indus Waters Treaty must be condemned across the board and the precedent must not be allowed to be set.
He said the threat to cut Pakistan’s water supply was a violation of the UN Charter and any action on it would be seen as an act of war by Pakistan.
The PPP chairman pointed out that India positioned itself as a net security provider, and yet “India’s actions have shown as a result of this conflict that they’re a source of insecurity, not a source of security for the region.
“The true net security provider for our region and beyond will be peace between India and Pakistan.”

He said Trump had a unique opportunity to deliver on his commitment to peace, enjoying good relations with both countries. He added the delegation would be beginning its engagements in Washington DC from tomorrow and encourage US lawmakers and government officials to play their role in facilitating the peace process.
The delegation separately met UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and appreciated his proactive role in support of efforts for de-escalation and the offer of his good offices to advance dialogue and resolution of the Kashmir dispute.
 






The high-level team also briefed Ambassador Jerome Bonnafont, France’s permanent representative to the UN, about India’s aggression post-Pahalgam attack.
 






The Pakistani delegation is scheduled to arrive in Washington today, where it plans to engage with Rubio, other senior officials, lawmakers, and think tanks till June 6. The team will also visit London and Brussels. The visit coincides with the arrival of an Indian delegation in Washington on June 3, led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.
Yesterday, the nine-member Pak­is­tani delegation held a series of meetings at the UN Headquarters.
It briefed the permanent representatives of the UNSC’s elected members  besides itself — namely Algeria, Denmark, Greece, Guyana, Panama, Sierra Leone, Slovenia, Somalia and South Korea.
 






The group also engaged with envoys of the UNSC’s permanent me­m­bers.
According to a statement by Bilawal after the team’s meeting with China’s Ambassador Fu Cong, the two neighbours agreed “aggre­ssive posturing and unilateral actions threaten peace in the region and must be firmly opposed”.
In its briefing to Russia’s Ambassador Vasily Nebenzya, the delegation described India’s allegation as premature and lacking any credible investigation.
During the meeting with the United States’ UN envoy, Ambassador Dorothy Shea, Bilawal urged her country to play its role in ensuring comprehensive dialogue between India and Pakistan to address all outstanding issues.
 






Briefing to OIC representations
Earlier, the team met officials from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) officials to brief them on Pakistan’s stance.
Bilawal, while addressing the OIC Permanent Representatives, “categorically rejected India’s attempt to link Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident without any credible investigation or evidence”, according to a press release by Pakistan’s Mission to the UN.
He highlighted that the blame was “used as a pretext for unlawful military actions, including cross-border strikes, which targeted civilians and civilian infrastructure”.
During his meeting with the OIC envoys, PPP chairman expressed concern at India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, which Pakistan considered “a blatant act of weaponising water and a violation of international and treaty obligations”.
“He [Bilawal] made it plainly clear that we cannot allow this to become a new normal,” the statement read.
It continued that the PPP chairman stressed that “due to India’s belligerent aggression, the world has become a less safe place, with real and present implications for peace and security in South Asia”.
The former foreign minister went on to thank the OIC for its efforts and role aimed at mediation to de-escalate tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, highlighting that the “only path to peace is dialogue, engagement and diplomacy”.
“He [Bilawal] reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peace, restraint, and diplomacy, and called for the restoration of the Indus Waters Treaty, full respect for the ceasefire, and the resumption of a comprehensive dialogue with India, with the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute at its core,” the statement read.
 






 






Meanwhile, the permanent representatives of the OIC countries expressed their “appreciation for Pakistan’s transparent and timely briefing and reaffirmed their solidarity with Pakistan and the people of Jammu and Kashmir”.
“They reiterated their concern over worsening security situation in South Asia and stressed the importance of upholding the principles of the UN Charter and international law and in this regard, the sanctity of treaties, including the Indus Water Treaty,” the statement added.
Separately, the delegation also held a meeting with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) president for the month of June, Ambassador Carolyn Rodrigues-Birkett, who represents the Republic of Guyana.
 






The delegation emphasised that in the face of a growing trend of unilateralism and escalation, the UNSC must play its crucial role to ensure peace and conflict resolution.
It urged the UNSC to play a proactive role in promoting de-escalation, ensuring respect for international law and treaties and facilitating peaceful resolution of the disputes, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the Council’s resolutions.
Ambassador Rodrigues-Birkett reaffirmed the UNSC’s commitment to upholding international peace and security in line with its mandate.
Separate delegation briefs Russian FM
Separately, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) Syed Tariq Fatemi called on Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov upon the former’s arrival in Moscow this afternoon and briefed the Russian diplomat in detail about the recent developments in South Asia, according to a statement from the Embassy of Pakistan in Moscow.
Fatemi conveyed Pakistan’s perspective on the dangers of escalation as well as the dire consequences of India’s threat to reduce the flow of the Indus Waters Treaty, by holding the treaty in a so-called “abeyance”.
While discussing Pakistan-India relations, Lavrov stressed Russia’s support for the promotion of normal relations between the two countries and its positive effect in the region.
 






The SAPM conveyed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s good wishes and the desire of the Pakistani leadership to expand bilateral cooperation with Russia across a wide array of subjects, including energy, connectivity, trade, among others.
Lavrov expressed satisfaction over the steadily growing bilateral cooperation with Pakistan, placing particular emphasis on important projects, such as the establishment of new steel mills as well as the connectivity projects.
He also stated that Russia looked forward to working closely with Pakistan, within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, especially in the field of counter-terrorism.
SAPM Fatemi also delivered PM Shehbaz’s letter addressed to President Vladimir Putin.</p><small>2025-06-03 19:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/03221702cbaa963.jpg?r=221839' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915209/hafizabad-police-launch-raids-to-arrest-culprits-after-wife-gang-raped-in-front-of-husband' target='_blank'><strong>Hafizabad police launch raids to arrest culprits after wife gang-raped in front of husband</strong></a><br><p>Police on Tuesday launched raids to arrest eight suspects who allegedly abducted a couple in Hafizabad and subjected them to physical and sexual assault.
The first information report (FIR) was filed by the husband today at the Kasoki Police Station under Sections 148 (Rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (Unlawful assembly), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 354-A (assault or use of criminal force to woman and stripping her of her clothes ), 355 (causing hurt by dangerous means), 365 (kidnapping), 375-A (rape), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint to commit the theft), 496A (enticing away a woman) and 506B (criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR said the incident occurred on April 25 around 7pm when the complainant and his wife were on a motorcycle when they stopped for a bit. As the wife got off the motorcycle, a man came towards them who verbally abused and hit her, it stated.
A group of armed men later arrived and took the couple to a secluded place near a graveyard. The FIR detailed how the couple were subjected to physical violence, sexual assault, and robbery.
The complainant said in the FIR, “We were both tied up and they made me lie down on the ground,” adding that his wife was “gang-raped despite me repeatedly pleading with the suspects to stop”.
The suspects took away two mobile phones, two tola of gold and Rs2,500 in cash, the FIR added.
It further said, “The suspects forced the couple to have sexual intercourse at gunpoint,” adding that they filmed it and blackmailed the victims.
The FIR also said, “We delayed reporting the incident because the suspects had threatened us, saying that if we took legal action or got a medical examination done, they would kill us,” adding that the suspects had uploaded the footage of the assault on the internet.
The husband requested a case to be registered against the culprits for abduction, rape, sexual assault and robbery, saying that the suspects be arrested and punished at the earliest, naming four of the total eight suspects.
Hafizabad District Police Officer Atif Nazeer told Dawn.com that a case was filed against the suspects, who will be arrested within 24 to 48 hours.
“The suspects were being identified using video footage and police raids are currently underway,” he said. “The couple has undergone a medical examination, and investigations into other legal aspects are in process.”
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
In March, Punjab police arrested three suspects for allegedly gang-raping a woman in Lahore, according to a statement by the police.
 
 

Earlier this year, the provincial government planned to increase the number of Special Sexual Offences Investigation Units (SSOIUs) across the province to investigate scheduled offences under the Anti-Rape (Investigation & Trial) Act of 2021 and offer better services to women.
Around 150 more units would be added Punjab-wide to probe the scheduled offences in this regard.
Since a large number of cases were being reported and registered, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz instructed Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal to enhance the number of units and appoint designated trained officers to help out women complainants.</p><small>2025-06-03 19:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607636-nha-enforces-extra-toll-tax-for-vehicles-without-m-tag' target='_blank'><strong>NHA enforces extra toll tax for vehicles without M-Tag</strong></a><br><p>

According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the complainant (victim) told the police that he was sexually assaulted by his teacher six days ago.
“I had not told anyone in my family because I was afraid of their reaction. But I gathered the courage and informed my father about the entire ordeal. I want justice for myself and demand police action against the suspect, who used to molest students in the mosque,” the FIR read.
Charsadda police have lodged the FIR under sections 377-B (punishment for sexual abuse) of Pakistan Penal Code and 53 (sexual abuse)  of Child Protection Act.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Charsadda District Police Officer Suleman Zafar confirmed the incident, saying “I have taken notice of the incident and have instructed the respective area sub-divisional police officer to take prompt action.”
The FIR was filed on the victim’s complaint within the limits of the Nasta police station.
“Further interrogation is underway but the preliminary report says that the boy was a student of religious studies,” DPO Zafar said. “The alleged suspect is a resident of Mohmand district but was living in Charsadda.”
He said the suspect, who is at large, would be arrested very soon and justice would be ensured for the victim’s family at all costs, adding that the elements involved in such heinous crimes would not be forgiven under any circumstances.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to the civil society report ‘Cruel Numbers 2024’ by Sahil that was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
These included reported cases of child sexual abuse, abduction, missing children, and child marriages. It shows that nine children were abused per day during the year. A gender-divide analysis indicates that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.
Earlier today, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) exposed a child sexual exploitation gang operating in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh district, leading to the arrest of two suspects and the recovery of ten children.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry detailed that 178 first information reports have been lodged against child exploitation, 198 suspects have been arrested, and fourteen were jailed between four to ten years.</p><small>2025-06-03 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607619-bilawal-bhutto-addresses-presser-at-un-headquarters-on-pakistan-india-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal urges world to press India for comprehensive dialogue with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

The metropolis continued to witness faint tremors today, taking the tally since Sunday to 20, according to data provided by the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Experts have previously pointed out that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.
“I have also studied engineering […] these (low-scale tremors) are a good thing. The earth is releasing its energy,” CM Shah said, responding to reporters’ queries about yesterday’s jail break incident in Karachi.
 
 

He explained that if the earth released its seismic energy altogether, it could result in a major earthquake. “But if it releases in bits, then it is better — nothing is actually better — but saves us from a big tragedy,” Murad added.
The most recent tremor occurred at 11:52am and measured 2.0 on the Richter scale, with its epicentre located 23 kilometres east of Malir, according to the PMD’s data.
Since Sunday — when the series of minor quakes began — the total of tremors recorded near Malir is nine, five near the Defence Housing Authority, three near Quaidabad, along with one each near Gadap Town, Korangi and DHA City on the outskirts of Karachi.
The 3.6-magnitude jolt from Sunday evening was the most significant, while the lowest measured was of 2.0 magnitude from today morning.
Karachi Chief Meteorologist Amir Hyder Laghari pointed out yesterday that there was a historical fault line which has become activated, causing frequent earthquakes in the city.
He said the fault is releasing its seismic energy, and when it’s spent, the tremors’ magnitude will reduce. Laghari added he expected the small-scale jolts to end within a week.
Murad’s remarks today echoed opinions voiced by Laghari and other experts, who have said that the chances of a major quake in Karachi are low.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Eurasian and Indian — according to geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.
Dr Imran Ahmed Khan of Karachi University’s Department of Geography said an imbalance between the Indian, Eurasian and Arabian plates may be causing the tremors in the city. He added that the quakes will likely stop when a balance between the plates has been achieved.
 
 

Dr Adnan Khan, associate professor at the KU’s Department of Geology, noted that a huge earthquake was unlikely in Karachi as the city was situated far from active plate boundaries.
“Karachi lies on what’s called a ‘passive margin’, so the chances of a big earthquake happening there are low. Small earthquakes do happen sometimes, usually between 3 and 4 on the Richter scale, but they are not dangerous,” he added.
Dr Imran explained that the Indian tectonic plate is moving upward by about 4 to 5 centimetres every year in the Himalayan region.
At the same time, the Eurasian plate is pushing against it. As these two plates press against each other, they build up pressure, and when the pressure becomes too much, it rebounds and is released as energy, causing earthquakes.
The country had witnessed around 20 low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.
In April, jolts were felt in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab — including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore — twice that month.</p><small>2025-06-03 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0312070154dfbf8.jpg?r=221523' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915165/sindh-ig-says-78-of-213-escaped-prisoners-from-karachis-malir-jail-recaptured' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh IG says 78 of 213 escaped prisoners from Karachi’s Malir jail recaptured</strong></a><br><p>Over two hundred inmates managed to escape from District Prison Malir in Karachi last night, the Sindh police chief confirmed on Tuesday, adding that 78 were recaptured while one was shot dead.
Police officials earlier said the prisoners broke through the jail’s outer wall, which had been weakened due to the multiple low-intensity tremors felt in the area since Sunday. Police cordoned off the whole area and no one was allowed to enter or leave without ascertaining their identity.
Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Ghulam Nabi Memon on Tuesday told Dawn.com that over 200 prisoners managed to escape from Malir prison late on Monday night when they were brought out from their barracks for counting due to an earthquake, out of them 78 were recaptured while teams are being constituted to re-arrest the remaining 138.
Memon, who visited the jail earlier today, said that as per his assessment and briefings of jail and police officials, after the earthquake in the area, the jail administration brought an estimated 2,000 prisoners languishing in the jail from their barracks for counting at around 12:45am.
“Most of the prisoners were drug addicts,” he noted. “The addicts’ state of mind is such that they tend to develop mob psychology. Thus, when such an atmosphere was created inside the prison, the prisoners ran by opening the door of the jail,” he elaborated.
The police chief said FC personnel deployed at the prison resorted to massive aerial firing to push them back. He said the FC fired an estimated 700 shots. He said there were an estimated 2,000 prisoners, and 213 of them managed to escape.
The law enforcers launched an operation, recapturing 78 prisoners. “During the action, one prisoner was shot dead while two others were injured,” confirmed the Sindh IG. He said the situation was now under control.

The Sindh police head said they are setting up teams to re-arrest the remaining 138 escaped prisoners. “One of the escaped prisoners was brought back to the jail by his mother,” he added. The police and jail administration had information about all escaped prisoners.
To a question, the provincial police head opined ostensibly there would be “some lapses” and the prisoners, finding an opportunity, managed to escape.
However, he said the Sindh government has decided to set up an inquiry committee to ascertain the circumstances which led to the incident and fix responsibility for it.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that one unidentified prisoner aged around 45 years old was brought dead to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre with a firearm injury. He was pronounced dead on arrival. “Doctors are waiting for police papers to conduct his post-mortem,” she added
The police surgeon said four other prisoners with gunshot injuries were also brought to the hospital for treatment.
They were identified as Mohammed Tahir, aged 28, who sustained a bullet injury on his left arm with no exit wound; Abdul Hadi, aged 25, who suffered firearm wounds on his hip joint and thigh; and the third prisoner, 35-year-old Akhter Naeem, who got a gunshot wound on his glutes.
The police surgeon said two policemen — namely Sikander, aged 22, and Mohammed Shamraiz, aged 40 — were also injured during the assault by the prisoners, adding that they were brought to the hospital for treatment of abrasions on their feet, back and neck pain.
While addressing a press conference in Karachi, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said that the government has removed the inspector general (IG) of prisons and the deputy inspector general (DIG) of prisons. “The new IG will be appointed today, and an inquiry committee will be formed as well,” he said.
He assured that there was no reason to panic or worry over the incident, emphasising that the police and FC personnel had “bravely” worked through the night to capture the inmates.
When asked by a reporter if this was an act of terrorism, he said it was not, highlighting that the jailbreak followed the earthquake tremors. Memon also reiterated that he would wait for the inquiry committee’s report.
The senior minister urged the parents of the inmates to tell them to surrender themselves.
CM Murad vows probe into ‘wrong decision’ to let prisoners out of cells
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah termed the incident “alarming” and asserted that action would be taken against those who made the “wrong” decision to let the prisoners gather in the open ground.
Responding to media queries after an event in Karachi, CM Murad said: “I do not want to say anything judgmental, but my initial thought is that it was wrong to let them out [into the ground].”
He detailed that jolts of such minor magnitude were a “good thing” as the earth releases its seismic energy in bits instead of a massive quake.
Stating that there were “some concerns” among the prisoners amid earthquakes yesterday, the Sindh CM noted that no one was usually allowed to be outside their cells after 6pm but the inmates were last night, due to which they assembled into a mob.

Murad said: “Definitely, those who made this wrong decision would be punished […] There are more than 6000 prisoners in the Malir jail.
“As far as I know, they also snatched weapons and there was also firing,” Murad noted, adding that one prisoner died.
CM Murad said the incident would be investigated, highlighting that most of those who escaped had “committed petty crimes” and, according to the latest details, there was no “major terrorist or foreigner” among them.
“My request to them (escaped prisoners) would be to surrender, otherwise, their involvement in the jail break incident will amount to terrorism or bigger cases,” he added.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar had also visited the Malir prison last night. Sindh Prisons Minister Ali Hasan Zardari had earlier taken notice of the jailbreak and sought a report from the IG and DIG prisons.
IG Memon telephoned and discussed the incident with Sindh Prisons IG Qazi Nazir, said a statement issued by the police chief’s spokesperson Syed Saad Ali.
Memon said police will provide all possible support to recapture the escaped prisoners. “Due to the timely response of police and other law enforcement agencies, many prisoners were immediately caught,” he said.
“Prisoners of drugs and minor offences are kept in Malir jail,” he said, adding that the Prisons Department and Malir Jail administration kept a complete record of every prisoner.
He continued that police teams have been formed to arrest the escaped prisoners. The senior superintendent of Malir police also gave a detailed briefing about the measures being taken to arrest the escaped prisoners. He said police cordoned off the entire area after the jailbreak.
Utilise all available resources to arrest absconding prisoners: Lanjar
Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar issued directives to utilise all available resources to arrest the absconding prisoners, emphasising that technical-based intelligence must be used to ensure swift apprehension of the escapees.
Additionally, he instructed that police teams should focus particularly on intelligence gathering and reconnaissance in their efforts, and that all incoming information must be followed up without exception.
He stated that surveillance and monitoring of hotels and suburban areas in all districts must be ensured.
Lanjar added that in actions related to the arrest of the escaped prisoners, all district police officers must not only ensure their own supervision but also regularly brief their officers and personnel on the overall efforts.

On the night of Sunday to Monday, “an individual with an uncovered face entered the prayer room, grabbed a copy of the Holy Quran, set it on fire then dropped it outside the building before fleeing,” the council of mosques in the Rhone region said.
The police source said an investigation had begun into the incident.
The attack comes after a man who had posted racist videos shot dead his Tunisian neighbour and badly wounded a Turkish man in the southern town of Puget-sur-Argens on Saturday.
The suspected killer, a Frenchman born in 1971, fled the scene in a car but was arrested not far away after his partner alerted police.
According to Le Parisien newspaper, the suspect said he “swore allegiance to the French flag” and called on the French to “shoot” people of foreign origin in one of his videos posted on social media.
Anti-terrorism prosecutors have taken over the investigation into the case, the first such racist attack linked to the far right to be dealt with as “terrorism” since their office was set up in 2019.
In a separate incident in April, a man stabbed a Malian man to death in a mosque in April, a case being handled by regional prosecutors.
France is home to the largest Muslim community in the European Union, as well as the largest Jewish population outside Israel and the United States.
There has also been a rise in reported attacks against members of France’s Jewish community since Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, and the Israeli military responded with a devastating military offensive on the Gaza Strip that has killed over 54,000 people.
France’s Holocaust memorial and three Paris synagogues and a restaurant were vandalised with paint overnight on Saturday.
A Turkish-born man who burned a Holy Quran in London was on Monday found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence.
Sweden has seen a series of burnings of the holy book, most notably by Iraqi Christian Salwan Momika. He was shot dead in January.</p><small>2025-06-03 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/032051568f83ecb.jpg?r=205354' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915208/pm-shehbaz-sets-up-committee-vows-to-resolve-all-issues-concerning-kp' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz sets up committee, vows to resolve all issues concerning KP</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday vowed to resolve all the issues afflicting Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and set up a committee for the task, Radio Pakistan reported.
Addressing a representative jirga in Peshawar, he said the committee would deliberate on all demands and issues raised by the KP chief minister.
He added that the committee would sit together with tribal elders and the KP governor and chief minister to formulate recommendations in this regard, further saying that the federal government would give serious attention to the recommendations to benefit the province’s valiant people.
 
 

Shehbaz affirmed the immense sacrifices rendered by the people of KP in the fight against terrorism and said the federal government would stand by the province until the complete eradication of the menace.
The prime minister said that KP had received Rs700 billion since 2010 under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award as its one per cent share allocated for anti-terrorism efforts.
These funds were released to strengthen the provincial police force, develop the Counter-Terrorism Department and enhance the capacity of law enforcement agencies, he added.
“The decision to allocate 1pc of the NFC Award for KP, agreed by all provinces, was just and appropriate decision, as KP has remained the frontline province in the war against terrorism,” he said.
Highlighting the province’s unwavering commitment and support to Pakistan, the prime minister said that KP’s people had voted in favour of the country during the referendum and had stood by the armed forces through all challenges.
“The sacrifices of KP’s people who laid down their lives and sustained injuries for the defence of Pakistan are deeply revered and will be remembered in golden words,” he added.
 


Referring to the Army Public School attack on December 16, 2014, the prime minister paid tribute to the students and teachers who lost their lives in the brutal incident.
 
 

Speaking on recent security developments, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan had given a strong response to last month’s unprovoked Indian aggression under the leadership of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
He reiterated that Pakistan’s decisive retaliation had frustrated India’s nefarious plans, adding that “India will never forget this decisive response of Pakistan.”
The prime minister further shared that during recent visits to Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan, leaders of these countries expressed joy over Pakistan’s “historic victory” against India.
 
 

He said that Indian Prime Minister Modi was left “frustrated and in a state of panic” after the defeat.
Reaffirming Pakistan’s rights under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, the prime minister asserted that India could not deprive Pakistan of its rightful share of water and suspend the treaty unilaterally.
He emphasised the need to expand existing water storage capacity and accelerate work on major dam projects, including Diamer Bhasha and Dasu dams.
Calling for national unity in the face of external threats, PM Shehbaz appreciated the people of KP for offering special prayers for the country’s success against India.
The jirga was attended by KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, COAS Munir, federal and provincial ministers, senators, parliamentarians, the Peshawar corps commander and the provincial chief secretary and police chief.</p><small>2025-06-03 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607602-russia-keen-to-deepen-ties-with-pakistan-under-sco-framework-lavrov-tells-sapm-fatemi' target='_blank'><strong>Russia keen to deepen ties with Pakistan under SCO framework, Lavrov tells SAPM Fatemi</strong></a><br><p>

A first information report (FIR) had been filed yesterday evening at the Sumbal police station against an unidentified man on the complaint of Sana’s mother, Farzana Yousaf, invoking Section 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The teenager was well-known for her social media activities, with nearly 800,000 followers on her TikTok account and almost 500,000 on her Instagram account.
Addressing a press conference, Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said the culprit was a 22-year-old man arrested from Faisalabad and termed it a case of “repeated rejections”.
“A beast, cold-blooded murderer is now in the law’s grip,” IG Rizvi announced, adding that the man had tried to contact Sana repeatedly and was being “rejected by her again and again”.

The police chief said the culprit wanted to establish contact with the social media influencer and “become friends” with her.
IG Rizvi described the man as having done matriculation and hailing from a lower-middle-income family, with “no source of income”.
The IG highlighted that the police conducted 11 raids — three in the federal capital and the rest in various cities of Punjab, with multiple raids in the Faisalabad district.
He detailed that the suspect had taken Sana’s mobile phone in a bid to wipe out the evidence but it had been recovered, along with the weapon of offence.
IG Rizvi noted that the man had “tried his best to contact” Sana on her birthday on May 29. “He reached her home and tried to meet her for seven to eight hours but failed.”
The officer added that yesterday, the culprit made another similar attempt for the same amount of time but could not succeed. “First, it was a cellular rejection. Now, it was a physical mode of rejection.”
Rizvi asserted it was “necessary to give a clear message that if any of our sister or daughter or youngster is becoming a social media influencer, and pursuing it as a profession, […] as a hobby and even as their bread and butter, we have to encourage it”.
 
 

The Islamabad police chief termed the murder a “very challenging case”, stressing that arresting the perpetrator in the “shortest time possible was necessary”.
“It was a blind murder; there was no clue, things were not clear, and it was further attempted to give it another angle, even though the aim of taking the mobile was to wipe out the clues,” he said, listing the hurdles faced by the police.
IG Rizvi appreciated members of the social, electronic and print media, stating that “many leads” came from journalists, who “offered their services in analysing social media”.
He also hailed seven police teams, as well as officials of the Crime Investigation Agency, for their efforts.
Earlier today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed the arrest in a post on X.
“The incident occurred yesterday in Islamabad when a young girl was murdered by a masked accused,” the minister said, adding that the suspect was arrested at around 12pm.
Naqvi stated that the police have recovered the murder weapon and pistol from the man, as well as the mobile phone used by the slain girl. The suspect has confessed to the murder, he added.
 






In the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the mother said that a man with a pistol in his hand entered their house suddenly at around 5pm and “shot straight at my daughter with the intention to kill”.
She added that two shots struck Sana in her chest, injuring her severely. The girl was taken to a hospital but she had succumbed to her wounds, the FIR added.
The mother described the suspect as having a “smart appearance, moderate physique and height”, and dressed in a black shirt and pants. She asserted that she and her sister-in-law, Lateefa Shah, were eyewitnesses to the incident and could identify the suspect if they saw him in person.
Farzana detailed that her 15-year-old son was not present at the house as he had gone to their native village in Upper Chitral, while her sister-in-law was visiting them for a few days.
 
 

In January, a man who recently brought his family back to Quetta from the United States confessed to shooting his 15-year-old daughter dead, motivated by his disapproval of her TikTok content, according to police.
The same month, two TikToker men died in separate incidents in Lahore after their pistols went off accidentally in Lahore.
More than 54 million people use TikTok in Pakistan, with authorities blocking the video-sharing app several times in recent years over content deemed objectionable.
The platform was banned four times in 2021 alone. It is currently accessible, with stringent moderation in place and complying with requests to remove certain content.</p><small>2025-06-03 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/03182412dbd0b47.jpg?r=182646' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915195/nccia-busts-german-led-child-sexual-exploitation-gang-in-muzaffargarh' target='_blank'><strong>NCCIA busts German-led child sexual exploitation gang in Muzaffargarh</strong></a><br><p>National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has exposed a child sexual exploitation gang operating in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh district, leading to the arrest of two suspects and the recovery of ten children.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry made the revelation during a press conference in Islamabad, saying the NICCIA has uncovered a “huge network” during an operation conducted on May 23.
He said an international gang masterminded by a German citizen was operating a child sexual exploitation group in Muzaffargarh where children were groomed.
“They set up a small club where children aged 6-10 years were taught games. They provided state-of-the-art facilities and modern cameras,” he said.
He added that children from disadvantaged families were “brought there, given money, and then blackmailed” to exploit them, and “their videos were uploaded on the dark web daily and sold for thousands of dollars.”
“Some videos were live-streamed and seen around the world from Muzaffargarh,” the state minister said. “The network was run by a German national and all efforts will be made to arrest him.”
Providing further information, he said fifty children had been victimised by the grooming gang, while “ten children were recovered and six were handed over to the child protection bureau.”
He mentioned that on May 23, the NCCIA launched an operation lasting five hours with assistance from other agencies, as a result of which two suspects were arrested.
“Unfortunately, the families and parents of some children were also involved in the nefarious crime and action has been initiated against them as well,” Chaudhry said.
He said the NCCIA had been working diligently against financial scams, harassment, and other cybercrime, adding that financial scams had become common due to the easy availability of mobile phones and the agency had been taking action after receiving complaints.
The minister went on to say that the workforce of the agency should be increased threefold and a branch should be set up in every district. “The interior minister and prime minister have been requested to increase funds for the NCCIA in the budget,” he said.
Chaudhry added that an international organisation, the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), provides information and the NCCIA takes prompt action.
He detailed that 178 first information reports have been lodged against child exploitation, 198 suspects have been arrested, and fourteen were jailed between four to ten years.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to the civil society report ‘Cruel Numbers 2024’ by Sahil that was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
These included reported cases of child sexual abuse, abduction, missing children, and child marriages. It shows that nine children were abused per day during the year. A gender-divide analysis indicates that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.</p><small>2025-06-03 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607581-very-hot-dry-weather-expected-during-eid-holidays' target='_blank'><strong>Very hot, dry weather expected during Eid holidays</strong></a><br><p>

The Mina Emergency Hospital is one of 15 such facilities operating just a few weeks a year around the annual pilgrimage to Islam’s holiest sites, which in 2024 saw more than 1,300 people die in the desert heat.
Saudi authorities hope to head off a fatal repeat of last year’s pilgrimage when temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius.
 
 

Temperatures this year are forecast to exceed 40 degrees Celsius as one of the world’s largest annual religious gatherings, bringing together devotees from around the globe, officially commences on Wednesday.
So far, authorities have recorded 44 cases of heat exhaustion.
Abdullah Asiri, Saudi Arabia’s deputy minister for population health, told AFP at the Mina hospital that “the focus is on heat-related conditions because the Haj coincides with extreme heat”.
Brimming with staff but no patients just yet, the hospital is part of the kingdom’s efforts to prepare for “the worst case scenario” after pilgrims descend on Mina, Asiri said.

Defying the scorching heat, pilgrims have already started to flock to Makkah.
As of Sunday, more than 1.4 million pilgrims had arrived in Saudi Arabia for the multi-day pilgrimage, according to officials.
Makkah’s Grand Mosque is serviced by the largest cooling system in the world, according to Saudi state television, with enormous fans and cooled pavements dotting the massive complex.
But outside, hiding from the heat can prove challenging.
Increased capacity
Some pilgrims wear caps or carry umbrellas, but others walk on foot without any protection from the sun, like Palestinian Rabah Mansour, 70, who said that after a lifetime of working outside as a farmer, “heat doesn’t bother me”.
“I have been working in the fields since I was a child,” he said, as sweat trickled down his face.
While many pilgrims may be overcome with religious fervour, Asiri warned devotees against unnecessarily exposing themselves to harsh conditions.
Badr Shreiteh, another Palestinian pilgrim, told AFP that he believed such hardships on the Haj trail would increase the blessings he reaps.
“As you can see, we’re dripping with sweat,” he said, adding: “The more hardship we endure, the more reward we gain.”
According to Asiri, of the health ministry, a total of 50,000 healthcare workers and administrative staff have been mobilised for the Haj, far exceeding previous years’ numbers.
More than 700 hospital beds are ready, equipped with fans to treat severe cases of heat illnesses.
“Capacity this year has been expanded by more than 60 per cent compared to last year,” Asiri said, expecting greater numbers of patients.
“That’s why we are doing all of these measures,” he said.
Last year, medical staff treated 2,764 pilgrims for heat exhaustion and other heat-related conditions, according to the health ministry.
‘Challenge’
To prevent people from needing hospitalisation in the first place, 71 emergency medical points have been set up around Makkah’s holy sites with a focus on “treating patients on the ground before their case deteriorates”, said Asiri.
On the second day of Haj, pilgrims will head to Mount Arafat, climbing it and reciting prayers for the whole day.
Asiri said pilgrims can stay in the shade.
“Most of the heat-related illnesses that happen in Arafat is because people think that they must be under the sun,” he said.
“You don’t have to be outside your tent during Arafat. You don’t have to climb the mountain,” he added, citing no religious obligation to do so, “and it’s very risky from a health point of view”.
Haj Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah told AFP earlier that thousands of misting fans and more than 400 water cooling units have been deployed.
Authorities built cooled walkways, including a newly completed four-kilometre pathway leading to Arafat.
Last year’s Haj deaths were a high-profile example of the havoc wrought by heat in 2024, which the Copernicus Climate Change Service said was the hottest ever recorded.
Abdul Majid Ati, from the Philippines, said there is “extreme heat, but there are also times that we are inside the (Grand mosque) — it’s extreme cold because of the tiles and of the aircon”.
“We take this as a challenge and a test of our moral character. “</p><small>2025-06-03 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607569-pm-shehbaz-assures-cm-gandapur-of-addressing-kps-issues-with-seriousness' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz assures CM Gandapur of addressing KP's issues with 'seriousness'</strong></a><br><p>
