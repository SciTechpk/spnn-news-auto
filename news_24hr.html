Air pollution has become one of the most pressing public health and environmental crises facing Pakistan, and Lahore in particular is no stranger to this phenomenon.
The conference is being organised in collaboration with the United Nations and the Government of Punjab. The Pakistan Business Council will be a knowledge partner, while Ipsos, Climate Forward Pakistan and Carbon Track will be research partners.
The conference sheds light on actionable solutions, fosters high-level dialogue, and drives collective action for cleaner air in Pakistan. Sessions will cover a broad range of themes, including governance and policy frameworks, financing clean air, smog and industrial responsibility, judicial activism, public health impacts, nationwide air quality standards, and regional cooperation on transboundary pollution.
 


Notable speakers expected to speak at today’s moot include Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, federal and provincial ministers, Supreme Court’s Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Ayesha Malik, and Lahore High Court’s Justice Jawad Hassan.
Senior United Nations’ officials, global health experts, economists, and corporate leaders are also set to give their insights on the pressing matter.

12:28pm — The very air we breathe has become our enemy, says Ahsan Iqbal
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal termed the ‘Breathe Pakistan’ initiative “very timely”. “This conference is not only about pollution; it is about leadership, partnership, and collaboration.”
“When we look out the window, the beautiful bustling city of Lahore, we find it suffocating. Its vibrant heart is struggling and its lungs are choked.

“The very air we breathe has become our enemy.”


11:52am — Short break

11:45am — ‘EPA to be expanded to entire Punjab next year’
Silwat Saeed also highlighted the various measures being taken by the Punjab government, including an environment protection force, which she said is being experimented with for the first time in the province.
“This is actually providing miraculous results,” the Punjab environment department official said, noting that the teams had specialised equipment with them.
Saeed said the force, currently in Lahore, will also be expanded to the rest of Punjab, with 10 industrial hotspots to be prioritised initially and the entire province next year.

11:42am — ‘Air quality monitors in Punjab increased from 2 to 41 in past year’
Silwat Saeed detailed Punjab’s three-pronged approach to tackle air pollution, which comprises first monitoring the quality of the air we breathe, then mitigating it, and then finally engaging with the citizenry to inform and empower them.
“Without localised data, there is nothing that can work. […] In earlier decades, we were sitting in the dark, we didn’t know what was wrong. Now that has changed.”
The Punjab official stated that the number of air quality monitors has increased from two to 41 in the past year. “Within the next 6-7 months, the number would be 100 for the entire Punjab.”
She further noted that a detailed study was currently being undertaken by the Punjab government to see why the air in the province had pollutants that “are affecting our health”.

11:38am — ‘First time that Punjab’s development programme has been climate-tagged’
The Punjab environment department official asserted that it was for the first time that the province’s development programme had been “climate-tagged”.
“You would be seeing that the transport sector has been given around Rs269bn that has been tagged for climate change mitigation and adaptation programmes,” she said, referring to the largest allocation.
Others were Rs95bn for raising awareness, Rs65bn for capacity building, Rs62bn for water resources, Rs47bn for forestry, and Rs16bn for agriculture and livestock.
Saeed noted that it was a cross-sectoral issue and the “real villain is not a single entity which you can point out and fix”.

11:30am — Pakistan located in a ‘geographical trap’, adding to its pollution woes: Silwat Saeed
Silwat Saeed noted that urbanisation has also resulted in the “huge menace of smog”, but it was also a manifestation of deteriorating air quality, which becomes palpable because of temperature inversions.
The Punjab official further highlighted that Pakistan was located in a “geographical trap” that added to its pollution woes.
“The northern area of this entire region is actually the foothill of the Himalayas, and the foothills would act as a lid when all the pollutants from the region get trapped and then they whirl around within the cities in the region, not only in Pakistan but also in India, Bangladesh and Nepal.”

11:24am — Session 2 on a ‘greener Punjab’ begins
Silwat Saeed, Punjab’s Environment Protection and Climate Change Department secretary, kicked off the day’s second session, ‘A Greener Punjab To Combat Air Pollution’.
She appreciated DawnMedia for “uniting” her department to speak about how environmental governance was being transformed at a sub-national level.
“This problem is not some distant abstract thing. It is right in front of us.”
She noted that it was not the first time the world was seeing the issue of air pollution, mentioning the advancement in industrialisation in Europe during the last century.

11:20am — ‘About 5pc of entire global GDP lost because of pollution’
Mohamed Yahya said that “about $6 trillion annually, about 5pc of the entire global GDP, is lost because of pollution”.
“There’s no better and more heartbreaking place to discuss this issue. I want to congratulate the Dawn group [for organising the conference].”
Recalling last year’s smog, the UN official said the stain was so profound here in Lahore that it was visible from space. “A glaring testament of what needs to be done.”

“The smog is our creation.”


11:18am — ‘Silent pandemic’ of air pollution a global emergency: UN resident coordinator
“The science is clear,” UN’s Yahya said, adding that the numbers should shake everyone. Citing WHO estimates, he pointed out that “99pc of us in this room and 99pc of humanity breathes air that is unsafe”.
“Let that number be something that galvanises us. This is not a distant threat. It’s a global siege.  About seven million people lose their lives every year because of the air they breathe.
“It’s the single greatest environmental risk of our lives and a silent pandemic.”

**11:13am —  What happens when the air we breathe turns against us?: UN’s Yahya
UN’s resident and humanitarian coordinator for Pakistan, Mohamed Yahya, termed the air we breathe as “our most intimate and non-negotiable relationship with our world”.
“It’s not an abstract concept but a fabric of life itself, the substance that fuels our cells, our lungs, our dreams. But what happens when that very substance turns against us? When the air we breathe becomes a slow-acting poison?” he asked.

**11:10am — Musadik Malik notes China leading solar revolution after smog problems 10-15 years ago
The climate change minister noted that the South Asian cities of Lahore and New Delhi were not mentioned when the issue of the most polluted cities was highlighted 10-15 years ago.
“The names mentioned were Beijing and Shanghai, and now they are providing 60-75pc of the world’s solar technology. Not only did they fix their cities, but they also led the solar revolution throughout the world to counter the problem they were facing”.

11:04am — Policy in works to update old oil refineries: minister Malik
Hailing the “amazing initiatives” being carried out under CM Maryam Nawaz, the climate minister said 8,000 to 10,000 bikes have been distributed, 600 or 500 e-buses are on the roads or will be launched, and anti-smog guns have been installed.
“We will keep bringing higher standards for fuel. We’ve made a policy to update our old refineries … can be brought up to the best standards in the world,” the federal minister said, adding that incentives were to be given as well and some companies were working on the policy.

10:55am — Climate minister Musadik Malik calls air pollution a man-made phenomenon
Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik called air pollution a man-made phenomenon, adding that it was up to us to fix it. He noted that climate change and environmental issues were not major objectives in the past and hard work was being carried out to fix this.
He refrained from citing different laws and policies, but said that the federal government and Punjab were doing very good work with regard to climate change.
The minister said around 40pc of children’s lung functioning were affected due to polluted air.
He added: “This is not just smog. Also look at it through the lens of death. And it is not just death. Also look at it through the lens of love, and when you see the faces hidden behind the haze, maybe then we will solve the issues more quickly.”

10:45am — Musadik Malik mentions link between life expectancy and air pollution
Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik is addressing the event via a video link, apologising that he could not reach Lahore due to “some special circumstances, as you know”.
“Pollution and all these environmental hazards … they stand in the way of our success,” the minister said.
He recalled that his father had been in a coma during his last days and prayed for “just one more day” for his life. Stressing the importance of life, Malik said five to eight years of the lives of all Lahore residents, including elders, were wasted due to smog.
“We probably do not associate this with the grief and mortality that comes ahead of us because of smog or air pollution,” he said, adding that according to some estimates, 128,000 premature deaths occur in Pakistan every year, and a person’s five to eight years of life are cut short due to air pollution.

10:37am — Mandatory recycling bins in Punjab schools from Oct 30
The Punjab minister also reflected on her recent visits to Japan. “The entire waste management in Japan is for segregated waste, so that technology cannot be brought to Pakistan,” she said.
“So now we’re going to China for that technology and waste incinerators. We’ve started this in schools. We thought schools would be the right place to start this and embed it into our curriculum. After Oct 30, the schools have to keep five recycling bins at schools mandatory,” Aurangzeb said.

10:30am — ‘Transboundary arrangement’ may now be taken up with UN, WB after recent events: Punjab minister
Marriyum Aurangzeb also observed the lack of data regarding air pollution and highlighted the phenomenon of transboundary pollution.
“The major seasonal contributor to high AQI levels in Lahore and Multan … that easterly wind corridor from India plays a critical role and is a major contributor to seasonal AQI levels. We had started a transboundary arrangement but because of recent events, we may take this forward with the UN or World Bank.”
“Breathe Pakistan is a great initiative for spreading awareness … the responsibility is shared, and whatever we choose has consequences on the environment and climate change,” Aurangzeb stressed.

10:26 — ‘Climate Change Vision 2025 tells policy and action plan for next 10 years’
Aurangzeb pointed out that Punjab’s Climate Change Vision 2025 detailed the policy and action plan for the next 10 years.
She highlighted that the Punjab government introduced vehicle fitness certificates for the “first time ever”.
“We are using safe city cameras to identify smoke coming from cars. We have a Punjab Clean Air Programme, which also has a buy-back policy of old vehicles, two-wheelers and three-wheelers.
’[…] For the first time ever, we have mobile fuel testing labs. EPA Punjab has started fuel testing to test petrol at petrol stations in Punjab. In the last eight months, 1,100 electric buses have arrived in Punjab.“

10:21 — Aurangzeb lists steps taken by Punjab govt to tackle smog
Aurangzeb emphasised that Punjab now had a state-of-the-art environmental force. Listing the steps taken by the provincial government, she said a subsidy programme with 80pc paid by the government was initiated and Lahore Division now had 5,000 superseeders.
Stubble burning zones were mapped, investment was done in the mechanisation of agriculture, and drone monitoring for industrial units is carried out. Around 11,000 brick kilns across the Punjab were also mapped and those without zigzag technology were sealed.

10:17 — Punjab minister details CM Maryam’s smog mitigation plan
The Punjab senior minister recalled the smog mitigation plan launched by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
“When I speak about Punjab interventions, we have completed the entire legal framework. We are now doing AI-predictable modelling for forecasting AQI levels,” Aurangzeb highlighted.
“Localisation of smog mitigation was critical to the intervention, so we took a multi-sectoral lens to smog mitigation,” she said, noting smog guns imported two months ago and deployed in Lahore.
“For predictable forecasting, we have 41 air monitors across Punjab, and will have 100 across Punjab by 2026.”

10:12am — Marriyum Aurangzeb says such initiatives key to tackling climate change issues
Beginning her address, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb noted the presence of “lots of experts, media people and policymakers and civil society”, adding that it reflected the shared responsibility toward climate resilience and climate adaptation.
Thanking DawnMedia for taking the initiative, the Punjab minister said she was a “bit sceptical” when she participated in the February conference. “I did not think it would be a sustainable initiative. So my heartfelt congrats to Naz, to you and the Dawn group for sustaining this initiative because that is the key to issues like climate change.”
“I want other media groups to be made part of this initiative. I will present a case study from our chief minister. Lahore, a heritage hotspot of Pakistan,  [and] the heartbeat of Pakistan, is confronted with seasonal smog. This is a year-long phenomenon. AQI levels of Lahore and other regions of Punjab were not satisfactory, so we started working on smog mitigation objectives,” Aurangzeb highlighted.
She said her government was “in shock that we are talking about it in March” when she called a meeting, as the air quality issue is a year-long phenomenon. “We started off with a multi-sectoral lens for climate change.”

10:07am — Dawn CEO Nazafreen stresses commitment to cleaner skies
Inaugurating the moot, Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani, the CEO of Dawn, says: “On behalf of DawnMedia, it is an honour and my responsibility to welcome you all to Breathe Pakistan’s The Air We Breathe — a critical gathering focused on one of the most urgent challenges, air pollution.”
Recalling the initiative’s launch, she said: “Our aim was to start a national dialogue on climate change. At the first conference, experts came together to issue a charter for a climate-resilient Pakistan.
“Today, The Air We Breathe builds on that momentum. As we enter another smog season, this conference focuses on practical tangible measures to tackle air pollution,” Saigol-Lakhani added.
She further said, “We are helping to weave a living network of collaboration to ensure shared commitments … I hope today’s discussions will inspire collective action and send a strong message that the health of people and the future of Pakistan are not policy points but our priorities.
“Let us commit to cleaner skies and a healthier environment for generations to come.”

The visit comes after a IMF mission concluded talks with Pakistani authorities on reviews of two lending programmes totalling $8.4 billion without announcing a staff-level agreement (SLA).
A day earlier, the finance minister had expressed optimism that the SLA with the IMF would be finalised next week during his visit to Washington.
According to the Radio Pakistan report, the minister will participate in more than 65 events, forums, ceremonies, and meetings during his six-day visit to the US.
“During his visit, the finance minister will represent Pakistan at the plenary meetings of the IMF and the WB,” the report added.
It further said that Aurangzeb would meet with senior officials from the IMF, the WB, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA).
The minister is set to meet WB president Ajay Banga and attend a dinner with the Finance Ministers of selected countries at his special invitation, as per the report.
“The finance Minister will also meet IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva on the sidelines of the G24 and at Middle East, North Africa and Pakistan (MENAP) countries platform,” Radio Pakistan reported.
He will address MENAP forum as a keynote speaker, it added.
It said that he will also participate in a regional roundtable on the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) digital transformation organised by the WB, where tax authorities from other countries are set to discuss their tax reforms as well.
In addition, the minister is expected to attend two other events by the World Economic Forum as well as meet his counterparts from China, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, and Azerbaijan, the report said.
Auragnzeb will also hold meetings with top White House officials, and senior officials from the US Departments of State and Treasury and the International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), it said, adding that he was also expected to have a meeting with the chairman of the Financial Services Committee of Congress.
“During the visit, the finance minister will also meet with officials from global credit ratings agencies, commercial banks, especially the investment banks from the Middle East,” according to Radio Pakistan.
“The finance minister will visit leading US think tanks, including the Atlantic Council and the Peterson Institute of International Economics (PIIE),” it added.</p><small>2025-10-11 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/110236108e03426.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947924/air-pollution-is-an-administrative-failure-can-pakistan-see-through-the-haze' target='_blank'><strong>Air pollution is an administrative failure. Can Pakistan see through the haze?</strong></a><br><p>The fear of smog has already started lingering upon us. We are once again bracing ourselves to choke in our own neglect. Are we doomed to suffer every year, through climate change, mismanagement, broken promises, or is it just bad luck?
In truth, it seems less a matter of fate and more the outcome of willful ignorance — an ignorance far from blissful, especially given that under Article 9 of Pakistan’s Constitution, the right to life inherently includes the right to a clean and healthy environment.
Numbers tell the story
This contradiction defines our new normal. For the past several winters, Pakistan has ranked as the third most polluted country in the world. Nowhere is this crisis more visible than in Lahore, the country’s second-largest city, where nearly 14 million residents are forced to breathe poison. It’s the most polluted city in the world and in the last five years, its air has met the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) minimum safety standards on only seven days.
The World Bank (WB) and the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) estimates on Pakistan’s air pollution tell a story — one we’ve chosen to ignore for far too long.
The WB estimates that outdoor air pollution in Pakistan is responsible for 22,000 premature adult deaths and the loss of 163,432 disability-adjusted life years annually. Indoor air pollution, meanwhile, causes 28,000 deaths each year and leads to 40 million acute respiratory infections. Furthermore, the 2024 Air Quality Index (AQI) reported that poor air quality shortens average life expectancy by 3.9 years, rising to as much as seven years in heavily polluted cities such as Lahore, Peshawar, Gujranwala, and Rawalpindi.
The effects of air pollution extend far beyond human health, impacting the environment as well as the economy. According to the WB, environmental degradation costs the country around 7 per cent of its GDP, or about Rs365 billion per year, with the burden falling disproportionately on the poor. As an agrarian nation, Pakistan’s agricultural sector also suffers, with 2.6 billion people dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Tropospheric ozone alone causes annual losses of approximately 110 million tonnes of key staple crops such as rice and wheat.
An administrative problem
The challenge of air pollution is neither new nor cyclical; it is a sustained environmental and public health crisis that demands long-term solutions. Its roots lie in systemic causes, ranging from natural factors such as temperature inversions and stagnant winds to human-driven sources like vehicular and industrial emissions, crop burning in agricultural regions, construction dust, combustion of biomass, and transboundary pollution from neighbouring countries such as India.
If we look at international examples such as England and China, it becomes evident that both countries tackled air pollution through strong, well-organised policies built on three key pillars: effective administration, robust governance, and consistent on-ground implementation. Pakistan could take cues from Britain’s landmark Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968, which curbed pollution. These specific laws enforced the use of smokeless fuels in urban areas and mandated factories to transition away from black smoke emissions.
Similarly, Beijing launched a series of forward-looking initiatives, including low-emission zones, an expanded urban rail network, and an advanced integrated air quality monitoring system. Established in 2016, this system leveraged cutting-edge technologies such as high-resolution satellite remote sensing and laser radar to combat air pollution. It also featured a dense PM2.5 monitoring network with more than 1,000 sensors strategically distributed across the city, allowing authorities to precisely identify when and where emissions peaked.
What these examples reveal is that cleaner air is not achieved through isolated fixes, but through strong systems that ensure accountability and follow-through. A discussion of the primary sectors of smog, then, must begin with the understanding that air pollution is, above all, an administrative problem.
Culprits of air pollution in Pakistan
Among the major sources of air pollution, it’s no mystery that transportation stands as the chief culprit behind smog. In Lahore alone, over 4.2 million motorcycles manoeuvre through its congested streets every day, averaging nearly two per household. Across Pakistan, the continued reliance on outdated Euro-II diesel fuel has further eroded air quality. The country’s freight and passenger fleets are still dominated by pre-Euro and Euro II trucks and buses, many of which release dangerously high levels of pollutants.
Weak regulatory enforcement and ineffective vehicle inspection systems allow these aging, smoke-belching vehicles to remain on the roads, making Pakistan’s transport sector one of its most stubborn and toxic sources of pollution.
Transport
Pakistan’s transport system is in desperate need of a major overhaul, particularly in terms of infrastructure. Despite the existence of national environmental quality standards, regular emission testing remains largely unenforced. A clear timeline must be established to phase out vehicles beyond a certain age, especially heavy-duty vehicles such as trucks. The installation of catalytic converters and the nationwide adoption of Euro-5 and Euro-6 standard fuels should be made mandatory. Electric buses, too, must become an integral part of Pakistan’s public transport network.
Encouragingly, the provincial government has launched a vehicle emission testing system in Punjab and begun deploying electric buses in the province. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has pledged to have 1,115 electric buses operational across Punjab by December.
It is critical for Pakistan to accelerate the adoption of a sustainable transportation system including electric buses and vehicles. It is not only essential for meeting the country’s commitments under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, but also for easing the pressure on foreign reserves caused by Pakistan’s heavy dependence on imported oil.
Industries
Industrial emissions add yet another layer to the problem. Punjab’s industrial landscape is vast and diverse, with nearly 18,000 factories spread across multiple sectors. These include 718 chemical and petroleum units, 6,324 engineering units, 3,750 food, beverage, and tobacco units, 1,808 leather, rubber, and plastic units, 934 paper units, and 387 non-metal and mineral units.

However, while 560 industries in the Lahore division are formally registered, a sprawling informal sector, including thousands of brick kilns and small manufacturing units, continues to operate outside the regulatory framework. Most industries fail to comply with environmental standards and are often located within cities, dangerously close to residential areas, due to weak state enforcement. As a result, citizens are routinely exposed to pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and PM2.5, both major contributors to smog formation.
The Pakistan Environmental Protection Act of 1997 requires every industrial unit to self-monitor and report under smart rules, yet the reality paints a different picture — only 10 to 20pc of units actually comply. To address this, designated industrial zones should be established to prevent factories from operating near residential communities. Regular third-party audits and strict compliance monitoring must also be mandated to ensure adherence to environmental standards.
Moreover, while Article 9A of the Constitution guarantees the right to a clean and sustainable environment, the implementation of related policies and frameworks, such as the National Clean Air Policy, remains woefully inadequate.
Agriculture
The agriculture sector, particularly crop burning, adds its own share to the haze. The primary source of this pollution is the post-harvest burning of crop residues by farmers in both Pakistan and India — a quick fix that clears the fields but poisons the air for the next cultivation cycle. Satellite imagery from Nasa Worldview, dated November 6, 2024, shows a thick blanket of smog engulfing Lahore, with clusters of fires scattered across the region between Delhi and Lahore.

Pakistan produces around 69 million tons of stubble annually, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), contributing nearly 20pc of the country’s air pollution. To address this, the Punjab Clean Air Action Plan introduced a three-step policy aimed at discouraging stubble burning. Yet, it has failed to eliminate smog.
The government has distributed happy seeders, planters that shred crop residue and mulch it back into the soil, which have the potential to reduce carbon emissions by up to 78pc. However, the sheer volume of crop residue far exceeds the number of machines available, leaving a substantial gap between supply and demand. While these machines were made accessible to farmers in designated red zone districts, their cost remains prohibitive for small and marginal farmers. Making them more affordable would mark a major step toward sustainability, given the significant reduction in emissions they offer.
The government also attempted to impose fines of Rs50,000 per acre on offenders, but the policy fell short of its goals, hindered by inefficient enforcement mechanisms and the lack of affordable technological alternatives. This raises a critical policy question: should Pakistan rely more on carrots or sticks to promote climate-smart agricultural practices?
Construction sector
The construction sector, particularly brick kilns, is a major contributor to air pollution in Pakistan. Many brick kilns burn low-grade coal and waste materials, releasing large quantities of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Additionally, the incomplete combustion of biomass — commonly used as a cooking fuel in rural and low-income households — emits significant amounts of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), soot, and other toxic substances. Together, these emissions have become major drivers of urban smog and deteriorating air quality across the country.
Pakistan should adopt modern, energy-efficient brick kiln technologies such as zigzag designs and expand the natural gas infrastructure nationwide to enable their widespread use. The government should also introduce incentives for the adoption of alternative clean fuels, particularly in areas without access to gas pipelines.
The analysis above suggests that if these sectors were modernised and effectively managed, Pakistan could potentially cut air pollution by as much as 50pc.
A holistic approach and climate diplomacy
Air pollution demands a holistic response, with a clear policy direction and multilateral solutions spanning all fronts including science, policy, and finance. Pakistan already sits on a pile of plans — the National Clean Air Policy, Punjab Clean Air Action Policy, SMOG Control Strategy 2024–25 — but policies without implementation are just paper promises.
Climate diplomacy should be pursued through a formal engagement with the government of India on air pollution, since it is a transboundary issue. Both countries can leverage joint air quality monitoring, data sharing and develop policies that can foster sustainable agricultural practices and reduce emissions.
Decentralised air plans should be adopted that engage stakeholders from all provinces. The private sector should engage in data generation and mapping emission hotspots, delivering research and carrying out advocacy campaigns.
We already know what must be done. The time to act is now because the smog won’t wait for our next committee meeting.

The announcement comes soon after President Donald Trump signed an executive order vowing to defend the Gulf Arab state against attacks, following Israeli air strikes targeting Hamas leaders in the Qatari capital Doha.
“We’re signing a letter of acceptance to build a Qatari Emiri Air Force facility at the Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho,” Hegseth said at the Pentagon, with Qatari Defence Minister Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani at his side.
 
 

“The location will host a contingent of Qatari F-15s and pilots to enhance our combined training” as well as “increase lethality, interoperability,” he said.
“It’s just another example of our partnership. And I hope you know, your excellency, that you can count on us.”
 






The Idaho base currently also hosts a fighter jet squadron from Singapore, according to its website.
Hegseth also thanked Qatar for its “substantial role” as a mediator in the talks that led to a truce and hostage-prisoner swap deal between Israel and Hamas, and its assistance in securing the release of a US citizen from Afghanistan.
The Qatari minister hailed the “strong, enduring partnership” and “deep defense relationship” shared by the two countries.
The Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar is Washington’s largest military facility in the Middle East.
Trump’s close relationship with the leaders of Qatar has raised eyebrows, especially over its gift to the US president of a Boeing 747 to be used as Air Force One.
Though the Idaho facility for Qatar had apparently been in the works since the last administration of Democrat Joe Biden, the deal prompted some hand-wringing on social media, including from far-right activist Laura Loomer, usually a Trump ally.
“Never thought I’d see Republicans give terror financing Muslims from Qatar a MILITARY BASE on US soil so they can murder Americans,” Loomer wrote on X.
 






Hegseth, who never said it was a base, later wrote on the platform: “Qatar will not have their own base in the United States — nor anything like a base.
We control the existing base, like we do with all partners.“

On Friday night, police had repulsed an attack on a police training centre in Dera Ismail Khan. At the time, officials had said that at least three terrorists, including a suicide bomber, were killed in retaliatory fire by police forces.
On Saturday, a report issued by the CTD, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, showed that seven cops were martyred while another 13 were injured in the incident. Dera Ismail Khan Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Hamid Siddiqui also confirmed the casualties to Dawn.com.
According to the CTD report, the attack took place at 8:30pm on Friday within the limits of the Shorkot Police Station.
“A National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) office near the training centre was also burnt down by terrorists,” Dera Ismail Khan AC told Dawn.com.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the DI Khan police stated that five terrorists were killed during a five-hour long exchange of fire.
Detailing the attack, the statement said, “Last night, Fitna al Khawarij terrorists first rammed a truck loaded with explosives into the gate of the police training school in Ratta Kalachi area, causing the school wall to collapse.”
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The initial attack left one police officer dead, the police statement said. It further said that militants then proceeded to enter the school and started firing with heavy weapons and hand grenades, adding that police forces “retaliated bravely” and the exchange of fire went on for about five hours.
“As soon as the news of the attack reached District Police Officer (DPO) Sahibzada Sajjad Ahmed, he rushed to the site with a heavy contingent of police,” the statement read.
Regional Police Officer Syed Ashfaq Anwar was present as well, it said, adding that police were then joined by security forces.
“The police and security forces jointly set an example of courage and bravery in the five-hour long operation, killing five terrorists and recovering suicide jackets, explosives and ammunition from them,” as per the police statement.
The area has been cleared of the terrorists, and a search operation was underway, the statement said.
Lauding the efforts of the forces in thwarting the attack, KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed was quoted as saying, “The unparalleled bravery of the officers on the frontline has proven that the KP police is committed to eradicating terrorism.”
Announcing compensation for the martyred, he assured that “their sacrifices will not go in vain”. The KP IG also announced special rewards for all those who participated in the operation.
Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
A senior army officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the DI Khan a day ago. A cop was martyred in the district after a police checkpoint came under attack from multiple sides by terrorists late on Wednesday.
Last month, 13 terrorists were killed during an IBO in the district’s Daraban area.
According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p><small>2025-10-11 07:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628069-afridis-cmship-a-slip-between-the-cup-and-the-lip' target='_blank'><strong>Afridi's CMship — a slip between cup and lip</strong></a><br><p>

• Okays elevated freight corridor to improve port connectivity
• Accepts proposal of private firm to bring and operate 500 e-buses in Karachi and Hyderabad
KARACHI: In what appears to be a decision that may adversely impact thousands of patients belonging to the lower strata of life, the Sindh government is planning to outsource radiology and diagnostic lab services at two major hospitals in the province, including the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and approved funds to hire “transaction advisers” for the purpose.
A decision to this effect was taken at the 48th meeting of the Public-Private Partnership Policy (PPP) Board, chaired by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, at the CM House on Friday.
According to a press release, the policy board approved “funding to hire transaction advisors for the feasibility study and transaction advisory services to outsource radiology and diagnostic lab services at the Chandka Medical College Hospital (CMCH), Larkana and JPMC, Karachi”.
 






“The health Department intends to implement the project under the public-private partnership (PPP) modality to address serious challenges in operation and maintenance (O&M) of advanced diagnostic equipment such as MRI, CT scan, digital X-ray, ultrasound, and echocardiography,” it said.
It claimed that after outsourcing, the private partner will invest in new equipment, ensure their operation and maintenance, upgrade outdated systems, deploy trained staff, and improve turnaround time for test results, ensuring quality and patient-centred diagnostic services.
Private firm to bring, operate 500 e-buses
The policy board also approved procurement of 500 electric buses for Karachi and Hyderabad, aiming to offer residents a cost-effective, safer, and eco-friendly transportation alternative.
The board endorsed the scope, structure and risk matrix of the Peoples Green Transport Project and also “accepted the amended unsolicited proposal submitted by a private firm, granting it the ‘Right of First Refusal’ and exemption from the prequalification process”.
Under the project, 500 electric buses will be deployed in phases along with depots, charging infrastructure, bus shelters and an automatic fare collection and intelligent transport system.
The project, to be executed on a design, build, finance, manage, operate and transfer (DBFMOT) model with a 12-year concession period, is expected to serve over 200,000 passengers daily and integrate with the Green Line bus rapid transit project (BRT).
Elevated expressway
The policy board approved the development of an elevated expressway to connect the Karachi port with Qayumabad at the Jam Sadiq Interchange.
The CM directed the board to expedite the paperwork so that he could lay the foundation stone of the project.
The board endorsed the project scope, transaction structure and risk matrix, and “approved the unsolicited proposal for competitive bidding”.
The project involves design, finance, construction, and 25-year O&M of a 16.5-km, four-lane elevated freight expressway.
The expressway will reduce travel distance by 26 kilometres, enabling 24/7 heavy traffic movement, easing congestion on urban roads, and improving port efficiency and connectivity with M-9 and Malir Expressway, also called Shahrah-i-Bhutto.
The Board also approved design changes to align with the project with the Yellow Line BRT, add mixed-traffic ramps, improve port connectivity, and avoid major land acquisition.
‘Carbon removal through forestation’
With the intention to restore forest in the riverine areas to minimise the climate impacts and contribute to the reduction in greenhouse gases in Pakistan, the board accorded its approval to a riverine forestation project on approximately 41,000 hectares in districts of Jamshoro and Matiari under the PPP mode.
The forest department was asked to issue the letter of award to the preferred bidders for three bidding packages.
“The project is expected to generate approximately 35 to 40 million carbon credits, which will be monetised through international carbon markets, resulting in significant foreign exchange earnings,” the press release said.
The board also approved engagement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a feasibility study for a new riverine forestation project that will be spanned 88,000 hectares approximately.

Authored by Justice Athar Minallah, a three-judge Supreme Court bench, while extending the benefit of doubt, ordered the acquittal of all charges against petitioner Anwar Keneth after accepting his jail plea but with a direction to release him if not required in any other case.
 
 

In a nine-page judgement, the bench consisting of Justices Athar Minallah, Irfan Saadat Khan and Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan also expressed the expectation that the Pakistan Institute of Mental Health (PIMH) executive director, where the petitioner was being treated, will ensure continuation of his medical treatment.
The blasphemy case against Mr Keneth was registered on Sept 25, 2001, by the Gawalmandi police for alleged offences under Section 295C of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Bench says elderly suspect diagnosed with mental illness, prosecution failed to prove case beyond reasonable doubt

The complaint registered by Inspector Nasrullah Khan Niazi concerned the Aug 27, 2001, letter to a person named Haji Mehmood Zafar and following investigation, a report under Section 173 CrPC was filed before the competent court. The appellant pleaded guilty to the charge framed and admitted writing the letter.
 
 

The trial court convicted the appellant under Section 295C and sentenced him to death with a fine of Rs500,000. The high court later confirmed the death sentence.
Subsequently, a jail petition sent through the prison superintendent was received by the Supreme Court in 2014, whereas the letter was sent to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) on March 12, 2024.
Later, the PIMH medical board diagnosed the petitioner as suffering from ‘Bipolar Affective Disorder’ (a disorder causing extreme mood swings, including emotional highs and lows) and that the mental disorder was in the ‘hypomanic’ stage. The medical board also advised admission of the appellant to the institute for treatment.
In its order, the Supreme Court regretted that the prosecution in the case produced only two witnesses, Maulana Naeem Akhtar Adnan (PW-1) and Haji Mahmood Zafar (PW-2). The investigating officer of this case did not enter the witness box. It appears that the prosecution, besides producing two witnesses, made no attempt to prove its case against the appellant, the order regretted.
The judgement said the appellant professes the religion of Christianity and that the letter was attempting to propagate and profess his faith with a claim that ‘he belonged to the Juda tribe and a descendant of King David’.
The appellant claimed to be the ‘King of Israel and rule the whole world,’ and asserted that the ‘great Lord of Heavens will establish the Kingdom in Israel’.
In his letter, he attempted to build an argument that his faith was the true religion, the judgement said, adding that the entire letter unambiguously showed its author was suffering from some mental disorder.
The conduct of the appellant during the investigation and the trial was not that of a sane person, the judgement said, adding the contents of the letter reflected signs of grandeur, hallucination, and delusional flight of ideas.
Though the abnormality was obvious from the conduct and contents of the letter, neither the prosecution nor the trial court had the appellant medically examined by specialists in the field of psychiatry.
According to the judgement, the offence under section 295C is penal and attracts the punishment of death. It added that it was a settled principle of criminal administration of justice that the prosecution has to prove its case against an accused beyond a reasonable doubt and it was not absolved of this duty if the accused has been unsuccessful in proving a plea in his/her defence.
The appellant was not aware that his actions were influenced by the mental disorder from which he was suffering, the judgement noted, adding that the culpability of the offence for which the appellant was charged required establishing the ‘actus rea’ and ‘mens rea’.
The opinion of the medical board has raised a serious doubt regarding the existence of criminal intent or ‘mens rea’.The CII, in its interim report, has rightly observed that the followers of all religions enjoy the right to profess, practice and propagate their respective beliefs but the exercise of such right is subject to law, the judgement said.

Mr Gandapur left for Dera Ismail Khan after saying farewell to his staff at the chief minister’s house, despite his resignation not yet being formally accepted by the province’s governor.
In his first media interaction after resi­g­ning, Mr Gandapur had pressed for the swift acceptance of his resignation on Thu­rsday night. He said any delay in the process would be detrimental to the province.
 
 

However, the resignation cannot be processed until the governor reviews it. An official on Governor Faisal Karim Kundi’s staff told Dawn the governor was in Islamabad and not expected to return to Peshawar until Saturday (today).

Withdrawal is pending as governor is out of town

“The resignation letter may have arri­ved in mail but I could not say anything in this regard right now,” the official said.
A spokesperson for Gandapur confirmed the chief minister’s departure in a statement, noting that a large number of employees from the chief minister’s house and secretariat were present to see him off. Mr Gandapur thanked the staff for their cooperation during his tenure.
Upon reaching Dera Ismail Khan later in the afternoon, Mr Gandapur was greeted by supporters at the Yarak Interchange who showered his convoy with rose petals. In a brief address, Mr Gandapur reiterated that his political career was focused on public service rather than power.
“My politics was never about power but about serving the people,” Mr Gandapur said, stressing that the trust of his constituents remained his “greatest strength despite his resignation”.
 
 

Meanwhile, a leader from Gandapur’s party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, said they were awaiting the governor’s approval.
“The moment Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi approves the resignation, the process for the election of the new chief minister would be started,” the PTI leader said.
He noted that any decisions about a future provincial cabinet would be made by the nominee for chief minister, Sohail Afridi, after meeting with PTI founder Imran Khan.
 
 

According to Article 130 (8) of the Constitution of Pakistan, “the Chief Minister may, by writing under his hand addressed to the Governor, resign his office.” The governor can, however, invoke Article 133 to ask the chief minister to continue his duties as an interim arrangement until a successor is in place.

“The president of the republic has nominated Mr Sebastien Lecornu as prime minister and has tasked him with forming a government,” the Elysee Palace said in a statement as the deadline he had fixed to appoint the premier ended on Friday.
Lecornu, in a message on X, said he accepted his reappointment “out of duty”, adding that “we must end the political crisis” gripping France.
“It is my duty to accept the mission entrusted to me by the President to do everything in my power to give France a budget for the end of the year and to respond to the everyday problems of our compatriots.

Macron reappoints him after consulting parties, except two largest stakeholders in assembly

“We need to put an end to this political crisis, which is exasperating the French people, and to this instability, which is bad for France’s image and its interests.”
Earlier, Macron welcomed mainstream political leaders to a crunch meeting at the Elysee, as the country’s central bank chief warned political turmoil was sapping growth.
Before the reappointment of PM Lecornu, Macron was looking for a sixth prime minister in less than two years. The gathering was aimed at finding a figure whose appeal spans the centre-right to centre-left in order to steer the budget for 2026 through a fragmented and fractious parliament.
Party leaders from the left, right and centre arrived at the Elysee, but the far-right National Rally (RN) and hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) — two of the largest political parties in the National Assembly — were excluded.
While reacting to the reappointment of PM Lecornu, RN President Jordan Bardella said, “The Lecornu II government, appointed by Emmanuel Macron who is more isolated and out of touch than ever at the Elysee Palace, is a bad joke, a democratic disgrace and a humiliation for the French people.”
Socialist Party lawmaker Francois Kalfon said, “Our scepticism grows by the day. We want something concrete on the pension reform. We are not afraid to return to the polls.”
National Assembly President Yael Braun-Pivet said, “I note the reappointment of Sbastien Lecornu as Matignon. For weeks now, the National Assembly has been in full working order, ready to play its role to the full: debating, scrutinising and voting. Now it’s time to get down to work. It’s about time!”

In the latest mass attack targeting the energy system as winter approaches, electricity was interrupted in nine regions, and around 854,000 consumers were temporarily without power across the country.
In southeastern Ukr­aine, a seven-year-old was killed when his home was hit, and at least 20 people were injured.
In Kyiv, an apartment block in the city centre was damaged by a projectile, while on the left bank of the  Dnipro that divides the capital, crowds waited at bus stops with the metro out of action and people filled water bottles at distribution points.
“We didn’t sleep at all,” said Liuba, a pensioner, as she collected water. “From 2:30am there was so much noise. By 3:30 we had no electricity, no gas, no water. Nothing.”
Ukraine’s air force said it downed 405 of 465 drones and 15 of 32 missiles in the attack. Moscow said its overnight strikes were a response to Ukr­aine’s attacks on Russian civilian facilities.
The assault was among the heaviest concentrated strikes on energy infrastructure, Ukranian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said. Her deputy, Oleksiy Kuleba, said two million customers in Kyiv temporarily faced problems with water supplies.
Ukrainian President Vol­­odymyr Zelenskiy said Russia’s main target ahead of the heating season is civilian and energy infrastructure and called for more support from Kyiv’s allies. “What’s needed is not window dressing but decisive action from the US, Europe, and the G7 in delivering air defence systems and enforcing sanctions,” he said on X.
 






Ukraine’s Energy Min­ister Svitlana Hrynchuk met with G7 ambassadors to discuss how allies could help protect the country against further attacks and repair the damage.
Ukrainian private ene­r­gy firm DTEK said its thermal power plants suff­ered significant damage. The government said it ex­­pe­cted to restore the water supply to the capital by the end of Friday.

Because of its proximity to rivers, it is a fertile region but prone to disastrous flooding. This is not just because of the rivers but also due to the mismanagement of the embankments and headworks. Besides its delicious mangoes, dates and pomegranates, the district has also produced dozens of (in)famous and powerful politicians for decades now. We can mention a few of the ruling clans here — the Dastis, Gourmanis, Qureshis, Khars, Jatois, and Sials.
The scions of these clans have, each in line with their influence, contributed to the district’s underdevelopment. A large majority of the district’s people remain destitute, marginalised and vulnerable to periodic disasters. They are at the mercy of both large landlords and callous bureaucrats. Both official and independent sources identify Muzaffargarh as one of Punjab’s poorest districts, which is deprived in terms of land ownership, consumption, education, sanitation and housing rights. For instance, its literacy rate is estimated as being 30pc lower than that of central Punjab. Its population density too is far less than that of central Punjab. These two indicators suffice to highlight the difference in human development in the two regions. The tale of Muzaffargarh is the tale of the Seraiki belt too.
 
 

Now consider the scale of the recent flood losses. The Rapid Need Assessment Report of UN-OCHA published on Sept 23 and covering 18 flood-affected districts in Punjab states that 4.2 million people were impacted. Shockingly, more than 3m were in just five districts of the region, which account for nearly 64pc of the total 28 flood-affected districts. Muzaffargarh appears to be the most devastated district in Punjab as far as its share in the overall affected and displaced populations is concerned. Out of a total of 2.8m displaced people, 33.6pc or 0.92m belonged to the district, followed by Jhang 14pc, Bahawalpur 13pc, Khanewal 11.5pc and Multan 10pc. The report concludes that “The top four most vulnerable hotspots are Muzaffargarh, Jhang, Bahawalnagar and Khanewal”. On food insecurity, too, the report finds that, of those interviewed, between 61pc and 81pc of respondents expressed fear of food shortages in the coming weeks in the southern districts.

The differences between Punjab’s northern and southern districts are the outcome of deliberate negligence spread over decades.

Though the National Disaster Management Authority’s website showed only four fully and 234 partially damaged houses in the whole of Punjab until Sept 25, the OCHA report shows as many as 46,000 fully and 115,700 partially damaged homes in the province. South Punjab remains at the top. However, interestingly, the UN-OCHA report shows very few damaged schools in south Punjab in comparison to the rest of the province. This is intriguing. Lower literacy levels in the Seraiki belt is a result of the skewed children-school ratio. The literacy rate is likely to drop in future should the government fail to repair the damaged schools quickly.
These differences between the northern and southern districts are not a result of any organic development. This is the outcome of deliberate and sustained negligence spread over decades. As each flood disaster washed away schools, illiteracy continued to rise or literacy levels remained stagnant. Since the 1992 super floods, Muzaffargarh district has suffered from three colossal flood disasters and four not-too-large calamities.
As in 2025, in 2010 too Muzaffargarh’s share in Punjab’s total losses was the highest. As in the case of previous flood disasters, the 2025 floods once again uncovered the regional, class, power and gender inequalities. A wise man once said that in contradictions lie hope. Either we heal the root causes of these contradictions and remove their drivers or continue to survive with the contradictions that we have been living with for centuries now.
But perhaps the status quo will not be sustained (think Nepal) for long — unless, in the words of Senator Mushahid Hussain, “a healing touch” is witnessed. If that did not happen in the last millennium, it may not take place in the future either. But the recent statement of a federal minister provided some clue. He said that the ‘entrenched elite’ was not only responsible for violating the law of the land but also for causing flood destruction and meting out miseries to the poor. I have no reason to disagree with his blunt outburst. Rather, we must be thankful for his straight talk, though unfortunately, he appears to be serving the interests of the same elite. So, let us move ahead. If the elite constitute one end of the stick, the people make up the other. But the kind of democracy we have legitimises the same elite that the people resent.
So, in Lenin’s words, what is to be done? If most of the people’s vulnerabilities are likely to emanate from the policies of the elite, then so are their miseries and losses. This can’t be reversed unless people reform the situation through peaceful and sustained pressure.
The elite mismanage dams, embankments, barrages and headworks. They fail to implement laws, rules and policies in letter and spirit. Our Constitution, in particular Articles 37, 38 and 140A, our public policies on disaster management and our commitments under various UN conventions provide sufficient grounds for pressuring the elite. Moreover, the concept of ‘build-back-better’ is a vital pillar of the disaster-reduction framework. The concept is not, as some tend to believe, limited to physical structures; it also means ending socioeconomic vulnerabilities and building the capacities of ordinary people — so that today’s vulnerable segments can be enabled to cope with disasters on their own, and, hence, lessen the burden on the exchequer.

• Hamas expected to release 20 living Israeli prisoners after which Israel will release 1,950 Palestinians
• US plans 200 troops deployment for task force
JERUSALEM: Thousands of ­displaced Palestinians streamed back towards their abandoned homes on Friday after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas went into effect and Israeli troops began pulling back from parts of Gaza.
A huge column of displaced Gazans filed north through the dust and rubble towards Gaza City, the enclave’s biggest urban area, which had been under attack just days ago in one of Israel’s biggest offensives of the war.
“Thank God my house is still standing,” said Ismail Zayda, 40, in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City. “But the place is destroyed, my neighbours’ houses are destroyed, entire districts have gone.”
The Israeli military said the ceasefire agreement had been activated at noon local time (0900 GMT). Israel’s government ratified the ceasefire with Hamas in the early hours of Friday, clearing the way to partially pull back troops and fully suspend hostilities in Gaza within 24 hours.
Hamas is expected to release the 20 living Israeli prisoners within 72 hours, after which Israel will release 250 Palestinians serving long terms in Israeli prisons, and 1,700 others detained in Gaza during the war.
US Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff said the Israeli military had completed the first phase of a withdrawal in Gaza and the Israeli, prisoners’ release period had started.
 
 

Once the agreement is operating, trucks carrying food and medical aid will surge into Gaza to help civilians, hundreds of thousands of whom have been sheltering in tents after Israeli forces destroyed their homes and razed entire cities.
Israeli troop pullout
In Khan Yunis, in the southern Gaza Strip, some Israeli troops pulled back from the eastern area near the border, but tank shelling was heard, according to residents.
 
 

In Nusseirat camp in the centre of the enclave, some Israeli soldiers dismantled their position and headed east towards the Israeli border, though other troops remained in the area after gunfire was heard in the early hours of Friday.
Israeli forces pulled out from the road along the Mediterranean coast into Gaza City.
“As soon as we heard the news of the truce and ceasefire, we were very happy and got ready to go back to Gaza City, to our homes. Of course there are no homes — they’ve been destroyed,” said Mahdi Saqla, 40.
“But we are happy just to return to where our homes were, even over the rubble. That too is a great joy. For two years we’ve been suffering, displaced from place to place,” he added.
US to deploy troops for Gaza task force
The United States will deploy up to 200 troops to Israel to establish a task force to support stabilisation efforts in Gaza, but no Americans are expected to be deployed into the Palestinian enclave, US officials said on Thursday.
The US military’s Central Command will stand up the task force, known as the Civil-Military Coordination Center, or CMCC, one of the officials said.
The CMCC’s job will be to facilitate the flow of assistance into Gaza, including security assistance and humanitarian aid, officials said.
Two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the US troops would be the core of the CMCC, but it would also include representatives from Egypt’s military, Qatar, Turkiye and probably the United Arab Emirates.
The officials said the joint control centre would coordinate with Israeli forces and other security forces to avoid clashes.
“No US troops are intended to go into Gaza,” said one of the officials.
Gaza reconstruction
Meanwhile, Germany wants to organise an international conference with Egypt for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday, as Israel and Hamas edged closer to ending hostilities.
The main goal of this conference “should be to address the most urgent needs, such as rebuilding water and energy supplies and medical care”, Merz said in a statement.

Bound by an agreement with Kashmiri leaders, its people lived under direct federal control, with no say in their future. It was only in 2009 that the then PPP government gave it back its name, discarding the colonial label of ‘Northern Areas’. A legislative assembly, a chief minister, and a governor followed, an arrangement trumpeted as the birth of a fifth province. But beneath the fanfare, the structure was hollow: the assembly had meagre powers, every decision remained hostage to Islamabad, and the promise of equality with Pakistan’s provinces proved illusory.
Encouraged by the idea that full provincial integration was their rightful due, the people began pressing successive PML-N governments for equal constitutional rights as citizens. An irritated government sought to defuse the discontent by forming a committee, this time under Sartaj Aziz, the then adviser on foreign affairs. A principled individual, Aziz produced a report endorsing most of the people’s demands. Meanwhile, the government faced another challenge in the form of a Supreme Court case on the issue. Hearings were delayed while the government introduced a new decree — the Gilgit-Baltistan Order 2018 — claiming it would ensure “political empowerment and good governance” in the region, ostensibly based on the committee’s recommendations.
When the PTI assumed power, the issue was still before the Supreme Court, which had questioned the GB Order 2018 and directed the government to present a revised framework ensuring that the rights enjoyed by GB residents equalled those accorded to other Pakistanis. The result was the GB Order 2019, a draft the court reviewed and even endorsed, raising genuine expectations in GB that the constitutional deadlock was nearing resolution. Yet, those hopes soon collapsed: the government failed to implement the order, and the court let the matter drift. Though hearings were later scheduled on a petition, reportedly no stay order was issued. Taking advantage of this passive process, the federal government quietly sidestepped the ‘troublesome’ decision. As a result, the region remains bound by the discarded GB Order 2018, an arrangement the Supreme Court itself had directed be replaced six years ago, exemplifying how successive governments disregard binding judgments, thereby undermining the process of granting long-denied constitutional rights to a strategic region that has remained loyal to Pakistan. Unless addressed, the present unrest over multiple governance issues could escalate into a broader movement for constitutional rights, one that anti-state actors might exploit, with potentially tragic consequences for this historically peaceful region.
It is a farce that the very political parties which denied GB its constitutional rights, despite making loud promises before the last assembly elections, are once again preparing to peddle the same slogans as the next polls approach. Once more, they will vow integration as a federating unit, if not permanent then at least provisional, with token representation in parliament. And once more, with the help of their pliant local ‘leaders’, these hollow declarations will be recycled and sold to voters, who in their desperation may fall for the deceit.

The upcoming polls in Gilgit-Baltistan are a rare opportunity to reset governance in the area.

The litmus test of intent lies not in the electioneering noise but in the manifestos of the three major parties, published on their official websites. I read them closely, line by line, expecting some clarity of purpose where policy positions are laid bare. This should have been the basis for our local leadership, political parties, and educated citizens to make informed choices, rather than being short-changed yet again by opportunists masquerading as champions of GB.
When manifestos are released, many expect them to reflect serious commitments. And they do mention GB, including special regional development, inclusion in federal awards, and fiscal allocations. But none of the three major political parties, namely the PPP, PTI and PML-N, make a clear and binding promise to settle GB’s constitutional status as a province or provisional province.
The PTI’s 2024 manifesto, for instance, promises “regional development and social inclusion … focus on areas such as … Gilgit-Baltistan …” but does not mention granting it provincial status or full constitutional rights. The PML-N similarly refers to allocations and reforms involving GB, but again, its texts do not pledge constitutional provincial status. The PPP is the only one that comes closest, promising its inclusion in the National Finance Commission award and fiscal autonomy. It refers to the GB Empowerment Order, but the wording stops short of a binding constitutional amendment.
What emerges, instead, is a damning report card. The manifestos, coupled with the historical record, expose how the people of this resource-rich but sensitive region remain trapped under governance by decrees, orders, and notifications drafted in bureaucratic corridors and rubber-stamped by ‘leaders’ with no real stake in the future of this region.
For GB’s educated class and opinion leaders, this should be a moment of reckoning. The solution to every core problem lies in meaningful constitutional rights with assured representation in the institutions where policy is made, and protection under the same legal framework enjoyed by the other federating units. Today every province has a voice in the fate of CPEC, but the very region that is Pakistan’s gateway to China is excluded, occasionally represented only as a token gesture through handpicked ‘leaders’.
The upcoming elections in GB are a rare opportunity to reset governance in the region. Voters and civil society should insist that every political party — the three major parties and all others — meet these non-negotiable conditions before receiving public support.
i) Each party must include an explicit, categorical promise in its manifesto to grant full constitutional rights to the people of GB with a realistic timeline for implementation.
ii) The parties currently in power (the PML-N and PPP) must promptly implement the Supreme Court’s orders and formally notify the Draft Governance Order 2019, replacing the GB Order 2018.
iii) Every party must publish a transparent, step-by-step framework for integrating the region as a province.
If any party refuses these conditions, civil society should lead an organised voter-education campaign urging the electorate to withhold support from that party until it complies. Continued disregard for judicial verdicts and the denial of constitutional rights to a region under de facto state control are unsustainable. The status quo is not a choice. The electorate must demand clarity, compliance and a credible route to full constitutional enfranchisement for Gilgit-Baltistan.

LAHORE: The numbers paint a grim picture: Pakistan ranks as the world’s third most polluted country according to World Population Review 2025, while Germanwatch’s Climate Risk Index 2025 — analysing three decades of data from 1993 to 2022 — places the nation at the very top of the list of countries most ravaged by climate change. From Lahore’s annual smog siege that sends residents scrambling for air purifiers to the black smoke billowing from brick kilns dotting the city’s periphery, the evidence is visible in the grey skies above Pakistan’s major cities.
It is against this backdrop that DawnMedia, under its Breathe Pakistan project, is convening a critical conversation on the crisis. The Air We Breathe: A Focused Conference on Air Pollution, will be held at Lahore’s Expo Centre today (Saturday), bringing together experts, policymakers, and industry leaders to confront one of the most pressing environmental challenges facing the country.
The conference has drawn high-level attention, with judges of superior courts, federal and provincial ministers, technical experts and foreign dignitaries set to grace the event. The day-long gathering will feature multiple sessions tackling the multifaceted dimensions of Pakistan’s air quality crisis.
 
 

Key discussions will span governance, financing, and regional cooperation — from “Better Governance for Air Pollution” and “A Greener Punjab to Combat Air Pollution” to “Financing Clean Air for Pakistan”. Sessions will also examine “The Smog Equation”, explore “Tackling Trans-Boundary Air Pollution in South Asia: Diplomacy and Regional Cooperation”, and chart pathways for “Developing a National Air Quality Management Framework for Pakistan”. The health dimension will be addressed in a dedicated session on “A Health Crisis in the Smog”, acknowledging the toll that toxic air takes on millions of Pakistani lungs each year.

DawnMedia hosts seminal conference on air pollution today

Speaking about the conference, Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani, the chief executive officer of DawnMedia, said, “Building on the success of the first Breathe Pakistan conference, The Air We Breathe one-day conference focuses on a single pressing, and vital aspect of environmental degradation. As Punjab heads into a period when air quality indices nosedive, The Air We Breathe aims to explore viable policy options, practical solutions, and collaborative frameworks across public, private, and academic sectors.”
 
 

The timing is deliberate — as winter approaches, Punjab braces for its annual air quality emergency when cooler temperatures trap pollutants close to the ground, turning the province’s skies into a toxic blanket. Ms Saigol-Lakhani added that attendees could expect a series of high-impact sessions on air quality management, climate governance, financing for clean air initiatives, the role of the judiciary in securing citizens’ rights to clean air, and data-driven environmental action.
The conference has garnered broad political support, with endorsements spanning the spectrum — from government figures to opposition voices and civil society stakeholders working on environmental issues.
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari thanked DawnMedia for taking the initiative, calling it particularly timely given Pakistan’s precarious position as one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations. She termed the move a national service, noting that the country was bearing the brunt of climate change effects in the form of devastating floods, cloudbursts, and increasingly erratic monsoon spells. “Creating awareness among the public and bringing together all the departments and institutions concerned is a national service,” she added, underscoring the need for coordinated action across sectors.
Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan echoed this sentiment, calling the programme the need of the hour. “Our country is in trouble due to climate change and projects like Breathe Pakistan were required to counter the challenge and create awareness among the people,” he said. He stressed that every citizen should make a contribution to make the climate better — a reminder that while policy and governance are crucial, individual action remains an essential piece of the puzzle.
Abid Omar of the Pakistan Air Quality Index, a community-led initiative to monitor air pollution, described air pollution as the most pressing issue facing Pakistan today. “It’s an internal threat. It’s a clear and present danger. Every year, over 100,000 people are dying from air pollution. It is causing a tremendous loss to our economy,” he said, his words highlighting a crisis that kills more Pakistanis annually than many recognise — a silent epidemic claiming lives through respiratory diseases, heart conditions, and stroke.
The economic toll is equally staggering: lost productivity, healthcare costs, and reduced life expectancy translate into billions in economic damage, draining resources that could fuel development.
Mr Omar, who will be among the experts attending the conference, expressed the hope that DawnMedia, in convening this critical gathering, would prove “seminal in making the policy required to clean Pakistan’s air” — a recognition that while the data documenting the crisis is clear, what Pakistan desperately needs now is actionable policy and political will.
Jamaat-i-Islami chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman also lauded the Breathe Pakistan initiative, emphasising that the country desperately needs greenery and trees. “Trees should be planted and they should be protected. The mafia involved in deforestation should be controlled and the government should be pressured to not support such mafias,” he said, alluding to the powerful timber and land-grabbing interests that have stripped Pakistan’s forests — from the dwindling conifer forests of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the mangroves along the southern coast — at alarming rates.
Deforestation not only removes nature’s air filters but also accelerates soil erosion and reduces the land’s capacity to absorb carbon emissions. “If we want clear air and save ourselves from climate change, initiatives like this conference should be supported,” he added, calling for collective action beyond partisan politics.
The DawnMedia CEO outlined the conference’s robust institutional backing: “The Air We Breathe is being held in collaboration with the Environment Protection and Climate Change Department, Government of Punjab and the United Nations as our principal partners, the Pakistan Business Council as our knowledge partner, and IPSOS, CFP, and Carbon Track as our research partners.” The partnership structure reflects the multidimensional nature of the air quality challenge — requiring coordination across government, international agencies, business, and data-driven research.
She added that The Air We Breathe builds on the momentum from the first conference “by shifting the focus from pledges to practical, tangible measures to reduce air pollution.
We’re also introducing new mechanisms to track progress and sustain accountability, ensuring that what began as conversation now translates into long-term, measurable action.”
The emphasis on accountability signals a departure from Pakistan’s long history of environmental commitments that fade once the cameras stop rolling.
Ms Saigol-Lakhani said the conference focused on the quality of the air and everyone should attend it to become better informed and be agents of change in their own spheres. “But more specifically, this conference is for policymakers, industry leaders, urban planners, environmental experts, academics, and students who want to play an active role in shaping Pakistan’s response to the air quality crisis,” she explained.
The speaker lineup reflects this cross-sectoral approach: Federal ministers Ahsan Iqbal and Musadik Masood Malik, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Supreme Court justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Ayesha Malik, and Jawad Hassan, Punjab Environment Prot­ection and Climate Change Secretary Silwat Saeed, UN Resident Coor­dinator Mohamed Yahya, Emma Fan of the Asian Development Bank, and Zafar Masud of the Bank of Punjab will be among those addressing the gathering — a mix of judicial authority, political leadership, technical expertise, and financial institutions necessary to drive systemic change.

Shortly after the shooting, two policemen depl­oyed on the opposite side of the road retaliated and killed him.
 
 

CCTV footage showed a suspect carrying a pistol approached the worship place, Baitul Mehdi, in Rab­wah and opened fire on the security guards, who were volunteers from the community. Six gu­a­­­rds were injured, but they managed to close the main gate of the worship place.
The injured guards were shifted to a nearby hospital where four were reported to be stable while two remained critical. Police shifted the body of the attacker to the morgue.
Attack condemned
Ahmadi community spo­k­e­sperson Aamir Mahm­ood condemned the attack, saying that continuous hate speeches were being made against the community. He urged the state to take notice of such hateful rhetoric and take strict action against those responsible. He demanded effective measures to ensure the safety of Ahmadi community members.
 
 

Chiniot DPO Abdullah Ahmad told Dawn that the worship place had been attacked by a gunman, resulting in injuries to six private security guards.
He said police and the guards returned fire, killing the attacker on the spot. One of the guards was in critical condition, while five were stable, he added. He said the attacker had arrived in a car along with another person. His identification card was recovered from the vehicle.

As per reports, explosions were heard in the Afghan capital on Thursday, though the Taliban government spokesman claimed there was no harm done. When the ISPR chief was asked during a presser on Friday to comment on Mehsud’s reported elimination, he neither confirmed nor denied it but repeated the official demand that Afghanistan take action against terrorists on its soil.
He also added that Pakistan will do “whatever is necessary” to protect its citizens and territory. On Thursday, the defence minister had also raised the issue in the National Assembly, saying that the state was deliberating over sending another delegation to Kabul to convince the Taliban to “dismantle safe havens” that were being used by the terrorists.
 
 

The fact is that the Afghan Taliban, despite their denials, have hosted terrorists of various persuasions on their soil. For example, the US strike that took out Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in the Afghan capital in 2022 left the Taliban red-faced, as it was a clear violation of the Doha Agreement between them and the Americans. Therefore, it is not implausible that Noor Wali Mehsud was eliminated while in Kabul.
Pakistan has in the past launched cross-border attacks into Afghanistan, while pursuing terrorists responsible for violence in this country. It is, indeed, a complex situation; the state must act as terrorists, many taking refuge on Afghan soil, martyr civilians and soldiers in brazen attacks. Yet going after militants across the border is not without risk, as it could inflame matters further with the Taliban regime.
 
 

Pakistan does not have many good options in this regard. On the external front, it appears that the best course may be to continue relaying the message — bilaterally and together with regional partners such as China, Russia and Iran — to the Afghan Taliban that sheltering terrorists will have costs, such as reduction in trade activities, or downgrading of diplomatic relations.
Kabul must be told that the current situation — where terrorists seek refuge on Afghan soil but the Taliban government remains in denial — is not tenable. What the Afghan Taliban do with their militant ‘guests’ is their problem; Pakistan and the rest of Afghanistan’s neighbours must be assured that their security will not be threatened by these malign actors.
Internally, along with kinetic actions to take territory back from the militants, there is also a need to pursue the non-kinetic elements of NAP, which the ISPR head alluded to. This was a process that had the buy-in of all state institutions.

• ATC grants 12-day remand for 110 TLP activists
LAHORE: The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) began marching towards Islamabad after Friday prayers, with a large number of supporters reaching Shahdara and staging a sit-in after clashes with police, partially paralysing the provincial capital.
The law enforcers repeatedly tried to contain the procession near the group’s headquarters by erecting barricades and containers and using tear gas and other crowd-control measures.
In the Gujrat district, local authorities on Friday night dug up trenches at least three locations along the G.T. Road to block the march headed towards Islamabad.
However, the TLP, led by its chief Saad Rizvi, not only managed to take out the main procession in Lahore as part of its “Gaza March” but also kept on moving ahead amid religious slogans, rendering the police helpless.
Reports suggest that protests turned violent following Friday sermons delivered by prominent religious figures of the organisation at local mosques before the march began to move towards Islamabad from Lahore’s Multan Road.
Video circulating on social media appeared to show protesters commandeering heavy vehicles, including cranes reportedly belonging to government departments such as the Lahore Waste Management Company, Rescue 1122 and the Punjab police, to use them in the procession.
Scuffles reportedly broke out soon after TLP chief Saad Rizvi delivered a major sermon at the main Friday congregation at the central mosque near the organisation’s headquarters on Multan Road.
Later, he addressed a big rally and gave the party workers the go-ahead to move towards Islamabad as per the given plan.
Confrontations were reported at multiple locations along Multan Road, including Yateem Khana Chowk, Chauburji, near the Civil Secretariat, Bhati Gate, Azadi Chowk and Ravi Bridge (Shahdara).
Witnesses said some protesters occupied sections of the Orange Line track to throw stones at police, injuring several officers. Protesters were seen carrying sticks, rods and bricks.
Police responded by firing tear-gas shells and, according to witnesses, warning shots in the air to disperse the crowd.
 
 

On some occasions, the two sides were seen chasing and repelling each other. Sources said three police vehicles were seized and some personnel briefly taken hostage and assaulted, turning stretches of Multan Road into a battleground and disrupting life for nearby residents.
A second wave of major scuffles was reported near Azadi Chowk, where several police vehicles were damaged and many officials were injured.
Footage on social media showed officers retreating for cover; two superintendents of police were also seen taking positions at safer locations. One video showed an officer being knocked to the ground and bleeding.
Police sources said dozens of officers were injured, some seriously, after being pelted with stones and attacked by baton-wielding protesters. The TLP said many of its supporters were injured and alleged that some had died from police firing during the march. Neither claim could be independently verified and no official casualty figures were released.
Authorities also accused TLP-linked social media accounts of circulating old images and videos to inflame tensions. By evening, hundreds of TLP workers had gathered near Ravi Bridge awaiting further instructions from Mr Rizvi.
Talal’s presser
State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry accused the TLP of holding protests to misuse the issue of corruption for political gain, reiterating that the government would not allow any group to use violence or blackmail the state. Speaking to the media in Islamabad, he said policy is clear: peaceful protest within the democratic and constitutional framework is a constitutional right. “There is no space for groups to blackmail others, to use mobs, or to use violence to achieve their demands or objectives,” he said.
 
 

Mr Chaudhry said hundreds of suspects planning violence had been identified, and that provincial governments had already made arrests. “For the government, stopping around 2,000 people is not a problem, but a policy decision was made to use minimum force,” he noted.
Meanwhile, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday handed 110 TLP activists to police on a 12-day physical remand in a case relating to violent protests and attacks on law enforcers. Police produced the suspects before the court and sought their custody for interrogation. ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill approved the remand and directed police to conduct the investigation strictly in accordance with the law.
Nawankot police have registered an FIR alleging the suspects attacked law enforcement personnel, opened fire, resorted to violence and damaged public property during a protest.
Those remanded include Qari Umar Farooq, Basharat Ali, Qari Shabbir Farooqi, Hafiz Ghulam Sarwar, Qari M. Hussain, Qari Muharram Aslam, Qari Khurshid, Hammad Ali, Imran Hussain, Ghulam Nabi, Nazir Hussain aka Nazir Chishti and Muhammad Usama. The judge ordered police to produce the suspects again upon completion of the remand for further proceedings.
Meanwhile, local authorities in the Gujrat district on Friday night dug trenches at least three locations along the GT Road.
Earlier in the day, both bridges over the Chenab and Jhelum rivers were sealed by parking heavy vehicles across the carriageways. Entry to and exit from Gujrat via several other points were also curtailed for vehicular traffic.
However, pedestrians were still allowed to cross the bridges, though officials warned this may become difficult today if further vehicles are added to the barriers.
Trenches have been dug near the Jhelum bridge at Sarai Alamgir and on the Wazirabad side of the Chenab.
For the first time, a trench has also been dug on GT Road within Kharian city to render vehicular movement virtually impossible. Previously, such trenches were typically limited to approaches near river bridges, including during the 2021 TLP march.
A senior law-enforcement official said preparations were in place to create additional trenches at various points along GT Road within the Gujrat district if the march cannot be contained in Gujranwala.
Heavy containers have also been parked at multiple locations in Gujrat city and in the towns of Lalamusa, Kharian and Sarai Alamgir.
The closures have paralysed daily life, with numerous social and business events postponed. The local business fraternity voiced concern over the prolonged blockade and urged the government to adopt a viable policy to tackle such situations without crippling commercial activity.

The FO, moreover, also emphasised the need for continued dialogue and cooperation with Kabul to address cross-border terrorism.
At the weekly FO briefing, spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the security and well-being of its people.”
 






Pakistan “respects the sovereignty of Afghanistan, and remains steadfast in its commitment to fostering dialogue and cooperation with our neighbour to address the shared challenges of terrorism”, the spokesperson said, adding that the security operations were intelligence-driven and aimed at protecting its citizens from terrorist groups, including the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The statement came after twin explosions shook Kabul on Thursday night. Local Afghan media, quoting witnesses, reported fighter jet overflights and bursts of automatic gunfire. They described the blasts as precision air strikes that hit a vehicle and a compound linked to the TTP, suggesting that the intended target was TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud.
Meanwhile, reports on Noor Wali Mehsud’s fate were conflicting. Some Pakistan military-linked social media hailed the strike as a potential blow to the TTP leadership, while pro-TTP channels released an audio message purportedly from the TTP chief denying his death and calling the reports “enemy propaganda”. The incident marks one of the most serious escalations between the two neighbours since the Taliban’s return to power in 2021.

Stresses continued dialogue, cooperation with Kabul to address cross-border terrorism, says Afghanistan’s sovereignty is respected

Analysts say that if confirmed a Pakistani strike inside Kabul would be the first such incident in the Afghan capital, although Pakistan has previously conducted operations against TTP targets in other parts of Afghanistan.
Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces patience has worn out,” Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had said a day earlier in the National Assembly.
Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups.
Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the Foreign Office briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.
Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.”
India-Afghanistan agreement
The Foreign Office refrained from commenting on the agreement between New Delhi and Kabul to reopen their long-shuttered embassies.
The agreement was reached during talks in New Delhi between Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Afghanistan’s Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, which marked India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021.
“Our position on Afghanistan’s bilateral relations with any other country remains that it is a matter between those two countries,” Mr Khan said, adding, “Afghanistan is a sovereign, independent country, and we do not have any particular comment to offer on it.”
He further noted that Pakistan’s consistent request to Afghanistan, while respecting its sovereign right to pursue an independent foreign policy, has been that Afghan territory should not be used against Pakistan.

DI Khan District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Ahmed Sahibzada confirmed that three terrorists were killed by police forces and added that a large contingent of security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area.
Police confirmed that the training centre premises were cleared and all terrorists involved in the attack were killed.
A search operation, led by DPO Sahibzada, was also conducted in the surrounding areas to ensure no other terrorists were present.
A large contingent of security forces reached the incident site soon after the attack commenced and cordoned off the area. Earlier, there were reports of a loud explosion in the vicinity of the police facility.
DI Khan Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) Yaqoob Khan earlier told Dawn.com that a “suicide bomber and two terrorists have been killed”.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
A senior army officer was martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the district a day ago. A cop was martyred in the district after a police checkpoint came under attack from multiple sides by terrorists late on Wednesday.
Recently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.
Last month, 13 terrorists were killed during an IBO in the district’s Daraban area.
According to reports compiled by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, KP remained the most terrorism affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.</p><small>2025-10-10 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628019-can-pakistan-reverse-its-dismal-record-on-ocean-protection' target='_blank'><strong>Can Pakistan reverse its dismal record on ocean protection?</strong></a><br><p>

“We can confirm there has been an explosion at Accurate Energetic Systems in the Bucksnort area,” located in Hickman County, Tennessee, the local sheriff’s office wrote on Facebook.
“Emergency services are currently on the scene working to address the situation,” it added.
The mayor’s office in Hickman County told AFP that it could not immediately confirm any fatalities or the cause of the explosion.
Hickman County Mayor Jim Bates told CNN the plant did not have a history of safety problems, although there was a small ammunition explosion there in 2014. That incident killed one person and injured three, according to the Tennessean newspaper.
However, Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis reported “some” fatalities and added that several people were missing in the “very devastating blast” that engulfed an entire building at the facility.
“We do have several people at this time that’s unaccounted for. We are trying to be mindful of families and that situation,” Davis said. “We do have some that are deceased. But we’re going to go back and, like I say, talk to these families, notify these families.”
Davis said authorities had secured the area, but warned of the possibility of smaller explosions around the site.
Accurate Energetic Systems, an explosives manufacturer founded in 1980, develops, manufactures and stores explosives for “military, aerospace, and commercial demolition markets,” according to the company’s website.
The 1,300-acre headquarters in Bucksnort, Tennessee, includes eight production buildings and a quality lab.

“Pakistan violated Afghanistan’s airspace, bombing a civilian market in the Marghi area of Paktika near the Durand Line and also violating Kabul’s sovereign territory,” the Afghan Defence Ministry said in a post on social media.
For its part, Pakistan remained tight-lipped on the issue, with the the military spokesperson neither confirming nor denying the strikes when questioned about them at a press conference earlier in the day. The Foreign Office, meanwhile, did not respond to a request for comment till the publication of this report.
On Thursday evening, residents in the border town of Marghi reported that a market selling second-hand weapons had been bombed. Around the same time, Afghan government spokesman Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabeehullah Mujahid confirmed on X that an explosion “was heard in the city of Kabul”.
Many social media accounts speculated that TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud was targeted, but Mujahid refuted the reports in an interview with Anadolu Agency and claimed Mehsud was not present in Kabul or Afghanistan.
The development comes amid Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi’s first visit to India. During the visit, New Delhi announced it was upgrading its mission in Kabul to a full embassy.
The top Afghan diplomat addressed the Kabul incident while speaking at a press conference, saying: “There has been an attack near the border in remote areas. We consider this act of Pakistan wrong. Problems cannot be solved like this … We have kept the door to discussion open. They should solve their problem on their own.
Earlier, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry did not directly respond when questioned whether Pakistan was responsible for the attacks. “To safeguard Pakistani lives and properties, what measures need to be taken will be taken,” he told reporters.
Surge in terrorism
Terrorism has surged in Pakistan since the withdrawal of US-led troops from Afghanistan in 2021 and the return of the Taliban government.
The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistani Taliban (TTP), a separate but linked group to the Afghan Taliban, along with its affiliates, is behind most of the violence — largely directed at security forces.
A lieutenant colonel and a major were among 11 security personnel martyred in an exchange of fire with the TTP in the Orakzai district earlier this week.
The federal government and the army have repeatedly accused Kabul’s authorities of harbouring terrorist groups that launch attacks on Pakistani soil with impunity.
Earlier this year, a UN report said the TTP “receive substantial logistical and operational support from the de facto authorities”, referring to the Taliban government in Kabul.
 
 

A day earlier, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told the National Assembly that several efforts to convince the Afghan Taliban to stop backing the TTP had failed.
“We will not tolerate this any longer,” Asif said. “United, we must respond to those facilitating them — whether the hideouts are on our soil or Afghan soil.”
He warned that any response could cause collateral damage. “Everyone will have to bear the consequences, including those providing the hideouts. Enough is enough,” he added. “The Pakistani government and army’s patience has run out.“
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also said the nation was united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country and the government would take all measures to crush violence perpetrated from across the border.
Pak-Afghan tensions
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
With ties between the two neighbouring countries already strained, PM Shehbaz had issued a stern message to Kabul last month, saying Afghanistan must decide whether it stands with Pakistan or the TTP.
The prime minister said terrorists entered Pakistan from Afghanistan and, together with the outlawed TTP, carried out attacks that martyred soldiers, brothers, sisters and ordinary citizens. He added that Pakistan was willing to maintain relations with Afghanistan, but if Kabul chose to side with and support the terrorists, then Pakistan had nothing to do with the interim Afghan government and the terrorists would be eliminated at any cost.
Differences between Pakistan and Afghanistan are primarily centred on security and border disputes. Pakistan has made terrorism its central concern in ties with Kabul, citing a sharp rise in attacks by the banned TTP and other militant groups operating from Afghanistan.
Further exacerbating tensions has been the issue of repatriation of Afghan refugees by the federal government, a move that has been criticised by the Taliban authorities.
During a meeting in January held in Peshawar, political leaders had urged Field Marshal Asim Munir that the military engage with Afghanistan to address Pakistan’s internal security problems. The army chief, however, said the Afghan interim rulers had failed to heed repeated warnings in the past. “They don’t listen to us,” sources quoted the field marshal as telling politicians who had called for formal or informal dialogue with the interim Afghan government.
Lack of action by Afghan authorities against terror outfits has also led to reprisal by Pakistan in recent months.
At least three people were killed and seven wounded in two separate incidents in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar and Khost provinces in August. Afghan authorities claimed the fatalities were caused by strikes carried out by Pakistan. There was no official word from Islamabad, and Afghan authorities did not provide any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the incidents.
Pakistan has targeted terrorist camps in Afghan territory in the past: most recently in December last year, when Pakistani jets bombed positions in Pak­tika province, targeting TTP members.
At the time, the Foreign Office had avoided di­r­ectly commenting on the claim, but admitted that Pa­k­­i­stani forces conducted “operations in border areas to protect the people of Pakistan from terr­­­orist groups”. A number of cross-border infiltration bids have also been foiled.</p><small>2025-10-10 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/101812054f89dc3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947905/karachi-university-student-dies-after-being-run-over-by-campus-bus' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi University student dies after being run over by campus bus</strong></a><br><p>A Karachi University student died on Friday after being run over by a campus bus, police said.
The victim was identified as a second-year student of the social work department by traffic police inspector Akmal Rai.
According to police reports, the student had gotten off at a point near the Mehmood-ul-Hassan Library and was attempting to cross the road when another bus passed by her.
Meanwhile, a campus bus, bearing registration number EB-0333, attempted to overtake the first bus and hit the student from the driver’s side.
The student, knocked down by the initial impact, was then run over by the bus, killing her on the spot. The accident angered students, resulting in protests inside the campus.
A notification issued by the university dated October 10, and available with Dawn.com, said an inquiry committee has been constituted to “investigate the tragic incident”.
“Vice Chancellor is pleased to constitute an inquiry committee forthwith to investigate the tragic incident in which a female student succumbed to death,” the notification stated.
Per the notification, the convenor of the committee is the chairperson of the Department of Criminology Prof Dr Naima Saeed, with members including in-charge transport NED University of Engineering and Technology, a final-year student of the social work department M Alam, and another student from the social work department Ms Sarwat.
“The committee is instructed to investigate the incident and submit its report in 15 days,” added the notification.</p><small>2025-10-10 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/101410187183149.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947881/venezuela-opposition-leader-maria-corina-machado-wins-nobel-peace-prize-dedicates-award-to-trump' target='_blank'><strong>Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado wins Nobel Peace Prize, dedicates award to Trump</strong></a><br><p>Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado received the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.
The committee chose to focus on Venezuela at this time, in a year dominated by US President Donald Trump’s repeated public statements that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.
Machado was on this year’s TIME Magazine “100 most influential People” list, where current US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said she was the “personification of resilience, tenacity, and patriotism”.
“She is receiving the prize for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” said Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo.
“As the leader of the democratic forces in the Venezuela, she is one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times,” he said.
 






He said that Machado had been a “key unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided; an opposition that found common ground in the demand for free election and representative government”.
“This is precisely what lies at the heart of democracy: our shared willingness to defend the principles of popular rule even though we disagree. At a time when democracy is under threat, it is more important than ever to defend this common ground,” he said.
He stated that Venezuela had evolved from “a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal and authoritarian state” that was suffering from a humanitarian and economic crisis.
“Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty even as the few at top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against its own population. Nearly eight million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution, and imprisonment,” he said.
He further said that Venezuela’s authoritarian regime made carrying out political work in the country “extremely dangerous”, adding that Machado stood up for free and fair elections more than 20 years ago.
Frydnes said that the Venezuela opposition leader had spoken out for judicial independence, human rights, and popular representation.
“She has spent years working for the representation of the Venezuelan people,” he said. He further said that Machado was the opposition’s presidential candidate for the 2024 elections, but her candidacy was blocked by the regime.
“She then backed the representative of another party Edmundo González Urrutia in the elections. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised across the political divides. They were trained as election observers to ensure a transparent and fair election.
“Despite the risk of harassment, arrest, and torture, citizens across the country held watch over the polling stations. They made sure the final tallies were documented before the regime could destroy ballots and lie about the outcome,” he said, adding that the efforts of the collective opposition were innovative, brave, peaceful and democratic.
Frydnes went on to say that democracy was a pre-condition for lasting peace. “However, we live in a world where democracy is in retreat. Where more and more authoritarian regimes are challenging norms and resorting to violence.”
He said the repression of the Venezuelan population by its regime was not unique. “We see the same trends globally. Rule of law abused by those in control, free media silenced, critics imprisoned and societies pushed towards authoritarian rule and militarisation.
“In 2024, more elections were held than ever before. But fewer and fewer are free and fair.”
Noting that she has been forced to live in hiding in the past year, he said, “Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.”
Frydnes said that Machado “embodies the hope for a different future — one where the fundamental rights of citizens are protected and their voices are heard”.
US President Trump had made no secret of his desire to win this year’s prize.
Since returning to the White House for his second term in January, the US leader has repeatedly insisted that he “deserves” the Nobel for his role in resolving numerous conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated.
But Nobel Prize experts in Oslo had insisted in the run-up to Friday’s announcement that he had no chance, noting that his “America First” policies run counter to the ideals of the Peace Prize as laid out in Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will creating the award.
Machado dedicated the award in part to Trump.
“Oh my God … I have no words,” Machado told the secretary of the award body, Kristian Berg Harpviken, in a phone call which the Nobel Committee posted on social media.
 






“I thank you so much, but I hope you understand this is a movement, this is an achievement of a whole society. I am just one person. I certainly do not deserve it,” she added.
She later said, in an X post in English: “I dedicate the prize to the suffering people of Venezuela and to President Trump for his decisive support of our cause!”
 






Last year, the prestigious prize went to the Japanese anti-nuclear group Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The prize comes with a gold medal, a diploma and a prize sum of $1.2 million.
The award will be presented at a formal ceremony in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of the prizes’ creator, Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel.
The Peace Prize is the only Nobel awarded in Oslo, with the other disciplines announced in Stockholm.
Will she be able to attend ceremony?
It was not immediately clear whether she would be able to attend the award ceremony in Oslo.
Should she not attend, she would join the list of Peace Prize laureates prevented from doing so in the award’s 124-year history, including Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov in 1975, Poland’s Lech Walesa in 1983 and Myanmar’s Aung San Suu Kyi in 1991.
Machado is the first Venezuelan to win the Nobel Peace Prize and the sixth from Latin America. Her three adult children are living abroad for safety reasons.
The United Nations human rights office welcomed the award to Machado as a recognition of “the clear aspirations of the people of Venezuela for free and fair elections”.
The head of the award committee, Joergen Watne Frydnes, said he hoped it would spur the Venezuelan opposition’s work.
“We hope that the entire opposition will have renewed energy to continue the work for a peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” Frydnes told Reuters after the announcement.</p><small>2025-10-10 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10103101e6ab6df.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947869/at-least-7-dead-after-philippines-hit-by-twin-quakes-tsunami-warning-up' target='_blank'><strong>At least 7 dead after Philippines hit by twin quakes, tsunami warning up</strong></a><br><p>Two powerful offshore earthquakes struck off the southern Philippines on Friday, killing at least seven people, while towns near the epicentre suffered structural damage and authorities warned of strong aftershocks.
The first quake of magnitude 7.4, in waters off the town of Manay in the province of Davao Oriental, triggered a tsunami alert for coasts within 300 kilometres of the epicentre, but the warnings for the Philippines and Indonesia were subsequently lifted.
A second earthquake of magnitude 6.8 struck the same area seven hours later, triggering a new tsunami warning, with the country’s seismology agency Phivolcs warning of possible waves that could be more than a metre higher than normal tides.
 






People living near coastal areas in the southern Philippines were “strongly advised to immediately evacuate” to higher ground, or move further inland, it said in an advisory.
Phivolcs Director Teresito Bacolcol described the twin earthquakes as a “doublet”, two distinct earthquakes that occurred along a massive trench off the country’s eastern seaboard.
There were initial reports of damage to homes, buildings and bridges, one official in Manay said, although the full extent of the damage in the Philippines was not immediately clear.
At least seven people were killed, civil defence official Ednar Dayanghirang said in a briefing. The fatalities were reported in towns and cities near the earthquake’s epicentre.
The twin quakes were among the strongest in recent years to hit the Philippines, which sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and experiences more than 800 quakes each year.
It came two weeks after the Philippines experienced its deadliest earthquake in more than a decade with 74 people killed on the central island of Cebu following an offshore quake of magnitude 6.9.

Vehicles shaking, gates rattling
A video posted on social media and verified by Reuters showed people in the city of Davao calmly holding on to parked vehicles that rocked from side to side as the ground shook, as metal gates rattled nearby.
Richie Diuyen, a disaster official in Manay, said the quake lasted 30 to 40 seconds and damaged some homes and the facade of a church, while leaving cracked roads and unpassable bridges.
“We couldn’t stand earlier. I am 46 years old now, and this is the strongest earthquake I ever felt,” Diuyen said by phone.
Earlier, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said authorities were assessing the situation and search-and-rescue teams would fan out once it was safe.
“We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” he said in a statement.
Warning of strong aftershocks
Phivolcs warned of aftershocks and urged people in affected areas to stay away from the shoreline.
Verified footage from the southern Philippines showed workers filing out of buildings to gather in the streets, lamps swaying in shops, and offices with toppled cabinets and workers holding on to desks as structures and fittings around them creaked.
Video images from Indonesia’s island of Sulawesi showed fishing boats returning from sea and children playing on a beach from which water had receded.
Phivolcs revised down the magnitude to 7.4 from an initial figure of 7.6, and put the quake’s depth at 23km. The second quake was also downwardly revised to 6.8 from 6.9, with an depth of 37km.
The governor of Davao del Norte in the Philippines said people panicked when the earthquake struck.
“Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told broadcaster DZMM. “It was very strong.”</p><small>2025-10-10 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/101950174aba43c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947913/karachi-police-developing-web-portal-for-businessmen-to-lodge-extortion-complaints' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police developing web portal for businessmen to lodge extortion complaints</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar announced on Friday that a web portal is being developed to facilitate traders by registering their complaints regarding extortion and other crimes in Karachi.
Earlier this week, Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Ghulam Nabi Memon vowed to provide full protection to economic and commercial activities in collaboration with traders across the province.
“All complaints submitted through this portal will be addressed promptly, and police action will be taken immediately to ensure redressal,” Lanjar said while addressing a press conference at the Karachi Police Office.
Flanked by IG Memon and Karachi Additional IG Javed Alam Odho, Lanjar said any complaint related to extortion slips or threats submitted through the new web portal will lead to the immediate registration of a first information report (FIR), and all legal measures will be ensured against those involved.
Additional IG Odho said that the initiative is being taken in light of traders reporting “inconveniences” while visiting police stations for lodging an FIR.
“Protecting the business community and providing them with a safe and free business environment are among the top priorities of the Sindh government,” Lanjar said.
He added that extortion has become a major issue of concern in recent times and emphasised that since Karachi is Pakistan’s economic hub, the government’s foremost priority is to provide a peaceful environment for the business community and all traders, ensuring safe and free business activities at every level.
“Although the issue of extortion has been given significant hype, both the SIU/CIA (Special Investigation Unit/Crime Investigation Agency) and the district police are fully committed to uprooting and eradicating this crime and have been conducting effective and coordinated operations,” the home minister said.
“At present, Wasiullah Lakho and Samad Kathiawari are operating extortion gangs from Iran,” he added. “For their arrest, a formal request for red warrants has been sent, and the Sindh government will also request assistance from the federal interior minister to help ensure the arrest of these criminals involved in such heinous acts.”
The home minister stated that extortion in a city like Karachi is a highly serious and sensitive matter, and the provincial government has always been committed to providing a business-friendly environment to promote economic activity. However, he stressed that public cooperation is crucial to curb extortion.
Lanjar noted that the SIU/CIA and district police have conducted operations in which four extortionists were killed.
“The threats were linked to the Lakho group and Samad Kathiawari, and the government will never allow any group or criminal element to openly distribute extortion slips or intimidate citizens,” he vowed.
Additional IG Odho added that the police had arrested 20 suspected extortionists within two weeks. He said that there would be zero extortion cases in the city and recalled that the police had also controlled targeted killings in the metropolis.
On Wednesday, a police crime data report showed that 118 incidents of extortion were reported in Karachi so far this year, of which only 44 were genuine extortion cases, while the remaining 74 pertained to personal disputes and business quarrels. A police statement added that of the 44 cases, 39 were “solved” — a success ratio of 87 per cent.
Additionally, compared to last year, there has been a “significant” reduction in street crimes during the ongoing year. As of 2024, 252 incidents of street crimes were being reported daily, but this year, only 167 incidents have been reported, a decrease of 52pc.
According to a crime statistics report seen by Dawn.com, only six people were killed as of September 2025, compared to 13 as of January 2024.</p><small>2025-10-10 15:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10193110b0c5672.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947912/white-house-says-trump-nobel-omission-was-politics-over-peace' target='_blank'><strong>White House says Trump Nobel omission was ‘politics over peace’</strong></a><br><p>The White House lashed out at the Norwegian Nobel Committee on Friday after it awarded the peace prize to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado and overlooked US President Donald Trump.
“The Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace,” White House Director of Communications Steven Cheung said on X.
 






“President Trump will continue making peace deals, ending wars, and saving lives. He has the heart of a humanitarian, and there will never be anyone like him who can move mountains with the sheer force of his will.”
Since returning to the White House for his second term in January, Trump had repeatedly insisted that he deserved the Nobel for his role in resolving numerous conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated.
Trump restated his claim on the eve of the peace prize announcement, saying that his brokering of the first phase of a ceasefire in Gaza this week was the eighth war he had ended.
But he added on Thursday: “Whatever they do is fine. I know this: I didn’t do it for that, I did it because I’ve saved a lot of lives.”
Nobel Prize experts in Oslo had insisted in the run-up to Friday’s announcement that Trump had no chance, noting that his “America First” policies run counter to the ideals of the Peace Prize as laid out in Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will creating the award.
The president has not yet commented on the Nobel decision, but he did post three videos on his Truth Social account on Friday morning of supporters celebrating the Gaza deal.
“Will you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not. They’ll give it to some guy that didn’t do a damn thing,” Trump told top US military leaders last month.
He said it would be a “big insult” to the United States if he didn’t get it.
Nominations for the Nobel must have been made before January 31 to be valid for this year’s prize. Trump returned to the White House for his second term in office on January 20.</p><small>2025-10-10 14:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627978-ku-female-student-dies-after-being-struck-by-campus-bus' target='_blank'><strong>KU female student dies after being struck by campus bus</strong></a><br><p>

The DG ISPR made these remarks while addressing a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters.
 


He said governance gaps in KP were being paid for by the blood of security personnel.
“Appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators is never and not a policy,” he asserted, adding that the state and its institutions would not be bothered by “any political distortions”.
“The state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of any single person who is singularly the most responsible person for bringing terrorism back to KP.”
He said that he hoped the government would focus on governance and the people it was duty-bound to protect. “We also hope that instead of begging Afghanistan for security, you will protect this province and its people.”
The DG ISPR began the press conference by paying homage on behalf of the armed forces of Pakistan to the “brave sons of soil” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He said the purpose of the press conference was to give an overview of the security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
For the past two decades, Pakistan, particularly KP, has been facing the issue of terrorism, he said.
In 2024, he said, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP, 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians were killed.
Moreover, he continued, 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025 until September 15. In these operations, 970 terrorists were killed while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred.
When the frequency of terrorism incidents increased in 2021, “the response also went up”, the DG ISPR said. “And more number of kharijis were killed in subsequent years.”
The DG ISPR said following the 2014 attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, security forces had started uprooting terrorism as part of a comprehensive strategy.
“We reached close to [realising] the dream of a peaceful Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. [But], unfortunately, as part of a plan, terrorists and their facilitators were then provided space here.
“Governance and public welfare were deliberately weakened and attempts were made to build a misleading narrative. The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are paying its price with their blood and sacrifices even today.”
Factors behind rise of militancy
He then outlined the factors that led to this situation.
First reason, he said, was not fully implementing the National Action Plan, followed by politicising the issue of terrorism, India using Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the provision of modern weapons to terrorists in Afghanistan and the existence of a “terrorism-crime nexus” that had “complete local and political backing”.
Going back to the 2014 APS attack, he said all political parties, and the provincial and federal governments devised the NAP. “All political parties agreed that the implementation of the NAP was necessary for eliminating terrorism.”
But, he added, the then-government removed some provisions of the plan in 2021 despite progress in those areas and came up with the “revised” NAP. All political parties, provincial governments and the federal government then agreed to fully implement all 14 points of the revised plan, he said.
Pointing to a graphic of the plan on the screen, he said the first point concerned kinetic operations.
“Is this being worked on or not? I have presented the data for KP to you. Just in KP, are law enforcement agencies not conducting more than 40 intelligence-based operations?”
He asserted that the empirical evidence demonstrated that work was being done on the first point of the NAP. He then went on to question the work being done on the remaining 13 points.
“Today, are we all standing under one narrative? Do you not hear voices calling for talks with these terrorists? Are we following this NAP?
“Does the solution to all problems lie in dialogue? You tell me. If the solution for every problem is in dialogue, then when India fired missiles on Pakistan on May 6 and 7 … why didn’t the people of this country say let’s hold talks?”
If the solution lay in just holding dialogue, there would be no wars, he emphasised.
Coming to the fifth point, the military spokesperson said it had been decided to “break the terror-crime nexus” in order to eradicate terrorism. Moreover, he said, it had also been decided to “strengthen the judiciary” with regard to counter-terrorism cases.
Then, pulling up another graphic, the DG ISPR detailed the cases in anti-terrorism courts in KP.
He said that no one was convicted, while 34 cases were pending. “This is the judicial system that was to be strengthened. The political government of the time decided it, we did not.”
The DG ISPR further stated that the decision had been made to strengthen KP police. Noting that the provincial police was currently 3,200-personnel strong, he asked: “ The terrorism (situation) is before you all. Is this [number] enough?“
The army spokesperson also noted that the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan was being “politicised”.
“Misleading things were said when these decisions were taken.”
He said that after the US left Afghanistan in 2021, “they left behind weapons and ammunition that are now being used by terrorists. Those weapons were found in the custody of terrorists killed in operations in KP.”
The DG ISPR replied to a question about how things will change concerning the NAP by saying, “We know how things will change … they will change once we work on this NAP with clarity and in unison. There will be change when those who play politics are asked why they are playing with people’s lives and property and why they are supporting the statements of terrorists.”
Last night’s Kabul explosion
During the press conference, the DG ISPR was also asked about media reports alleging a strike was carried out in Kabul last night to eliminate the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) leader Noor Wali Mehsud.
In his response, he said the army had taken note of the reports circulating on social media and the statement issued by the Taliban spokesperson.
“Afghanistan is a neighbourly, Islamic country. We have historical connections, cultural connections. Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for four decades. We only say one thing to the Afghan government: do not allow your soil to be used for terrorism against Pakistan,” he added.
He pointed out that trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan was also continuing, and many Afghans came to Pakistan for medical reasons. “So we only have an extremely fair demand: don’t let your soil be used by non-state actors and terrorist groups.”
“Is it wrong to ask? It is absolutely fair, it is correct, it is rational, it is our right. And for this, we also engage them at multiple levels,” he said, highlighting several bilateral and multilateral engagements.
“Yes, we do engage them and we clearly communicate [to them] … that these are the [terrorist] leaders, their facilitators and their centres [in Afghanistan]. Yes, we engage [with Afghanistan], but at the same time, we are doing and will continue to do whatever is necessary to protect the lives of Pakistan’s people and its territorial integrity,” the DG ISPR continued.
When pressed by another reporter for more clarity on alleged strikes in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said, “I have made it clear that Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this. And I have also said that all the necessary steps for protecting the people’s lives and property are being taken and will continue to be taken.”
Saudi defence deal and international engagement to curb Afghan terrorism
Questioned about the Saudi defence deal and whether the kingdom could be engaged in the talks with Afghanistan to resolve the issue of cross-border militancy, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan continued to engage the country and its other allies even before the pact.
“We engage the Afghans directly at multiple levels and also through allied countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, China, US, Turkiye and many more. They all understand that the space being given to non-state actors in Afghanistan is not just against Pakistan.”
He said ‘‘every alphabet’’ of non-state actors was found in Afghanistan, pointing to various groups such as the TTP, IS-K, BLA and more.
DG Chaudhry said these terrorists had no affiliation or religious or cultural identity and were available to the highest bidder.
’’If you allow these elements space in your country, then every kind of terrorist organisation will be found. That is why we are engaging them because all of them are concerned because this threat from non-state actors is not only a danger to Pakistan or to the region but it is becoming a threat to the whole world.“
He said the Afghan authorities had to decide whether they would allow Afghanistan to become a sanctuary for terrorists or not, adding that history showed that nurturing such groups often led to them turning on their benefactors.
DG Chaudhry said such groups were a threat to Afghanistan and its people as well. He said Pakistan’s job was to engage the Afghan authorities and take necessary action to defend and protect the lives of its people.
On a question about an international coalition to strike terrorist havens in Afghanistan, he said while such consultations and engagement continued, “we know that your security cannot be granted by external players, while we keep on engaging them, the responsibility to protect your life and property and people is of Pakistan’s state and institutions and military and that is where our first and foremost focus is’’.
The DG ISPR also remarked on whether the presence of non-state actors was a product of the transition of the Afghan Taliban from a non-state actor to a state entity, or due to the interference of foreign actors such as India.
“Perhaps it is the clout and influence of these non-state actors in Afghanistan that has grown beyond control,” he said. “Perhaps it is the factions within Afghan government who cannot agree on how to resolve this problem. But that is for them to decide.”
Past engagement with TTP and change in KP leadership
Questioned about past engagement with the TTP and the change in the KP leadership that saw Ali Amin Gandapur stepping down as chief minister, the DG ISPR said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists). Where is this voice coming from? Who is saying this? Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talking to them and stopping operations.
‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations. It is for everyone to see that today, or five years back or six or seven or eight or in any timeframe, who is that person and political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’
DG Chaudhry said the person saying so was responsible for the state in the past but now he was not and yet he still persisted with his stance.
“It is absolutely clear that this stance and confusing the people through it that the solution to this problem is not in counterterrorism or operations but in talking to the people who slaughtered your children … is for everyone to see.’’
He said the army, police and children of Pakistan were paying the price for the above ‘‘perverted and criminal thinking’’.
DG Chaundry said talks were indeed engaged in but questioned what was the result of it all, pointing to the Afghan Taliban’s promises in the Doha peace talks and their failure to abide by them.
 
 

Questioned about the change in KP leadership and how it might be signalling a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR said the establishment was itself a part of the state.
“Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counter-terrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’
He questioned whether the military could afford distraction by political shenanigans and said the answer was no.
Faiz Hameed court martial proceedings
Questioned about the court martial proceedings against former spymaster retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, DG Chaudhry said: ‘‘That legal process is ongoing and will come to its logical and just conclusion.’’
To another question about an alleged delay in the court martial proceedings, DG Chaudhry said the matter concerned a former intelligence chief and hence the “gravity” of the matter was high.
’’The state and the institution have to be absolutely and deliberately correct in that. All the requirements of procedure, process and justice have to be met because you would not like to try such an important and critical case in hurry and haste,“ he added.
“The Pakistan Army’s system of internal accountability does not work off allegations but facts and evidence. There is a process to it and anybody who is charged is given complete right to defend themselves and that time will be given and is being given, so we are not worried about any delay because we have to fulfill all the requirements of justice and process.’’
He said another reason for the court martial proceedings was that ‘‘when you turn a relation into a political and personal relation, then you will have to answer for that. But who did it? The one who was [heading] the state at the time and doing politics and that is why, we always say not to involve us in your politics.’’
The DG ISPR said all political parties and politicians were respectable for the army but it was unacceptable if anyone considered their politics to be above the state.
“If a single person thinks their being is greater than Pakistan, then that is unacceptable.’’
Giving the example of the current state of Indian armed forces and the creeping influence of Hindutva , the military spokesperson said the military was the ‘‘ultimate instrument of violence’’ of the state and politicising it would lead to ‘‘horrible results’’.
Issue of US weapons left behind in Afghanistan
In response to a question about US weapons in the hands of terrorists, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan was engaged with Washington on the matter.
“This equipment is not only being used in Pakistan by Fitna al-Khawarij or Fitna al-Hindustan but the equipment left with non-state actors can be used anywhere,” he explained. “We do share data and engage with them (the US) and they understand how the equipment is used by non-state actors.”
Collateral damage during operations
In response to a question about collateral damage during operations and criticism by affected locals, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that operations were intelligence-based and “very precise”.
“We cannot believe statements about collateral damage because we are the army of Pakistan and KP,” he replied. “If terrorists have taken a family hostage and are firing at innocent people and we respond, does that make it collateral damage or facilitation?”
The DG ISPR noted that facilitators, whether they were doing it out of desperation or for financial gain, had three choices: “Turn terrorists over to the law. If that is not possible, then join the state and work to eradicate the threat,” the military spokesperson said. “If a terrorist violates the sanctity of someone’s home by entering it, and you do not force him out, that makes you a facilitator. Where is the collateral damage? there’s no collateral damage. There’s a terrorist and a facilitator.”</p><small>2025-10-10 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627966-extortion-a-serious-concern-in-karachi-says-home-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Extortion a serious concern in Karachi, says home minister</strong></a><br><p>
