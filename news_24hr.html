The DG ISPR made these remarks while addressing a press conference at Peshawar Corps Headquarters.
 


He said that governance gaps in KP were being paid for by the blood of security personnel.
“Appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators is never and not a policy,” he asserted, adding that the state and its institutions would not be bothered by “any political distortions”.
“The state and its people will not and cannot be left to the whims of any single person who is singularly the most responsible person for bringing terrorism back to KP.”
He said that he hoped the government would focus on governance and the people it was duty-bound to protect. “We also hope that instead of begging Afghanistan for security, you will protect this province and its people.”
The DG ISPR began the press conference with paying homage on behalf of the armed forces of Pakistan to the “brave sons of soil” of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He said the purpose of the press conference was to give an overview of the security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
For the past two decades, Pakistan, particularly KP, has been facing the issue of terrorism, he said.
In 2024, he said, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP, 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred while 165 civilians were killed.
Moreover, he continued, 10,115 operations were conducted in 2025 until September 15. In these operations, 970 terrorists were killed while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred.
While terrorism incidents had started increasing 2021 onwards, “the response also went up”, the DG ISPR said. “And more number of kharijis were killed in subsequent years.”
The DG ISPR said following the 2014 attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, security forces had started uprooting terrorism as part of a comprehensive strategy.
“We reached close to [realising] the dream of a peaceful Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. [But], unfortunately, as part of a plan, terrorists and their facilitators were then provided space here.
“Governance and public welfare were deliberately weakened and attempts were made to build a misleading narrative. The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are paying its price with their blood and sacrifices even today.”
Factors behind rise of militancy
He then outlined the factors that led to this situation.
First reason, he said, was not fully implementing the National Action Plan, followed by politicising the issue of terrorism, India using Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the provision of modern weapons to terrorists in Afghanistan and the existence of a “terrorism-crime nexus” that had “complete local and political backing”.
Going back to the 2014 APS attack, he said all political parties, and the provincial and federal government devised the NAP. “All political parties agreed that the implementation of the NAP was necessary for eliminating terrorism.”
But, he added, the then-government removed some provisions of the plan in 2021 despite progress in those areas and came up with the “revised” NAP. All political parties, provincial governments and the federal government then agreed to the full implement all 14 points of the revised plan, he said.
Pointing to a graphic of the plan on the screen, he said the first point concerned kinetic operations.
“Is this being worked on or not? I have presented the data for KP to you. Just in KP, are law enforcement agencies not conducting more than 40 intelligence-based operations?”
He asserted that the empirical evidence demonstrated that work was being done on the first point of the NAP. He then went on to question the work being done on the remaining 13 points.
“Today, are we all standing under one narrative? Do you not hear voices calling for talks with these terrorists? Are we following this NAP?
“Does the solution to all problems lie in dialogue? You tell me. If the solution for every problem is in dialogue, then when India fired missiles on Pakistan on May 6 and 7 … why didn’t the people of this country say let’s hold talks?”
If the solution lay in just holding dialogue, there would be no wars, he emphasised.
Coming to the fifth factor he mentioned as a reason for the rise in terrorism, he said it had been decided to “break the terror-crime nexus” in order to eradicate terrorism. Moreover, he said, it had also been decided to “strengthen the judiciary” with regard to counter-terrorism cases.
Then, pulling up another graphic, the DG ISPR detailed the cases in anti-terrorism courts in KP.
He said that no one was convicted, while 34 cases were pending. “This is the judicial system that was to be strengthened. The political government of the time decided it, we did not.”
The DG ISPR further stated that the decision had been made to strengthen KP police. Noting that the provincial police was currently 3,200-personnel strong, he asked: “ The terrorism (situation) is before you all. Is this [number] enough?“
The army spokesperson also noted that the repatriation of Afghan refugees from Pakistan was being “politicised”.
“Misleading things were said when these decisions were taken.”
He said that after the US left Afghanistan in 2021, “they left behind weapons and ammunition that are now being used by terrorists. Those weapons were found in the custody of terrorists killed in operations in KP.”
The DG ISPR replied to a question about how things will change concerning the NAP by saying, “We know how things will change … they will change once we work on this NAP with clarity and in unison. There will be change when those who play politics are asked why they are playing with people’s lives and property and why they are supporting the statements of terrorists.”
Last night’s Kabul explosion
During the press conference, the DG ISPR was also asked about media reports alleging a strike was carried out in Kabul last night to eliminate the banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s (TTP) leader Noor Wali Mehsud.
In his response, he said the army had taken note of the reports circulating on social media and the statement issued by the Taliban spokesperson.
“Afghanistan is a neighbourly, Islamic country. We have historical connections, cultural connections. Pakistan has hosted Afghan refugees for four decades. We only say one thing to the Afghan government: do not allow your soil to be used for terrorism against Pakistan,” he added.
He pointed out that trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan was also continuing, and many Afghans came to Pakistan for medical reasons. “So we only have an extremely fair demand: don’t let your soil be used by non-state actors and terrorist groups.”
“Is it wrong to ask? It is absolutely fair, it is correct, it is rational, it is our right. And for this, we also engage them at multiple levels,” he said, highlighting several bilateral and multilateral engagements.
“Yes, we do engage them and we clearly communicate [to them] … that these are the [terrorist] leaders, their facilitators and their centres [in Afghanistan]. Yes, we engage [with Afghanistan], but at the same time, we are doing and will continue to do whatever is necessary to protect the lives of Pakistan’s people and its territorial integrity,” the DG ISPR continued.
When pressed by another reporter for more clarity on alleged strikes in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said, “I have made it clear that Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this. And I have also said that all the necessary steps for protecting the people’s lives and property are being taken and will continue to be taken.”
Saudi defence deal and international engagement to curb Afghan terrorism
Questioned about the Saudi defence deal and whether the kingdom could be engaged in the talks with Afghanistan to resolve the issue of cross-border militancy, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan continued to engage the country and its other allies even before the pact.
“We engage the Afghans directly at multiple levels and also through allied countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, China, US, Turkiye and many more. They all understand that the space being given to non-state actors in Afghanistan is not just against Pakistan.”
He said ‘‘every alphabet’’ of non-state actors was found in Afghanistan, pointing to various groups such as the TTP, IS-K, BLA and more.
DG Chaudhry said these terrorists had no affiliation or religious or cultural identity and were available to the highest bidder.
’’If you allow these elements space in your country then every kind of terrorist organisation will be found. That is why we are engaging them because all of them are concerned because this threat from non-state actors is not only a danger to Pakistan or to the region but it is becoming a threat to the whole world.“
He said the Afghan authorities had to decide whether they would allow Afghanistan to become a sanctuary for terrorists or not, adding that history showed that nurturing such groups often led to them turning on their benefactors.
DG Chaudhry said such groups were a threat to Afghanistan and its people as well. He said Pakistan’s job was to engage the Afghan authorities and take necessary action to defend and protect the lives of its people.
On a question about an international coalition to strike terrorist havens in Afghanistan, he said while such consultations and engagement continued, “we know that your security cannot be granted by external players, while we keep on engaging them, the responsibility to protect your life and property and people is of Pakistan’s state and institutions and military and that is where our first and foremost focus is.’’
The DG ISPR also remarked on whether the presence of non-state actors was a product of the transition of the Afghan Taliban from a non-state actor to a state entity, or due to the interference of foreign actors such as India.
“Perhaps it is the clout and influence of these non-state actors in Afghanistan that has grown beyond control,” he said. “Perhaps it is the factions within Afghan government who cannot agree on how to resolve this problem. But that is for them to decide.”
Past engagement with TTP and change in KP leadership
Questioned about past engagement with the TTP and the change in the KP leadership that saw Ali Amin Gandapur stepping down as chief minister, the DG ISPR said: “Who is saying today that there should be talks and not operations against them (terrorists). Where is this voice coming from? Who is saying this? Who is that person who is carrying out this whole campaign of talk to them and stop operations.
‘‘Who is [the one] saying that he cannot accept his provincial government that does not stand against operations. It is for everyone to see that today, or five years back or six or seven or eight or in any timeframe, who is that person and political thought that says there should be talks with terrorists.’’
DG Chaudhry said the person saying so was responsible for the state in the past but now he was not and yet he still persisted with his stance.
“It is absolutely clear that this stance and confusing the people through it that the solution to this problem is not in counterterrorism or operations but in talking to the people who slaughtered your children … is for everyone to see.’’
He said the army, police and children were paying the price for the above ‘‘perverted and criminal thinking’’.
DG Chaundry said talks were indeed engaged in but questioned what was the result of it all, pointing to the Afghan Taliban’s promises in the Doha peace talks and their failure to abide by them.
 
 

Questioned about the change in KP leadership and how it might be signalling a reorientation in relations with the establishment, the DG ISPR said the establishment was itself a part of the state.
“Do you mean to say that such a leadership is being brought that is anti-state? This cannot happen. The state of Pakistan is very strong and I’ve already said, our war against terrorism and counterterrorism activities will continue without all these political distractions. This war is going on at every time and moment.’’
Faiz Hameed court martial proceedings
Questioned about the court martial proceedings against former spymaster retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, DG Chaudhry said: ‘‘That legal process is ongoing and will come to its logical and just conclusion.’’
To another question about an alleged delay in the court martial proceedings, DG Chaudhry said the matter concerned a former intelligence chief and hence the “gravity” of the matter was high. ’’The state and the institution has to be absolutely and deliberately correct in that. All the requirements of procedure, process and justice have to be met because you would not like to try such an important and critical case in hurry and haste,“ he added.
“The Pakistan Army’s system of internal accountability does not work off allegations but facts and evidence. There is a process to it and anybody who is charged is given complete rights to defend himself and that time will be given and is being given so we are not worried about any delay because we have to fulfil all the requirements of justice and process.’’
He said another reason for the court martial proceedings was that ‘‘when you turn a relation into a political and personal relation then you will have to answer for that. But who did it? The one who was [heading] the state at the time and doing politics and that is why we always say that don’t involve us in your politics.’’
The DG ISPR said all political parties and politicians were respectable for the army but it was unacceptable if anyone considered their politics to be above the state.
“If a single person thinks their being is greater than Pakistan then that is unacceptable.’’
He said the military was the ‘‘ultimate instrument of violence’’ of the state and politicising it would lead to ‘‘horrible results’’, pointing to India and the seeping of Hindutva influence in its armed forces.
Issue of US weapons left behind in Afghanistan
In response to a question about US weapons in the hands of terrorists, the DG ISPR said that Pakistan was engaged with Washington on the matter.
“This equipment is not only being used in Pakistan by Fitna al-Khawarij or Fitna al-Hindustan but the equipment left with non-state actors can be used anywhere,” he explained. “We do share data and engage with them (the US) and they understand how the equipment is used by non-state actors.”
Collateral damage during operations
In response to a question about collateral damage during operations and criticism by affected locals, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that operations were intelligence-based and “very precise”.
“We cannot believe statements about collateral damage because we are the army of Pakistan and KP,” he replied. “If terrorists have taken a family hostage and are firing at innocent people and we respond, does that make it collateral damage or facilitation?”
The DG ISPR noted that facilitators, whether they were doing it out of desperation or for financial gain, had three choices: “Turn terrorists over to the law. If that is not possible, then join the state and work to eradicate the threat,” the military spokesperson said. “If a terrorist violates the sanctity of someone’s home by entering it, and you do not force him out, that makes you a facilitator. Where is the collateral damage? there’s no collateral damage. There’s a terrorist and a facilitator.”

A Dawn.com correspondent in Lahore reported on Friday evening that the protesters were trying to remove obstacles at the city’s Chauburji Chowk and march ahead.
A statement by Edhi spokesperson Younis Bhatti said several policemen had been injured in clashes with TLP protesters. The statement added that Edhi volunteers moved the injured personnel to various hospitals in the city.
Meanwhile, TLP spokesperson Usman Naushahi told Dawn.com that one of the protesters had died and 22 were injured.
Ahead of the march, without naming the TLP, the US embassy in Islamabad posted on social media platform X that “the US consulates general in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar are monitoring planned protest activity across Pakistan on October 10”.
“These protests may cause traffic delays/detours due to closed or blocked roads in the vicinity of the demonstrations. The duration of the protests is unknown. We advise US citizens to avoid large gatherings and remain aware of their surroundings,” the embassy said in the post.
 






Internet services suspended in twin cities
Before the march began, roads in Islamabad were blocked and mobile internet services suspended. In anticipation of the protest, the Islamabad administration had also started placing shipping containers at Faizabad Interchange — the historic site of several TLP sit-ins.
It emerged earlier today that the Ministry of Interior had directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to suspend 3G and 4G services in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
A directive dated October 9 and addressed to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) chairman stated the ministry had “accorded approval to suspend 3G/4G services in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, starting from 12am tonight till further orders.”
The missive, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, directed the PTA to take “further necessary action” in this regard in coordination with the Islamabad commissioner and police chief, and the Rawalpindi regional police officer.
The ministry did not provide a reason for suspending services, but the development does come amid verious other measures being taken by the authorities ahead of the TLP protest.
Traffic plan
Islamabad traffic police also issued a diversion plan, referring to the “law and order” situation in the Faizabad area.
The plan, posted on Islamabad police’s X account, said the entry of all heavy vehicles in the federal capital would not be allowed until further orders and detailed the diversion routes for smaller vehicles around the Faizabad area.
 






A Dawn report, citing sources, earlier said around 500 containers would be used to seal the Red Zone in Islamabad, covering Attaturk Avenue, Third Avenue, Margalla Road, and Khayaban-i-Suharwardy as well as the capital’s entry and exit points.
These containers were being placed at key locations, including Serena Chowk, Express Chowk, Nadra Chowk, Agha Khan Road near Marriott Hotel, Margalla Road near Trail 3 and Luqman Hakeem Road. Other blockades were being set up at Faisal Avenue’s Zero Point and Faisal Chowk, the report said.
It added that entry points into the capital from Rawat T-Cross, Chungi No 26 and Faizabad will also be sealed with containers. The metro bus and electric bus services on 21 different routes were suspended on Thursday evening and these would remain suspended today as well.
Some educational institutions also announced closures in view of the rally and the state’s preparations to counter it.
There are also reports of roads being blocked in Jhelum and Jhelum.
Security measures and arrests
Separately, according to a Dawn report, the capital police had started detaining local TLP leaders, activists and workers, taking into custody at least 280 people on Thursday.
The report said about 7,000 security personnel, including 5,500 policemen, 1,000 Frontier Constabulary and 500 Rangers, would be deployed across the capital to intercept the TLP gathering and maintain law and order. Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) and vehicles equipped with anti-riot gear, including tear gas shells and rubber bullets, would also be deployed at various locations.
To avoid any law and order situation in Rawalpindi, the city police and administration have imposed Section 144 till October 11 and sealed major entry and exit routes with more than 300 containers.
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
As part of the security plan, more than 6,500 police personnel, including 1,150 traffic police, contingents of Punjab Constabulary, and the newly formed Riot Management Police (RMP), have been deployed in Rawalpindi. Personnel from other districts have also been called in to assist the local force.
On Thursday, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that the government always allowed peaceful marchers and demonstration, however, the TLP had not sought permission for its protest in the capital.
Section 144 imposed in Punjab
Late on Thursday, violence had also broken out in Punjab, after police launched a crackdown on the headquarters of TLP in a bid to arrest its chief, Saad Rizvi. The clashes left several people injured, including around a dozen policemen.
An October 8 order by the Punjab Home Department, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, says that Section 144 has been imposed in the province for 10 days.
The order states that the Punjab government has received credible reports from law enforcement and intelligence agencies indicating a “serious and imminent threat to public peace, tranquility, and the safety of life and property across the province”.
“Multiple credible threat alerts, regarding possible terrorist activities planned by hostile groups, including RAW, TTP, BLA, Daesh etc., aimed at targeting minorities or Muslim scholars to trigger sectarian unrest have been received. Assemblies, rallies, gathering, sit-ins, processions, demonstrations, jalsa, etc., could present a convenient target for such terrorist attacks and the possibility of an untoward incident cannot be ruled out.
“[…] There is a strong apprehension that certain political, sectarian or anti-social elements may engage in activities, assemblies, gatherings or demonstrations that are likely to cause a breach of public peace, disturb the public order and create a security risk for the general public and critical infrastructure,” the order read.
Apart from a ban on assembly of four or more persons, the order also places a restriction on carrying, brandishing and displaying arms in public spaces, a ban on “misuse of loudspeakers, public address systems and audio amplifying devices for provocative, sectarian or inflammatory content”, and a ban on publishing, disseminating of displaying provocative, hateful or sectarian material.
A notification by the University of Punjab, also available with Dawn.com, said that the varsity would remain closed today, as per the instructions of the government.
Meanwhile, a statement by the Punjab Public Service Commission’s media and production deputy director said exams for the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority Sub-Divisional Officer’s post, scheduled for Oct 11 and 12, had been postponed following the imposition of Section 144. The statement, however, did not specify a new date for the exams.

The following are some facts about the democracy campaigner:
Upper-class background
Maria Corina Machado, 58, was born in Caracas, Venezuela, on October 7, 1967. She is an industrial engineer by training, and her father was a prominent businessman in Venezuela’s steel industry. Her upper-class roots have made her a target of criticism from Venezuela’s governing socialist party.
In hiding
Machado won a resounding victory in the opposition’s primary election in 2023, and her rallies attracted large crowds, but a ban from holding public office prevented her from running for president against Nicolas Maduro in an election in 2024, and she went into hiding.
The country’s electoral authority and top court say Maduro, whose time in office has been marked by a deep economic and social crisis, won the election, though they have never published detailed tallies.
Machado emerged from hiding to make a brief appearance during a protest before Maduro’s inauguration in January. She was briefly arrested and then freed.
Advocate of liberal economic reforms
Machado advocates for liberal economic reforms, including the privatisation of state-owned enterprises such as PDVSA, Venezuela’s oil company. She also supports the creation of welfare programs aimed at aiding the country’s poorest citizens.
Political activism
Her political activism has come at a cost, leaving her isolated as nearly all of her senior advisers have been detained or forced to leave the country. Machado herself has accused Maduro’s administration of operating as a “criminal mafia.”
Collective struggle
Though sometimes criticised for being egotistical, even by her own mother, Machado rarely speaks about herself in public. Instead, she frames her campaign as a collective struggle for redemption and unity, aiming to inspire hope among Venezuelans weary of economic hardship and social decay.</p><small>2025-10-10 10:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081142489d89812.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931259/the-karachi-zoo-is-proof-that-man-is-the-cruelest-animal' target='_blank'><strong>The Karachi zoo is proof that man is the cruelest animal</strong></a><br><p>I had never set foot in a zoo before; I now wish I hadn’t.
As a mom of two feline monarchs who rule my home and a self-appointed custodian of strays that stumble into my orbit, my lessons in love have come padded in fur and whiskers. Cats, after all, love without surrendering their sovereignty. They teach you that affection can be fierce yet uncompromising of selfhood. That dignity breathes in freedom. And if dignity breathes in freedom, naturally, captivity is its slow suffocation. Few places advertise that suffocation as boldly as cages built in the name of leisure and ‘education’.
So when my editor assigned me a story on the Karachi Zoo, I knew it wouldn’t be one of those breezy reporting days, neatly filed away before lunch. This one would sit heavy.
But journalism, inconveniently faithful to reality, does not make exceptions for personal aversions. Zoos exist whether I approve or not, and my job was to bear witness. So, I went (a naïve corner of my heart clung to the hope of encountering some grace).
I didn’t.
Don’t get me wrong, the zoo surprisingly brimmed with life, just not the kind its caged inhabitants could claim. It was a life monopolised by the visitors. There were no roars, screeches, growls, or chirps — the very sounds I had imagined would dominate a place primarily built for animals. There was only the droning hum of speakers pumping out Bollywood classics from the 90s that I could have happily grooved to anywhere else. Children shrieked with delight as they bounced on trampolines and kicked footballs; families engrossed in mere mirth and laughter as they spread chadors across the sun-kissed grass for their little picnic.
 


And then came the long queue of people waiting for the boat ride — a waterbody so vast that I couldn’t help but wonder if the space, in some alternate reality, might have been used to expand the cages. The distractions only multiplied. A zip line whirred overhead, offering a burst of adrenaline. Around the corner, a 3D cinema, a bowling alley for children, a replica London bus shuttling families through concrete enclosures, cafés lined up along the sidewalks.
My personal favourite was The Forest cafe. The space opens into a semi-outdoor seating area under a lattice of tangled vines and dangling bulbs. The white plastic chairs and simple tables contrast with the deliberate attempt at an earthy aesthetic. The rustic wiring strung between branches, and soft yellow orbs of light seemed to mimic fireflies. Not even a fraction of this detail could be spared describing the animals’ barren enclosures.
 


It was, in essence, a festival of human joy, set against the backdrop of suffering animals who had never tasted freedom in such, or indeed, any capacity.
Survival of the ‘un’fittest
I saw the king of the jungle first — albeit dethroned.
A lion stretched in stillness, eyes half-lidded, radiating a kind of existential fatigue perhaps only captivity can breed. Whatever vitality once thundered through his veins seemed to have been sucked out of him. His “kingdom” measured roughly 20x20 foot, half claimed by a stagnant green puddle and a lone, leafless branch.
 


A ring of eager faces pressed to the bars outside his enclosure, waiting for something, anything, to happen. But the king, long resigned from the business of performance, offered nothing. No matter how many whistles pierced or hands clapped, he did not so much as flinch.
I was making observations, notebook in hand, when a small voice piped up beside me.
 


“Mama, look! A white lion!”
Curious, I glanced over. A little boy was tugging at his mother’s arm, eyes wide with excitement.
She leaned forward, squinting through the iron bars.
“White?” she murmured, puzzled. “He looks brown to me.”
“The sign says it’s a white lion,” the boy insisted.
They were both right: the lion was technically white, but appeared brown; its fur caked with filth and devoid of any sign of basic grooming.
 


Next to his cage, in a stroke of remarkable satire, stood Café de Lion. While the king wasted away in his shrunken dominion, his name had been franchised into local food. There, people laughed over bun kababs and chaat, basking in the spray of a makeshift waterfall — oblivious, or perhaps uncaring, of an apex predator dying a slow, psychological death a few steps away.
At a little distance, monkeys sat listlessly in their rusting cages. One licked chipped paint flaking off the metal bars, while another ran in endless circles, a raw wound glaring across his back. There was no bandage to cover it, and no staff in sight to notice.
 


Their cage appeared barren. No ropes, branches, objects, or varied textures to mimic a natural habitat; only a corroded and abandoned ladder leading nowhere. The floor was a flat stretch of tiles, offering no soil, sand, or grass. Monkeys are considered arboreal by nature and in the wild, their lives unfold to rustling foliage, shifting light, and changing smells and sounds. Here, that world was stripped to sameness; they had nothing to swing from, nothing to stir instinct.
Rano, the Himalayan brown bear, was perhaps the most heartbreaking, exhibiting classic signs of captivity-induced psychosis. Her natural habitat lies in the cold alpine meadows of Deosai National Park and other mountainous regions of northern Pakistan — a world away from the suffocating confines of her enclosure.
All she did was pace with mechanical precision. Left to right. Right to left. Over and over. A life whittled down to a loop. You didn’t need the credentials of an animal behaviourist to sense there was something wrong with her; you only needed to pay attention.
 


As I stood watching her, one thought kept returning: If Karachi’s brutal heat can melt its people, what must it do to a bear bred for the cold north? There was no snow to hibernate under, no forest to disappear into; only a single dead tree trunk which seemed to mock the wilderness she was destined for but will likely never know.
Earlier this week, it emerged that Rano is being treated for a festering head injury, likely inflicted when she repeatedly rammed into the metal bars of her cage. The wound, now infested with maggots, is a testament to the neglect she has endured for years.
Adjacent to the chaos of the mammals, a ticketed enclave housed the reptiles. Inside, lizards, crocodiles, and snakes lay almost perfectly still within their cramped confines. I tried to take a closer look at their condition, but the view was obscured by fractured glass filmed with dust.
 


International codes of practice and guidelines from animal welfare organisations demand reptile enclosures to replicate natural habitats with heat lamps, textured surfaces, vegetation, and varied water features to stimulate movement and thermoregulation. Here, such enrichment (at this point, unsurprisingly) was conspicuously absent.
The chimpanzee, tigers, antelopes, deer, peacocks, and turtles fared no better.
 


An elderly chimpanzee lay seemingly depressed inside a dinghy room littered with juice boxes, gutka wrappers and plastic bags. A lone rooster walked in circles on a cement floor, unable to feel soft earth beneath its feet. Tucked away in one corner, jackals ran back and forth in what seemed like confusion. Animals built to thrive in open plains, dense forests, and flowing waters withering away in barren pens or circling stagnant ponds with their instincts suffocated at the source.
 


A prison… or worse
A “zoo”, they say. But experts and activists peel back the curtain and call it what it is: a prison.
Zohare Ali Shariff, a veteran in wildlife management and former theme park operator in Rawalpindi, builds on this sentiment with unapologetic clarity. “Don’t call it a sanctuary,” he said before I even hit the record button. “A sanctuary is a place where animals or people are looked after, where they de-stress from the outside world. You can’t tease them. This is just the opposite. These are prisons, essentially.”
But this isn’t new. Zoos, after all, began as menageries — pits of spectacle where animals were paraded as curiosities, dying in droves during capture or transit. As far back as 2500 BCE, Egyptian and Mesopotamian rulers collected giraffes, elephants, bears, dolphins, and exotic birds as living trophies of power.
The history of captivity, Shariff explained, is older than our moral compass, stretching back to the very origins of human civilisation. “Human beings were hunter-gatherers until about 10,000 years ago. It was only with the advent of agriculture that they began domesticating animals such as cattle, horses, and sheep. What started as a relationship of coexistence and mutual benefit, gradually evolved into a sense of fascination. Over time, that fascination hardened into ownership, sowing the first seeds of captivity — the roots of which continue to entangle us.”
That fascination-turned-desire-for-ownership found its most brutal stage in the Roman Empire. Beast hunts were an integral part of public entertainment, not just to thrill audiences with exotic spectacles, but as a theatrical show of Rome’s ability to conquer nature.
Lions, leopards, elephants, and bears were yanked from Africa and Asia, shipped across seas, and paraded into arenas. While ancient art and literature tell us much about the blood-soaked performances, the logistics (the mass capture, trade, and transport of animals on such a scale) remain only partly understood. What is clear is that countless animals died before ever making it to the amphitheatre and nobody was bothered.
It took nearly two millennia and a creeping public conscience for the model to change. In Europe, private menageries evolved into public zoos (still steel-barred and concrete-floored). Then, barely a century ago, a different concept took root: “simulated natural habitat.” Shariff credited Karl Hagenbeck, a man who began as an animal trader and ended up an advocate, for pioneering spaces that at least tried to look and feel like home for the captives.
Tragically, what began as a promise of freedom amounted to little more than a cosmetic change. While the language has shifted from “menageries” to “zoos,” the substance remains much the same.
Shariff argued that animals in captivity are often kept in conditions that are more akin to penal institutions than habitats. Many develop zoochosis, a psychological disorder where wild animals spiral into compulsive, repetitive behaviours alien to their natural state (case in point: Rano). The restless back-and-forth pacing, eerily reminiscent of inmates trudging cell corridors, reflects long stretches of monotony, boredom, and stress.
Mahera Omar, animal activist and co-founder of the Pakistan Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), drives the point further. She stressed that creatures that roam thousands of square kilometres in the wild are reduced to a fraction of that space in captivity, stripped of the chance to fulfil even their most basic behavioural needs. “It is, in effect, a psychological prison — one that denies animals both liberty and their natural way of living,” she said.
And yet, to call it a prison almost flatters it. In Karachi, human prisons are learning the language of rules: a new app now ensures every visit to Central Jail is logged, scheduled, and bound by a 20-minute window, with visitors submitting IDs and photographs before stepping inside. Captivity there, however grim, is at least codified and monitored.
Contrast this to Karachi Zoo, where animals languish without such protections. They don’t have visitation protocols, oversight of their mental well-being, or binding rules about space or enrichment. The irony is hard to stomach: a prisoner serving time for an actual crime has a regulated framework safeguarding their access to family and food, while animals, guilty of simply existing, are confined for life without rights or recourse.
The absence of and the need for enrichment
In Karachi Zoo, Rano and her companion (an Asiatic black bear) lived in the infamous pit — an archaic relic from Europe’s 300-year-old blueprint for cruelty — until the latter died in 2020, after only three years in captivity.
 


“It was when a bunch of concerned citizens and animals’ rights advocates filed a petition to the Sindh High Court that Rano bear was moved into a cage 15 times bigger,” Shariff said. However, he asserted that space without enrichment is a hollow victory. “On busy days, animals need to hide. Make a den for Rano. Plant trees for her to climb. Give her water to play in and varied terrain to roam. All she has is one miserable log. It doesn’t cut it.”
He breaks down the idea of reform into two essential dimensions: environmental enrichment (the right terrain, trees, water) and behavioural enrichment (keeping instincts sharp).
With the eye of both scientist and caretaker, Shariff described, in loving detail, how to design a tiger enclosure: grassy earth, undulating terrain, trees to scent-mark, and a pond for their water-loving tendencies. “A full-grown male tiger is capable of leaping 18 to 20 feet in a single bound. To account for this, the perimeter fence must reach at least 24 feet, topped with an inward-facing overhang so that even if the animal climbs, it cannot scale the barrier. The extra four inches serve as a critical safety buffer,” he noted, explaining the science of their confinement.
As far as behavioural enrichment is concerned, Shariff in his Rawalpindi park, spiced up the mornings for tigers with chicken blood trails leading to hidden “prizes,” giving captive-born predators a taste of the hunt. It made tigers stalk, ears twitching, eyes alert. They were made to forage for scattered food to mimic their 17-hour daily wanderings in the wild. “You have to do these gimmicks,” he said, almost with mischief, “because otherwise they’ve covered every inch in days.”
But the enrichment must be backed by care and that’s not exactly a department where Karachi Zoo has earned bragging rights. This is work that requires love, vigilance, and dedication — scrutinising faeces for early signs of illness, reworking the layouts overnight to keep animals stimulated, tailoring diets to species and seasons.
Instead, Shariff recalled reaching out to the management, only to discover they didn’t even maintain a basic record of their animals. No documentation of ages, sexes, or medical histories. If the paperwork was this neglected, it was hardly surprising that medical care fell through the cracks too. In many cases, he claimed, veterinary intervention arrives only when an animal is on its deathbed followed by an obituary blaming ‘old age’ as the cause of death.
For Jude Allen, an animal rights activist, enriching the lives of captive animals is about recreating a slice of their natural habitat. “Take lions, for example — they’re essentially giant cats. They play just like kittens do,” he explained.
He stressed that the solution doesn’t have to be complicated. A large ball, a stretch of greenery, space to run — these are small interventions that can spark enormous joy. “You’ll see them acting like complete goofballs because they’re so playful. That’s all they want. They want room to run. They need greenery. They need an environment that feels natural,” he said.
Captivity, he noted, is a compromise but one that can still allow for meaningful social bonds. “Even if they are in a zoo, they need a caretaker who bonds with them, because at the end of the day, that’s the only social interaction they’ll get. All animals are social. If you have a lion alone in a cage, he is going to need someone to bond with.”
Yet, he acknowledged that what may seem like simple measures are, in reality, distant milestones for those managing Karachi Zoo. During repeated visits, Allen has urged the administration to switch off a radio blaring near the lions’ enclosure. “It’s not just contributing to noise pollution, it’s actively distressing the animals. How can we talk about enrichment when the administration isn’t even trying to improve their day-to-day living conditions?” he asked, emphasising the basics.
However, for Daniyal Alishan, director media and spokesperson for the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), the music and announcements are no more than background noise. “There are songs that play but it’s not throughout the day,” he countered. “Sometimes we also get stuck in traffic and there’s noise of horns, rickshaw engines revving, vendors calling out, even the wail of an ambulance. It’s very normal.”
Normal, perhaps, for a commuter jostling through Karachi’s rush hour at Sharea Faisal. But for a lion, whose entire existence is reduced to concrete walls and enforced idleness, the comparison collapses.
Where’s the money going?
“Exploitation,” Allen remarked, “That’s the word you’re looking for.”
He explained that the Karachi Zoo receives an annual budget from the KMC that covers all operational expenses from staff salaries and administrative costs to utilities, and maintenance. “The problem isn’t the absence of funds, it’s that they’re not being utilised,” he noted.
According to him, much of the rot stems from ghost employees — staff members who exist only on paper — while those actually working are underpaid and overworked. “You’ll find caretakers responsible for dozens of animals without proper equipment or veterinary support. When I talk about exploitation, I’m talking about a chain — one that begins with the animals and extends all the way to the lowest-paid worker.“
Beyond the official budget, Allen said, the zoo generates additional, unaccounted revenue through various commercial activities such as shop and restaurant rents, as well as ticket sales for rides. “That’s still not the big picture,” he continued. “During Eid holidays, the footfall can reach around 200,000 visitors per day, and that’s on the conservative side.” He broke down the math: “If you multiply that by the Rs50 entry fee, that’s around one crore rupees a day. Over four days of Eidul Fitr and four days of Eidul Azha, that’s eight crore rupees — none of which is officially accounted for.”
 


He claimed that this money, along with income from other public holidays, is “internally distributed among the higher-ups” rather than being spent on animal welfare. “You look at the enclosures, the conditions, the lack of medical facilities and then you hear these numbers. There’s enough money to make the zoo a sanctuary. It’s infuriating,” he said.
When confronted with allegations of mismanagement, ghost employees, and unaccounted-for revenue at Karachi Zoo, Alishan, spokesperson for the KMC, was quick to push back.
“We have a technical team of doctors; a staff of 11 people who take care of the animals, feed them and bathe them,” Alishan insisted. “Recently, people exaggerated Rano’s self-inflicted injury and blew it out of proportion. If she has been here for a decade and survived it happily and healthily, then concerns about enrichment don’t hold valid.” Survival, per his judgement, is proof of contentment. The implication is that enrichment, the internationally accepted benchmark for captive animal welfare, is irrelevant if the animal is breathing ten years on.
When pressed on how he defines happiness and health, Alishan reduced it to a narrow metric: “As long as an animal can walk, eat, weighs what it should and looks physically fine, it is healthy. The expressions that come across as happy or sad fall into the emotional category, not medical.”
Rano, long regarded as the zoo’s poster case for abysmal conditions, has been the subject of campaigns by activists and citizens. But Alishan dismissed suggestions of veterinary neglect. “She has a wound because she keeps pushing herself against the bars. I wouldn’t even call it an injury, it’s just swelling. It should heal in two to three days. Think of it like when you or I hit our heads accidentally. It happens,” he noted, adding that he’s a pharmacist by training. But what other specialists might call a symptom of stress and deprivation in captivity, he recast as nothing more than a mishap.
He also rebuffed the idea that Karachi Zoo is exceptionally inhumane in any way. “If you go to zoos in Bangkok or Singapore, the bears there also hit themselves. It’s not unusual, and it’s not a sign of mistreatment.“ As for the charges that animals appear despondent, he claimed that it’s usually the visitors who unsettle them by whistling, tossing wrappers, and teasing.
On the issue of funding, Alishan dismissed allegations that money meant for the zoo is siphoned away by higher authorities. He explained that the Sindh government does not allocate funds directly to the zoo; instead, they are channeled to the KMC through the Octroi Zilla Tax (OZT). KMC also retains all revenue generated from the zoo’s commercial activities, disbursing funds back to it based on its operational expenses and the needs of the animals under its care.
 


“Our revenue is calculated on a fiscal basis from July 1 to June 30. This year, for the first quarter, the zoo generated about Rs10–15 million, which was received by the KMC. Of this, around 15 per cent was earmarked for the zoo,“ he clarified.
According to him, criticism of Karachi Zoo suffers from a lack of perspective and an unwillingness to acknowledge what he deemed hard-won progress. “Compare the state of the zoo a decade ago to what it is today. The difference is immense; we’ve completely transformed it,” he emphasised, lamenting that no one gives the administration credit for it. Alishan also pointed out that many educated voices and even celebrities “make a mountain out of a molehill”, framing the zoo’s condition as if the animals are being tortured; an assessment he considers unnecessary and unfair.
The spokesperson also hinted at expansion of the zoo rather than downsizing. “A whole lot of animals and birds are about to be added to Karachi Zoo by the end of this year,” he remarked with pride.
Plausible alternatives on the table
For Allen, the founder of the “I Am NoorJehan” movement, a civil society organisation advocating for animal welfare, the challenges facing Karachi Zoo are not merely about upkeep; they are questions of ethics, expertise, and long-term vision. “We need people with a high level of commitment,” he said. “Most of the animals in the zoo have been born in captivity. We can’t simply release them back into the wild. That’s another dilemma we face.”
“You can’t simply shut down the zoo,” Shariff concurred. The reason is deceptively simple: animals born in captivity cannot survive in the wild.
“If I put a captive tiger in a jungle, he wouldn’t know how to hunt. He’s never stalked prey, never ambushed, never learned how to open a carcass. Even if, by some miracle, he manages to kill a deer, he wouldn’t know what to do next. There’s a tediously long process behind reintroducing captive animals into the jungle. With many, it’s simply not possible,” he explained, arguing that the alternative is not closure, but a drastic reinvention.
Creating awareness, Shariff insisted, must sit at the heart of any reimagined zoo. This means going beyond the perfunctory signboards that simply label an enclosure with the word “lion” or “sher”. Visitors should be told what these animals eat, how they behave in the wild, their role in ecological balance, and the threats they face from human activity.
He proposed interactive experiences: trained volunteers — preferably passionate young people — engaging with families, answering questions, and even narrating anecdotes about the animals’ personalities. Giving animals names, highlighting their quirks, and telling stories about their habits, he believes, can humanise them in the eyes of visitors. It replaces the perception of ‘dangerous beasts’ with an understanding of them as sentient beings with distinct lives, deserving of respect.
 


For Karachi Zoo, he sees only two viable paths: “ban the import of new animals, care for the existing ones until their natural deaths, and then shut it down. Or, privatise it.“ In his view, private management, with accountability and incentives to perform, would ensure a relatively higher standard of care than the bureaucratic neglect the zoo suffers today.
For Shariff, the debate must shift from patchwork fixes to a fundamental rethink of what role zoos should play in the 21st century. “If we are serious about animal welfare, we must retire the outdated, colonial-era model of zoos. Instead, we need large-scale, professionally managed sanctuaries where animals can truly heal.”
But even as he outlined reforms, he cautioned that the conversation cannot be reduced to larger cages or superficial upgrades. “No matter how enriched the environment appears — be it large enclosures, simulated habitats, or artificial terrain — the fundamental issue remains: captivity is inherently restrictive.”
The deeper cultural malaise and the myth of education
In recent years, Pakistan has witnessed a disturbing surge in the private ownership of wild animals. Lions and tigers are paraded as emblems of power by social media influencers, industrialists, and the urban elite alike.
In July, one such pet lion escaped and mauled a woman and her children in Lahore, prompting authorities to confiscate 18 lions kept illegally as pets and raid dozens of breeding farms. Similar instances have unfolded in Karachi and Islamabad over the years: a lion casually strolling near Sharea Faisal; a leopard darting across walls, injuring residents; even a giraffe peering over a boundary wall in a residential area. For a price of around Rs1.4 million, one can have a white lion delivered to their doorstep within 48 hours — a grotesque convenience that underscores the absence of adequate ethical or regulatory restraint.
“Many private collectors and breeding farms keep animals solely for profit — sometimes raising lions or tigers to be sold or displayed as status symbols,” explained Shariff, adding that this commodification reflects a deeper moral failure. He explained that such facilities operate under the guise of conservation but function more as profit-making ventures.
In a society where possession is mistaken for prestige, we often hear a recurring defence: “zoos exist to educate the child in Lyari” — the one who might never see a lion in his lifetime otherwise. But what lesson does this child truly absorb when his first encounter with a wild creature comes framed by iron bars, with spectators tossing bottle caps to provoke a reaction out of it? That freedom is conditional? That captivity is natural? That violence is entertaining?
What’s telling is that this logic transcends class and literacy.
The very people who preach the virtues of “education” are often the same who, in an offensive display of extravangant wealth, keep lions in their basements and tigers at their weddings.
Empathy, a core building block that shapes one’s response to suffering, thus, doesn’t necessarily stem from schooling (or its lack thereof); it’s born out of a culture that recognises kinship between species. You can collect degrees and titles, but they’ll do little good when your moral compass is calibrated to established hierarchies.
Conventional education in Pakistan hasn’t been able to instill empathy towards animals; it has merely refined the language with which cruelty is excused. That, perhaps, is the deeper malaise. Whether in elite drawing rooms flaunting lion cubs or in public zoos where sentient beings decay in cells, our (mis)treatment of animals mirrors a lopsided social structure — one that exalts human dominance while reducing all other life to spectacle, possession, or profit.
 


An illusion of superiority
It is in this climate of warped hierarchy that the passing of Jane Goodall carries profound meaning. Last week on October 1, the world bid farewell to a remarkable woman who spent her life dismantling humanity’s illusion of superiority. In a poetic tribute scripted by fate itself, her death came in the same week we marked World Animal Day.
Goodall devoted her life to showing humanity its reflection through the eyes of chimpanzees. She once said, “Only when our clever brain and our human heart work together in harmony can we achieve our true potential.” It’s a reminder that our greatest tragedy lies in a mind racing ahead to invent and consume, while conscience limps behind.
Her immersion in chimpanzee society as a neighbour made her privy to bonds of compassion, reciprocity, and grief — qualities we often arrogantly compartmentalise as unique to humans. Her work challenged that assumption, showing that while animals may be bound by instinct, human beings, armed with reason, carry a parallel burden: the capacity for deliberate cruelty. To accept the imprisonment of any being, particularly one that lacks the voice to defend itself, is to expose reason’s darker edge — when divorced from compassion, it becomes an instrument of subjugation.
And then, nature humbles us with with truths we could never imagine on our own. In 2005, three lions in Ethiopia intervened in the abduction of a 12-year-old girl who had been held for a week by men attempting to force her into marriage. The lions reportedly stood guard over her for about half a day until her family and the authorities arrived, after which they returned to the bush.
Such stories lend flesh to the work of Marc Bekoff, one of the foremost researchers on animal emotions. In his study, titled Animal Emotions: Exploring Passionate Natures, he argues that animals experience a wide spectrum of emotions such as joy, fear, grief, love and embarrassment. His argument is not based on sentimental projection but on observable patterns of behaviour and biological mechanisms that underpin them.
If Bekoff’s work gives science its voice, then countless encounters in the wild give it a soul. From elephants who linger over their dead to crows that hold funerals, the natural world overflows with gestures that reflect our own tenderness and grief. These are not coincidences of instinct, but expressions of feeling; proof that human beings do not have monopoly over emotions.
Until rationale learns to walk hand in hand with empathy, the dream of a world founded on gentle coexistence (the truest measure of civilisation) will remain out of reach. And until we learn to see the beating hearts beneath fur, feather, and scale as kin rather than conquest, we remain the lesser species; clever, yes, but not yet wise. For real wisdom would humble us into realising that this is their world, and we are only living in it.</p><small>2025-10-10 10:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/101410187183149.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947881/venezuela-opposition-leader-maria-corina-machado-wins-nobel-peace-prize' target='_blank'><strong>Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado wins Nobel Peace Prize</strong></a><br><p>Venezuela opposition leader Maria Corina Machado received the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday.
The committee chose to focus on Venezuela at this time, in a year dominated by US President Donald Trump’s repeated public statements that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.
Machado was on this year’s TIME Magazine “100 most influential People” list, where current US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said she was the “personification of resilience, tenacity, and patriotism”.
“She is receiving the prize for her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy,” said Jorgen Watne Frydnes, the chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo.
“As the leader of the democratic forces in the Venezuela, she is one of the most extraordinary examples of civilian courage in Latin America in recent times,” he said.
 






He said that Machado had been a “key unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided; an opposition that found common ground in the demand for free election and representative government”.
“This is precisely what lies at the heart of democracy: our shared willingness to defend the principles of popular rule even though we disagree. At a time when democracy is under threat, it is more important than ever to defend this common ground,” he said.
He stated that Venezuela had evolved from “a relatively democratic and prosperous country to a brutal and authoritarian state” that was suffering from a humanitarian and economic crisis.
“Most Venezuelans live in deep poverty even as the few at top enrich themselves. The violent machinery of the state is directed against its own population. Nearly eight million people have left the country. The opposition has been systematically suppressed by means of election rigging, legal prosecution, and imprisonment,” he said.
He further said that Venezuela’s authoritarian regime made carrying out political work in the country “extremely dangerous”, adding that Machado stood up for free and fair elections more than 20 years ago.
Frydnes said that the Venezuela opposition leader had spoken out for judicial independence, human rights, and popular representation.
“She has spent years working for the representation of the Venezuelan people,” he said. He further said that Machado was the opposition’s presidential candidate for the 2024 elections, but her candidacy was blocked by the regime.
“She then backed the representative of another party Edmundo González Urrutia in the elections. Hundreds of thousands of volunteers mobilised across the political divides. They were trained as election observers to ensure a transparent and fair election.
“Despite the risk of harassment, arrest, and torture, citizens across the country held watch over the polling stations. They made sure the final tallies were documented before the regime could destroy ballots and lie about the outcome,” he said, adding that the efforts of the collective opposition were innovative, brave, peaceful and democratic.
Frydnes went on to say that democracy was a pre-condition for lasting peace. “However, we live in a world where democracy is in retreat. Where more and more authoritarian regimes are challenging norms and resorting to violence.”
He said the repression of the Venezuelan population by its regime was not unique. “We see the same trends globally. Rule of law abused by those in control, free media silenced, critics imprisoned and societies pushed towards authoritarian rule and militarisation.
“In 2024, more elections were held than ever before. But fewer and fewer are free and fair.”
Noting that she has been forced to live in hiding in the past year, he said, “Despite serious threats against her life, she has remained in the country, a choice that has inspired millions.”
Frydnes said that Machado “embodies the hope for a different future — one where the fundamental rights of citizens are protected and their voices are heard”.
US President Trump had made no secret of his desire to win this year’s prize.
Since returning to the White House for his second term in January, the US leader has repeatedly insisted that he “deserves” the Nobel for his role in resolving numerous conflicts — a claim observers say is broadly exaggerated.
But Nobel Prize experts in Oslo had insisted in the run-up to Friday’s announcement that he had no chance, noting that his “America First” policies run counter to the ideals of the Peace Prize as laid out in Alfred Nobel’s 1895 will creating the award.
Last year, the prestigious prize went to the Japanese anti-nuclear group Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots movement of atomic bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The prize comes with a gold medal, a diploma and a prize sum of $1.2 million.
The award will be presented at a formal ceremony in Oslo on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of the prizes’ creator, Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel.
The Peace Prize is the only Nobel awarded in Oslo, with the other disciplines announced in Stockholm.</p><small>2025-10-10 09:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10103605f37648f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947870/30-terrorists-involved-in-orakzai-attack-on-security-personnel-killed-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>30 terrorists involved in Orakzai attack on security personnel killed: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Thirty terrorists involved in the Orakzai incident earlier this week — during which 11 security personnel, including two officers, were martyred — were killed in a “retribution operation”, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday.
The incident in Orakzai took place on Tuesday night when security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district on the reported presence of  “Indian proxy Fitna Al Khawarij”.
In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
In the Tuesday operation, 19 “India-sponsored” terrorists were killed, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, adding that 11 security personnel, including two officers, had also embraced martyrdom during the exchange of fire.
In a statement issued today, the ISPR said, “Security forces have been conducting a series of retribution operations against the kharijis involved in [the] heinous incident that occurred in Orakzai District on October 7, resulting in the shahadat of brave sons of soil, including Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq and Major Tayyab Rahat.”
 






It added that during an operation in the Jamal Maya area of Orakzai, conducted on the basis of credible intelligence, “all 30 India-sponsored khwarij involved in the terrorist incident have been sent to hell” after an intense exchange of fire.
“These successful operations have avenged the heinous act and have brought the main perpetrators to justice,” the statement read.
It said sanitisaton operations were under way to “hunt and eliminate any other India-sponsored khariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined and remain steadfast to eradicate and wipe out the menace of India-sponsored terrorism from the country”.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that security personnel were engaged in “safeguarding the motherland against the enemy by risking their lives”.
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, he also reiterated the government’s resolve to stamp out the menace of terrorism from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari, in a statement on the PPP’s X account, lauded the security forces’ “courageous” operation against “India-sponsored terrorists”.
It quoted the president as saying that the nation would forever remember the sacrifices of Lieutenant Colonel Tariq and Major Rahat and that security forces had made the nation proud by dismantling a network of terrorists.
“Continuous successes against terrorism reflect our resolve, [and] the brave sons of the soil have written history by sacrificing their lives for the protection of the motherland,” the president added.
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also lauded the efforts of security forces, saying that the nation stood with them in the fight against terrorism.
A statement posted on the interior ministry’s X account quoted Naqvi as saying, “I pay tribute to the security forces for thwarting the designs of the Fitna Al Khawarij terrorists. The security forces achieved great success by bringing 30 terrorists to a decisive end.
“We will not let the terrorists of Fitna Al Khawarij hide anywhere in Pakistan,” he said.
 






Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Just a day after the Orakzai incident, a major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an IBO in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district.
Last month, 19 soldiers were martyred in KP in multiple incidents in a span of a few days.
Following that, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had said that the “Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khawarij or stand with Pakistan”.
Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan. It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. But Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations.
Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
After Tuesday’s IBO in Orakzai, a statement from the ISPR said the participants at the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference held at General Headquarters on Wednesday had expressed the resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of “Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan.
A day ago, PM Shehbaz said during a meeting of the federal cabinet that the nation was united in its resolve to eradicate terrorism from the country, and the government would take all measures to crush violence perpetrated from across the border.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif issued a similar warning in the National Assembly same day about going after terrorist facilitators “wherever they are”. Saying “enough is enough”, he added that the facilitators of terrorism would have to pay, whether they were present on Pakistani or Afghan soil.

The disaster killed 15,900 people, with 2,520 people still listed as missing as of the end of February, according to the National Police Agency.
Teeth and fragments of jaw were discovered in February 2023 in the northern region of Miyagi, a spokesman for the local police told AFP.
“After dental and DNA identification analyses, it was confirmed the remains belong to Natsuse Yamane, female, who was six years old at the time,” he said.
The girl had been at her home in Yamada, a town around 100 kilometres away in Iwate Prefecture, when the tsunami swept her away, the spokesman added.
She had been listed as missing ever since.
The remains were found by construction workers sifting through material amassed in a clean-up of coastal areas, the Asahi Shimbun daily reported.
The child’s family issued a statement of thanks.
“We are very happy to have been contacted and to receive this news after having given up hope,” the Asahi Shimbun quoted the statement as saying.
 
 

The last time remains were identified in the three prefectures hardest hit by the disaster — Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima — was in August 2023, the Asahi said.
The 9.0-magnitude earthquake in March 2011 also sent three reactors into meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant in this century’s biggest atomic disaster.</p><small>2025-10-10 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1012575991c2aa7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947884/no-showstoppers-aurangzeb-says-had-constructive-engagement-with-fund-mission' target='_blank'><strong>‘No showstoppers’: Aurangzeb says had ‘constructive’ engagement with Fund mission</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Friday said that Pakistan’s recent engagement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was “constructive”, adding that there appeared to be no “showstoppers” so far.
An IMF mission led by Iva Petrova met with Pakistan’s economic team in Karachi and Islamabad from September 24 to October 8 to review the implementation of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and $1.1bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
A day earlier, the Fund said that “significant progress” had been made towards finalising a staff-level agreement on the second review under the 37-month EFF and the first review of the 28-month RSF.
“Programme implementation remains strong, and broadly aligned with the authorities’ commitments,” the IMF had said.
Today, the minister virtually addressed a high-level business delegation from Saudi Arabia, which arrived in Pakistan on October 7, and said, “We have had very constructive engagement with the [IMF] mission here.
“We have a few outstanding issues — from my perspective, no showstoppers,” he said.
“We will continue these discussions virtually tonight, into the weekend, and hopefully early [next] week when the [State Bank of Pakistan] governor, finance secretary and myself are in Washington. We hope to get moving with the staff-level agreement,” he said.
Meanwhile, Aurangzeb also lauded the Saudi delegation’s visit, terming it “timely”. He called it an opportunity for Pakistan to “step up in terms of inviting [investors], and equally making sure that our existing investors work in a good environment“.
The finance minister also went on to detail Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s vision for the economy, outlining two areas the premier aimed to prioritise.
“One is taxation reform,” he said, acknowledging the “additional burden business leaders face in the formal sector because the other sections of society are not setting up the way they need to”.
“The second is our digital journey and moving towards a cashless economy,” he said, noting that the two were interconnected. He stated that 40 to 50 per cent of Pakistan’s economy was undocumented.
Stressing the need for digitisation, Aurangzeb said, “The more we move toward a cashless economy and our digital journey, the more we sort of help the documentation and moving stuff into the formal economy.”</p><small>2025-10-10 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/101217505feb249.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947882/india-to-reopen-its-embassy-in-kabul-after-4-years' target='_blank'><strong>India to reopen its embassy in Kabul after 4 years</strong></a><br><p>India will reopen its embassy in the Afghan capital Kabul that was shut four years ago, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Friday.
India had closed its embassy in Kabul after the Taliban seized power following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces in 2021, but opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support, and humanitarian aid.
About a dozen countries including China, Russia, Iran, Pakistan and Turkiye have embassies operating in Kabul, although Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration.
New Delhi’s announcement came as Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi began talks with Jaishankar on what is the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since 2021.
“India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghanistan,” Jaishankar told Muttaqi in his opening remarks.
“Closer cooperation between us contributes to your national development, as well as regional stability and resilience,” he said, adding that India’s “technical mission” in Kabul was being upgraded to an embassy.
According to Hindustan Times, Jaishankar also said that closer cooperation between the two countries would contribute to “regional stability and resilience“.
“As a contiguous neighbour and a well-wisher of the Afghan people, India has a deep interest in your development and progress,” Jaishankar said, according to the report.
 






Meanwhile, Muttaqi was quoted as saying that India was the first country to respond to “the recent earthquake in Afghanistan”.
“Afghanistan looks at India as a close friend. Afghanistan wants relations based on mutual respect, trade and people-to-people relations,” the Afghan minister was quoted as saying.
New Delhi does not officially recognise the Taliban government but has taken tentative steps to thaw ties with meetings and talks between senior officials in their respective foreign ministries.
The visit comes after Muttaqi attended a regional meeting in Moscow where Afgha­nistan’s neighbours including Pakistan, Iran, China and several Central Asian countries issued a joint statement opposing the deployment of foreign military infrastructure in the region. The statement was regarded as a signal of opposition to US President Donald Trump’s stated objective to retake control of the Bagram military base near Kabul.</p><small>2025-10-10 07:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10124449157c330.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947879/operation-in-kps-bannu-kills-2-terrorists-including-one-wanted-for-killing-4-officials-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>Operation in KP’s Bannu kills 2 terrorists, including one wanted for killing 4 officials: CTD</strong></a><br><p>In a major intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Thursday, two terrorists were killed including one reported to be the mastermind behind the killing of four officials in April, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in a statement
A press release by the CTD issued yesterday said that it had “killed two most-wanted terrorists during a successful intelligence-based operation in Bannu district”.
“The mastermind of the martyrdom of four CTD officials is also among those killed,” it added.
According to the press release, the CTD had received confidential information that terrorists belonging to the banned organisation Fitna-al-Khawarij were planning a “major terrorist operation” on Company Road within the limits of Domail police station.
Fitnah-al Khawarij is the term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Per the statement, the CTD’s Special (SWAT) team surrounded the area immediately along with the district police.
“Upon seeing the operation team, the terrorists tried to escape and started indiscriminate firing on the officials,” it said. “CTD and police retaliated vigorously to protect themselves and arrest the terrorists.”
The exchange of fire between the CTD team and the terrorists reportedly continued for about 25 minutes.
After the firing stopped, a search and clearance operation was conducted in the area and two terrorists were found dead, both of whom were identified as being from Bannu, it added.
“Some of the terrorists’ accomplices took advantage of the darkness to successfully escape.”
One of the terrorists killed was identified as the mastermind behind an attack on the Bannu CTD team on April 30, 2025, in which four personnel were killed and one injured. He had also been involved in attacks on two police posts in the district, in which a constable was martyred, the statement saod.
The other was involved in several attacks and targeted killings on CTD and district police in 2023, including attacking and injuring a constable in November of that year, according to the CTD.
“Two Kalashnikovs, six magazines, 23 rounds, two hand grenades, two mobile phones and two cards of the banned TTP were recovered from the possession of the slain terrorists,” the press release said, adding that additional police and CTD personnel had launched a search operation in the area to arrest the escaped terrorists.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
A major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district yesterday, according to the media wing of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The incident occurred a day after the ISPR reported that 11 security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, had been killed in an exchange of fire between the forces and TTP terrorists in KP’s Orakzai district.</p><small>2025-10-10 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627901-faceless-e-challan-system-comes-into-effect-this-month-in-sindh' target='_blank'><strong>Faceless e-challan system comes into effect this month in Sindh</strong></a><br><p>

Agency Phivolcs warned of aftershocks from the quake, which struck in the morning in waters off Manay town in Davao Oriental in the Mindanao region. At least one person was killed, civil defence official Raffy Alejandro said on Facebook.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre issued an update around noon local time saying the tsunami threat in the Philippines had passed, having earlier said waves 1 to 3 metres high were possible, although warnings from other agencies remained in place.
 






There were no other reports of casualties from disaster offices in the region contacted by Reuters, but one official in Manay said there were initial reports of damage to homes, buildings and bridges.
The quake was among the strongest in recent years to hit the Philippines, which sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire” and experiences more than 800 quakes each year.
Rescue teams being prepared
The US Tsunami Warning System issued a tsunami threat immediately after the quake, saying hazardous waves were possible for coasts within 300 kilometres of the earthquake’s epicentre.
The earthquake came two weeks after the Philippines experienced its deadliest quake in more than a decade, with 74 people killed on the island of Cebu. That was a magnitude of 6.9 and also struck offshore.
Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said authorities were assessing the situation on the ground and said search-and-rescue teams would be deployed when it was safe to do so.
“We are working round the clock to ensure that help reaches everyone who needs it,” Marcos said in a statement.
Richie Diuyen, a disaster official in Manay near the epicentre, said the quake lasted 30-40 seconds and initial damage included some houses, the facade of a church, cracked roads and unpassable bridges.
“We couldn’t stand earlier. I am 46 years old now, and this is the strongest earthquake I ever felt,” Diuyen said by phone.
“The damage is quite big,” she said.
Tsunami warning for Indonesia, Palau
Phivolcs revised down the magnitude from an initial reading of 7.6 to 7.4, and put the depth of the quake at 23 km.
A tsunami warning was issued in Indonesia for its northern Sulawesi and Papua regions, and the PTWC said some coasts in Indonesia and the Pacific island nation of Palau could see waves of up to 1 metre.
A video of the quake from the Philippine city of Davao, posted on social media and verified by Reuters, showed office workers holding on to desks, with the creaking noises of structures. Another showed toppled cabinets and evacuated workers gathering outside.
Jonathan Dolotina, a radio operator at the disaster office of the coastal Philippine city of Mati, said there were no immediate reports of casualties and authorities were checking a damaged school building.
Sawsan Entrino, a disaster officer in Banay-Banay 10 km away, told Philippine broadcaster DZMM that local classes had been suspended and inspections were underway, but there were no immediate reports of damage.
The governor of Davao Oriental in the Philippines said people panicked when the earthquake struck.
“Some buildings were reported to have been damaged,” Edwin Jubahib told  DZMM. “It was very strong.”</p><small>2025-10-10 05:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/10082206a36d1b9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947802/amazon-eyes-project-kuiper-launch-by-2026' target='_blank'><strong>Amazon eyes Project Kuiper launch by 2026</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: After Starlink, a European giant and a Chinese company, Amazon’s satellite broadband initiative — Project Kuiper — has expressed interest in rolling out its services in Pakistan.
In a meeting with Minister for IT and Telecom Shaza Fatima Khawaja, a delegation from Amazon outlined plans to launch Project Kuiper in Pakistan by the end of 2026. The delegation, led by Mostafa Mousa — Project Kuiper’s lead for Licensing and Regulatory Affairs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa — also included Jeff Kietzemen and Hisham Alshaer.
The IT minister welcomed the delegation, stressing that this development signals growing confidence among global tech giants in Pakistan’s expanding digital economy. She noted that the entry of Project Kuiper would create new opportunities for affordable, high-speed internet, particularly in remote and underserved communities where traditional connectivity options remain limited.
Project Kuiper is Amazon’s Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network, which plans to deploy 3,236 satellites to deliver broadband speeds of up to 400 Mbps using low-cost user terminals.

Minister insists move signals tech giants’ growing confidence in Pakistan’s digital sector

The delegation shared its intent to establish ground infrastructure in Pakistan, including gateways and points of presence (PoPs), to ensure stable connectivity and smooth integration with local networks.
Welcoming Amazon’s plans, Ms Fatima said the partnership aligns perfectly with the government’s vision of “Digital Nation Pakistan”.
“This initiative is not just about faster internet — it’s about opportunity,” she noted. “With Project Kuiper, we are taking a concrete step towards digital inclusion so every citizen, no matter where they live, can connect, learn and grow.”
The Ministry of IT and Telecom emphasised that collaborations like these will create new opportunities for Pakistan’s IT sector, boost innovation and e-commerce and strengthen Pakistan’s position in the global digital ecosystem.
Pakistan’s satellite broadband policy is guided by the Pakistan Satellite Services Regulatory Policy (PASRP), which defines procedures for foreign operators seeking landing rights and spectrum access. Several international companies have already shown interest.
SpaceX’s Starlink has completed preliminary technical submissions, while OneWeb, a subsidiary of the French group Eutelsat, has opened talks for gateway testing and commercial collaboration.
The application of the Chinese satellite internet provider, SSST, is currently in the initial process.
Amazon’s Project Kuiper has now become the fourth major global LEO satellite operator to formally engage with Pakistan.
The PASRP’s regulatory framework requires satellite operators to secure multiple clearances, including landing rights, gateway licensing, spectrum allocation and security vetting, through bodies such as Suparco, the Frequency Allocation Board, Pakistan Telecomm­unication Authority, and the Ministry of Interior.

• Gandapur denies being offered his job back, says he won’t accept it
• Atta Tarar accuses PTI of ‘enabling terrorists’, sees effort to ‘promote militancy’ behind Sohail Afridi’s nomination
PESHAWAR: Despite Imran Khan’s inst­ructions, Ali Amin Gandapur technically re­­mains the chief minister of Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa until his resignation is accepted by the provincial governor.
His resignation letter, which was shared with the media the previous night, has apparently gotten lost in red tape, with Governor House denying having ever received it.
Officials at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat told Dawn that Mr Gandapur’s resignation had been delivered to the Governor House on Wednesday night. A copy of the letter seen by Dawn showed that it was received by the governor’s staff at 10:57pm.
However, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who was in Islamabad on Thursday, and other officials at the Governor’s Secre­tariat remained tight-lipped about the issue.
An official on Mr Kundi’s staff told Dawn that they had yet to receive the resignation letter. “As far as I know, the resignation has not yet reached the Governor’s Office,” the official said, adding that the governor would sign it whenever he received it.
He further said that Governor Kundi was due to return to the provincial capital on Friday (today).
 
 

Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Mr Kundi said he had not yet received the chief minister’s resignation and would sign it as soon as it was received. He described reports regarding the receipt of the resignation letter at the Governor House as “fake news.”
Meanwhile, in his first media interaction after ‘stepping down’, Mr Gandapur asserted that the federal government could not topple the PTI government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Commenting on the delay in the acceptance of his resignation, he termed it a “drama” and advised the government not to waste time, warning that such a delay would harm the province.
When asked if he had been re-offered the chief ministership, he denied receiving any such offer, saying that even if such an offer were made, he would not accept it.
‘PTI enables terrorists’
Meanwhile, at a press conference in Isla­m­abad, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused the PTI of “enabling terrorists”.
In his view, the problem that led to Mr Gandapur’s ouster was that he did not do as he was told i.e., “enable and support terrorists and prevent actions against them”.
He alleged that CM-in-waiting Sohail Afridi was nominated to “support, promote, and enable” terrorism in the province.
“These [people] are enabled by a person sitting in jail,” the information minister said, calling Imran Khan the “chief sponsor of terrorism”.

Recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) before a special court, Mr Khan rejected the prosecution’s narrative in the case pertaining to the alleged illegal retention and undervaluation of the Bulgari jewellery set, gifted to him by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021.
Mr Khan alleged that the entire case was “malicious, fabricated, and politically engineered”. He contended that he did not qualify as a “public servant” under the Pakistan Penal Code, arguing that even in his capacity as prime minister, he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he said was presented to his wife, Bushra Bibi.
 
 

The PTI founder maintained that due process was followed in accordance with the Toshakhana Policy 2018. He said the gift was duly reported to the PM Office protocol section, assessed, and legally retained after payment was deposited into the national exchequer. “We complied with the Toshakhana Policy in letter and spirit,” he said.

Bushra claims she is being targeted due to her association with Imran Khan

Rejecting allegations of undervaluation, Mr Khan denied that he or his wife had directed any official to influence the appraiser. He termed the statements of prosecution witnesses, including former comptroller Syed Inamullah Shah and appraiser Sohaib Abbasi, as “false, fabricated, and hearsay”.
He described Mr Shah as an “unreliable witness” who bore personal grudges after being removed from service and alleged that he was acting on behalf of political opponents. Similarly, he accused Mr Abbasi of being an “untrustworthy approver” who changed his stance under external pressure.
Mr Khan also challenged the jurisdiction of both the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), stating that the investigations were “extra-legal and supra-constitutional”. He said the FIA “acted merely as a post office”, transferring the case from NAB without independent evaluation. He also questioned the admissibility of evidence obtained from abroad, particularly from Bulgari Italy, citing recent amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.
Calling himself a “political prisoner”, Mr Khan said that since May 2022, more than 350 criminal cases had been filed against him as part of a campaign to exclude him from the political process. He claimed that his previous Toshakhana convictions had already been overturned on appeal, showing that the allegations were “bogus and groundless”.
Mr Khan reaffirmed his innocence and said his record of public service reflected his integrity. He declined to produce any defence evidence or testify on oath, stating that “no such need is felt as the prosecution failed to prove its case”.
In a separate statement recorded on the same day, Bushra Bibi also pleaded not guilty, denying charges of illegal retention and undervaluation of the Bulgari jewellery set. She maintained that the gift was declared, assessed, and retained in compliance with Toshakhana rules.
She, too, challenged the jurisdiction of NAB and FIA following amendments to the NAB Ordinance and described the proceedings as part of a “ruthless and unprecedented campaign” of political victimisation. Declaring herself a non-political housewife, she said she was being targeted solely due to her association with Imran Khan.
The court recorded both statements and will hear the case on Oct 13.

Now, all three of the country’s main water reservoirs — Tarbela, Mangla and Chashma — are filled to their maximum levels, holding a cumulative live storage of 13.316 MAF, considered a boon for irrigated agriculture and hydroelectric power generation.
“Tarbela Dam attained its maximum water conservation level of 1,550 feet on Aug.21, followed by Chashma lake that also attained its maximum level of 649 feet above mean sea level,” an official source told Dawn. “And, finally on Thursday [Mangla] also hit its maximum level of 1,242 feet.”
The official attributed the filling of the reservoirs to a high-flow season.
“The filling of Mangla and Chashma reservoirs to their maximum capacity is mainly due to rains, floods etc.,” he said. “However, the snow melting factor also contributes considerably in filling Tarbela Dam.”
Completed in 1967, Mangla Dam contributes to the country’s economic stability by helping ensure water supply for irrigation, mitigating floods, and providing hydel electricity to the National Grid.
At the time of its construction, Mangla Dam had a live storage capacity of 5.88 MAF, which gradually decreased to 4.6 MAF by 2004 due to sedimentation. WAPDA later began the Mangla Dam Raising Project, which not only regained the lost capacity but also enhanced it to 7.5 MAF.
Originally built with an installed power generation capacity of 1,000 MW, the dam is currently undergoing a phased refurbishment project. According to Wapda, the Mangla Refurbishment Project will increase the power generation capacity from 1,000 MW to 1,310 MW.

• Federal cabinet ratifies Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement with Saudi Arabia
ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Thursday approved the formation of a special force for the protection of major dams in the country, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reaffirmed the nation’s resolve to eradicate terrorism and said that the government and armed forces would take all measures to crush violence emanating from across the border.
“The meeting granted in-principle approval for legislation to establish a special security force for the protection of major dams and hydropower projects under Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), said an official press release issued by the PM Office after the cabinet meeting, which was presided over by the prime minister.
The cabinet ratified recently inked the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The meeting also paid tribute to the leaderships of both the countries.
The cabinet further approved the donation of 15 non-operational aircraft of the Department of Plant Protection to various institutions for educational, commemorative, and exhibition purposes. The remai­ning four operational aircraft will continue to be used by the department for anti-locust operations.
It was noted that previous attempts to auction these aircraft had been unsuccessful, leading to the decision to donate them instead.
Earlier, in his opening remarks, Prime Minister Shehbaz highlighted recent incidents in which army officers and soldiers embraced martyrdom while conducting operations against terrorists.
PM Shehbaz remarked that facilitators were providing shelter to terrorists coming from across the border, and warned that such elements would no longer be spared. “The situation had reached a critical point. The martyrs have drawn a line with their blood while defending their country, and this line cannot be crossed,” he said.
“The sacrifices of the martyrs will be remembered forever,” he asserted, adding that the country’s achievements on the economic and diplomatic fronts would mean nothing if terrorism was not eliminated.

Following recent shifts in political affiliations in the 53-member AJK Legislative Assembly, the PPP has raised its strength to 17 and the PML-N to nine, while the PTI forward bloc stands at 20.
The PTI, which holds the office of the leader of the opposition, is left with only five lawmakers — one of whom has tendered his resignation, although it hasn’t been accepted yet — while two seats are held by members of other parties.
The PPP’s parliamentary party and some key ticket holders, who met in Islamabad on Wednesday with its regional president Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin in the chair, unanimously resolved that the party should quit the government “sooner rather than later” to protect its political goodwill among the masses.

Amid suspicions that PM Haq ‘supported’ JKJAAC protest, PML-N, PPP lawmakers seek to pull out of ruling coalition

Later, the 17-member parliamentary party held an exclusive meeting that was also attended by a non-legislator, Sardar Tanveer Ilyas. The meeting came in the backdrop of the PML-N’s offer to PPP to form its own government following the possible exit of Mr Haq.
 
 

“Yes, we have offered them that we will support them in the event of a new election of the leader of the house. But we will not be part of the government and prefer to sit on the opposition benches,” a PML-N leader confided to Dawn.
The PPP meeting deliberated on options to pave the way for the prime minister’s exit, either through a no-confidence motion or his voluntary resignation. According to one participant, Mr Ilyas assured the meeting that he would arrange the required tally of 27 to send Mr Haq packing.
The issue will be further discussed by the PPP parliamentary party on Friday afternoon at Zardari House in Karachi, where the party’s central leadership is expected to take a final decision. Mr Ilyas has also been invited to attend.
A day earlier, the PML-N’s political committee had met in Islamabad, alongside cabinet members Rana Sanaullah and Ahsan Iqbal, where a similar view was expressed — that remaining part of the coalition was politically damaging for the party ahead of the polls.
Sources told Dawn that when PM Shehbaz Sharif was briefed about the recent agreement signed in Muzaffarabad between the federal government’s negotiation committee and representatives of the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC), he was told that PM Haq appeared to have tacitly backed the movement.
“It seemed the AJK premier himself was behind the committee’s hard stance; otherwise, it could not have succeeded in getting each and every demand of the protesters implemented,” a well-placed source quoted a member of the negotiating team as telling the premier.
This was why the head of the negotiation committee, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, had hinted to media persons that Mr Haq may be re­­p­laced. However, shortly afterwards, Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry sought to play down the claim, saying it was AJK’s internal matter.
Meanwhile, Mr Haq is said to be under intense pressure over the removal of eight cabinet members elected from 12 constituencies of Pakistan-based refugees, in accordance with the agreement with the JKJAAC.
These ministers belong to all three coalition partners. According to sources, the AJK PM had asked them to step down voluntarily, which was met stiff refusal. Two of them, belonging to the PML-N, even lashed out at the premier through social media posts, accusing him of backing the JKJAAC movement and urging him to resign himself.
The AJK prime minister has yet to respond to these allegations.

• Observers see ‘calculated political strategy’ behind PML-N’s use of ‘Punjab card’
KARACHI: After high-level engagement between the PML-N and PPP, an eme­r­ging thaw has temporarily paused the political firestorm between the two parties.
A phone call between Pri­me Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday further sparked hopes of reconciliation, although sources suggest the truce appeared to be temporary — more like a ‘pact of silence’ rather than a complete ceasefire.
According to insiders, the tensions that ignited the dispute are still simmering beneath the surface.
A brief statement issued by Bilawal House confirmed that PM Shehbaz called Mr Bhutto-Zardari. The two discussed the “current political situation, floods, and foreign policy”, it added.
However, there was no offi­c­ial readout from the PM Office regarding the conversation.
A day earlier, a PML-N delegation including Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and National Assembly Spea­ker Ayaz Sadiq had met Pres­ident Zardari at his residen­ce in Nawabshah, where Inter­ior Minister Mohsin Na­q­vi was also in attendance.
Although the intensity of the growing divide between the two sides appears to have significantly diminished following these high-level engagements, sources say the underlying disagreements remain.
A clear indication of this lingering discontent is PPP’s decision to continue its boycott of the Senate session on Thursday, underscoring the impression that the party’s grievances have yet to be fully addressed.
 
 

In the PML-N’s view, the dispute between the two parties was sparked when the PPP targeted Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, which PML-N viewed as crossing a line.
The PPP, on the other hand, felt their suggestion of using the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) for flood relief was unfairly criticised.
‘Punjab card’
Another growing perception within PPP ranks is that the PML-N onslaught is not a spontaneous reaction, but rather a calculated political strategy.
“It appears that Maryam Bibi [Nawaz] is positioning her party as the sole representative of Punjab by playing the ethnic card,” said a senior PPP leader, suggesting that the Punjab chief minister was attempting to counter “PTI’s popularity” in her province by using the “Punjab card” with targeted criticism of the PPP as part of that strategy.
Analysts do not entirely dismiss this perception. Author and political analyst Ali Usman Qasmi believes these are very “interesting developments”, noting that this may be the first time such a political approach is being adopted from Punjab’s side.
“Forget about a major political leader from Punjab, even a relatively unknown political worker or intellectual could not have made such statements in the past,” he said. “And I think this coming all from the chief minister of Punjab means a lot.”
Mr Qasmi believes that the PML-N’s recent rhetoric, emphasising a Punjabi identity, is a response to multiple pressures — both political and social.
One key factor, he argues, is the rising visibility of ethnic minorities, especially Pakhtuns and Baloch, in Punjab, which has created anxieties. This rising tension could be driving an environment in which ethnic symbolism is deliberately employed to consolidate support.
“One could say that perhaps PML-N sees this as an opportunity to capitalise on this sentiment and get some political mileage out of it,” he said.

• Containers placed at key points to prevent march on Islamabad
• Over a dozen cops injured in clashes; outfit claims casualties due to violence
• Minister says TLP using ‘Gaza March’ as pretext to spread unrest
LAHORE: The city remai­ned on edge throughout Thur­sday after late-night clashes between the police and the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) left several people injured, including around a dozen policemen.
The standoff came following a call by the religious outfit to march on the federal capital, where it planned to stage a protest outside the US embassy in solidarity with Palestinians.
In a bid to prevent the group from following through on its plans, authorities cracked do­wn, cordoning off the Mult­an Road headquarters of the TLP with shipping containers and sealing the city’s entry/exit points.
Meanwhile, in Islamabad, the administration also placed containers at entry points to keep protesters at bay. More than 100 TLP supporters were also rounded up in the capital.
After clashes with Lahore police a night ago, the TLP had called on its supporters to converge on the provincial capital for a ‘final call’ on Friday (today).
This worried police, who feared the protest might turn violent and took extraordinary security measures across the province to maintain law and order. As a result, citizens, particularly those living in the densely populated areas from Chauburji to Yateem Khanna Chowk, faced inconvenience.
Despite the added security measures, the situation remained tense, especially on Multan Road. The artery remained closed to all kinds of traffic as charged TLP supporters took positions in improvised shelters erected on the road, ready to pounce on police. On Thursday afternoon, the TLP supporters and the police faced off again, resulting in a skirmish. The religious outfit, however, ransacked some businesses and damaged vehicles.
There were contradictory reports about casualties, as TLP claimed at least two of its workers were killed. However, police sources acknowledged only one death, saying the body had been handed over to the TLP for burial.
The outfit also claimed that 50 of its workers sustained injuries, but police sources put the number at only seven. Over a dozen policemen were also injured in the violence since Wednesday night.
A senior police officer told Dawn on anonymity that the Nawan Kot police station was lodging FIR under anti-terrorism and other offences against hundreds of TLP activists and supporters. He said TLP chief Saad Rizvi would also be nominated besides many central leaders of the party.
‘Unrest and anarchy’
Separately, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Thursday accused the TLP of attempting to spread unrest and anarchy in the country under the pretext of a so-called ‘Gaza March’.
Speaking to reporters outside Parliament House, Mr Chaudhry said the government had always facilitated peaceful protests under legal procedures and standard operating protocols, but the TLP neither sought permission nor assured compliance with any law. “Was the TLP planning a protest or plotting violence? I will show you the difference,” he remarked.
The minister said that several individuals arrested in Punjab and Islamabad were found carrying batons, chemicals, glass marbles, tear gas shells and guns, and face masks, which, he said, indicated violent intent rather than peaceful demonstration.
“Does this look like a peaceful protest or an attempt to incite violence?” the state minister questioned, adding that those detained were confirmed to be the TLP office-bearers.
He called the TLP a “mercenary-like group” that operates under the garb of religion and said the organisation was deliberately trying to divert national attention from security issues.
“It was shameful that you were spreading blatant lies and giving false statements on social media regarding the deaths of your workers. Does our faith allow such things?” the minister added.

Official sources confirmed that the IMF had shared the draft Memor­andum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) with the authorities before a visiting mission left Pakistan after two weeks of engagements.
“We were at the cusp of finalising the SLA, but two crucial tables that form part of the MEFP required further adjustments,” an official said, hoping that the latest data on foreign remittances had strengthened Pakist­an’s stance about the external account.
He said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) would hold its cautious monetary policy stance for now in light of the rebounding inf­l­a­tion. Moreover, the flood-related losses still need to be finalised and verified.
Officials said the IMF mission appreciated the efforts of the power division, particularly its secretary Dr Fakhre Alam Irfan, for exceeding alm­ost all performance indicators — a rare feat. However, the Fund warned that timely corrective measures, including tariff adjustments, would be crucial for sustainability.
Therefore, the government will have to ensure the timely disbursement of committed subsidies, including the payment of pending bills by the provinces where consumer bills were waived or relaxed in flood-affected districts.
The provinces, with adjustments against flood losses, must also deliver their cash surplus targets. The government will maintain a tight fiscal policy, particularly regarding the disbursement of development funds, while development projects in flood-affected regions will remain on hold.
The FBR is set to revise its revenue collection target downward, with measures prepared for implementation by Jan 1, 2026, to address any further shortfalls.
These issues are expected to be finalised during the upcoming IMF-World Bank annual meetings, where the Pakistani delegation, led by the finance minister and including the SBP governor and FBR chairman, will depart this weekend. Sources said that public debt-related figures, including fixed and flexible interest rates, sukuk and maturities, are safely within targets.
In an early morning end-of-mission statement, the IMF said that significant progress had been made towards finalising the SLA on the second review under the 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the first review of the 28-month Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
 
 

Pakistan anticipates receiving around $1.2bn as a combined tranche from the two IMF facilities next month, subject to board approval, based on the expected SLA outcome from policy-level discussions next week.
The IMF team visited Karachi and Islamabad from Sept 24 to Oct 8 to discuss the second review under EFF and the first review under RSF. “Programme implementation remains strong, broadly aligned with the authorities’ commitments,” the IMF noted.
The team added that significant progress was made in several key areas, including fiscal consolidation to strengthen public finances while supporting flood recovery, keeping inflation within SBP’s target range through tight monetary policy, restoring energy sector viability via regular tariff adjustments and cost-reducing reforms, and advancing structural reforms to reduce the state’s footprint and strengthen governance. The IMF also highlighted discussions on strengthening climate resilience through reform measures under the RSF.
“The IMF team and the authorities will continue policy discussions with a view to settling any outstanding issues,” it said, adding that the team expressed sympathy for those affected by the recent floods.

Sources reported a Land Cruiser vehicle was apparently hit in the area of Abdul Haq Square in Kabul.
Afghan media outlet Tolo News reported that, according to locals, the Abdul Haq intersection was closed, resulting in widespread traffic congestion in the area.
AFP journalists reported that two explosions were heard in the capital. The two blasts occurred around 9:50pm local time (10:20 PKT). In the streets of the Afghan capital, numerous security forces were alerted and were searching cars, an AFP journalist saw.

Five more medium to heavy rare earth elements — holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium — and related material will be added from November 8, China’s commerce ministry said.
The rare earths will join over twenty elements and related materials already listed, in each case forcing exporters to apply to Beijing for licences before selling overseas. China has also separately banned exports of gallium, germanium and antimony to the United States.
Below is a summary of all Beijing’s mineral export restrictions since 2023:
Rare earth
China produces around 90 per cent of the world’s rare earths, a group of 17 elements with small but crucial uses in sectors like clean energy, defence and automotive.
China first placed seven of the elements and related material on an export control list in April before adding a further five on Thursday. The five new elements play small but crucial roles in fibre optics, nuclear power and other sectors.
While rare earths are common in the Earth’s crust, China has mastered the technically difficult and environmentally harmful refining process comparatively cheaply.

China has spent years tightening its control over the rare earths sector. In December 2023, Beijing banned the export of technology to make rare earth magnets, adding it to an existing ban on refining technology.
On Thursday, it added dozens more machines and materials used in mining and refining to the control list. Domestic production is tightly controlled by a system of quotas that are only granted to state-owned miners.
Tungsten, indium, bismuth, tellurium and molybdenum
China imposed export controls on five other metals used in defence, clean energy and other industries — tungsten, indium, bismuth, tellurium and molybdenum — in early February, shortly after US President Donald Trump’s first 10pc tariff on Chinese goods took effect.
Licences are now required to export 20 related products. However, the curbs stopped short of outright bans and were narrowly targeted in the cases of some metals, like molybdenum.

Battery, lithium and gallium processing technology
China in January proposed to restrict the export of some technology used to make cutting-edge battery components and process critical minerals lithium and gallium. The controls were imposed in July.
At least one company has stopped exporting products on the list since the proposal was floated.
On Thursday, China widened those controls to include more lithium battery-related items and equipment used to manufacture certain lithium-ion batteries.
Antimony, gallium, germanium
Beijing banned the export of antimony, gallium and germanium to the US in late 2024 in response to a fresh crackdown on China’s chip sector from Washington. The outright ban only applies to the US, although over the previous 18 months, China had steadily introduced export licensing regimes for the three metals.
In the case of antimony, a strategic metal used in flame retardants, solar power equipment and munitions, exports to big buyers like Japan, India and South Korea had barely restarted three months after export licences were introduced.
China dominates the supply chain for the three metals and mines or refines between half and 90pc of the global supply of those minerals.
Graphite
Beijing on Thursday widened existing export controls on graphite to include some synthetic graphite materials, effective from November 8.
In October 2023, China said it would require export permits for three types of “highly sensitive” graphite products to protect national security.
China is the world’s top graphite producer and exporter, and also refines more than 90pc of the world’s graphite into a material that is used in virtually all EV batteries.</p><small>2025-10-09 18:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0922550919c8f51.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947576/hamas-and-israel-sign-ceasefire-and-hostage-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas and Israel sign ceasefire and hostage deal</strong></a><br><p>Hamas and Israel signed an agreement on Thursday to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the conflict in Gaza.
Officials on both sides confirmed they had signed the deal following indirect talks in the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. The deal’s announcement had been greeted with celebrations among Palestinians and Israelis alike.
The deal includes the release of captives and prisoners as well as a surge of aid into Gaza after more than two years of genocide after Tel Aviv started bombing the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the ceasefire would take effect once the agreement is ratified by his government, which would convene after a security cabinet meeting today.
An Israeli government spokeswoman, confirming the deal had been signed, said the ceasefire would go into force within 24 hours of the cabinet meeting. After that 24-hour period, the captives held in Gaza will be freed within 72 hours, she said.
A source briefed on details of the agreement said earlier that Israeli troops would begin pulling back within 24 hours of the deal being signed.
An Israeli official said all 20 Israeli captives still believed to be alive in Gaza after being seized by Hamas would be released.
The prisoners released in exchange will not include Marwan Barghouti, one of the most prominent Palestinian prisoners, the spokeswoman said.
Trump said today that disarmament would be part of the second phase of a Gaza deal, with Israel insisting that Hamas must give up its weapons.
“I’m not going to talk about that because you sort of know what phase two is. But … there will be disarming,” Trump told reporters at a cabinet meeting, adding that there would also be “pullbacks” by Israeli forces.
He said he had no view regarding the possibility of a two-state solution and he would follow whatever was ultimately agreed on.
“I don’t have a view. I’m going to go with what they agreed to,” he told reporters. On what Palestinians can expect, he added: “We’re going to create something where people can live … We’re going to create better conditions for people.“
He said that the Gaza captives should be released on Monday or Tuesday and that he hopes to attend a signing ceremony in Egypt. Trump said he believed it will lead to “lasting peace”. “We are getting the hostages back on Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday, and that’ll be a day of joy,” Trump said.
Trump said under the plan Gaza is going to be “slowly redone”, a reference to plans to rebuild the Palestinian enclave. He did not provide details.
While questions remain about what happens in the region in the long term, Trump said he hoped it would lead to “an everlasting peace”.

Key developments

US President Trump says Hamas will release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line
Source says Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners
Trump thanks mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye; earlier said he may travel to Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”; says he thinks captives will probably be released on Monday


Hamas would release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line, Trump had said after talks in Egypt on his 20-point peace plan resulted in a deal.
Qatar had said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”.
Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal, a source within the group told AFP.
The exchange will take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the agreement, which is expected to be signed on Thursday, the source familiar with the negotiations said.
The captives will be released in exchange for 250 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment and 1,700 others arrested by Israel since the war began, the source added.
 
 

The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement
“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network.
“This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.”
Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!”
 






He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”.
“The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview.
“This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”.
 






In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.”
“Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”.
 






Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”.
In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt.
“I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza.
 






Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory.
Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier.
An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday.
 






‘Optimism prevails’
As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air.
“We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza.
Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce.
 
 

In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday.
Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible.
The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning.
Protests, prisoners
Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return.
One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for.
High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media.
Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”.
Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state
The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration.
Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen.
There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007.
 
 

Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries.
It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza.
Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide.

Khan led the Pakistani delegation on the 45-vessel GSF, which left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of aid to Gaza with activists and politicians, including Greta Thunberg, on board. However, as it approached Gaza, Israeli forces intercepted it, detaining the activists on board before deporting them. Khan was detained in Israel for five days before being deported to Jordan.
Appearing on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, the ex-senator slammed the federal government, as well as other Muslim governments, for failing to put pressure on Israel to stop its onslaught in the Gaza Strip. Khan also outlined his experience in Israeli captivity during the interview.
“What I want to ask is that if Sweden’s Greta [Thunberg] can lead the flotilla, then where are the Muslim countries?” he asked. “Why didn’t the people stand up? I am ashamed that 2 billion Muslims could not do anything.
“There were parliamentarians in jail with me. Where were Pakistan’s parliamentarians?”
Speaking about Pakistan’s role in the peace plan, specifically the meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, Khan highlighted that the 20-point plan unveiled by United States President Donald Trump was a “project of slavery”.
“Since they (Israel) could not capture Gaza by force, they tried to capture it through negotiations. That 20-point plan was a slap in Hamas’ face,” he emphasised.
He highlighted that the Palestinian Authority’s involvement was also questionable, as they talked about Gaza “minus Hamas” at the UN General Assembly.
“The world order had failed; thus, civilians undertook the mission,” Khan said.
When asked about whether the Gaza peace plan would be successful, the ex-senator replied in the affirmative, adding that the people of Europe and their pressure on Israel would be a contributing factor and that they would be able to bring about a ceasefire.
“Most of the people in this flotilla, 80 per cent, were Europeans and non-Muslims,” Khan explained. When asked about why Europeans were so fervently campaigning for Palestine, the ex-senator explained that they are complicit in decades of oppression by a colonising force.
“On this flotilla, the Westerners decided that they would bring as many Jews on board as possible,” Khan said. “The goal was to show that Zionism is an enemy of humanity and exploits Judaism. The vast majority of Jews do not support Zionists.
“They would use the f-word when talking about Israel,” he added.
The ex-senator also hailed Swedish activist Greta Thunberg as a “hero of humanity” for standing up for the Palestinians.
“Greta … a young girl left the world shaken,” he added. “I will invite her to Pakistan.”
The senator also floated the idea of a new flotilla mission with participants from across the world, but under the leadership of international Islamic civil society members.
“We will make sure that we fly Pakistani flags from the boats,” he vowed. “If the peace plan fails, if a humanitarian corridor is not opened, if the genocide is not stopped and if the culprits of this genocide are not brought to justice, then we will launch our own flotilla ourselves.
Behind bars at Ktzi’ot Prison
Programme host Hamid Mir pointed out the ex-senator’s loss of weight, to which he replied that it was due to a mix of the journey through the Mediterranean and a three-day hunger strike in jail.
“It was a 20-day journey through the Mediterranean to Ashdod Port. We would eat once every 24 hours during the trip, and only ate salan (curry) twice,” Khan said. “There was bread and dates, that was all the food we ate.
“In the Israeli jail, we staged a three-day hunger strike. That contributed to my weight loss,” he added, calling the jail a “concentration camp” with a “torture cell”.
When asked about his faith in accomplishing the mission, Khan said he did not believe it, but was hopeful that “God would provide a path”. The ex-senator added that he had “exposed Israel’s genocidal face to the world” during the mission.
“Malaysia sent the biggest delegation on the flotilla,” the ex-senator said, extending gratitude to Kuala Lumpur for its support. “I went straight to Tunis from Kuala Lumpur; I could not come back to Pakistan because I had several cases against me. I was afraid I’d be stopped at the airport (in Pakistan).”
Khan said that he was part of the Palestine Action Coalition and was representing the Pak-Palestine Forum.
When asked about the raid, Khan said that the participants had been given standard operating procedures in case of boarding or an Israeli attack.
“When we left Crete, we knew that we were in danger of a drone attack,” he explained. He added that there were 50 boats in the flotilla when they left Crete.
“This was a journey of four days and nights, so we expected interception and drone attacks. We were instructed to throw our phones and belongings into the sea so that the Israelis couldn’t get them,” the ex-senator said.
“When I saw the Israeli navy ships up close, they were paper tigers,” he said. “Their entire navy responded and it took them 12 hours to intercept us all.
“My boat, the ‘Allakatalla’ … was the second-last to be intercepted. The last boat was 28 kilometres [from Gaza] when it was intercepted,” he said. “One of the [Israeli] ships was bigger than this building and sailing behind a 12-metre boat; the wake it was creating nearly caused up to capsize.”
He added that when the boat was boarded by Israeli commandos, the participants had been ordered to remain nonviolent and not resist at all. Khan said the Israelis shone bright lights at the flotilla and a team of 12 S-13 commandos boarded the vessel.
“When they were jumping onto our boat, two of them fell over so badly that we were afraid that they would shoot us because they were scared,” Khan remarked. “Their training was awful, no professionalism. If we had 100 boats and we were not exhausted by the trip, they could not have intercepted us.
“The only thing they (the Israeli military) can do is kill babies; they are unable to deal with any resistance.”
Recalling his time in Israeli jail, the ex-senator said that Israeli officials expressed disdain for Palestine and ripped the Palestinian flag hoisted on the boat. He added that they forcefully removed the Pakistani flag.
“We were ordered not to make eye contact with them (the Israelis). I quietly lifted the flag and put it inside the boat,” he recalled. “We were given instructions like ’hands up, lie face down on the ground. They would kick anyone for the smallest thing.
“They assigned two army personnel to each of us. When they asked me where I’m from, I replied that I’m from Pakistan, to which they hurled abuse at me. They were provoking me so that I’d hit them and give them an excuse,” Khan added.
“They kept probing us throughout and went through our documents before putting us in a bus to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev Desert, which is infamous for its brutality. We could not see anything from inside the van; there were walls all around.”
When asked about what happened in the prison, Khan said that they were forced to remove their clothes and wear “jail clothes”. He added that they were led to their cells “like detainees at Guantanamo Bay”.
“There were two big cell blocks; 10 rooms on either side in one of the blocks, with a 30-foot walkway in between,” the ex-senator described. “We were locked in cell number 911. We were called ‘troublemakers’; suddenly, people with guns and dogs entered our cells and forced us into a corner.
“They then bound our hands and feet and blindfolded us, before taking us to isolation and then putting us in an open cage outdoors. Our hands were so tightly bound that we could not feel them after two hours. We were not allowed to offer our Maghrib prayers by the guards. We prayed anyway without wudu or prostration.”
When asked about his cellmates, he replied that one was an American policeman, a Swiss senator and people from Europe. There were also two Tunisians and two Egyptians.
The former senator arrived in Islamabad from Jordan earlier today wearing a keffiyeh and was accorded a hero’s welcome, with people showering him with petals and adorning garlands on the former lawmaker.
 
  @dawn.today Former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan landed in Islamabad to cheers and applause on Thursday. Khan was part of the Global Sumud Flotilla's mission to Gaza to distribute humanitarian aid. His vessel was intercepted in the late hours of October 1 and he was taken in captivity along with other participants of the GSF. After a week of Israeli captivity, former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was released and transported to Amman, Jordan, on the second anniversary of Israel’s genocide in Gaza. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com   

The Pakistan embassy in Jordan, where he was deported to earlier, said late on Wednesday that Khan, who was detained by Israel last week after it intercepted a flotilla of boats carrying aid for Gaza, had safely departed for Pakistan.
In a post on social media platform X, the embassy said the former senator had safely departed for Pakistan.
“In accordance with the instructions of the honourable deputy prime minister of Pakistan, the embassy of Pakistan in Amman ensured all necessary arrangements were made for his safe and smooth departure,” it said.
 






The X account for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reposted the embassy’s post.
Earlier on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Jordan Ayman Safadi.
According to the foreign ministry, Dar appreciated Jordan’s role in receiving the flotilla’s released detainees and facilitating their return home.
“He also thanked Jordan for its assistance in enabling the return of former senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan to Amman,” it said, adding that Khan was scheduled to reach Pakistan today.
On Tuesday, Dar had stated that Khan had been released and was safely with the embassy in Amman. He also said that he had spoken to the ex-senator on arrival in Islamabad from Malaysia.
“Senator Mushtaq is fine and in high spirits. I lauded the courage and steadfastness of senator Mushtaq for being part of the Sumud Flotilla in support of the Palestinian cause, to break the siege to deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza,“ he said.
“Senator Mushtaq thanked for the efforts made by the Pakistan Foreign Office in reaching out to him in Tel Aviv, Israel through a friendly European country’s mission there and for the full support and facilitation for his stay and safety in Amman by Pakistan embassy,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, the former senator had also posted a video on his X account on Tuesday in which he stated that the fight against the Israeli blockade was not over.
“I have reached Jordan along with 150 of my companions,” he said, adding that he had finally been released from Israeli detention.
“During this time, our hands were cuffed behind our backs, our feet were shackled and chained, we were blindfolded, dogs were set upon us, guns were pointed at us, and we were tortured in the worst way,” he said.
He said that the activists went on a hunger strike for three days, adding that they were denied access to air, drinking water, medication, and were not allowed to lie down.
“We have been freed,” he said. “And the fight for Palestinian freedom will continue. We will break this blockade. We will go again and again. We will make efforts to save Gaza, and those who are complicit in this genocide — those criminals will be punished,” he asserted.
He emphasised that the fight would continue “from Adiala jail to Israeli jails”, promising that he would return to Pakistan soon and provide a detailed account of his time on the flotilla as well as in Israeli detention.

In August, Imran had said the party should not go into by-elections triggered by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) disqualifying a large number of PTI members and leaders in relation to their involvement in the May 9, 2023, riots and that its lawmakers should leave all parliamentary standing committees, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
PTI lawmakers subsequently began resigning from the membership of parliamentary committees and also Senate standing committees. Whether Punjab lawmakers would do so was not decided at the time.
However, speaking to the media today outside Adiala Jail after meeting Imran, Barrister Gohar said: “Khan has issued a direction regarding Punjab. We have 107 MPAs in Punjab and we have around 14 standing committees. Khan has also issued the directive for Punjab that our party members will resign from the memberships and chairmanships of standing committees, the way we have in the National Assembly and Senate.”
Questioned about speculation of him being removed as the party chairman a day after Ali Amin Gandapur was told to step down as the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, Gohar rubbished the entire matter as “just rumours” and said the party was stable with no issue over the chairmanship.
“There is no issue of my chairmanship.’’
On developments about the KP chief minister’s position, Gohar said Imran praised Gandapur as ’’one of my few loyal allies“ and that he was a strong party member but the PTI founder had a strong stance regarding terrorism that any operation against it without a political strategy would fail.
“Whatever operation you carry out, any collateral damage in it further radicalises people. That is why, Khan said that our party, government and province cannot afford this so we were wanting some drasitc change.”
He said Imran wished for the transition in the KP government to be completed as quickly as possible, adding that the cabinet would continue but the party founder would finalise the names once the new government was formed.</p><small>2025-10-09 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627785-pm-shehbazs-general-assembly-speech-most-viewed-among-world-leaders-on-uns-youtube' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz's General Assembly speech most viewed among world leaders on UN's YouTube</strong></a><br><p>
