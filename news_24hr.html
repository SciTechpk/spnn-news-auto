According to rescue officials, the incident occurred at around 2:15am early on Wednesday.
Chakwal Rescue 1122 spokesperson Qazi Muhammad Akram said the passenger was on its way from Rawalpindi to Bahawalpur.
As the motorway was closed due to fog, the driver opted for an alternative route and used the Talagang-Fatehjang Road, he said.
When the bus was passing by Dhoke Pathan village located at the bank of Sowaan River, the driver lost control on a winding patch of the road, the Rescue 1122 spokesperson said.
As a result, the bus plunged into a 100-foot-deep ravine, he said. Five passengers, including the bus driver, died at the spot, while 24 others sustained injuries, he said.
He said that Rescue 1122 officials rushed to the scene after the incident was reported. He added that 15 officials and five emergency vehicles took part in the rescue operation which lasted for more than two hours.
Four of the deceased were identified as 56-year-old Abdul Sattar, the driver of the vehicle; 40-year-old Zia Ahmedn from Kotli Sattiyan; 33-year-old Mohammad Ishaq from Lodhran; and 45-year-old Ramzan from Multan. The body of the fifth person has not yet been identified..
“We have taken the dead bodies to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Talagang while all the injured were taken to City Hospital Talagang,” District Rescue Officer Dr Mohammad Atique told Dawn.
He added that all the injured passengers were being examined at the hospital.
Meanwhile, Talagang Assistant Commissioner Suleman Mansha and Deputy Superintendent of Police Malik Azi visited the injured at City Hospital.
AC Mansha directed the hospital management to leave no stone unturned in treating the injured.</p><small>2026-01-07 06:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/07112738f2681fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965619/bethell-stands-tall-as-england-174-3-in-final-test-nine-behind' target='_blank'><strong>Bethell stands tall as England 174-3 in final Test, nine behind</strong></a><br><p>Rock-solid Jacob Bethell was 79 not out as England narrowed Australia’s lead to just nine runs by tea on day four of the fifth and final Ashes Test on Wednesday, but veteran Joe Root fell cheaply.
The tourists battled to 174-3 by the break at the Sydney Cricket Ground with Harry Brook on 24 alongside the 22-year-old, who is targeting a maiden century.
Australia were dismissed for 567 before lunch on the back of Travis Head’s 163 and 138 from skipper Steve Smith.
That left England chasing a 183-run deficit after their first innings 384, with a question mark over Ben Stokes’s ability to bat.
The England captain limped off clutching what appeared to be his groin while bowling the third over of the day and did not reappear.
Mitchell Starc removed Zak Crawley for one as England reached lunch at 80-1, then Ben Duckett (42) and first innings century-maker Root (6) departed during the second session.
Australia lead the series 3-1 and have already retained the Ashes, with England desperate for another morale-boosting win after victory in the previous Test at Melbourne.
They needed a solid start to the chase, but chief tormentor Starc once again conjured up a first-over breakthrough – his 29th wicket for the series.
The pace spearhead delivered a beautiful inswinger that Crawley misjudged and left, with the ball smacking his pads and he was out lbw for one.
Duckett and Bethell survived until lunch, though Duckett lived dangerously, dropped on 38 by Cameron Green diving in front of Smith at first slip.
The Nottinghamshire opener failed to capitalise and was gone in the third over after the interval, chopping on Michael Neser for 42, his highest score in a wretched series.
Root, fresh from his first innings 160, was terrorised by Starc and Neser.
He finally fell lbw after 37 facing balls for his six runs to the relentless Scott Boland, with the 35-year-old trudging off dejected.
But Bethell proved unmovable and brought up a fourth Test half-century with a boundary from Starc as he looks to make the number three slot his own.







Australia resumed at 518-7, with Smith on 129 after his 13th Ashes century — more than any other player except the legendary Don Bradman — and Beau Webster on 42.
Smith flogged Stokes through the covers for a boundary in his first over, while Webster dished out similar treatment to Brydon Carse.
But the Australia skipper did not last long, nicking a fuller length delivery from Josh Tongue to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.
All-rounder Webster reached a fifth half-century in his eighth Test with a single and put on 20 with Starc before the big paceman was bowled by Tongue for five.
Scott Boland suffered a golden duck, edging Will Jacks to Harry Brook in the slips to leave Webster unbeaten on 71.
Tongue ended with 3-97 and Carse 3-130.</p><small>2026-01-07 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/070727365866baf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965604/trump-says-venezuela-turning-over-up-to-50m-barrels-of-oil-to-us' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Venezuela ‘turning over’ up to 50m barrels of oil to US</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that Venezuela’s interim government will deliver up to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States, and that the proceeds “will be controlled by me” as president.
The development is a strong sign that the Venezuelan government is responding to Trump’s demand that they open up to US oil companies or risk more military intervention.
Trump has said he wants interim President Delcy Rodriguez to give the US and private companies “total access” to Venezuela’s oil industry.
Venezuela has millions of barrels of oil loaded on tankers and in storage tanks that it has been unable to ship due to a blockade on exports imposed by Trump since mid-December.
The blockade was part of rising US pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that culminated in US forces launching a “large-scale strike” in the country and kidnapping him this weekend.
Top Venezuelan officials have accused the US of trying to steal the country’s vast oil reserves.
Venezuela will be “turning over” between 30 and 50 million barrels of “sanctioned oil” to the US, Trump said in a social media post.







“This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!” he added.
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright is in charge of executing the deal, Trump said, adding that the oil will be taken from ships and sent directly to US ports.

 

Supplying the trapped crude to the US could initially require reallocating cargoes originally bound for China, two sources had told Reuters earlier on Tuesday.
The Asian country has been Venezuela’s top buyer in the last decade and especially since the United States imposed sanctions on companies involved in oil trade with Venezuela in 2020.
“Trump wants this to happen early so he can say it is a big win,” an oil industry source said.
Venezuelan government officials and Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the government and state oil company***,*** did not provide comment.
Chevron in control of Venezuelan oil flows to US
US crude prices fell more than 1.5 per cent after Trump’s announcement, with the agreement expected to increase the volume of Venezuelan oil exported to the US.
That flow of oil is currently controlled entirely by Chevron , PDVSA’s main joint venture partner, under a US authorisation.
Chevron, which has been exporting between 100,000 and 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan oil to the US, is the only company that has been loading and shipping crude without interruption from the South American country in recent weeks under the blockade.
It was not immediately clear if Venezuela would have any access to proceeds from the supply. Sanctions mean PDVSA is excluded from the global financial system, its bank accounts are frozen and it is blocked from executing transactions in US dollars.
Venezuela has been selling its flagship crude grade, Merey, at around $22 per barrel below Brent for delivery at Venezuelan ports, giving a value for the deal at up to $1.9 billion.
Rodriguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday, is herself under US sanctions imposed in 2018 for undermining democracy.
Talks involve possible auctions with US buyers
Venezuelan and US officials this week discussed possible sales mechanisms, including auctions to allow interested US buyers to bid for cargoes, and issuing US licences to PDVSA’s business partners that could lead to supply contracts, two sources told Reuters.
Those licences have in the past allowed PDVSA’s joint venture partners and customers, including Chevron, India’s Reliance, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and European Eni and Repsol, to have access to Venezuelan oil to refine or to resell to third parties.
This week, some of those companies have begun making preparations for receiving Venezuelan cargoes again, two separate sources said.
The US and Venezuela have also discussed if Venezuelan oil can be used in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the future, one of the sources said. Trump did not refer to this possibility.
Increased oil flows would be ‘great news’
US Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said on Tuesday that an increased flow of Venezuelan heavy oil to the US Gulf would be “great news” for job security, future gasoline prices in the US and for Venezuela.
“Venezuela has an opportunity now to actually have capital come in and rebuild their economy and take advantage,” he told Fox News, when asked about talks between the governments on oil exports.
“With American technology, American partnership, Venezuela can be transformed.”
US refineries on the Gulf Coast can process Venezuela’s heavy crude grades and were importing some 500,000bpd before Washington first imposed energy sanctions on Venezuela.
PDVSA has already had to cut production due to the embargo, because it is running out of storage for the oil. Without a way to export oil soon, it would have to cut production more, one of the sources said.
Oil traders reacted to news of the deal talks on Tuesday. Differentials for some heavy oil grades in the US Gulf slipped around 50 cents per barrel on Tuesday on the prospect of more Venezuelan supplies.</p><small>2026-01-07 06:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695d81cf3b1b9.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965599/trumpian-imperialism' target='_blank'><strong>Trumpian imperialism</strong></a><br><p>THE image of a blindfolded and handcuffed Nicolás Maduro being taken to a prison in New York presented the ugly face of Trumpian imperialism. It is not the first time that the US, in pursuit of regime change, has invaded a sovereign state, but the abduction of the Venezuelan president and his wife is the most brazen instance of imperialistic aggression in recent history.
The military action against Venezuela has exposed President Donald Trump, who has, ironically, attempted to present himself as a ‘man of peace’ in his quest for the Nobel Peace Prize. It is a violation of international law and demonstrates the unravelling of an already collapsing global order or whatever is left of it.
Trump has made it clear that America will continue to control the oil-rich country and its resources. “We are going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil,” Trump said, asserting America’s ‘right’ to the country’s oil.
After Maduro’s removal by force, the American president called a meeting of top American companies to discuss the takeover of Venezuela’s oil fields. It is apparent that America’s blatant action in Venezuela had nothing to do with sending drugs and criminals to America, as Trump claimed, but rather to capture oil and rich resources.

The US president has pushed the world into extremely dangerous territory.

The American military action is hardly a surprise. Trump had increased pressure on Venezuela for the past several months. American air force jets had been bombing alleged drug boats, and killed over 100 people, without providing much evidence to substantiate their claims, in a blatant violation of international law. American forces also intercepted tankers carrying oil from Venezuela. The Trump administration has declared that Maduro was overseeing a “narco-terrorist” organisation. The January invasion was very well planned.
Maduro has also been accused by the Trump administration of “Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States”. These charges do not justify the invasion and abduction of a head of state. They are just a cover-up for America’s unlawful military action.

 

Many analysts believe that even Trump is not serious about the drug charge. For instance, media reports have pointed out that other individuals similarly charged with drug trafficking have received a pardon — among them a Honduran former president extradited to the US.
America has frequently attempted regime change in South American countries to protect its oil and other companies and prevent the governments of these states from adopting an independent foreign policy trajectory. In fact, American administrations had tried to remove the left-leaning nationalist administrations of Hugo Chávez and his successor Nicolás Maduro for years, but they failed.
The US first imposed sanctions against Vene­zuela during the era of Hugo Chávez. Following the Venezuelan president’s death in 2013, the administration of Barack Obama declared Vene­zuela a “national security threat” and imposed sanctions on certain Venezuelan officials for corruption and rights violations. President Trump’s first administration also imposed sanctions, blocking Venezuela’s oil exports. Sanctions and other factors have crippled the country’s economy and the growing unrest there has seen America capitalising on the situation to attempt regime change. President Joe Biden, for instance, had earlier called an opposition leader the “true winner” of a disputed presidential poll.
The latest development in the Venezuela-US timeline is the use of brute force by the Trump administration, which clearly believes that the US is not subject to any international law and has extraordinary powers to raid a country in the dead of night and kidnap its leader, without facing any censure, let alone consequences. Shortly after the operation, Trump stated at a press conference, “We are reasserting American power.”
What is truly disgusting is the criminal silence and in some cases, the tacit support by some countries for America’s military intervention in Vene­zuela. The European countries, while calling for international law and the UN Charter to be up­­held, has also said that Maduro lacked “the legitimacy of a democratically elected president”.
Trump has threatened Colombia and Cuba with similar action. “America can project our will anywhere, any time,” declared defence chief Pete Hegseth with the imperialistic arrogance that has become the hallmark of the Trump administration. The maverick American president appears emboldened by his military success. Soon after raiding Venezuela, Trump, when asked whether the US would conduct an operation against Colombia, said that it “sounds good to me”. He also declared that Cuba was not worth invading because “it’s ready to fall”.
Trump believes the US has the right to intervene in any country in the Western Hemisphere and has referred to the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, according to which the Americas were off limits to the European powers, as the ‘Donroe doctrine’ in a reference to himself. What he forgets is that the world has changed and such brazen use of force will have serious consequences for America and world peace.
Trump’s imperialistic ambitions go even further. He has once again claimed that Greenland needed to be under American control. He has appointed a special US envoy for Greenland, ignoring the Danish government’s protest. In the past, he has threatened to annex Canada as the 51st state of America. Besides, he has once again threatened to militarily intervene in Iran to ‘protect’ anti-government protesters. Last year, the US had joined Israel in bombing Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Washington has encouraged Israel’s continued aggression in Gaza in violation of the ceasefire. Unfortunately, Pakistan and the Arab countries have closed their eyes to Trump’s imperialist designs. Pakistan must review its commitment to joining the international peace force in Gaza led by Trump. It’s a trap to crush the Palestinian resistance.
Trump has pushed the world into extremely dangerous territory. He appears to have forgotten the lessons of Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. Ame­­rica will regret its latest imperialist aggression.

Trump sees acquiring Greenland as a US national security priority necessary to “deter our adversaries in the Arctic region”, the White House said in a statement.
“The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilising the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” the White House said.
Greenland has repeatedly said it does not want to be part of the United States. Leaders from major European powers and Canada rallied behind the Arctic territory on Tuesday, saying it belongs to its people.

 

A US military seizure of Greenland from a longtime ally, Denmark, would send shock waves through the Nato alliance and deepen the divide between Trump and European leaders.
The strong opposition has not deterred Trump from reviewing how to make Greenland a US hub in an area where there is growing interest from Russia and China. Trump’s interest, initially voiced in 2019 during his first term in office, has been rekindled in recent days in the wake of the US arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Emboldened by Maduro’s capture last weekend, Trump has voiced his belief that American dominance in the Western Hemisphere will never be questioned again, and has put pressure on both Colombia and Cuba.
He has also started talking about Greenland again after putting it on the back burner for months.
A senior US official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Trump and his advisers are discussing a variety of ways to acquire Greenland.
Is Greenland for sale?
Those options include the outright US purchase of Greenland or forming a Compact of Free Association with the territory, the official said. A COFA agreement would stop short of Trump’s ambition to make the island of 57,000 people a part of the United States.
The official did not provide a potential purchase price.
“Diplomacy is always the presidents first option with anything, and dealmaking. He loves deals. So if a good deal can be struck to acquire Greenland, that would definitely be his first instinct,” the official said.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers that recent administration threats against Greenland did not signal an imminent invasion and that the goal is to buy the island from Denmark during a classified briefing late on Monday for congressional leaders, two sources familiar with the briefing said.
The Wall Street Journal first reported Rubio’s comment.
Members of Congress, including some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, pushed back against the administration’s comments on Greenland, noting that Nato member Denmark has been a loyal US ally.
“When Denmark and Greenland make it clear that Greenland is not for sale, the United States must honor its treaty obligations and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, the co-chairs of the Senate Nato Observer Group, said in a statement.
Administration officials say the island is crucial to the US due to its deposits of minerals important for high-tech and military applications. These resources remain untapped due to labor shortages, scarce infrastructure and other challenges.
Its not going away, the official said about the president’s drive to acquire Greenland during his remaining three years in office.</p><small>2026-01-07 05:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/695d819698fa6.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965598/oosay-who' target='_blank'><strong>OOSAY who?</strong></a><br><p>DESPITE their scale, out-of-school adolescents and youth (OOSAY) are the most overlooked demographic, remaining largely invisible in policy discourse and programmatic prioritisation. Census 2023 data shows that a whopping 63 per cent of Pakistan’s youth population and 23pc of adolescent population have never received any formal education. Gender disparities are stark, with nearly three-quarters of women aged 15-29 having never enrolled in school, compared to about one-half of men.
These figures reflect more than just statistical gaps; they capture the lived realities of a majority of young people who experience early and sustained exclusion from proper education, leading to marginalisation on multiple fronts, including alternative learning opportunities, decent employment, health access and civic engagement.
Their concentration in the informal economy limits the availability of timely and reliable data, constraining evidence-based, targeted responses to support their reintegration. Moreover, policy frameworks routinely collapse OOSAY into broader youth categories, assuming exposure to formal schooling that many never had. This effectively renders them excluded from the very support intended for them.
SDPI, in collaboration with UNFPA conducted a mixed-methods ‘needs assessment’ of OOSAY across KP and Punjab. The aim was to understand the kind of support OOSAY themselves say they need to support their reintegration across four key domains: education, employment, health, and engagement.

Out-of-school adolescents and youth should be recognised as a distinct demographic.

Results from the study show that across both provinces, financial barriers are the most binding in hindering school access, impacting nearly three out of four respondents. These are compounded by responsibilities at home or work, gender norms, unavailability of schools, long commutes, lack of transportation, risk of harassment, and early marriage, all of them particularly restrictive for girls.
The impacts of being out-of-school are largely gendered, with boys often forced into early, low-skill, physically strenuous labour. In the sample, nearly two-thirds of male OOSAY said they felt pressured to economically support themselves and their families, leading to child labour. On the other hand, girls are expected to shoulder the burden of household responsibilities and unpaid care work. Findings show that 85.4pc of female OOSAY spend their day performing domestic chores and unpaid caregiving activities, limiting their availability for schooling, skills training, or paid work. Many girls are also forced into early marriage. In our sample, the median age of marriage for female OOSAY was 18 years, indicating that nearly half had been married at or below the minimum legal age of marriage.
The consequences of exclusion from education spill into the labour market, with nearly three-quarters of OOSAY lacking access to paid work, including an overwhelming 95pc of female respondents. Job opportunities are extremely limited, informal, and unstable, with nearly half of working respondents earning less than Rs25,000 per month despite working 12-15-hour-long shifts. This is even below the minimum wage rate.
Forty-two per cent of working OOSAY rely on daily wages with no job security, stability, or benefits. Workplaces lack safety, supervision, or opportunities to sustainably teach technical skills that these young people can harness in the long run.
These vulnerabilities are magnified due to a lack of access to alternative learning opportunities. In the sample, more than 90pc of the respondents reported that they have never enrolled in any skills development or vocational training programme. Only about 12.6pc (mostly males) pursued informal apprenticeships, and around 15pc (mostly females) relied on home-based learning.
Health outcomes further reflect this structural neglect. Many OOSAY suffer from malnutrition, chronic body pains, and mental health issues, but are unable to access healthcare due to unaffordability, mobility barriers, and low awareness. Nearly three-fourths rely on public hospitals because of cost considerations, with many often resorting to self-medication and home-based remedies. Two out of five respondents show signs of mental distress, but only 7.2pc recognise a need for counselling due to stigma. Mental health services are extremely scarce, with only 6.1pc reporting availability in their chosen health facility. Moreover, 82.5pc of married OOSAY have never accessed sexual and reproductive health services due to stigma or unavailability of services.

 

It is also important to note that being out-of-school is an intergenerational phenomenon: young people without education often end up in low-paid jobs and cannot afford schooling for their own children, perpetuating a cycle of illiteracy, unstable employment, and poverty. Hence, government attention is needed to address the issue. While several existing policies target out-of-school children, their focus remains largely on re-enrolment within the school-going age bracket, overlooking the fact that many have already aged out of the system and require alternative forms of support.
Going forward, there is a need for policymakers to recognise OOSAY as a distinct demographic that requires targeted support beyond re-enrolment efforts. This requires a coordinated national and provincial strategy with clear mandates, dedicated budgets, and integrated data systems, alongside stronger enforcement of labour laws, reforms in child labour laws, and targeted poverty reduction measures.
These policy interventions must be complemented by programmatic support in the form of inclusive education planning, flexible and phased bridging and skills development pathways aligned with market demand, formalised apprenticeships, and employment or entrepreneurial support channelled through district-level youth centres. There is also a need to adopt gender-responsive models that prioritise girls’ access through safe spaces, mobility support, and community engagement. Failure to act will continue to lock millions into cycles of low productivity, poor health, and economic precarity, putting the country’s demographic dividend at risk.

The University of Lahore constituted a ‘high-level’ inquiry committee comprising senior faculty members and the management officers hours after a D. Pharmacy student attempted suicide by jumping from the second floor of the varsity building on Monday.
Fatima (21) was rushed to a local hospital with her both legs fractured badly and injuries to her other body parts. The police inquiries so far suggested that she took the extreme step following the pressure of her family to continue her studies in D. Pharmacy while she found it a tough subject. There were also reports that the student and her family had an heated argument on the same issue on Saturday last when she again raised the matter.
According to police officials, the student’s family has so far not submitted any application seeking legal action. Her statement could not be recorded due to the severity of her injuries.

Investigators record statements of family

Police said the student sustained serious injuries to her spine and lungs after jumping from the university building. All required medical tests have been repeated and investigators have also received information from her family.
Police have taken custody of CCTV footage from all cameras installed inside and around the university to establish the full sequence of events, which is currently being reviewed.
Police sources said action would be taken against the university administration if any negligence or lapse is established during the investigation.
Investigators said the student remained on a phone call for 27 minutes before jumping and had deleted the record of her last call.
Initial findings suggested that she arrived at the university in the morning but did not attend her class. She was reportedly upset after receiving 18 marks out of 35 in a test, a matter she had also discussed with her father and brother.
Police said further progress in the case would be made after recording the student’s statement.
Meanwhile, the injured student remains under treatment at Lahore General Hospital (LGH). The hospital administration confirmed that she has suffered a head injury and fractures to her back and knee.

 

On Tuesday, Higher Education Department (HED) Secretary Ghulam Farid Kathia visited LGH and inquired after the student. Medical Superintendent Dr Faryad Hussain briefed him on her medical condition.
During a media briefing, Ameeruddin Medical College Principal Prof Farooq Afzal said the student’s condition has improved but the next 48 hours are critical.A special medical board, headed by Prof Jodat Saleem, has been formed comprising specialists from neurosurgery, surgery, orthopaedics, pulmonology and gynaecology.
Prof Jodat Saleem said the patient was in shock on arrival and had lost significant blood. Doctors administered two units of blood and successfully stabilised her condition.
He said the patient’s response to treatment has improved and medical care is continuing.

Acting on intelligence gathered over several weeks, counter-terrorism officials intercepted a truck loaded with 2,000kg of explosive material, along with detonators, cylinders and other components. Three suspects are now in custody.
Had the device reached its destination, the consequences could have been catastrophic. The details show that this was not a hasty or improvised plot. The suspects had rented a property on the outskirts of the city, kept their activities hidden, and transported explosive material over nearly 1,000km. According to investigators, the explosives were sourced from across the Afghan border, moved into Balochistan and then brought onwards to Karachi. The alleged involvement of the banned BLA shows how determined terrorist outfits remain and how they see urban centres as high-impact targets.
Karachi was clearly chosen for its symbolic and practical value. As Pakistan’s economic and commercial centre, an attack here would have caused fear far beyond the blast site. It would have disrupted business activity, shaken investor confidence and deepened public anxiety at a time when the country can least afford further instability. Preventing the attack before the explosives could be deployed underlines the importance of intelligence-led operations that focus on stopping violence before it occurs.

 

The case also reinforces the importance of coordination between security and intelligence bodies. According to the DG ISPR, the Karachi plot came to light because multiple agencies shared and combined information. This kind of cooperation is essential when terrorist networks operate quietly across regions and use long supply routes that are difficult to trace.
The claim that explosive material was transported from across the Afghan border adds to long-standing concerns about terrorists exploiting external space to plan and supply attacks. While such assertions must always be examined carefully, this case shows why Pakistan should continue raising the issue diplomatically, while strengthening its own defences.
At the same time, the incident exposes weaknesses. The alleged use of fertilisers and chemicals, and the ease of renting property without triggering suspicion, point to gaps in enforcement. Better control of explosive materials, stricter checks on rental housing, and closer monitoring of supply chains are basic but necessary steps. Preventing future plots will depend on staying alert, showing political resolve and enforcing the rules consistently, rather than celebrating isolated successes and moving on.
One truck has been stopped, and countless lives saved. The harder task now is to dismantle the networks, routes and enablers that made such a plot possible in the first place.

However, after submitting written assurances of compliance with standard operating procedures (SOPs) to the district administration, shopkeepers are hoping their businesses will reopen soon.
Akbar Road, commonly known as Akbar Market, is one of the largest hubs for buying and selling motorcycles in the metropolis. On a normal day, the road remains jam-packed due to motorcycles being displayed by shopkeepers along both sides of the road and footpaths, making it difficult for commuters and residents of adjacent areas to move freely.
Residents of the adjacent locality said that every year, during anti-encroachment drives, the district administration seizes motorcycles and stalls set up on roads and footpaths, after which traffic can move freely. However, they added that this situation rarely lasts even a week, as encroachments soon reappear.

Shopkeepers say they have paid Rs5,000 each in fines, file affidavits pledging compliance with SOPs

During a visit to the market on Tuesday, Dawn observed that the scene was markedly different; shops on both sides of the road were sealed, and employees and shop owners were seen sitting outside their closed shops, waiting to reopen after submitting affidavits to the district commissioner’s office, South.
‘Significant financial losses’
Karachi Motorcycle Dealer Association Chairman Muhammad Ahsan Gujjar told Dawn that on Jan 3, the district administration had sealed at least 95 shops over encroachment as they were displaying bikes on the road and footpath.
He added that he had spoken to the assistant commissioner South, who assured him that after submitting affidavits pledging not to violate SOPs in the future, the shops would be reopened and de-sealed soon.
Referring to the losses being suffered by traders due to the sealing of shops, Mr Gujjar said that daily between 1,500 and 2,000 new motorcycles are sold in the market. He added that this activity used to generate millions of rupees for the government in the form of sales tax, registration fees and transfer fees.
“Today is the fourth day since the shops were sealed, and an estimated loss of millions of rupees is being incurred,” he claimed.
While responding to a query on whether the district administration had informed shopkeepers in advance about the encroachment drive, the market association president, Aqeel Sheikh, said that shopkeepers had been informed earlier, and motorcycles were removed from the roads. However, he claimed that the Jan 3 operation was carried out without prior notice from the authorities.
He alleged that car denters and painters blocked the streets surrounding the Preedy police station, while pickups at Regal Chowk were also obstructing traffic, yet no action was being taken against them.
He added that Akbar Road is a major market where traders, who are taxpayers, generate millions of rupees in revenue, but it was they who were being “subjected to injustice”.
A traffic police official at the Preedy police station said that a single-lane parking is allowed and that vehicles parked in no-parking zones or double lanes are fined.
Responding to a question about whether the display of motorcycles blocking Akbar Road constituted a traffic violation, the officer said that shopkeepers usually park bikes for display on footpaths and roads as well, which falls under the jurisdiction of the anti-encroachment department.
However, he added that if the authorities do not take action and traffic flow is affected, the traffic police intervene, particularly in cases of double-lane parking.
This correspondent witnessed business as usual in the adjacent streets of Akbar Road as workshops, mechanics and spare parts shops for bikes remained open.
Meanwhile, another old market situated on Magazine Lane in the Saddar area, where used auto parts are sold, remained shut for the second day.
One shopkeeper claimed that the authorities sealed shops without considering whether they were involved in encroachments or not, adding that shopkeepers had already submitted affidavits to the authorities.
However, following the anti-encroachment drive, it has been observed that shops which were not sealed in the electronics market near Regal Chowk, auto parts market and adjacent streets of Akbar Road — which come within the remit of the Saddar area — are complying with SOPs, and footpaths are now free of encroachments.
On Tuesday evening, a market official said that all shopkeepers had paid Rs5,000 each in fines and that business activities would resume from Wednesday (today).
Deputy Commissioner South Javed Nabi Khoso also confirmed this and said that the sealed shops would open on Wednesday.

In a video posted by Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on the social media platform X, Imran’s sister Aleema said that Mahmood Khan Achakzai had informed them that a meeting would be arranged next week.
Achakzai is the head of the TTAP opposition alliance and chairman of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party.
“This is what he reassured us about, that a meeting will be arranged next week,” Aleema said, as she looked at Achakzai, who was standing next to her along with Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir.
Achakzai and Nasir had arrived at the site of the protest earlier on Tuesday.







“Achakzai sahib has said that because they are saying a meeting will be arranged next week, today we should disperse ourselves before the water cannons show up. That is his advice,” she said.
Recently, protests staged by the PTI and Imran’s sisters have been dispersed by authorities with water cannons, which the party has alleged were filled with chemical-laced water.
In another video, she said they were grateful for both Achakzai and Nasir, adding that their presence gave a lot of strength to the protesters.
However, she warned that the protesters would not willingly disperse next week.
“Next week, we will not move,” she said with a smile as people laughed around her. “If they do not allow a meeting, we will not move,” she asserted, calling on people to join their demonstration.







She said that her sisters had first refused to end the sit-in. However, they had decided to do so in respect of Achakzai and Nasir.







For his part, Achakzai said in a video posted by the PTI that the denial of a meeting with Imran was in contradiction of all international laws.
He said that he had spoken to a station house officer (SHO) who had assured him that he would try to arrange a meeting.







He further said that at least 10,000 people should gather at next Tuesday’s protest.
“If people want that a meeting with Imran should be allowed, especially PTI protesters, if they want that his sisters are respected, [then] this is a test case for them. At least 10,000 people should be here next Tuesday,” he said.
“If you don’t come, then forget about everything,” he said.







On Tuesday, police had sprayed water at Factory Naka, where an anti-riot fence had been erected to prevent PTI leaders and supporters from moving forward. However, after waiting for the water to dry, the protesters had staged a sit-in at the site.
The PTI leadership has provided a list of lawyers approved to meet Imran Khan in accordance with the Islamabad High Court’s order.
The approved lawyers included Gohar Ali Khan, Salman Akram Raja, Ali Zaman, Waqas Raza Khan, Malik Faraz, and Sophia Noreen. A letter written by Salman Akram Raja was sent to the superintendent of Central Jail Adiala, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum.
It should be mentioned that Parlia­mentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said last month that meetings with Imran would remain suspended till Feb 8.</p><small>2026-01-07 03:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0708133498c5785.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965551/did-india-lobby-with-trump-over-pakistan-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Did India lobby with Trump over Pakistan conflict?</strong></a><br><p>• The Hindu report says lobbying firm headed by former Trump aide Jason Miller led engagement with US officials on New Delhi’s behalf• Former diplomats say use of lobbyists is normal, but important meetings are usually set up directly by diplomats
NEW DELHI: Although the government of Narendra Modi has persistently denied that the US played any role in mediating an end to the four-day India-Pakistan conflict following the Pahalgam incident, a report in The Hindu details how a lobbying firm engaged by New Delhi made hectic calls to approach US officials on May 10, and beyond.
According to a filing with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) — including 60 entries made in December 2025 — did not divulge whether the calls on May 10 were made before or after the ceasefire, “they indicate close interaction on the day”, The Hindu wrote.
It said the embassy approached White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Ricky Gill at the National Security Council to discuss “media coverage” of the conflict.
This seems to contradict New Delhi’s stance, which has repeatedly denied several claims by US President Donald Trump, as well as Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s decision to award Mr Gill for the role he played in defusing the crisis.
In particular, the External Affairs Ministry consistently denied Trump’s contention he had threatened to stop trade if the conflict was not ended, and the call made to Mr Greer to discuss Operation Sindoor is particularly significant, the paper said.
The filings by US lobby firm SHW LLC raised eyebrows amongst diplomats in New Delhi as the firm also claimed that it set up meetings for several Indian officials — from External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, to Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri, Deputy National Security Advisor Pavan Kapoor, and even Indian Ambassador Vinay Kwatra — with top Trump administration officials over the past year.
SHW LLC was contracted by the Indian Embassy on April 24, 2025. Dawn had previously reported on May 2 that former Trump aide Jason Miller’s firm had been engaged by New Delhi as a registered foreign agent for $150,000 per month.
It had no other clients over the year, according to the six FARA filings it made, and has been paid $900,000 in two quarterly instalments as part of an annual contract for $1.8 million.
The practice is a first, say former and current Indian officials, and indicates that rather than normal bilateral channels, the engagements — broadly over India-US trade ties and Operation Sindoor — were set up by the firm, led by former Trump spokesperson Miller, who is listed as the principal of SHW LLC.
While the embassy has always contracted two to three lobbyists at a time, to consult them on working with the Democrat and Republican parties, this is the first time a lobby firm has been asked to set up meetings with US officials, as also to schedule calls with government officials.
“Such meetings are routinely sought by the mission directly,” at least two Indian government officials told The Hindu.
“This seems to indicate that the Trump administration has set new rules of engagement and the government has been left with little choice but to play along,” a former diplomat, who had served at the Indian embassy previously, said.
“The Indian Embassy has hired such firms, consistent with local practice and requirements, under successive governments since the 1950s,” a spokesperson for the Indian embassy in Washington said.
About the lobbying firm, The Hindu quoted another official as saying that lobbyists are hired “for advice and to understand the landscape, giving advice, and opening some doors,” but that meetings and calls are made between diplomats directly.
Apart from the calls on May 10, 2025, the firm billed the Embassy for making requests for the Parli­ame­ntary delegation led by Oppo­sition leader Shashi Tharoor to meet US Vice-President J.D. Vance and others.
On June 23, 2025, days before Mr. Jaishankar’s visit to Washington to attend the Quad Foreign Ministers’ meeting, SHW says that it sent emails requesting meetings for the Minister with Mr. Vance, Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, and CIA chief John Ratcliffe.
Of 60 entries detailing requests from the Indian Embassy, 30 reco­rded by SHW were requests for telephone calls to trade officials and White House senior officials to “discuss [the] status of US-India trade conversations”.
The calls increased in frequency as relations nosedived over US decisions to impose 25pc reciprocal tariffs and another 25pc in penalty tariffs for India’s oil procurement.
As tensions abated after Trump and Modi exchanged cordial words over social media, SHW said it made calls to White House officials to “flag social media post by Prime Minister Modi”.
Trump subsequently called Modi for his birthday on September 17, 2025, and the two leaders have spoken several times since then.

The CTD had brought the three suspects before the administrative judge of the ATCs, at the Judicial Complex within the premises of Karachi central prison and sought their physical custody for further interrogation.
The court remanded the trio in CTD custody until Jan 24 and directed the investigating officer (IO) to produce them on the next date along with a progress report.
According to the CTD, acting on a tip-off, law enforcers apprehended suspect Jalil alias Fareed in Rais Goth. Later, suspects Hamdan Qadir Buksh and Niaz Ali Muhammad were also arrested.
It claimed to have recovered 2,000 kilograms of explosives, 30 plastic drums and five cylinders, rigged with various detonators, and a truck. The police said they were planing to carry out a terrorist attack in the city. During initial grilling, Jalil disclosed that he had been allegedly affiliated with the proscribed Majeed Brigade of the BLA.
Regarding the truck, the suspect revealed that it was intended to be used at a targeted location in Karachi for a terrorist act.
The CTD had registered a case for the offences under Sections 4/5 of the Explosive Substances Act read with Sections 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act. On Monday,CTD officials told a press conference that the suspects had obtained the explosive material from Afghanistan.

The case was heard by Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Amjad Ali Shah. During the proceedings, defence lawyers sought the court’s permission to meet Mr Khan at Adiala Jail, stating that access was necessary to obtain instructions regarding the pending cases.
Defence counsel told the court that they had alre­ady taken instructions from the PTI founder in connection with the cases, reiterating that effective legal represen­tation requi­red direct consultation with their client.
Opposing the request, the special prosecutor submitted that Mr Khan was on bail in the May 9 GHQ attack case and was not in the custody of the ATC. He further informed the court that the PTI founder had since been convicted in ano­t­h­er case, adding that the defence could appro­ach the relevant forum if it had any grievance regarding access.
The prosecutor mainta­ined that, as a convicted pri­s­oner, the PTI founder was in the custody of the jail sup­e­r­intendent and that, under the law, jail aut­hori­ties had the power to regulate meetings. He argued that the issue rai­s­ed by the defence did not fall within the jurisdiction of the ATC hearing the GHQ attack case.
In response, the defence counsel adopted a firm position, stating that until they were granted access to the PTI founder, they would not be a part of the court proceedings. During the hearing, the court also took notice of the absence of several accused and issued non-bailable arrest warrants for 40 to 45 accused who failed to appear.
Trial via video link
The court provided defence lawyers with a copy of the Punjab government’s notification regarding the conduct of the trial through a video link. According to the notification issued on October 30 last year, proceedings in the May 9 GHQ attack case are to be conducted via video link.

 

Later, the court adjourned the hearing until January 20.
Separately, the hearing of the Judicial Complex attack case against the PTI founder and other accused in the Anti-Terrorism Court, Islamabad, was adjourned without proceedings due to the unavailability of Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra. The court fixed the next date of hearing for February 6.
Similarly, the hearing of another case registered at the Secretariat Police Station was also adjourned without proceedings owing to the judge’s absence. As a result, statements of witnesses could not be recorded, and the next hearing was fixed for January 12.

QUETTA: The provincial government has formally merged the over century-old Levies Force into the Balochistan Police, and abolished all ‘B’ areas across the province, converting them into ‘A’ areas for the purpose of territorial jurisdiction of the provincial police.
The two areas defined the territorial jurisdiction of law enforcement agencies within the province. The Balochistan Police acted as the law enforcement agency in ‘A’ areas, while the Levies Force operated in ‘B’ areas, functioning under the command of division and district officials.
The process of merging the Balochistan Levies and ex-federal Levies into the police force had been under way for a long time and has now been completed, with the provincial government moving to enforce a uniform system of laws and regulations under a single command across the province.
The provincial government declared Sibi and Loralai divisions as ‘A-Areas’ for the territorial jurisdiction of the Balochistan Police, according to a notification issued by Additional Chief Secretary Muhammad Hamza Shafqaat on Monday evening.
It said all members of the Levies Force, both provincial and ex-federal, serving in the converted areas, as well as members of the CPEC Wing, were merged into the Balochistan Police in their existing nomenclature, ranks, pay scales and benefits, corresponding to those applicable to police personnel.
Furthermore, the services, administration and functioning of the merged Levies Force and the converted areas will henceforth be governed by the provisions of the Balochistan Police Act.
The notification said that in continuation of the decision, all budgetary allocations and finances, DDO codes, arms and ammunition, police stations, check-posts and pickets, vehicles, records and investigations, training institutions, and all ancillary and auxiliary infrastructure pertaining to the Levies Force in the converted areas would be transferred to the Balochistan Police with immediate effect.
It further stated that the superintendent of police of a converted district would, upon request, place police personnel at the disposal of the district administration and other government functionaries for assistance in the enforcement of local and special laws and for other lawful public duties.
The commissioners of Sibi and Loralai divisions have been directed to complete the transition process within 30 days of the issuance of the notification.
‘Ambiguity resolved’
Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, in a post on X, said the “longstanding administrative ambiguity over the implementation of a uniform law in Balochistan has been officially resolved”.
“The division into A and B area categories has been abolished, and the Levies Force has been formally and legally merged into the Balochistan Police,” he said, adding that the decision would clarify state responsibilities and further strengthen the scope of public protection.







The matter also came up in the ISPR chief’s press conference on Tuesday. Talking about the move, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said, “This will have far-reaching consequences. This is again part of efforts to combat terrorism at the ground level and terror-crime nexus at the grassroots level.”
In October last year, the Balochistan government merged the provincial and federal Levies forces with the police in six out of eight administrative divisions of the province, declaring these divisions as A-areas.
The six divisions included Quetta, Kalat, Makran, Zhob, Rakhshan and Nasirabad. However, the Levies Force in Sibi and Loralai divisions, which included Dera Bugti, Sibi, Kohlu, Harnai, Ziarat and other districts, were not merged into the Balochistan Police.
Professional responsibilities
The Balochistan Police have stepped up efforts to strengthen their training system and improve residential and welfare facilities to better prepare former Levies personnel, merged from ‘B’ areas to ‘A’ areas, for their professional responsibilities.
Officials said that enhancing the quality of policing was essential to restoring public trust and ensuring sustainable law and order in the province.
As part of the initiative, professionalism, transparency, accountability and the use of modern technology have been declared essential for effective policing. Significant improvements have been made to accommodation and basic facilities at the Police Training College (PTC), Quetta, to create a more conducive and efficient training environment for trainees from various districts of Balochistan.
At present, 772 former Levies personnel are availing training and residential facilities at PTC Quetta.
A comprehensive three-month training programme for personnel merged from ‘B’ areas to ‘A’ areas began on Jan 1 this year. The programme includes physical training, weapons handling, marksmanship and counterterrorism skills to enable trainees to respond effectively to security challenges.
Training is being conducted on modern lines, with special emphasis on improving investigative skills, legal awareness, intelligence-based policing and community participation.
PTC Commandant Shahzad Akbar said residential blocks had been equipped with modern facilities to provide safe and comfortable accommodation to personnel during training. He added that a modern futsal ground had been established to promote physical fitness and healthy activities, while the parade ground had been upgraded to meet training requirements and ensure safety during practical exercises.

ISLAMABAD: The government plans on increasing tax rates on petroleum products to contain more than Rs3 trillion circular debt in the gas sector instead of changing the gas tariff as determined by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
While testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Petroleum, Petr­o­leum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Tuesday said the government was not increasing the gas tariff from January 1 on the instructions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The meeting was presided over by Syed Mustafa Mahmood, MNA.
The minister confirmed that the gas circular debt was over Rs3 trillion, including late payment surcharge. Mr Malik, however, deflected repeated questions from lawmakers about proposals for increasing the petroleum levy by Rs5 per litre on petrol and diesel to cover the circular debt, saying a separate briefing could be arranged on the subject.
Interestingly, there are only 10 million gas consumers in the country compared to petrol and diesel which are consumed by almost the entire population. Of late, the government has been increasing the petroleum levy, currently up to Rs82 per litre, on the pretext of providing a subsidy to power consumers and building roads in Balochistan, in addition to using the levy as one of the leading general revenue sources for the Centre.
In the last week of November 2025, Ogra had determined up to 7pc (Rs118 per unit) increase in the prescribed price of natural gas to meet about Rs886bn revenue requirement of the two gas companies during fiscal year 2025-26. Under the law, the government has to make a decision on consumer-end gas prices based on Ogra’s determination within 40 days.
The minister, however, said the price would not be increased for the next six months and pointed out reforms to curb gas theft and losses, besides a diversion of surplus LNG cargoes to the international market. He said Pakistan had concluded successful negotiations with Qatar to divert surplus LNG cargoes to global markets. He said a mutually acceptable arrangement had been reac­h­ed to manage excess supplies.
MNA Asad Alam Niazi said that the gas sector’s circular debt had surpassed a similar monster in the power sector. He asked whether a proposed Rs5 per litre levy on petrol and diesel was being considered to help retire the gas sector debt. Minister Malik responded that the committee would be formally briefed on the matter, but did not deny the proposal.
The minister said a detailed report on gas circular debt, prepared under IMF conditions, had already been submitted to the cabinet committee on energy (CCoE), adding that the flow of fresh circular debt in the gas sector has been “quelled”, which was a critical reform measure.
Sui gas companies’ managing directors presented data showing operational improvements. Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Managing Director Aamer Tufail said his company was able to reduce unaccounted-for gas (UFG) losses from 9pc to 5pc.
The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) reported that UFG losses had dropped from 17pc to 10pc and cautioned that Balochistan alone suffered annual gas losses of about Rs12 billion.
Committee member Syed Naveed Qamar argued that gas theft and losses often occur with collusion, but the minister said feeder-to-feeder monitoring had been introduced nationwide to tighten oversight.

 

Officials said domestic consumers were receiving enhanced gas supplies this winter. SNGPL reported that in November it supplied an additional 61 million cubic feet per day compared with last year, rising to 95 million cubic feet per day extra in December.
No domestic gas field was currently under curtailment, the minister said, adding that gas was being supplied to the power sector beyond its indicative demand to avoid load-shedding.
The committee was told that technology based monitoring systems, including town border stations (TBS) at network tail-ends, were now generating automatic alerts in case of pressure drops, improving real-time control and service delivery.
The minister said the government was also working with the World Bank to strengthen the capacity of the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions.
The committee chairman observed that CSR funds were not being utilised properly by the existing committee and, therefore, recommended that a new committee be formed for a transparent utilisation of funds as per the previous recommendations of the committee.

According to a navy statement, PNS Behr Masah has been deployed in support of this scientific mission, which is being conducted by the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) in collaboration with China’s Second Institute of Oceanography.
According to NHO, the Behr Masah is a hydrographic survey ship with the capability to undertake oceanographic and geo-physical surveys. 
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the navy underscored its commitment to promoting maritime awareness and facilitate marine scientific research in Pakistan.

Exercise aimed at improving understanding of Pakistani marine environment

The Joint Oceanographic Cruise represents a significant scientific collaboration between Pakistan and China, aimed at enhanced understanding of the marine environment in Pakistani waters. 
The research outcomes are expected to increase awareness of coastal and offshore marine dynamics, enabling better assessment of environmental patterns and supporting informed maritime planning and policymaking.
According to the NIO, the signing ceremony of the ‘Letter of Agreement on China-Pakistan Joint Cruises for Marine Environment and Ecosystem in Pakistan Coastal Area’ was held in Hangzhou, China, on Dec 12, 2025.
The NIO initiated the joint marine cruises with China’s Second Institute of Oceanography for the collection of marine environmental and ecosystem data across all four seasons in Pakistan’s coastal areas.
This will be an opportunity for senior representatives of both institutions to collaborate on marine ecosystems, coastal dynamics, climate change, and the sustainable utilisation of ocean resources. It will be a shared commitment to scientific cooperation, data exchange, joint research initiatives and capacity building.
Through this initiative, Pakistani scientists will have the opportunity to analyse samples in Chinese laboratories, which is not possible in Pakistan due to the lack of expensive laboratory equipment and machines. Pakistani personnel will also have opportunities for training on ocean equipment innovation, equipment operation, data collection techniques on board, and post-cruise laboratory analysis.

Pakistan’s recent relations with both India and Afghanistan have been characterised by significant strain and tension. Pakistan fought a four-day war with India in May 2025 and had a border skirmish with the Afghan Taliban regime in October of the same year.
“Absolutely, we are ready, by the grace of God,“ said Asif on Geo News programme Capital Talk when asked if the country was prepared and capable of handling a war of aggression on its eastern and western borders.
Asif said the country and its armed forces had demonstrated proof of this preparedness during the May 2025 conflict with India.
“The way we gave them a crushing response is the strongest evidence that we were prepared and responded in time,” said the defence minister.
He maintained that the world witnessed how “Modi was thrashed” and how, following the conflict, he lost “all credibility both within his country and internationally”.
The minister further said that following the befitting response by the Pakistan armed forces, India “approached the US” for a ceasefire.
“You can determine from that how badly they were shattered — to the point that they had to call China.”
Pakistan‘s response, which came during the early morning hours of May 10, saw large-scale attacks with guided weapons and drones on Indian military targets. Airbases along the border, posts on the Line of Control (LoC) and India’s S-400 surface to missile systems were hit among other targets.
However, the defence minister expressed confidence that there would not be a full-scale war between the two nuclear powers when asked whether India could launch another attack, involve the Taliban, and then bring in US President Trump to enforce a ceasefire.
He further said that the four-day war with India enhanced Pakistan’s prestige. “Our armed forces’ strength is recognised by the entire world,“ said the defence minister, adding that recent orders for fighter aircraft show ”that our jets have been [battle] tested“.
The conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. During the conflict, the Pakistan Air Force shot down at least six India fighter aircraft. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.</p><small>2026-01-06 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643641-pti-dismisses-govts-dialogue-proposal-involving-pakistans-top-five-figures' target='_blank'><strong>PTI dismisses govt's dialogue proposal involving Pakistan's 'top five figures'</strong></a><br><p>

At the outset of the press conference, the military’s spokesperson said that the purpose of the briefing was to give a comprehensive overview of counter-terrorism measures taken in the past year.



This “is the only purpose of this press conference, and I would request that we remain focused on counter-terrorism as terrorism is the biggest threat that is being faced by the state of Pakistan,” he added.
The DG ISPR said 2025 was a “landmark and consequential year in our fight against terrorism”, adding there were four reasons behind this conclusion.
He maintained that the fight against terrorism concerned the entire nation and had been ongoing for more than two decades. The DG ISPR further stated that the past year witnessed “unprecedented intensity in counter-terrorism efforts.”

 


In 2025, he continued, the state of Pakistan, as well as the people, gained “complete clarity on terrorism”.
“The state already had this clarity, which permeated slowly and gradually down[ward] that these terrorists are khawarij [and] they have no relation with Islam. They are Fitna-al-Hindustan and have no relation with Pakistan or [the people of] Balochistan,” he elaborated.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and it uses Fitna-al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based terrorist groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Lieutenant General Chaudhry further highlighted that in 2025, the world acknowledged Pakistan’s stance and narrative regarding terrorism, particularly Afghanistan becoming a “base for terrorist operations”.

 


Moreover, he added that the past year also demonstrated “how the National Action Plan (NAP) was reinvigorated and how it was being implemented”.
In this connection, he also mentioned that the vision for Azm-i-Istehkam — a counter-terrorism operation launched by the military in 2024 — was drawn from the revised NAP, and that all political parties and segments of society had reached a consensus on the necessity of implementing the NAP to eliminate terrorism.
He acknowledged, however, that “there are still deficiencies, and there is a lot of room for improvement” in the implementation of the NAP.
After outlining these four factors as the reasons behind declaring 2025 a “landmark and consequential year” in counter-terrorism, the DG ISPR went on to discuss them in detail.

75,175 IBOs in 2025
Sharing data, the military spokesperson said law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in 2025.
“Which comes down to 206 IBOs per day,” he said. Breaking it down, he noted that 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan.
He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan last year, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.
Moreover, 2,597 terrorists were killed in Pakistan in 2025, the DG ISPR said. Among them, 1,800 were killed in KP, 784 in Balochistan, and 10 in other areas.
In 2025, he continued, 1,235 law enforcement personnel and civilians were martyred in the fight against terrorism.
Sharing data about suicide bombing incidents, he said a total of 27 had taken place in 2025. Of these, 16 occurred in KP, 10 in Balochistan, and one in Islamabad, at the judicial complex.
“Out of them, two [involved] female suicide bombers.”
In light of these facts and figures, he said, the question that came to mind was why the majority of terror incidents took place in KP.
“The primary reason for this is the politically conducive environment provided [to terrorists], and the political-terror nexus that is flourishing in the province,” he said.

 


The DG ISPR highlighted that data show terrorism began to rise in 2021. A total of 193 terrorists were killed that year compared to 592 law enforcement personnel who were martyred, a ratio of 1:3, he added.
Moving to 2025, he pointed out that 2,597 terrorists were killed last year, while 1,235 law enforcement personnel were martyred. This translated to a ratio of 2:1, he added.
“But more importantly, what happened in 2021 that caused terrorism to rise?” he questioned, and he elaborated on the reasons behind this development.
The DG ISPR explained that there was a change in Afghanistan in 2021 following the Doha Agreement.
“An armed group, the Afghan Taliban, sat down with the US and international partners and entered into an agreement. Under the agreement, they made three commitments — that they will form an inclusive government in Afghanistan, use of Afghan soil for terrorism will not be allowed and women will be given rights [in Afghanistan],” the DG ISPR recalled.
But were the commitments fulfilled, the military spokesperson questioned.
“They were not. Is there a government there? There is no government there. They [just] call themselves interim Afghan government […] Is there an inclusive government there? No, there is not.”
“Has terrorism been eradicated [from Afghanistan]? Contrarily, Afghanistan has become a hub of terrorists and non-state actors. Terrorists of different creeds operate from there. So that is what started happening in 2021.”
Naming various terror outfits that he said were operating from Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said Afghanistan had become a “centre point where terrorists of all kinds are being nurtured”.
He said that around 2,500 terrorists, who were neither Afghans nor Pakistanis, had recently reached Afghanistan from Syria.
The military spokesperson also said that the Afghan Taliban, “which is now the mother organisation,” had started organising the TTP according to its organisational structure. The DG ISPR added that they also trained and directed the terror outfit.
Moreover, the Afghan Taliban built a “fake” narrative, boasting that they forced the US and international coalition forces to flee Afghanistan.
“On the basis of that, they start further polluting the minds of youngsters, the youth and religious-minded people. They present themselves as the flag-bearers of Islam and increase their recruitment.”
“But if you analyse the matter, you will realise that they did not make them [coalition forces and the US] flee. There were other reasons for it.”
The DG ISPR also spoke about the war economy in this regard. He referred to a recent report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which he said mentioned that around $144 billion was pumped into the reconstruction of Afghanistan.
“When the [supply of] that money stopped, to continue running the war economy, they [Afghan Taliban] spread the war in the form of terrorism across the entire region. They find new patrons and financial sponsors, with the biggest patron for terrorism in Pakistan being India,” he said.
The DG ISPR added that India was using the Afghan Taliban as proxies and providing them with financial and other assistance.
“So the base of operations is being provided in Afghanistan by the Afghan Taliban and India’s money and patronage [is available].”
The military spokesperson added that the Afghan Taliban were taking the assistance of sponsors from elsewhere too — wherever they were able to find them — to run the war economy.
The military spokesperson elaborated that modern US equipment worth $7.2bn was left behind in Afghanistan. It included night-vision devices, high-powered sniper rifles, body armour and other personal protection equipment, M-4 and M-16 assault rifles — “the best of weapons and ammunition”.
This equipment was “available to the Afghan Taliban, in the black market, to all these terrorist organisations”.
Moreover, the political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 began “internally facilitating terrorists” and decided to hold talks with them while a “great game was being played in Afghanistan.”
This was seemingly a reference to talks held between the then-Pakistan government and the TTP.
The DG ISPR went on to say that “once you give them terrorists so much space and so much wherewithal, you see a rise in terror incidents.”
By 2023, he added, that state began standing against them.
Lieutenant General Chaudhry referred to a speech by the army chief following a blast in a mosque in Police Lines, Peshawar, in 2023, adding that on that occasion, the army chief gave clarity on terrorism. “Entire Pakistan has that clarity now.”
Further elaborating on this “clarity,” he used strong language, saying that terrorists had no religious association; they had to be eliminated, and action had to be taken against them.
“But it takes time. Because if you have to fight them, you have to equip yourself, train yourself, adopt the right technology, build the narrative, and take the nation along.
“You saw this last year, which I said was a consequential and landmark year, when the tide started turning.”
The military spokesperson acknowledged that questions were also raised about the large number of terror incidents: 5,397 in 2025.
“Yes, this is a big number. Why? Because we are engaging them everywhere. We are conducting 75,000 IBOs, 206 per day, and we are taking them on.“
“By ‘we,’ I mean myself, you, and everyone in Pakistan. We have absolute clarity that we have to win this fight, not by appeasement, but by force and strength. There are a few things in life worth fighting for, where fighting is not only justified but necessary, and there is no alternative.”
He said that when terrorism has reared its head in other countries, it has destroyed states. “But your state, your law enforcement agencies, and your army are fighting on a daily basis.”
Terrorism surge after May conflict
Referring to a chart, he said it could be deduced from the data that after Pakistan defeated India during a four-day conflict in May 2025, terrorism surged. After its defeat, “Indians immediately sought to influence non-state actors.”
Afghanistan served as the base of operations for those incidents, he said, adding that Pakistan repeatedly urged Kabul to end cross-border terrorism.
“And then we carried out strikes on terrorists along the Pak-Afghan border in October, not targeting the Afghan Taliban or their posts. And what did the Afghan Taliban regime do, which is acting as a proxy and a base of operations for Indians? They attacked Pakistani posts, coming in direct support of the terrorists.“
“So the state of Pakistan did what was necessary. Dozens of Afghan posts were obliterated within hours, and a hard message was sent.”
The DG ISPR said that posts were obliterated not just at the border but also inside Afghanistan.
He added that the border was closed after that, and terror incidents and the facilitation of terrorists declined.
“The number of terrorists killed in the last three months after the border was closed in October rose to 276 per month. There are signs here for those who can understand.”
He said parallels had been drawn between Pakistan‘s actions in October last year and India’s in May 2025.
“Those drawing the parallel are trying to spin a narrative,” he said.
He added, “In May 2025, India targeted Pakistani citizens; Pakistan, however, did not target Afghans in October.”
“We targeted our own citizens who were present there and involved in terrorism in Pakistan. They have training centres there.
“We knew TTP was present there. Did we target TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan)? No, we did not.
“Only the state of Pakistan has the right to punish or reward its citizens in accordance with the law and Constitution of Pakistan. Who is India to cause harm to any Pakistani citizen?”
He again asserted that in the October strikes, Pakistan’s military targeted the TTP.
The DG ISPR said Pakistan had been pressing the Afghan Taliban for the constitution of a verifiable mechanism, adding that Pakistan had evidence of where and to whom the Afghan Taliban had been providing refuge.
Stressing the difference between India‘s and Pakistan’s cross-border strikes, he said whoever tried to point out similarities between the two developments was lying.
They were trying to deceive the people, spinning a misleading narrative, the DG ISPR said.
Listing 10 “major” incidents of terrorism in Pakistan in 2025, he said: “And who are involved in all of these high-impact [terror incidents]? They are all Afghans.”
The DG ISPR said all 78 terrorists involved in the 10 major incidents were killed. “None of them went back alive, and 60 civilians were martyred in those incidents. So the narrative they create that it is the military’s fight [is false]. This is the fight of the people. […] If we and you did not stand up against them, they would blow themselves up in your homes, markets, offices, schools, and streets until you adopt their perverted ideology.”
After playing “confessional statements by some terrorists,” he said that 16 of the terrorists killed in 2025 could be clearly identified as high-value targets. They included Amjad Ali, who was the second-in-command in the shura of the TTP.
He then asked his audience to rise from their seats, and those in uniform to salute, to pay tribute to the “martyrs,” including the people of Pakistan and personnel of the police, armed forces, and Federal Constabulary, who had lost their lives in terror incidents.
Three main pillars of counter-terrorism
Following that, the DG ISPR said there were three main pillars of the fight against terrorism.
Essentially, it was intelligence-based, he said, but there were three main pillars of its final manifestation on the ground.
The first among these pillars was the engagements on the Pak-Afghan border, the second was offensive actions by small teams, and the third was the technical surveillance and engagements, he explained. “These are the three pillars that are based on intelligence.”
Speaking about technical surveillance and engagement, he said a narrative was created that Pakistan’s military was using drones.
But in fact, it was the terrorists who began using those armed quadcopters, he said, adding that 405 quadcopter attacks by the terrorists were reported from KP alone during the year.
“Their patron — India — provides them with funds, technical inventory and other assistance. So they have now started going into this armed quadcopter business. They also have a special wing for quadcopters in their organisations.
“They also use mosques, public places and houses as human shields.”
He explained that law enforcement bodies, including police and armed forces, were using drones only for technical surveillance.
The military’s spokesperson mentioned that even the KP government had provided law enforcement bodies with quadcopters, as terrorists had been using them.
He added that law enforcement did not use quadcopters in any built-up or populated area and ensured that there was no collateral damage.
“It is important to brief you on this as a false narrative is being spun regarding this,” he remarked. “We use it with care, and your army does not cause any collateral damage. We hit only terrorists and their facilitators.”
He said the army was not only engaged in kinetic action when it came to countering terrorism. It was also taking measures pertaining to “communication, engagement and social manoeuvre“, he said.
“In our view, this is even more important than killing the terrorists,” he said as videos of the military’s engagement with the public played in the background. “And the narrative they create that there is a law and order situation, there is a gap between the public and the state — absolutely not.
“I say with great pride that Pakistan’s people and the state are together.”
He said the people of Pakistan now had clarity on what Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan were, on the India-Afghan Taliban terrorism nexus, on the other external sponsors of terrorism, on the international acknowledgement and acceptance of Pakistan’s stance on terrorism and on internal facilitators — most of whom were found in politics — of terrorism.

India-Afghan Taliban nexus
Speaking about the India-Afghan Taliban nexus, he also played various clips of the Indian media as a portrayal of the “collusion”.
In this connection, he also mentioned those who “promoted terrorism under the guise of human rights and democracy.” He specifically cited a professor from the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, who, the DG ISPR said, had confessed to involvement in terrorism.
The military spokesperson said the professor was defended by people in Pakistan and abroad and showed social media posts by various users, including freelance journalist Kiyya Baloch, the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, and human rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Haazir.

 


He then said that the Afghan Taliban was not a government but a group that had occupied Afghanistan, under whose patronage more than a dozen terrorist organisations had been operating.
“Everyone knows this but the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government,” he said, following which a video of KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was played.
In the video, Afridi was speaking in Pashto, and the DG ISPR quoted him as asking why other countries were not facing the issue of terrorism from Afghan soil.
He then pointed out that other countries, too, were facing the issue, adding that a false narrative was being spun.
The DG ISPR also rejected the impression that the fight against terrorism was being carried out in the pursuit of “dollars and minerals”.
A clip of PTI leader Asad Qaiser was also played, who rejected military operations in KP.
On this, the DG ISPR explained that the army was a federal force and worked under the instructions of the federal government. “We are constitutionally bound to ensure Pakistan’s territorial integrity and security.
“No one can allow you to hand over your areas to terrorists for your politics and to facilitate whosoever.”
Giving the example of ANP being targeted by terrorists after the party voiced opposition to terrorism, the DG ISPR, without naming the PTI, said: “They are saying that they are not ready to die. That they will not stand up. That they will join them (terrorists).“
Again without naming the PTI, he raised the question of why terrorists had not ever targeted the party.
Then, showing a news report about “KP seeking Afghan help for negotiations”, the DG ISPR remarked: “What policy of appeasement is this in which you are begging Kabul?”
“Their narrative also came out in the open in 2025.”
Then, coming back to the revised NAP, he said the kinetic action detailed under it was already being taken by security forces.
The rest of the provisions under the plan had to be fulfilled by society, political parties and provincial, federal and district governments, not the army.
“On this, what we feel is that there is a reinvigoration under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.”
He said a case study regarding this was about how the plan was being implemented in Balochistan. And “we should be very proud” of it, he added.
“The credit must go to the chief minister and the government of Balochistan. What they have done is — and they will soon provide you with a comprehensive and final document — they have constituted district-level coordination committees, which include local MPAs, DC, DPO, and representatives of the army and intelligence [agencies].
“So the devolution sense in a real sense is reaching the districts of Balochistan through these district coordination committees.”
The DG ISPR shared that 472 meetings had been held of these committees between February and November 2025, since their constitution.
“Funds of Rs23bn by the Balochistan government and Rs8bn by the federal government have been made available to each committee at the district level,” he said, adding that locals were included in the committees and identified projects that needed to be executed.
He said 127 projects have been completed, and 949 had been planned under this plan. Moreover, 54,000 social activities and engagements had been carried out under this plan, in which government and law enforcement functionaries, army representatives and political functionaries engage with the people.
He said the Balochistan government was expeditiously working on this “NAP Balochistan”, further stating that the distinction between category-A and category-B areas in Balochistan had ended.
“By law, the government of Balochistan has converted everything into Cat-A, which means that now there is a Balochistan police mandate all across Balochistan.
“This will have far-reaching consequences. This is again part of efforts to combat terrorism at the ground level and terror-crime nexus at the grassroots level.”
He said the Balochistan’s government had allocated Rs5bn separately for training the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department as part of this.
The DG ISPR said the authorities had managed to curb the smuggling of Iranian oil in Balochistan in a bid to combat the political-terror-criminal nexus.
He also highlighted that the high number of pending terrorism cases in courts in KP and the low conviction rate as other reasons behind the failure to eradicate terrorism from the province.
Moreover, the military’s spokesperson said two more areas that were being addressed under the revised NAP were narcotics — as it was connected to terrorism — and illegal weapons.
In both areas, he said the conviction rate was low.

“It is not the job of the army, but it has a direct bearing on our counter-terrorism efforts.”
Afghan repatriation
Gen Chaudhry said another important facet of the revised NAP was the repatriation of Afghans. He said Punjab had just one Afghan refugee camp that had been cleared and similarly, all 10 refugee camps in Balochistan had also been cleared.
In contrast, of the 43 refugee camps in KP, just five had been cleared, he said.
The DG ISPR said that of around 150,000 refugees repatriated from KP, 1.2 per cent had been “deported”.
Deportation “means that an individual had been checked and found to be illegally [staying]. [Deportation] provides the impetus for others to leave willingly”.
“In other provinces, the percentage of deportation is much higher. That means law enforcement agencies are not being given a freehand there (KP). […] The people and law enforcement bodies in KP want [repatriation of Afghans], but why are they not being utilised for this?” he said.
The DG ISPR said a Pakistan Land Port Authority had been established, which would contribute to NAP’s reinvigoration. The body would facilitate coordination among agencies operating at land ports, he explained.
He said the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre had also been established and termed it a “fusion of multiple agencies in one place”.
He said a major terrorist attack had been averted in Karachi recently, for which the “fusion of intelligence” happened at NIFTAC and provincial centres associated with the body.
He ended his briefing, asserting that the fight against terrorism would continue “with the singularity of purpose and singularity of narrative”.
“Those in uniform and those not in uniform have to fight together and win this fight. And no power in the world can stop us from winning this fight.”
‘Afghan border closure more beneficial than a loss’
When a journalist asked whether Pakistan was ready for a full-fledged war after availing multiple other options in recent months but “getting nothing out of it,” the DG ISPR disputed the phrasing. He noted that the ratio of terrorists killed to people martyred was now 2:1, up from 1:3 in 2021, and that Pakistan’s stance was being acknowledged globally.
“Pakistan was the first to say, two years ago, that attention needed to be paid to Afghanistan, where terrorists from across the world have gathered. Now, a United Nations report states that there are 20 regional terrorist organisations there.”
Gen Chaudhry further said, “We will trace them and their facilitators. No one should have any doubt about Pakistan’s resolve—its public, its armed forces, and its political and military leadership.”
Asked about the future of the Pak-Afghan border, the DG ISPR noted that the state’s top-most priority was the security and territorial integrity of Pakistan.

 

He stressed that the border had been closed for a reason, which had also been communicated to Kabul. About Pakistani students in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR said the state will do whatever is necessary for their protection.
At another point, when asked about Afghanistan’s demand for a separate trade pact to reopen the border, the DG ISPR stated that the border closure only had “advantages” for Pakistan and no losses, as terrorism was permeating through it.
Asked what the “long-term solution” for Afghanistan was, the DG ISPR said, “We will play all the cards, and we will engage with them where we have to in a hard manner. Where we have to engage them diplomatically, we will do that as well.”
Asked if there was any hope of a change in Afghanistan’s attitude due to the recent joint statement by Pakistan and China, the DG ISPR said Islamabad and Beijing “see in the same way on regional terrorism“, and therefore cooperation in that domain is maintained. He said there was consensus in the entire region that Afghanistan had become the centre of terrorism.
On whether a regime-change operation in Afghanistan, similar to the recent operation in Venezuela, would be in Pakistan’s favour, the DG ISPR said it was for Afghans to decide. “We have to take care of our country. That is enough for us.”

 

On Pakistan’s future stance on such a development, Gen Chaudhry said the state would “curate its policy based on the circumstances at that time” and stressed that the foreign ministry takes the lead in such matters.
Asked about who was supporting the IS-KP terrorists in Pakistan, as the group and the Afghan Taliban were enemies, the DG ISPR questioned who termed them as each other’s enemies.
The DG ISPR asserted that terrorists have no ideology, whether it is the Daesh, Al Qaeda, TTP, FAK, FAH, or ETIM. “They have no nationality, humanity or ethnicity,” Gen Chaudhry said. “They all have one father — the Afghan Taliban. About them killing each other, you have been covering for a long time that one faction kills another.”

 

“As far as Pakistan is concerned, there is no shade or colour of any sort of terrorist. We have no space or sympathy for any terrorist. I have already said that there is only one type of good terrorist: a dead terrorist,” the DG ISPR stated.
He stressed that the nation has to fight the war of narratives, technology, and intelligence. He quipped that terrorists were “baffled” by Pakistan continuing to move forward despite various militant groups thrown in the mix, along with sectarian strife and internal political facilitators.
Asked if Pakistan would inevitably carry out more strikes against the TTP in Afghanistan, the DG ISPR highlighted that in October 2025, Pakistan only carried out strikes “at the Pak-Afghan border area, on the terrorists that were infiltrating into Pakistan and those who were planning to go across into Pakistan and the places they were being organised”.
He stressed that it was the TTP, who were Pakistani citizens, who were struck. Gen Chaudhry noted that it was the Afghan Taliban who struck the Pakistani posts then, which gave Pakistan the “full right to respond” as its territorial integrity was attacked.
Questioned whether Pakistan had given the Afghan Taliban legitimacy by holding talks with them in Doha and Istanbul last year, the DG ISPR answered that they are the de facto rulers in Afghanistan. He pointed out that talks have been held during the entire period from 2021 to 2025, so there was “nothing new” about that now.
“Who else will you speak with?” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that since 2021, high-level delegation visits have taken place, 225 border flag meetings have occurred, 836 protest letters have been written, and 13 demarches have been issued to the same Afghan Taliban.
Issues in KP
Asked whether there was any hope of the federal government taking action to remove the hindrances in KP, such as by imposing governor’s rule, the DG ISPR said these decisions were up to the political leadership to decide. “This is for them to decide. They have to see multiple things. A soldier thinks in black and white [but] a politician thinks in multiple shades.”
“Our job is to separate the truth and the lies. We call a spade a spade,” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that the current counter-terrorism narrative of declaring terrorists Khariji began in 2023.
On whether the military was willing to hold talks with KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, the DG ISPR said dialogue was for the government to have.
Asked at another point what the solution to the lack of political will in KP was, the DG ISPR said politicians had to resolve those issues. “We are a democratic country. There is a parliamentary democratic system, which has the solution to this.”

 

The military spokesman asserted, “Our job is to give the state and the public our perspective based on facts and cold logic. We have no emotions in this.”
The military spokesperson termed the field marshal the “source of the clarity” of not holding any talks with the terrorists or giving them any space, and instead fighting them as per God’s directives. “The truth will come out if someone has personal vested interests and does not want to obtain that clarity.”
On the KP government‘s decision to abolish the Action in Aid of Civil Power Ordinance and the army‘s plan of action for military operations, the DG ISPR said under Article 245, the armed forces were to defend Pakistan as per the federal government’s directives.
“The validity of any direction issued by the federal government under Clause 1 shall not be called in question in any court,” he quoted Article 245 as saying.
On how the military would launch any operation or conduct IBOs in KP when there was a difference of opinion with its provincial leadership, the military spokesperson pointed out that “operations” were continuing despite the KP CM saying they would not allow kinetic actions.
“Those who say we will not allow [operations], are their personalities or statements above Pakistan’s sovereignty?” he asked rhetorically.
“This is a war of our sovereignty. This is Pakistan’s war. No personality or politics is above Pakistan,” he asserted.
‘Cannot blame institution for certain persons’ acts’
Responding to a query about the military leadership’s involvement in the 2021 “rehabilitation” policy and their accountability, and whether calling out only the political leadership would be “selective justice”, the DG ISPR rebutted that the military leadership had input in the decision.
“We have a political narrative imposed on us wherein powers are taken in full but not the responsibility. The method to it is saying ‘we were powerless’. The government has the authority,” Gen Chaudhry said, adding that both the current government and its predecessor had authority.

 

The military spokesman further said that some institutions were “not as empowered as they should be because of the politicisation that has crept into them over time”. “We repeatedly say not to impose any politics on us […] All political parties, political leaders and political ideologies, ethnicities, communities, religions, sects are equal for us as long as they are Pakistani.”
The DG ISPR, without taking names, alluded to Imran Khan and said he was “running his party like a dictator” and added that he was insistent on holding talks with the Afghan regime.
He quipped that he [Imran] was so empowered that he had even declared the then-army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa as “father of the nation”, a title that is reserved for Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
Gen Chaudhry added that then-intelligence chief — referring to Faiz Hameed — was “used for politics”. “You cannot put this [blame] on the institution; it was a field of characters.”</p><small>2026-01-06 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/062234429381bac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965471/bangladesh-pacer-mustafizur-rahman-registers-for-psl-following-ipl-snub' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman registers for PSL following IPL snub</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman has registered for the Pakistan Super League (PSL) draft following his release from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).
The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by Kolkata for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December.
He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season. On Saturday, Kolkata announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason, without providing further details.
The decision comes amid strained relations between India and Bangladesh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh.
In response, Bangladesh has banned IPL broadcasts in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board has requested the ICC to shift its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka.
Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars.

Five of those deaths since the mercury dropped on Monday were in France alone, while a woman died in Bosnia as heavy snow and rain sparked floods and power outages across the Balkans.
Paris’s two airports, Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly, were to cancel many flights early Wednesday to allow ground crews to clear snow from runways and de-ice planes. Forty percent of flights at Charles de Gaulle were to be scrapped, and 25 per cent at Orly.

In Britain, the mercury plunged to -12.5C overnight Monday-Tuesday in Norfolk, eastern England, while temperatures below -10C across the Netherlands brought trains to a standstill on Tuesday morning.
“Last night was the coldest night of the winter so far,” Britain’s Met Office said, with nearly all of the United Kingdom on alert for snow and ice and more snowfall expected.
With the chill making roads perilous, three people died in accidents linked to black ice in southwestern France on Monday morning, authorities said, while a taxi driver died in hospital on Monday night after veering into the Marne river in the Paris region.
His passenger was still being treated for hypothermia, according to a police source. Another driver also lost his life east of Paris on Monday after a collision with a heavy goods vehicle.
Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, the Netherlands’ main flight hub, meanwhile, saw a second day of weather-driven cancellations on Tuesday, with more than 400 flights grounded and travellers facing huge queues at the airline counters.
Trains from the Dutch national railway operator NS only began rolling again after 3:00pm PKT, with services limited afterwards.
But planes got off the ground again from Liverpool in northwest England and Aberdeen in northeast Scotland, after the cold had forced both airports to close on Monday.
‘Like climbing Mont Blanc’
After nearly 40 centimetres (16 inches) of snow fell in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo at the weekend, a woman died in hospital after being hit by a tree that collapsed under the weight of the snow on Monday, according to the police.
Dozens of villages across neighbouring Serbia were left without power in the wake of the snowfall, while downpours caused several rivers to overflow in Bosnia and forced the evacuation of dozens of homes in Albania.

More than 300 schools were shut in Scotland on Tuesday, the national BBC broadcaster reported, with Scottish train services also severely disrupted.
“Tuesday will bring more severe snow and ice to the north of Scotland — and with it, continued travel disruption and risks to people and communities,” Scottish transport minister Fiona Hyslop warned late on Monday.
“It’s important that people plan ahead, consider their travel plans and work from home if that’s an option.” Several smaller French airports were closed on Tuesday, according to the transport ministry.
In the French capital, Monday’s snowfall had settled overnight across much of Paris’s pavements, with pedestrians forced to navigate treacherously icy streets.
Tour guide Valeria Pitchouguina said the sight of Paris snowed under was “truly extraordinary”, but the ice was complicating efforts to shepherd her groups up the steep stepsto the picture-postcard district of Montmartre.
“When it’s like that and snowy and icy, it’s something else, it’s less like climbing Montmartre and more like climbing Mont Blanc,” Pitchouguina told AFPTV.
Hungary meanwhile also braced for a second day of fresh snowfall Tuesday, with some roads and railways already impassable, especially in the northeast.
Construction and Transport Minister Janos Lazar urged Hungarians to only head out “if absolutely necessary”.</p><small>2026-01-06 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06213020fe07708.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965469/somalia-calls-israeli-fm-visit-to-somaliland-an-incursion' target='_blank'><strong>Somalia calls Israeli FM visit to Somaliland an ‘incursion’</strong></a><br><p>The Israeli foreign minister arrived in Somaliland on Tuesday in a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa.
Israel announced last month it was officially recognising Somaliland, a first for the self-proclaimed republic since it declared independence from Somalia in 1991.
Somaliland enjoys a strategic position on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, whose delegation was welcomed at the airport by senior government officials, said recognising Somaliland had been “the moral thing to do”.
Somaliland President Abdirahman Abdullahi Mohamed praised Israel’s “courageous” decision, and said it would open up great economic and development opportunities.
“It promotes the strategic interest partnership of the two countries,” he said in a joint press conference.
Somalia reacted furiously to news of the visit, labelling it an “illegal” and “unauthorised incursion”.
In a statement, Somalia’s foreign ministry said it “reserves the right to take all appropriate diplomatic and legal measures… to safeguard its sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity”.
A special meeting of the African Union Peace and Security Council on Tuesday condemned “in the strongest terms” the recognition by Israel and called for its “immediate revocation”.
During the Israeli delegation’s short stay, sources said roads were blocked, with civilian movements restricted.
Following Israel’s recognition, militant group Al-Shabaab — which has fought the Somali government for around two decades — said they would fight any attempt by Israel to use Somaliland as a base.
‘Threat’ to stability
Analysts say the deal with Somaliland could provide Israel with better access to the Red Sea, enabling it to hit Houthi rebels in Yemen.
Somaliland’s location alongside one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes has made it a key partner for foreign countries.
Israel’s recognition was supported by the United States, but criticised by Egypt, Turkey, the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council and the Saudi-based Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The European Union insisted Somalia’s sovereignty should be respected.
Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud called the Israeli decision a “threat” to stability in the already volatile Horn of Africa.
In an interview with Al Jazeera, he said Somaliland had accepted three conditions from Israel: the resettlement of Palestinians, the establishment of a military base on the Gulf of Aden, and joining the Abraham Accords to normalise ties with Israel.
Somaliland’s foreign ministry denied the first two conditions.
Somaliland has experienced greater stability than the rest of insurgency-hit Somalia.
It was briefly a recognised state in June 1960 when it gained independence from Britain, but voluntarily united with Italian-administered Somalia days later.
Somaliland’s leaders say that the union was never formally ratified and became void when the Somali state effectively collapsed in 1991.
20 nations, OIC reject Israel’s recognition of Somaliland
In December Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in rejecting Israel‘s recognition of self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.
The statement also registered the countries’ rejection of any “potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land”.
The joint statement was issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Iran, Iraq Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye, Yemen and the OIC.</p><small>2026-01-06 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643633-pakistan-may-not-need-imf-after-six-months-as-defence-orders-rise-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan may not need IMF after six months as defence orders rise: minister</strong></a><br><p>

Zaman took the first game 11-9, every point greeted by applause from the home crowd packed in the corridor between the courts at the Creek Club in the port city.
France’s Melvil Scianimanico got his revenge in the second set with a 12-10 win. He then gave an 11-3 thrashing to Zaman, who looked visibly tired in the third set as the crowd of adolescent squash players and global icons like Jahangir Khan watched on, mumbling their own predictions in between shouting praise for the home favourite.
Zaman is no stranger to comebacks, having been crowned the U23 world champion at the same venue in April. He won the fourth set 11-6 and proceeded to demolish the Frenchman 11-6 to win the fifth set and game to cheers from the crowd.
Eleventh seed Zaman will play  Egypt’s Fares Dessouky on Wednesday in the Round of 16. Dessouky is seeded eighth in the tournament and has a world ranking of 15.
“Melvil is a great player and, so is Dessouky; it’ll be a fight to beat him tomorrow the same way I won the match today,” Zaman told Dawn after the match.
“There’s a lot you learn from top-tier championships like this with all the best players in the world,” Zaman said of the PSA Gold level, the first of 2026.
“It feels great to have an event like this in Pakistan after years.”
The biggest upset of the day came from Pakistan’s wildcard entrant Nasir Iqbal, currently ranked number 134 in the world.
The veteran international player was two down before he staged a comeback against world number 45 Moustafa El Sirty of Egypt.
After El Sirty took the first two sets 11-5, 11-8, Iqbal flipped the script and demolished the Egyptian 11-5, 11-9, 11-6 in the next three sets to claim Pakistan’s first win of the day.
Over at the state-of-the-art glass court, Ashab Irfan took an easy 3-0 win over Japan’s Ryunosuke Tsukue with scores of 11-4, 11-6,11-9.
In Wednesday’s Round of 16, Irfan will play top seed Karim Gawad of Egypt.
“He’s literally my squash idol, and to play against him tomorrow, that too at a Gold level PSA event, feels surreal,” a beaming Irfan told Dawn.
Irfan reached a career-high world ranking of 47 late last year after a series of international wins. He recently committed to Trinity College in the US, where he’ll begin this year.
Zaman also climbed to his lifetime best ranking of 37 last year with championship wins in Canada and the US.
“I want to break through to the top 15 world rankings this year,” Zaman said.
Pakistan’s other three players — all wildcard entrants — lost their games and were eliminated from the tournament.

 

Sana Bahadar opened Pakistan’s campaign at the championship in the glass court against Egypt’s Mariam Metwally, who demolished her 11-4, 11-1, 11-6.
Bahadar is the first and only player in Pakistan and across Asia who is fully deaf and can’t speak. She relies on her father, who travels with her for every competition, to translate everything for her and often sign the score to her when it’s not being displayed on a screen.
“I was emotional when I found out Sana is deaf. I’ve never competed against a deaf player before, and it makes me realise how much we take for granted when you see her overcome the obstacles she has to reach this level,” world number 35 Metwally told Dawn after the match.
Mariam Malik faced a similar 3-0 loss against Hong Kong’s Sin Yuk Chan at the same court later in the day.
“It’s definitely a big margin to lose by but it’s also a matter of trust to be playing at a gold level event like this,” Malik told Dawn.
“I can’t remember the last time a Pakistani woman player competed at a competition of this calibre, which helps build up local players like myself and my teammates.”
Tayyab Aslam, also a wildcard entrant, was defeated 3-0 by Spain’s Iker Pajares in 11-6, 11-2, 11-7.</p><small>2026-01-06 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643624-probe-panel-set-up-after-lahore-university-student-jumps-off-roof' target='_blank'><strong>Probe panel set up after Lahore university student 'jumps off roof'</strong></a><br><p>

Due to the closure of the Afghanistan border over recent months, potato prices in Pakistan have plunged to rock-bottom levels.
Independent researchers and farmers across Sahiwal, Okara, Pakpattan, Kasur, and adjoining districts feared the market had already begun to collapse, and in some places, it had collapsed even before the full arrival of the new crop.
Wholesale prices had fallen below production costs, forcing some growers to plough standing crops back into the soil to avoid further losses. Potatoes were being sold in the market at Rs 20–25 per kg in the three districts of the Sahiwal division.
President of the Pakistan Kisan Ittehad, Khalid Mahmood Khokhar, while highlighting the miseries of potato farmers in the districts of Okara, Pakpattan, Sahiwal, Kasur, Khanewal, and Vehari, said they were “ruined”.
Khokhar further noted that a 60 kg bag of potatoes stored in cold storage was selling for only Rs 600–700 in the open market, while transportation costs alone amount to Rs 400.
“As a result, many farmers are unable to sell their produce from cold storage, and potato owners are reluctant to release their stock from cold storage.”
“Farmers,” he said, “have invested Rs 270,000–300,000 per acre in potato cultivation but are unable to recover even their input costs.”
Khokhar added that in the open market, potatoes were being sold at Rs 20–25 per kg, leaving growers with losses of Rs 235,000–250,000 per acre. He declared that 2025 was a “devastating year” for potato farmers in Pakistan.
Pind Sudhar, an organisation conducting independent market analysis and research, has tracked Punjab’s potato economy for over a decade, saying, “Exports without government support are not commercially viable because potatoes are cheap globally, while Punjab’s cost of production is comparatively high.”
“The crisis is fundamentally one of overproduction and inflation of supply,” said CEO Pind Sudhar Rashid Choudhry.
He hinted that private traders and commission agents could not shoulder export risks on their own.
“Transport costs, storage losses and weak prices in regional markets mean that unsubsidised exports often operate at a loss.”
“Last year’s experience underscores the risk that arises when Afghan markets are open: investors bought potatoes from farmers and stored them in anticipation of export demand. Farmers received reasonable prices, but traders suffered heavy losses when prices failed to recover,” said Ahmed Hasan, a large potato grower and cold storage operator from Depalpur, district Okara.
“This year, those investors will likely stay away,” said another cold storage operator in Sahiwal. “Without them, all the excess produce will flood the domestic market,” Ahmed Hasan further added.
The researchers stated the situation was further complicated by uncertainty over trade with Afghanistan. Although exports to Afghanistan historically absorb a relatively small share of Pakistan’s total potato output, their psychological impact on the market has been significant.
They added that open borders encouraged speculative buying and storage, helping stabilise farmgate prices. With Afghan markets unlikely to open fully this season, that buffer has disappeared.
Official figures showed that acreage under potato cultivation this season had risen by about 24pc compared to last year, driven by herd behaviour among farmers seeking returns from an input-intensive but high-output crop.
Production costs compounded the problem. Independent estimates put per-acre cultivation costs at over Rs300,000, significantly higher than official figures of Rs266,000. With farm gate prices falling to Rs10–15 per kg in some markets, growers were incurring losses even before harvest expenses were recovered.
Independent agricultural researchers estimated that Pakistan’s domestic potato demand stood at around 6.2 million tonnes annually, while the current season’s crop was expected to be double of that volume.
Even under optimistic assumptions, including exports of about 350,000 tonnes to Afghanistan and another 400,000 tonnes to other destinations, the surplus would only be temporarily absorbed, stabilising prices for a few weeks at best.
The researchers and farmers argued that the only viable short-term solution was for the Punjab government to procure potatoes directly from farmers and export them with a targeted subsidy.
While such an initiative would require several billion rupees, proponents said that the foreign exchange earned would offset part of the cost and help reduce the trade deficit. Independent researchers cautioned that subsidies alone were not a long-term fix.
They called for demand expansion through food processing, value addition and dietary diversification, alongside better production planning. However, they warned that without immediate action, the damage this season could be irreversible.
In December last year, it was reported that Pakistan’s potato market had crashed as the crop — stored for both exports and domestic consumption — was being offloaded in vegetable markets by farmers and stockists at prices that do not even cover transportation costs and cold storage rent.</p><small>2026-01-06 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06180953074a86d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965461/european-leaders-voice-support-for-denmark-after-trump-claims-on-greenland' target='_blank'><strong>European leaders voice support for Denmark after Trump claims on Greenland</strong></a><br><p>A group of European leaders on Tuesday underlined their support for Denmark after US President Donald Trump again voiced designs on its autonomous Arctic territory of Greenland.
The leaders of France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain as well as Denmark said that sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders were “universal principles, and we will not stop defending them”.
Washington’s military intervention in Venezuela has reignited fears about Trump’s designs on Greenland, which has untapped rare earth deposits and could be a vital player as polar ice melts, opening up new shipping routes.
Greenland is on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the United States, and Washington already has a military base there.
With the situation in Venezuela more pressing, Trump quipped on Sunday that “we’ll worry about Greenland in about two months”.
The European leaders’ joint statement said: “Arctic security remains a key priority for Europe and it is critical for international and transatlantic security.
“NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and European allies are stepping up.
“We and many other allies have increased our presence, activities and investments, to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries.” They stressed that Denmark — including Greenland — was part of NATO.







“Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders,” the leaders said.
“These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.”
The statement was signed by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.
They added that the US was “an essential partner in this endeavour”.
“Greenland belongs to its people. It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,” they said.</p><small>2026-01-06 13:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643574-high-level-senate-delegation-to-visit-us-from-jan-20' target='_blank'><strong>High-level Senate delegation to visit US on Jan 20</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes after Pakistan-US relations saw a notable thaw in 2025, a year marked by high-level engagement, strategic recalibrations, and complex regional developments.
The Secretariat termed the visit a “historic milestone” in Pak–US parliamentary relations, signifying the “beginning of a new institutional chapter in bilateral engagement”.
According to the statement, the visit was organised under the auspices of the Pakistan Policy Institute USA. It will also include the United States–Pakistan Inter-Parliamentary Group for the first time.
“This development represents a major achievement of strategic and non-traditional parliamentary diplomacy,” the statement said, adding that the visit “reflects a shared commitment to strengthening democratic institutions through direct engagement between elected legislatures”.
The Secretariat added that the initiative came at a “critical juncture” of global and regional transformation, particularly in South Asia and the Middle East.
It further said that the visit would be undertaken with clearly defined strategic objectives, including the “establishment of a permanent institutional mechanism” for sustained inter-parliamentary dialogue between the US Congress and the Senate of Pakistan.
“The delegation aims to promote democratic values, exchange best legislative practices, enhance parliamentary oversight, and strengthen institutional cooperation beyond traditional executive-level diplomacy,” it said.
The Secretariat said that the visit would also focus on engaging with the Pakistani-American community to present the country’s parliamentary perspective on regional and global issues, while advancing scientific, cultural, and policy-oriented cooperation.
No Pakistani parliamentary delegation has held formal engagements at the Rayburn House Office Building under the auspices of the US Congress in the 77-year history of Pakistan–US relations.
The Secretariat said that the program would also include a press conference and media engagements at the National Press Club, Washington, D.C., as well as community and policy receptions in New Jersey.
It further said the visit would lay the foundation for regular parliamentary exchanges, enhanced legislative cooperation, and a sustainable institutional partnership between Pakistan and the United States—anchored in mutual respect, democratic principles, and long-term strategic engagement.
In April last year, a US Congressional delegation visited Pakistan, describing their visit as “highly successful and productive”.
The delegation, comprising Congressmen Jack Bergman, Tom Suozzi and Jonathan Jackson, held meetings with senior Pakistani officials, including Field Marshal Asim Munir.</p><small>2026-01-06 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06160008bfbde6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965439/head-smith-centuries-put-australia-in-charge-of-final-ashes-test' target='_blank'><strong>Head, Smith centuries put Australia in charge of final Ashes Test</strong></a><br><p>Run-machine Travis Head hit a swashbuckling 163 and Steve Smith a composed unbeaten 129 as Australia built a 134-run lead over England to seize control on day three of the fifth and final Ashes Test on Tuesday.
It was destructive opener Head’s third ton of the series, to go with the phenomenal match-winning 123 he made in Perth and 170 at Adelaide.
Smith was equally impressive, with his first hundred of the series driving the hosts to 518-7 by stumps at a packed Sydney Cricket Ground in reply to England’s 384.







Beau Webster was alongside him on 42 at the close.
Australia lead the series 3-1 and have already retained the Ashes, with England desperate for another morale-boosting win after victory at the previous Test in Melbourne.
“Nice batting wicket out there. Nice to start my innings on the back of a great innings from Travis Head,” Smith told Fox Sports.
“When you’re out there with him they forget about you and I was able to get into my work. Worked out well today.”
Head brought up three figures off just 105 balls and seemed destined to score 200.
But he came undone in the third over after lunch by the part-time spin of Jacob Bethell, who was bowling for the first time in the series.
In his second over, Bethell trapped the 32-year-old lbw attempting a sweep shot to end a magnificent knock.
Skipper Smith treated Bethell with contempt, launching him for a big six on his way to a 37th Test hundred.
It was Smith’s 13th Ashes century to move past England legend Jack Hobbs. Only Donald Bradman with 19 has more.
Usman Khawaja, in his 88th and last Test after announcing his retirement, fell lbw to Brydon Carse for 17 while Alex Carey made 16 before Josh Tongue enticed an edge.
Nightwatchman Michael Neser made 24 and Cameron Green 37.
“This is proper Test cricket now in terms of the graft and the stuff that you have to put in,” said Bethell, as the tourists attempt to finish a dismal series on a high.
“Yeah, it was a tough day, but you know, that’s what it’s about. We’ve got to come out tomorrow, take those three wickets early on and get back in again.”
Dropped catches
Head resumed on 91 and Neser on one after Jake Weatherald (21) and Marnus Labuschagne (48) were out on Monday.
Head clattered an early midwicket boundary off Ben Stokes and reached three figures with his 17th four, crunched through the covers from Tongue, windmilling his bat in celebration.
It was his 12th century and first in Sydney to cement his reputation as one of the game’s most versatile batsmen.
Head only moved to the top of the order in the second innings of the first Test in Perth due to Khawaja’s back injury, but he has made the position his own.
With his hundred secure, he banged three straight fours off Matthew Potts then had a massive letoff on 121 when he pulled Carse and Will Jacks dropped a sitter near the ropes.
Neser ably stuck around for 90 balls to foil England, who wasted their last two reviews on him.
Batting like a top-order batsman, he smacked four boundaries before getting a thin edge to wicketkeeper Jamie Smith off Carse.
Smith, on 12, was dropped at leg slip by Zak Crawley but safely made it to lunch and passed 50 with a drive down the ground.
When Khawaja departed, Carey produced a series of textbook strokes before being dismissed in similar fashion to his last two Tests.
Unruffled, Smith slammed Stokes to the ropes for four to put Australia in the lead for the first time and, steely eyed, kept going to yet another stylish century.
All-rounder Green came into the Test under increasing pressure after failing to fire with either bat or ball through the series, with his automatic selection being questioned.
He produced a glorious cover drive and a big six to show flashes of what he can do.
But he then needlessly spooned Carse to Ben Duckett in the deep to throw away his wicket.

Strict security arrangements were made by the police when the two reached the court along with their lawyers.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Mansoor Ahmed presided over the hearing, during which the counsel for the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) stated that the investigating officer was busy with proceedings before the Lahore High Court (LHC).
Therefore, the NCCIA counsel asked the court to allow time for producing the record.
Subsequently, Judge Qureshi extended the bail of both TikTokers till January 26 and directed the NCCIA to present the record at the next hearing.
The judge had earlier allowed Butt and Mubarak to leave the courtroom after marking their attendance.

 

The content creators are no strangers to legal trouble.
In September 2025, Butt was booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting online gambling apps in his YouTube and TikTok videos, as well as on Instagram stories for limited periods of time.
Nadeem was also booked by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting gambling apps on his social media, but he was also arrested in September for displaying a fake registration number – ‘IK-804’ – on his car. On being quizzed, he couldn’t satisfy the police with regard to displaying the fake registration number, which is associated with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
Punjab Bar Council restores licence of Rajab Butt’s lawyer
Separately, earlier in the day, the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) restored the practising licence of Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq, the counsel representing Butt.
The decision came a day after LHC’s Justice Malik Awais Khalid heard a petition filed by Advocate Ashfaq challenging the suspension of his licence to practise law. The court had summoned the complete record of the PbBC about the licence suspension and also directed the council’s vice chairman to afford the lawyer an opportunity of a personal hearing and decide the matter by 2pm today.

The PbBC had suspended Ashfaq’s licence on a complaint from the president and general secretary of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) for representing Butt before a Karachi court despite a strike called by the bar.
On Tuesday, PbBC Vice Chairman Muhammad Ashfaq Kahooti said that Ashfaq’s licence had been “restored”. It stated that the same day the complaint against Ashfaq had been received, “a short notice was issued to him and, without affording him a proper opportunity of hearing, his licence to practice as an advocate was suspended” by the bar’s executive committee.
However, the order noted that the objection raised by Ashfaq regarding the lack of authority of the PbBC’s executive committee was “turned down as the said contention is misconceived”.
The vice chairman referred the matter to the council’s disciplinary committee for further proceedings and directed the office to inform the LHC about the decision.
The PbBC order stated that Ashfaq had submitted an application in the shape of an objection petition challenging his licence suspension. His application argued that the December 31 order was a “clear violation” of Article 10-A of the Constitution, as well as the “principles of natural justice, as the order was passed in absentia without providing him an opportunity of hearing”.
Ashfaq further contended that he had not “committed any misconduct either towards the legal fraternity or against the dignity of the legal profession”. The lawyer had described the complaint filed by KBA as “biased, mala fide, and motivated by certain members of its cabinet”.

 

The KBA had called the strike in protest against the alleged victimisation of its former librarian, Naseer Muhammad Kalhoro.
The PbBC’s December 31 order had noted that while defending his client, Ashfaq made statements against the legal fraternity, which the council described as serious professional impropriety.
The PbBC’s executive committee then unanimously decided to suspend Ashfaq’s licence to practice law with immediate effect. It referred the matter to the council’s disciplinary committee for further proceedings regarding the permanent cancellation.
Ashfaq has also been appearing as counsel for former spymaster Faiz Hameed in the trial concluded against him before a military court.</p><small>2026-01-06 09:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/06133114023ced2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452/procurement-of-jf-17-aircraft-comes-under-discussion-during-meeting-between-air-chief-bangladeshi-counterpart' target='_blank'><strong>Procurement of JF-17 aircraft comes under discussion during meeting between air chief, Bangladeshi counterpart</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Bangladesh’s air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.
The JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter was jointly developed by China and Pakistan. The fighter has proved its combat capabilities during two military conflicts with India in 2019 and 2025.

 

The press release issued by ISPR said Bangladesh Air Force Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan called on Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu in Islamabad.
The Bangladeshi air chief led a high-level defence delegation during the visit, it said.
“The meeting focused on strengthening operational cooperation and institutional synergy, with emphasis on training, capacity building, and collaboration in aerospace advancements,” it said.
According to the press release, the visiting air chief was accorded a guard of honour.







Air Chief Marshal Sidhu briefed his Bangladeshi counterpart on PAF’s recent advancements and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Bangladesh Air Force through a comprehensive training framework from basic to advanced flying and specialised courses across PAF institutions, it said.
“He also assured fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem,” it added.
“The Bangladeshi air chief praised PAF’s combat record and expressed interest in benefiting from its operational expertise, seeking assistance in maintenance support for Bangladesh Air Force’s aging fleet and integration of air defence radar systems to enhance air surveillance,” the statement said.
“Detailed discussions were also held on the potential procurement of JF-17 Thunder aircraft,” it said, adding that the delegation also visited key PAF facilities.
“The visit underscored the strong historical ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh and reflected a shared resolve to deepen defence cooperation and build a long-term strategic partnership,” it added.</p><small>2026-01-06 09:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0611360054ff32d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965443/amnesty-says-27th-amendment-part-of-sustained-attack-on-judicial-independence-calls-for-urgent-review' target='_blank'><strong>Amnesty says 27th Amendment part of ‘sustained attack’ on judicial independence, calls for ‘urgent review’</strong></a><br><p>Human rights group Amnesty International on Tuesday said the 27th Constitutional Amendment was the “crescendo of a concerted and sustained attack on the independence of the judiciary, right to fair trial and the rule of law in Pakistan”, calling for an urgent review of the legislation.
The 27th Amendment, passed by Parliament after five days of heated debate, opposition protests, and last-minute revisions, was widely criticised for abolishing judicial independence through the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and introducing changes to the military leadership structure by rewriting Article 243 of the Constitution (command of the armed forces).
In a statement issued on Tuesday, the rights body said the Amendment was a “crescendo of a concerted and sustained attack on the independence of the judiciary, right to fair trial and the rule of law in Pakistan”.







It called on authorities to conduct an urgent review of the Amendment to “ensure that all its provisions fully comply with Pakistan’s international human rights law obligations and commitments”.
It added the Amendment “insulates the president and heads of the naval, armed and air forces from accountability”.
“The Pakistani authorities must immediately take all appropriate measures to safeguard the impartiality, independence and safety of judges, ensuring that they can carry out their judicial functions without any inappropriate or unwarranted interference and any restrictions, improper influences, pressures and threats, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason,” the rights body said.
It noted that the Amendment violated “international human rights law, particularly undermining the independence of the judiciary, right to fair trial and justice and accountability”.
It urged Pakistani authorities to “uphold their international human rights obligations, effectively protect the human rights of everyone in the country, and ensure access to justice and effective remedies for victims, as well as respect the separation of powers and the rule of law”.
Amnesty maintained that the 27th Amendment had ensured the establishment of the FCC, which “lacks independence, erodes judges’ security”.
It noted that despite the Amendment’s “far-reaching consequences”, it was passed through Parliament with “no consultation with civil society and opposition parties”.
It recalled that on the day the Amendment was signed into law, two senior judges of the Supreme Court — Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah — had resigned. It added that two days later, a Lahore High Court had also resigned, referring to ex-judge Shams Mehmood Mirza.
The rights body said the 27th Amendment “further erodes judicial independence,” which it maintained had been “already weakened” by the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which was passed in 2024. It noted that the 26th Amendment was “passed with similar haste, in less than 24 hours in October 2024”.
It added that the composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) — the body responsible for the appointment of judges of the Supreme and high courts — was changed under the 26th Amendment. Members of Parliament were added to the commission and judicial members were reduced to a minority, the statement said, adding that the “change in composition to include the legislature of the JCP risks politicisation” of the appointment of judges.
Amnesty noted that the 26th Amendment transferred “the Supreme Court’s original jurisdiction — the authority to hear cases at its own initiation — and advisory jurisdiction and authority to provide opinion on significant questions of law or public importance referred by the president — to the newly created Constitutional Benches”.
It said that the benches had “exclusive jurisdiction for cases that dealt with the interpretation of the Constitution.”
“A little over a year after the Constitutional Benches were constituted, the twenty-seventh amendment abolished the bench at the Supreme Court level and replaced it with a separate court — the Federal Constitutional Court.”
Concerns about ‘attacks on judiciary’
Amnesty noted that the 26th and 27th Amendments were brought “amid larger concerns regarding attacks on the judiciary”.
It noted that “in the past two years, various judges have raised concerns over interference with the judiciary as well as threats to judges deciding key cases involving the ruling coalition and military.”
The group recalled an open letter written by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — in March 2024.
It said that the letter, which was addressed to the then-chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa, spoke of “intimidation by the military’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), abduction of family members of judges and surveillance in the judge’s private homes as tactics to pressurise them regarding ongoing cases, particularly those related to the former Prime Minister Imran Khan”.
Subsequent to the letter, Amnesty recalled, the case was then taken up by the SC that sought replies from the respective high courts, out of which the Peshawar High Court (PHC) responded that “interference in judicial matters by the executive was an ‘open secret’.”
In its reply, the PHC maintained that judges “faced threats from intelligence agencies while hearing ‘political’ cases. Judges are also subject to threats online and physically”.
The Amnesty statement also recalled an April 2024 incident, where various judges of the SC, as well as the high courts, received letters containing suspicious powder.
It added that in the same month, “an online campaign was launched maligning Justice Babar Sattar of the Islamabad High Court, one of the judges who had written the open letter.”
The rights body continued: “In March 2024, an anonymous complaint was filed against another author of the open letter, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, accusing him of ‘bias’ and ‘favouritism’.”
“It was subsequently not adjudicated upon by the SJC (Supreme Judicial Council).”
Amnesty recalled that another signatory to the letter — Justice Jahangiri — was removed over a case questioning the validity of his law degree in December 2025.
“Justice Jahangiri had raised concerns regarding his trial, arguing that it bypassed the procedure for removal of judges in the Constitution and that the bench hearing his case had [a] conflict of interest, as it included the [Islamabad High Court] Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, against whom Justice Jahangiri had filed a case at the SC challenging his eligibility as chief justice.”
‘Hastily adopted’
Amnesty noted that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk had referred to the 27th Amendment as “hastily adopted” and said that the process of its passing lacked “broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society”.
It said that the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also raised alarm over the hasty passage of the Amendment.
The HRCP, in a statement, had said that the Amendment was passed in “the absence of any meaningful consultation with the political opposition, the wider legal fraternity and civil society”.
“Amnesty International notes that there was no consultation with civil society and the draft was made public only on November 8 when it was presented in the Senate, mere hours after approval from the federal cabinet.”
Detailing further parliamentary proceedings that led to the eventual passing of the Amendment, the rights group said that “at no point during this process were civil society and other stakeholders consulted or given an opportunity to provide feedback on the draft amendment”.
Amnesty also took note of the “contested” composition of the parliament at the time of the passage of the Amendment.
In its statement, Amnesty said, “This amendment was passed at a time when opposition leaders in both houses had been disqualified after their convictions by anti-terrorism courts for alleged involvement in protests following the arrest of Imran on May 9 2023.”
It also recalled the issue of PTI’s reserved seats in the National Assembly (NA).
The PTI was stripped of its election symbol right before the 2024 general elections, following which the party nominees were forced to contest the polls as independent candidates.
The 80 PTI-backed independents in the NA had then joined the Sunni Ittehad Council to be able to claim reserved seats.

 

Amnesty said that in July 2024, a 13-member bench of the Supreme Court also “ruled that the PTI was entitled to its share of reserved seats”.
Had the 2024 judgment been implemented, the PTI-Sunni Ittehad Council bloc would have been the single largest party with 114 seats in the National Assembly, the Amnesty statement said.
“The verdict, however, was challenged at the Constitutional Bench after the 26th Amendment was adopted, and the bench ruled in June 2025 that the party was ineligible for the reserved seats.
“PTI’s reserved seats were then distributed among three parties, PML-N, PPP and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), effectively giving the ruling coalition a two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.”
Implications of FCC’s establishment
Amnesty also raised alarm over the implications resulting from the establishment of the FCC.
The rights group warned of “serious implications for access to justice and human rights as cases relating to the application of fundamental rights under the constitution shall now lie with the new court”.
It further recalled that “powers of the Supreme Court to validate and review bans on political parties imposed by the federal government — under Article 17, which guarantees the right to freedom of association — have been transferred to the Federal Constitutional Court.”
“This has severe implications as the government has publicly made statements intending to ban its largest opposition party, PTI, in the past and the Punjab Assembly has passed a resolution to ban the PTI for being a ‘national security threat’.”
Amnesty said, “The absence of clear rules delineating jurisdiction between the Supreme Court and the Federal Constitutional Courts [also] creates significant confusion on which forum would hear particular cases.”
It added that the ambiguity was “likely to cause procedural delays, to the detriment of litigant’s access to justice.”
Amnesty also warned of the possibility of “further confusion regarding the interpretation of the Constitution since the new court is not bound by past precedent of the Supreme Court”.
It also raised alarm over the process for the appointment of judges to the FCC and noted that the first batch of FCC judges was appointed directly by the executive branch.
“The first batch of judges to the Federal Constitutional Court and its chief justice are to be appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister, bypassing the JCP process under Article 175-A of the Constitution. These initial appointments raise concerns regarding direct political interference by the executive branch.
“Concerns persist for future appointments given the composition of the JCP after the 26th Amendment, as members of Parliament outnumber the judicial members and can thus dictate all future appointments.”
Amnesty quoted the United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers as saying that “there is a risk of court capture when laws establish that political branches should be involved in selecting judges to hear certain politically sensitive cases.”
“Additionally, the president also has powers to determine the number of judges for the new court, allowing the ruling government to change the composition of the court if certain judges are deemed unfavourable,” the rights group said.
These apprehensions deepened when the chief justice and first four judges of the FCC were sworn in on November 14, 2025, less than 24 hours after the 27th Amendment became law,” it added.
“No criteria or justification for the appointments were provided.”
It also took note of the changes made to the process of the transfer of high court judges under Article 200.
The Amendment “gives the president absolute powers to make transfers, subject merely to recommendation from the JCP. The arbitrary and executive-heavy nature of this power now opens the possibility of transfer used as a punitive measure against judges who rule against the Pakistani authorities”.
Amnesty further noted that the Amendment also declared that any judge who refused transfer would be suspended and their case would be reviewed by the SJC, which now has powers to remove them for refusal of transfer under Article 209.
“This is in direct violation of the Basic Principles that state that removal of judges must only be for reasons of ‘incapacity or behaviour that renders them unfit to discharge their duties’,” it said.
Lifetime immunity ‘paves way for unchecked and arbitrary use of power’
Amnesty — referring to the lifetime immunity granted to the president from criminal prosecution and arrest, as well as to the ranks of Field Marshal, Marshal of Air Force and Admiral of the Fleet under the 27th Amendment — said that the absolute lifetime immunity for such positions “paves the way for unchecked and arbitrary use of power and disregard for the rule of law.”
The group warned that “the wide-ranging nature of the immunity violates the fundamental principle of equality before the law enshrined in Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights”.
It also noted that the clause violated the “right to remedy under Article 2(3) for anyone pursuing legal recourse under criminal law for actions done by these officials”.
Amnesty maintained that while immunity was permissible under international law, it still had limits, “particularly in cases of war crimes and major violations”.
“The International Court of Justice has also held that immunity only extends for ‘officials acts’, and serious international crimes cannot be regarded as official acts,” it added.
Amnesty also noted that military officials with the ranks of Field Marshal, Marshal of Air Force and Admiral of the Fleet had been declared “national heroes” under the 27th Amendment and “‘shall not be removed from office except on the ground or charges and in the manner provided under Article 47’, which deals with the removal and impeachment of the president who can only be removed on grounds of ‘physical or mental incapacity’, for violating the Constitution, or ‘gross misconduct’ as well as a resolution by two-thirds or more of the membership of Parliament”.
“It bears noting that the current chief of army staff was appointed as Field Marshal after the conflict with India in May 2025, and stands to benefit directly from these protections,” Amnesty said.</p><small>2026-01-06 08:39</small></div><hr>
