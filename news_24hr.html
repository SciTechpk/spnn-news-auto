Neither Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson nor Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker have been accused of criminal wrongdoing, though both have emerged as prominent opponents of Trump’s immigration crackdown and deployment of National Guard troops in Democratic-leaning cities.
Trump’s call to imprison the two elected officials comes as another high-profile political rival, former FBI director James Comey, appeared in court to face criminal charges that have been widely criticised as flimsy.
Donald Trump has frequently called for jailing his opponents since he first entered politics in 2015, but Comey is the first to face prosecution. On his social media platform, the president accused Johnson and Pritzker of failing to protect immigration officers who have been operating in Chicago.
“The Chicago mayor should be in jail for failing to protect Ice officers! Governor Pritzker also!” Trump wrote, referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel.
‘ICE free zone’
Johnson signed an executive order on Monday creating an “ICE Free Zone” that prohibits federal immigration agents from using city property in their operations.
Hundreds of Texas National Guard soldiers have gathered at an army facility outside Chicago, over the objections of Pritzker, Johnson and other Democratic leaders in the state. Trump has threatened to deploy troops to more cities, which he said last week could serve as “training grounds” for the armed forces.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday found most Americans oppose the deployment of troops without an external threat.
Trump has ordered National Guard troops to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, following his earlier deployments to Los Angeles and Washington. In each case, he has defied staunch opposition from Democratic mayors and governors, who say Trump’s claims of lawlessness and violence do not reflect reality.
“My goal is very simple. STOP CRIME IN AMERICA!” he wrote on his social media platform.
Violent crime has been falling in many US cities since a Covid-era spike, and National Guard troops have so far been largely used to protect federal facilities, not fight street crime.
Protests over Trump’s immigration policies in Chicago and Portland had been largely peaceful and limited in size, far from the conditions described by Trump administration officials.
“What we have going on right now is literally domestic terrorism in Chicago,” Todd Blanche, the No. 2 Justice Department official, said on Fox News.
Pritzker has accused Trump of trying to foment violence to justify further militarisation, and his state has sued to stop the deployment. A federal judge on Monday permitted the deployment to proceed for the time being. Another federal judge has blocked the deployment to Portland. Trump has threatened to invoke an anti-insurrection law to sidestep any court orders blocking him, which was last invoked during the Los Angeles riots of 1992.

The deal, to be signed Thursday, includes the release of captives and prisoners as well as a surge of aid into Gaza after more than two years of genocide after Tel Aviv started bombing the Palestinian enclave following Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel.

Key developments

US President Trump says Hamas will release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line
Source says Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners
Trump thanks mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye; earlier said he may travel to Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”


Palestinian group Hamas would release all captives while Israel would pull its troops back to an agreed on line, US President Donald Trump said after talks in Egypt on his 20-point peace plan resulted in a deal.
Qatar said the deal was the “first phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement, which will lead to ending the war, the release of Israeli captives and Palestinian prisoners, and the entry of aid”.
Hamas will exchange 20 living captives for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as part of the first phase of a deal, a source within the group told AFP Thursday.
The exchange will take place within 72 hours of the implementation of the agreement, which is expected to be signed on Thursday, the source familiar with the negotiations said.
The captives will be released in exchange for 250 Palestinians sentenced to life imprisonment and 1,700 others arrested by Israel since the war began, the source added.
 
 

The Israeli military said that Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir instructed forces to prepare strong defenses and be ready for any scenario and to prepare to lead the operation for the captives’ return with sensitivity and professionalism, following the announcement of the Gaza ceasefire agreement
“I am very proud to announce that Israel and Hamas have both signed off on the first phase of our Peace Plan,” Trump said on his Truth Social network.
“This means that ALL of the hostages will be released very soon, and Israel will withdraw their Troops to an agreed upon line as the first steps toward a Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace.”
Trump also thanked mediators Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye, adding: “BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS!”
 






He also told Reuters that a Gaza hostages-for-ceasefire deal hammered out in Egypt represented “a great day for the world”.
“The whole world has come together on this one, Israel, every country has come together. This has been a fantastic day,” Trump told Reuters in a brief telephone interview.
“This is a great day for the world. This is a wonderful day, a wonderful day for everybody,” he said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would bring the Israeli captives home “with God’s help”.
 






In a separate post on X, he said: “With the approval of the first phase of the plan, all our hostages will be brought home.”
“Through steadfast resolve, powerful military action, and the great efforts of our great friend and ally President Trump, we have reached this critical turning point,” he said, thanking the US president for “his leadership, his partnership, and his unwavering commitment to the safety of Israel and the freedom of our hostages”.
 






Trump said earlier that he may travel to the Middle East this week as a deal was “very close”.
In a dramatic moment, AFP journalists saw US Secretary of State Marco Rubio interrupt an event at the White House and hand Trump an urgent note about the progress of the negotiations in Egypt.
“I may go there sometime toward the end of the week, maybe on Sunday,” Trump said, adding that he was “most likely” to turn up in Egypt but would also consider going to war-torn Gaza.
 






Trump’s plan called for a ceasefire, the release of all the captives held in Gaza, Hamas’s disarmament and a gradual Israeli withdrawal from the territory.
Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff arrived at the talks earlier.
An Israeli government spokesperson said the captives release was expected to begin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Trump told Fox News’ ‘Hannity’ programme on Wednesday that captives held in Gaza will probably be released on Monday.
 






‘Optimism prevails’
As night fell in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, an AFP contributor described an atmosphere of anticipation before the announcement, with joyful chants of “Allahu akbar”, and some celebratory gunfire into the air.
“We’re closely following every bit of news about the negotiations and the ceasefire,” said 50-year-old Mohammed Zamlot, who had been displaced from northern Gaza.
Hamas had submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners it wants released from Israeli jails in the first phase of the truce.
 
 

In exchange, Hamas is set to free the remaining 47 captives, both alive and dead, who were seized in its October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.
Qatar’s prime minister and Turkey’s intelligence chief were also expected at the talks on Wednesday.
Hamas said it would be joined by delegations from Islamic Jihad — which has also held some of the captives in Gaza — as well as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
The negotiations were taking place under the shadow of the second anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, which has killed at least 67,183 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures the United Nations considers credible.
The territory’s civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas’s authority, said the bombardment of Gaza had not stopped in the hours before the deal. An AFP journalist in Israel near the Gaza border reported hearing multiple explosions in the morning.
Protests, prisoners
Global pressure to end the conflict has escalated, with much of Gaza flattened, a UN-declared famine unfolding and Israeli captive families still longing for their loved ones’ return.
One key to the negotiations was the names of the Palestinian prisoners Hamas pushed for.
High-profile inmate Marwan Barghouti — from Hamas’s rival, the Fatah movement — is among those the group wanted to see released, according to Egyptian state-linked media.
Hamas’s top negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, also said the group wants “guarantees from President Trump and the sponsor countries that the war will end once and for all”.
Arab countries say plan must lead to Palestinian state
The next phase of Trump’s plan calls for an international body led by Trump and including former British prime minister Tony Blair to play a role in Gaza’s post-war administration.
Arab countries which back the plan say it must lead to eventual independence for a Palestinian state, which Netanyahu says will never happen.
There is no clear indication who will rule Gaza when the war ends. Netanyahu, Trump, Western and Arab states have ruled out a role for Hamas, which has run Gaza since driving out Palestinian rivals in 2007.
 
 

Hamas has said it would relinquish Gaza governance only to a Palestinian technocrat government supervised by the Palestinian Authority and backed by Arab and Muslim countries.
It rejects any role for Blair or foreign rule of Gaza.
Global outrage has mounted against Israel’s assault. Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel calls its actions self-defence after the 2023 Hamas attack.</p><small>2025-10-09 03:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/09074937d2d1a37.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947564/afghan-fm-muttaqi-heads-for-first-visit-to-india-to-foster-ties-abroad' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan FM Muttaqi heads for first visit to India to foster ties abroad</strong></a><br><p>KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi left for New Delhi on Wednesday, the ministry said, in what would be the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since they seized power in 2021.
Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi will hold talks with Indian Foreign Minister Subra­hmanyam Jaisha­nkar and other officials on political, economic and trade issues, the Afghan foreign ministry added.
The visit comes just a day after Muttaqi attended a regional meeting in Moscow where Afgha­nistan’s neighbours including Pakistan, Iran, China and several Central Asian countries issued a joint statement opposing the deployment of foreign military infrastructure in the region. The statement was regarded as a signal of opposition to US President Donald Trump’s stated objective to retake control of the Bagram military base near Kabul.
So far, Russia is the only country to have formally recognised the Taliban administration.
Historically, India and Afghanistan had friendly relations but New Delhi shut its embassy in Kabul after the 2021 US withdrawal from the war-shattered country and the return to power of the Taliban.
India opened a small mission a year later to facilitate trade, medical support and humanitarian aid.
New Delhi does not officially recognise the Taliban government but has taken tentative steps to thaw ties with meetings and talks between senior officials in their respective foreign ministries.
Muttaqi’s trip was made possible after the UN Security Council Com­mittee temporarily lifted a travel ban on him to allow diplomatic engagements abroad, India’s foreign ministry said last week.
Discussions during Muttaqi’s trip will centre on bilateral cooperation, trade exchanges, exports of dry fruit, facilities in the health sector, consular services and various ports, the Afghan Taliban foreign ministry said last week.
Bar on social media
On the other hand, access to several social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat, have been “intentionally restricted” in Afghanistan, internet watchdog NetBlocks said on Wednesday.
Social media sites have been intermittently accessible on smartphones since Tuesday, AFP journalists reported, a week after a 48-hour nationwide internet and phone blackout was imposed by Taliban authorities.
“The restrictions are now confirmed on multiple providers, the pattern shows an intentional restri­ction,” said NetBlocks, a watchdog organisation that monitors cybersecurity and internet governance.
The disruption is “primarily impacting mobile with some fix-lines also affected”.

• PPP calls meeting of top decision-making forum on Karsaz blast anniversary
• Political observers say tiff is ‘anything but scripted’
FOR several days, political stakeholders and observers — both inside and outside parliament — have been asking the same question: is the current animosity between ruling allies PPP and PML-N a genuine tiff or a scripted dispute?
While speculation has been rife over what actually sparked the bad blood between both parties, the events of Wednesday night clearly indicated that the disagreement had caused enough ‘trouble in paradise’ for the ruling party to dispatch its ‘A-Team’ in an attempt to win over President Asif Ali Zardari.
Sources in the capital told Dawn that a delegation was heading to Nawabshah by special plane. Later, a statement from the Presidency said that Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq called on the president on Wednesday night.
 
 

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi — who was earlier summoned to Karachi by the president to help — was also present in the meeting.
The development came swiftly on the heels of an announcement by the PPP that it would convene its Central Executive Committee — the party’s top decision-making forum — on Oct 18 to discuss the political situation in the country.
That the meeting was being called on the anniversary of the Karsaz bombing that targeted the late Benazir Bhutto’s homecoming parade in 2007 was being seen as quite significant, leading many to believe that the party may arrive to some momentous decision at the gathering.
While there were no details given by either side about the emergent meeting with President Zardari, many observers believed that the decision to send a team to mend fences with the PPP leader must have been endorsed by Nawaz Sharif after his younger brother prevailed upon him to help bring down political temperatures.
Origins of dispute
Before the PML-N dispatched its top men to Nawabshah, ostensibly to negotiate a rapprochement, background discussions with PML-N and PPP leaders indicated that the tiff was quite serious, and “anything but scripted”.
The PML-N camp was of the view that the crisis was precipitated when the PPP crossed the line by targeting Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
“Maryam Nawaz is PML-N’s redline,” a party insider said, quite categorically.
However, being a prudent political party, the PML-N is always ready to go the extra mile to settle a political score, and this is what exactly happening at the moment, the PML-N leader says.
The PPP, meanwhile, blames their ally of being so “touchy” that even a “prudent suggestion” like using the Benazir Income Support Programme to provide immediate relief to the flood victims was taken as an attack.
“So much so that CM Maryam entered the fight herself … and deliberately chose to tease the PPP by reviving the thorny issue of six canals to water Cholis­tan,” a party leader said.
An escalation of ‘hostilities’ in recent days, in the words of another PPP leader, indicated the party’s belief that it was necessary to match the PML-N harsh tone.
However, party sources maintain that PPP Chair­man Bilawal Bhutto-Zar­da­­ri has deliberately kept his distance from the unfolding situation, choosing to remain silent on the matter — though he is closely monitoring developments.
Way forward?
Amid these tensions, the PPP is said to be receiving several proposals – from all quarters — about potentially reviewing it’s support for the PML-N in the Centre. Even in Punjab too, a proposal was floated that the PPP, with around a dozen seats in the Punjab Assembly, should sit on the opposition benches.
But as things stand, there seems to be little chance of the two allies disbanding their relationship, as those who have brokered this alliance will not allow it, insiders opined.
Although PPP lawmakers would love nothing better than to sit on the opposition benches, rather than being beholden to the whims and wishes of CM Maryam, they are seemingly content to flip the script and paint the acrimony as a cover for a ‘niece-uncle jealousy’.
In the words of Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) chief Ahmad Bilal Mehboob, both parties have been bitter rivals in the past, and may yet be rivals again when the next election rolls around.
“This time, the pitch of criticism is higher and even Bilawal and Maryam have gotten involved,” he noted.
When asked to comment on what may have triggered the bad blood, Mr Mehboob said that CM Maryam’s hyper-dynamism regarding the floods may have provoked a sense of competition, and to some extent, jealousy among leaders from Sindh.
“This competition between the two largest provincial governments is healthy and should be welcomed. However, the language used on both sides sometime crosses the line, and may leave lasting scars on interprovincial relations, he said, predicted that some kind of ceasefire would be on the cards with the intervention of Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif.
However, in his view, by projecting the PPP as a genuine opposition force, the party may be trying to diminish the relevance of Imran Khan’s PTI as the main opposition.
This view is echoed by political commentator, Dr Rasul Bakhsh Raees, who sees it as an attempt to crowding out the PTI from political discourse.
The PPP thinks that it is good time for it to present itself as an opposition to the PML-N — allowing it to achieve two objectives — maintaining its political dominance while also trying to capture some of the PTI’s constituency in Punjab, he opined.

The prolonged closure had severely impacted the lives and livelihoods of residents on both sides of the border, particularly those living in the remote areas of Mashkel.
The reopening follows persistent efforts and demands by local leadership, including MPA Mir Zabid Ali Reki of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, and other community leaders.
A resolution urging the federal authorities to reopen the border was also passed in the Balochistan Assembly.
The inauguration ceremony was led by Inspector General of Frontier Corps (South) Balochistan, Maj Gen Bilal Sarfraz, who formally reopened the Katager Zero Point gate to public movement and trade. He was joined by MPA Reki and a large gathering of local officials, religious scholars, and residents.
The JUI-F leader said the reopening was a moment of immense relief for the people of Mashkel.
“Residents will now be able to travel to and conduct business with neighbouring Iran without difficulty,” he said.
He also highlighted the critical importance of the Guzzar border point, which remained closed, saying it played a vital role in the economic sustenance of thousands of families in Mashkel and surrounding areas.
“The continued closure of the Guzzar border has caused significant hardship,” he said.
Later, the IGFC assured the public that efforts were underway to reopen the Guzzar border this month.

• Islamabad must furnish verified estimates of flood-related losses, ensure provinces will absorb these costs from own resources
• Govt moves on asset declarations to meet IMF benchmarks
ISLAMABAD: An Interna­t­ional Monetary Fund (IMF) staff mission on Wednesday concluded talks with Pakistani authorities on reviews of two lending programmes totalling $8.4 billion without announcing a staff-level agreement, though official channels insisted there was no immediate plan to burden taxpayers with fresh measures.
Sources said another round of discussions may take place on the margins of the World Bank-IMF annual meetings in Washington in the coming days to resolve the last-mile issues.
 
 

Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb is scheduled to depart for the United States later this week with a delegation that includes the finance secretary, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman.
Officials said Islamabad would have to provide verified estimates of flood-related losses and ensure that provinces would absorb these costs from their own resources without compromising cash surplus commitments to the Centre. For the current fiscal year, Punjab is required to provide a cash surplus of Rs740bn, followed by Rs370bn by Sindh, Rs220bn by Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa, and Rs185bn by Balochistan.
Sources said that, against this backdrop, the IMF mission did not hold a formal wrap-up meeting with the finance minister before leaving, although both sides met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, given his recent engagements with the IMF managing director to discuss flexibility in light of the flood damage.
A select team of the IMF mission had reportedly called on the minister on Monday, the sources said.
The visiting team, led by mission chief Iva Petrova, did not issue a customary end-of-mission statement, and its representative office did not respond to requests for comment.
Official sources, however, claimed that the talks were “smooth” so far, and there was no immediate need for additional tax measures to bridge the shortfall, although the tax target might have to be revised depending on the first-quarter GDP data, due in the last week of December.
At that time, the question of fresh measures or changes in rates would become due with effect from Jan 1, 2026, to cover lapses in the first half of the fiscal year in view of the biannual nature of the review.
Civil servants to declare assets
Separately, the government on Wednesday notified draft amendments to the Sharing of Assets of Civil Servants Rules, 2023, to comply with the IMF’s demand for governance reforms, under which all Grade 17 and above public servants across federal, provincial and local level and state-owned enterprises would be required to file their electronic returns of assets and incomes for public review through the FBR.
The draft rules, however, exempted serving officers of the armed forces.
The FBR has invited public comments within seven days to comply with the IMF deadline. Under these rules, all public servants who include officers of federal or provincial governments or autonomous bodies, corporations and companies owned by such governments having Grade 17 or above would need to file an electronic declaration in the format agreed to by the SBP and FBR.
However, these declarations would not be publicly available, as the relevant banks would be required to ensure a pre-notified, secure, and single authorised email address that would be under the control and responsibility of the bank’s head of compliance for authorisation, use, and security of data.
The banks would share with the FBR the credentials of designated focal persons to ensure the secrecy of information. All required information would be transmitted in abridged form.
However, this requirement of electronic returns and declarations would not apply to people exempted under the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.
According to the ordinance, this exemption applies to a “person who is a member of any of the armed forces of Pakistan except a person who is, or has been a member of the said forces and is holding, or has held, a post or office in any public corporation, bank, financial institution, undertaking or other organisation established, controlled or administered by or under the federal government or a provincial government or, notwithstanding anything contained in the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 (XXXIX of 1952) or any other law for the time being in force, a person who is a civilian employee of the armed forces of Pakistan”.

Mr Gandapur, who has been in Islamabad for the past several days, is thou­ght to have been trying to meet the PTI founder.
Sources said that soon after the party’s announcement that he would be replaced, the strongman from Dera Ismail Khan tried to secure a meeting with the party founder to make a last-ditch attempt to save his seat. However, things did not pan out that way, and he had to bow out.
 
 

“I held the KP chief ministership in trust for Imran Khan, and am returning it to him after tendering my resignation,” he posted on social media on Wednesday.
PTI insiders told Dawn that Mr Gandapur has decided to go down without a fight that may create further problems for the embattled party. “He will make a smooth transition,” an insider told Dawn.
Speculation about a possible change at CM House had been rife. Although there was no official word, sources close to Sohail Afridi — the new CM-in-waiting — had left it be known that he had been tapped for the top spot.
 
 

Mr Afridi is said to be Bushra Bibi’s pick to run the province.
Those privy to matters confided that while Imran Khan’s spouse and sister rarely see eye to eye, they had a rare convergence of opinion on Mr Gandapur, with both agreeing to the need for his ouster.
Sources in the PTI said the party chief Imran Khan had made up his mind about Ali Amin’s removal after the November 26 march on the federal capital, when Mr Gandapur mysteriously disappeared from Islamabad, leaving confused workers behind.
He subsequently met Imran Khan several times in his prison cell and bought time by assuring him that he would be the one to fulfil his (Imran’s) agenda.
They said that the decision to remove Mr Gandapur was entirely Mr Khan’s decision and he had not consulted anyone in the party on the subject.
Sources said that the resignation of Mr Gandapur would certainly bring down the number of differences and groupings within the party.
President of the KP chapter of PTI Junaid Akbar, MNA Atif Khan and MNA and former speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaiser, who are through to be in the opposing camp, congratulated the chief minister-designate Afridi and assured him of their full support.
Talking to Dawn, MNA Atif Khan said that they would fully support the new chief minister in the larger interest of the province and its people, and would help him in the implementation of Imran Khan’s vision.
Mr Afridi was appointed provincial minister for the higher education department a week ago (on October 1). Before this appointment, he was serving as special assistant to the chief minister on the works and communication department.
If installed, Mr Afridi would be the first chief minister from the former tribal regions. He has a Master’s in Economics from the University of Peshawar. During his student life, he remained a die-hard activist of the Insaf Students Federation and later became its chairman.
He has also served as the PTI’s youth wing provincial president. He won the election from PK-70 tribal district Khyber in the previous general elections held on February 8, 2024.

Ali Amin Gandapur

• MPA Sohail Afridi picked to replace Gandapur as chief minister
• Outgoing CM claims he steered KP to financial stability, countered militancy with courage
• Raja says decision based on ‘poor security situation in KP’; Gohar rules out presence of ‘forward bloc’ in the party
• PTI mulling registration of ‘two party names’ with ECP to circumvent any adverse moves
ISLAMABAD: Ali Amin Gandapur stepped down as the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Wednesday after incarcerated PTI leader Imran Khan ordered him to resign, apparently due to the deteriorating law and order in the province.
PTI MPA from Khyber Sohail Afridi will replace Mr Gandapur as the chief executive of the restive province, confirmed party leader Salman Akram Raja in a media interaction.
The removal of the KP CM comes amid a growing rift within the KP’s ruling party, which has pitted Mr Gandapur against Imran’s sister Aleema Khan — as both sides recently having gone public with their reservations against each other.
In the resignation letter released to the media on Wednesday evening, Mr Gandapur said it was his ‘honour’ to resign in compliance with the orders of his leader, Imran Khan.
“When I took over as [the] chief minister, the province was faced with a dual challenge of financial ruin and menace of terrorism. Over the last one and a half years…we steered the province to financial stability and countered the threat of militancy with resolute courage and unwavering decision-making. We initiated mega projects of nation-building in a province that was militarily categorised as a war zone.”
 

Sohail Afridi

“I thank all my cabinet colleagues, members of the assembly — both from PTI as well as opposition — and all KP bureaucrats who helped me face extraordinary challenges of governance in KP. I may not be able to claim with certainty that I did well on all these challenges, but one thing that I can say with utmost certainty is that I served the people of KP with absolute sincerity and always acted in the best interests of Pakistan,” he wrote.
Earlier in the day, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja told reporters that the decision to remove Mr Gandapur had been made by the jailed party chief.
Speaking to the media in Rawalpindi, Mr Raja announced that as per the directions of the founding chairman, Mr Gandapur would be replaced by MPA Sohail Afridi.
Replying to questions, he claimed that Imran Khan had informed him about the background of the decision and instructed him to brief the media.
He said terrorism was badly affecting KP and a record number of incidents were being reported. He said that Mr Khan was very perturbed by the situation, especially the recent incident in the Orakzai district, and he had no choice but to change the CM.
Mr Raja also said that the PTI founder had been continuously saying that the policies of the federal government were ‘wrong’ and the KP government should distance itself from them.
‘No forward bloc’
Dawn.com quoted PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar as saying that the decision regarding the replacement of the KP CM would not lead to any forward blocs in the party.
“Khan’s instructions will be acted on. Ali Amin Gandapur will depart for Peshawar in half an hour and send his resignation via summary to the governor tomorrow. Everyone will support the PTI government that will be formed as per Khan’s instructions,” he said earlier in the day.
The interim PTI chairman said he wanted to make it ‘clear’ that there was ‘no forward bloc’ in the party. Mr Gohar said the party would maintain its two-thirds majority in KP with 91 MPAs.
Mr Gohar added that Mr Gandapur had clearly said that he was the chief minister only as long as Imran’s trust was reposed in him.
PTI to register more parties
Separately, the PTI has also been deliberating a decision to register one or two political parties to circumvent any adverse situation like the one it had encountered during the Feb 8 elections.
Sources told Dawn it was being considered to register one or two political parties to avoid any untoward situation in the future. The names which are being considered are ‘Tehreek-i-Insaf Pakistan’ and ‘Insaf Pakistan’ etc.
According to sources, the new party or parties will have separate chairmen so that in case of the disqualification of one party’s chairman, the other party would be available to contest elections. PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser confirmed to Dawn that the idea was under consideration and that they were working on different names.

In a post on X following today’s surprise developments, Gandapur said: “In respectful compliance of the orders of my leader … Imran Khan, it is my honour to tender my resignation.”
 


He also attached a copy of his resignation sent to KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi.
“When I took over as chief minister, the province was faced with a dual challenge of financial ruin and menace of terrorism. Over the last one and a half year, with the support of my cabinet, our party members and workers, my team of bureaucracy and above all, guidance of Imran Khan, we steered the province to financial stability and countered the menace of militancy with resolute courage and unwavering decision-making. We initiated mega projects of nation-building in a province that was militarily categorised as a warzone,” the letter said.
Gandapur thanked his cabinet colleagues, assembly members of both the PTI and the opposition and all officers of the KP bureaucracy, who he said helped him face “extraordinary challenges of governance” in the province.
 
 

“I may not be able to claim with certainty that I did well on all those challenges but one thing that I can say with utmost certainty is that I served with absolute sincerity to the people of KP and always acted in the best interest of Pakistan.”
An earlier post on Gandapur’s official Facebook account, later deleted, quoted him as saying: “The role of the chief minister was Imran Khan sahib’s amaanat (entrustment) and as per his order, I am returning his amaanat and submitting my resignation.”
 


PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram also shared the same statement on X, attributed to Gandapur.
 


Earlier, PTI also confirmed the development on its official X account: “Ali Amin Gandapur has resigned as per Imran Khan’s directive.”
 


A short while before Gandapur’s statement, PTI Secretary General Raja said “this is correct” when asked by a reporter in Rawalpindi if MPA Afridi had been decided as the next chief minister.
 






Addressing a media briefing later, Raja stated that the decision was made by Imran, who he said told him about the “background of this in detail and also ordered me to put this before you”.
The PTI leader said there will be no vote of no-confidence against Gandapur as Imran had ordered him to resign. He pointed out that the PTI had a “clear majority” in the KP Assembly through which Afridi would be elected as the next chief minister.
Asked about the possibility of Gandapur refusing to resign, Raja said, “Ali Amin  is loyal to the party. Imran Khan has expressed good sentiments for him. There is no reason that Ali Amin will not follow Khan sahib’s order.”
Raja also quoted Imran as raising concerns over the spike in terrorism in PTI-ruled KP.
He said: “There is the worst terrorism situation in KP. There have been record incidents this year […] the lives lost and martyrdoms so far, there is no example found of this.”
“Khan sahib is very sad, the incident that happened in Orakzai, Khan sahib said there is no choice for him now, but to make the change [in KP CM].”
He further quoted Imran as highlighting that for over two years, he had the stance that the federal government’s policies were “very wrong” and the KP government “should disassociate itself from it”.
 


Raja stressed that Imran “repeatedly said there are three stakeholders and until they were involved, there would not be peace in KP and Pakistan”, specifying the parties as the residents of tribal areas, the Afghan government and the Afghan people.
“The way we humiliated Afghan refugees and cast them out from Pakistan, we have sown such a hate of which there was no need, after hosting them for 40 years, […] and is unforgivable in the eyes of Imran Khan,” the PTI leader said.
He also criticised the federal government for not “maintaining contact” with the Afghan interim set-up.
 
 

Raja said Imran was “sad and angry’’ that his vision was not acted on and the KP government could not “distance itself from the policies of the federal government and agencies the way it was necessary’’.
Criticising the cycle of violence involving military action and reprisals, he said there was only one way to end the menace of terrorism and that was to “sit and look at the issue in its wider context’’.
 
 

Raja said Imran had the expectation that the new KP setup under Afridi would herald ‘‘a new beginning and there will be wise talk of mutual understanding’’. He added that jirgas and tribes would be asked for help, and a solution would be provided to the province’s issues.
“Khan has affirmed the intent of adopting better policies from now on at the federal government level and the provincial government can provide guidance on this matter. It is the expectation of Imran Khan that Sohail Afridi will guide and advise the federal government and make it understand how to establish peace in the region and act on Imran Khan’s vision.”
“There was a perception created that our provincial government was a helper of the federal government’s misplaced policies, so the expectation from Sohail Afridi is he will distance himself and clearly say we don’t support the federal government’s policies,’’ Raja added.
‘Not a result of rift with Aleema’
However, Raja refuted speculation that the decision was a result of the recent dispute between Gandapur and Imran’s sister Aleema Khan.
“Imran Khan also expressed good intentions for Ali Amin. He thinks it will also be good for Ali Amin to leave the office and become part of politics that is politics of the people of KP,” he said.
Today’s development comes about a week after the PTI found itself embroiled in another controversy after Aleema and Gandapur exchanged grave allegations, with the latter accusing Imran’s sister of provoking rifts in the party.
The argument started with Aleema claiming that Gandapur had told her imprisoned brother that she was trying to hijack the PTI with the help of the Military Intelligence (MI) and the “establishment”. She made these remarks only a day after Gandapur met the ex-premier in jail for more than two hours and left the premises without speaking to the media persons.
In a video statement in response to Aleema’s allegations, Gandapur claimed that campaigns were being carried out to declare her the PTI chairperson. He acknowledged telling Imran that the party was being harmed by these campaigns and agendas.
The claims made by Aleema — who came to the limelight after her brother was jailed in August 2023 and regularly meets him at Adiala jail — and Gandapur strengthened speculations about a severe rift between the PTI and Imran’s family members.
In June, the midnight passage of the KP fiscal budget also exposed deep divisions within the PTI.
Gandapur initially said his government would follow Imran’s directives on the budget and meet with him to secure the approval. However, days later on June 24, the provincial assembly bulldozed cut motions on demands for grants and greenlit the budget without Gandapur being able to meet the PTI founder.
The passage was met with surprise from key PTI leaders, including Raja and ex-KP finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra, who said the approval could have been extended till June 27 at least.
Gandapur justified the approval, saying that any delay could have paved the way for the imposition of governor’s rule in the province.
Gohar says Imran’s orders to be acted on
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar said, while talking to the media in Islamabad, that once Imran’s instructions were delivered, no other party body could contradict them but had to act on them.
“Khan’s instructions will be acted on. Ali Amin Gandapur will depart for Peshawar in half an hour and send his resignation via summary to the governor tomorrow. Everyone will support the PTI government that will be formed as per Khan’s instructions.’’
He said he wanted to make it “clear’’ that there was ‘‘no forward bloc’’ in the party. Gohar said the party would maintain its two-third majority in KP with 91 MPAs.
Gohar added that Gandapur had clearly said that he was the chief minister only as long as Imran’s trust was reposed in him. He also praised him for his performance in the top provincial office, saying he had worked day and night for the party, government and people.

A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that last night, security forces conducted an IBO in Orakzai district on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khawarij.
Fitna Al Khawarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of operation, 19 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell due to effective engagement by own troops,” the ISPR said.
It added that during the exchange of fire, 39-year-old Lieutenant Colonel Junaid Tariq, who was leading his troops from the front, and his second-in-command, 33-year-old Major Tayyab Rahat, embraced martyrdom along with nine of their men.
The soldiers were identified as 38-year-old Naib Subedar Azam Gul, 35-year-old Naik Adil Hussain, 34-year-old Naik Gul Ameer, 31-year-old Lance Naik Sher Khan, 32-year-old Lance Naik Talish Faraz, 32-year-old Lance Naik Irshad Hussain, 28-year-old Sepoy Tufail Khan, 23-year-old Sepoy Aqib Ali and 24-year-old Sepoy Muhammad Zahid.
The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area. It further stated that security forces were “determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve”.
Funeral prayers were offered for the two officers in Rawalpindi’s Chaklala district, which were attended by Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, federal ministers and military and civic officials, the ISPR said in a later statement.
“The prime minister, while paying tribute to the 11 shuhadas (martyrs) of [the] Orakzai incident, resolved that [the] Pakistani nation stands resolute and firm against this menace of terrorism and the shuhadas’ ultimate sacrifice is a reminder of the unwavering resolve of the nation to defend the motherland at all costs,” the statement read, adding that the remaining nine martyrs would be laid to rest in their native towns with full military honours.

PM Shehbaz paid tributes to the country’s security forces for killing 19 terrorists and also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the soldiers, including Lieutenant Colonel Arif and Major Rahat, according to a statement issued by the prime minister’s office.
“The sacrifices of the fearless sons of security forces will never go in vain,” he said.
“We will crush the nefarious intentions of Indian-backed terrorists. We will not allow elements that harm Pakistan’s integrity to succeed,” he added. PM Shehbaz said the government was determined to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country.
A statement issued by the presidency said President Asif Ali Zardari had paid tributes to the “courageous action of security forces in the Orakzai district”.
It added, “[The] president expressed satisfaction over the elimination of 19 terrorists of the Indian-backed khwarij. The President declared Lt. Col. Junaid Tariq shaheed, Major Tayyab Rahat and other martyrs as heroes of the nation,” the statement read.
It added that Zardari expressed heartfelt sympathy with the families of the martyrs, praying that they bear their loss with patience and courage.
The president said that the brave sons set an eternal example by sacrificing their lives while defending their country. “The sacrifices of the martyrs are a symbol of the nation’s resolve and unity.”
He reiterated the “resolve to completely eliminate Indian-backed terrorism from the soil of Pakistan”.
“The entire nation stands as a lead wall with its armed forces,” the statement quoted him as saying.
A statement issued by the PPP said party chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had also expressed grief over the martyrdom of the 11 security personnel and paid them tributes.
The statement posted on the PPP’s X account said Bilawal extended condolences to the families of the martyred and expressed solidarity with them.
“Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari prayed for the elevation of the ranks of the martyrs,” the statement said, adding that he reaffirmed his “unwavering support for the security forces during the ongoing operation for the elimination of terrorists”.
 






National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, expressing grief over the martyrdom of the security personnel and paying tributes to them, reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to eliminate the threat of terrorism, state-run APP reported.
“The sacrifices of our armed forces and security personnel in the war against terrorism will never go in vain. Terrorist […] will never succeed in fulfilling their nefarious designs,” the APP quoted him as saying.
Meanwhile, Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam said in a statement that he was “extremely dejected” to learn of the martyrdom of the personnel.
“In this moment of profound grief, I extend my heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the government, armed forces and the people of Pakistan, particularly to the bereaved families who have lost their loved ones,” the statement read. “May Allah Almighty grant eternal peace to the souls of the departed and bestow strength and patience upon their families.”
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Two reports, issued last week by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies and the Centre for Research and Security Studies, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.</p><small>2025-10-08 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0823270940d7c3b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947485/cristiano-ronaldo-becomes-footballs-first-billionaire-says-report' target='_blank'><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo becomes football’s first billionaire, says report</strong></a><br><p>Cristiano Ronaldo has become the first footballer to reach billionaire status, according to the latest Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which has valued the Portugal great’s net worth at an estimated $1.4 billion.
The 40-year-old striker’s financial ascent comes after he signed a new contract with Saudi side Al-Nassr in June reportedly worth more than $400 million.
Bloomberg said that Ronaldo earned more than $550m in salary between 2002 and 2023, supplemented by a decade-long Nike deal worth nearly $18m annually, and lucrative endorsements with Armani, Castrol and others that added more than $175m to his fortune.
Ronaldo’s move to Al-Nassr from Manchester United in 2023 had already made him the highest-paid player in football history, with an annual salary of 177m pounds ($237.52m), plus bonuses and a reported 15 per cent share in his Saudi Arabia club.
Argentina and Inter Miami forward Lionel Messi has earned more than $600m in pre-tax salary during his career.
Ronaldo’s billionaire status places him among a rare group of athletes that includes basketball greats Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and LeBron James, golfer Tiger Woods and tennis player Roger Federer.
Ronaldo suggested he is not considering retirement any time soon.
“I still have a passion for this,” he said at the Portugal Football Globes gala on Tuesday. “My family says it’s time to quit and they ask me why I want to score 1000 goals if I’ve already scored 900-something. But I don’t think that way inside.
“I’m still producing good things, I’m helping my club and the national team. Why not continue? I am sure that when I finish I will leave full because I gave everything of myself. I know I don’t have many years left to play, but the few I have left, I have to enjoy them to the fullest.”</p><small>2025-10-08 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08231028b222ffc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947484/pakistans-next-generation-of-women-cricketers-look-towards-a-brighter-future' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s next generation of women cricketers look towards a brighter future</strong></a><br><p>Zoofishan Ayyaz already knows who’ll be on the women’s national cricket team in the coming years. She, for one, hopes to make it. The dream could very well be a reality given that she captained the Strikers to a four-wicket win against the Conquerors in the National Women’s Under-19 T20 Tournament final, and a performance that saw her take the player-of-the-match award. But she knows, with the firmest of convictions, that the cohort of teenage girls she plays with and against will be the future of women’s cricket in Pakistan
“I’m telling you, in the coming times, cricket is about to change so much. We have incredible talent coming up,” Zoofi, as she is known to her teammates, told Dawn.com.

“You’re going to see players that make you say ‘wow, Pakistan has this kind of talent’?”

Over at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Pakistan recorded their third straight loss in the ICC Women’s World Cup match as they struggled against defending champions Australia. But the 18-year-old from Wah Cantt exuded confidence as she analysed her team’s performance throughout the tournament and was already preparing for a win against Bangladesh in the upcoming series. “It was a batter’s pitch, but the bowlers gave it their best effort too.”
Now in her fourth year playing domestic cricket, Zoofi has seen “zameen asmaan ka farq” from when she first began. “There’s so much competition now that I keep reminding myself to pull up my socks,” she laughed as she twiddled the gold medal hanging around her neck.
“But it’s great that there’s so much competition now, and it’s hopefully these players that will basically make it to the main team.”
 






It was evident in the mix of disbelief and quiet confidence the girls exuded that they were running head-on to the goals that once stood as distant dreams.
Aqsa Habib almost refused to collect her Player of the Tournament trophy after being glued in place by the shock of her accolade.
“I didn’t even believe it when they called my name out, because they didn’t mention it before, they just gave me a surprise!” the 17-year-old Strikers player from Lahore said. She was player-of-the-match in Monday’s semi-final against the Challengers.
“Heading into this tournament, my main goal was to just give it my best, and I’ve done that in every match,” Aqsa said. “From where to where God has taken me, even I can’t believe it.”
She admitted that playing concurrently to Pakistan’s match against Australia was inspiring but came with an immense amount of legwork.
“Obviously it’s great to think about this kind of stuff, but there’s a lot of hard work that goes into it, which is what we need to do to get to that level. The more we work hard, the closer we are to getting there.”
For now, her support system, that is her team-mates and parents and their prayers, is who she credits for today’s win.
“This team has given incredible support. We had this sort of bond to cover for each other, and I think it’s this team unity that made us win.”
“Manifestation, I’m telling you,” one of her team-mates chimed in. “Before the semi-finals we wrote it down that we would win, and now we’ve won!”
 

Aqsa Habib collects her Player of the Tournament trophy and cheque at the National Women’s U19 T20 Tournament at National Stadium, Karachi.

There was a sense of sportsmanship — and handshakes —that went well beyond the players’ years. Zoofi made it a point to acknowledge the fight the Conquerors put up as she gave a winning speech as captain and referred to them as the runners-up team instead of the losing team.
Maheen Irfan of the Conquerors, a right-arm leg spinner, said: “We wanted to win, but they played better today, so it was theirs to win.”
She knew where they were lacking — “we had dot balls and a lot of misfielding, which we shouldn’t have done in the final” — but like Zoofi and Aqsa, also had her eyes on swapping her red Conquerors shirt for the national green team kit one day.
“The dream is to be able to represent Pakistan at an international level. It feels good to have made it till here, hopefully we’ll continue onwards.”

PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar said Gandapur would send his resignation to the governor on Thursday. Gandapur assumed the office of chief minister after he was administered his oath by then-KP governor Haji Ghulam Ali on March 3, 2024.
His tenure as chief minister was not without controversy, either involving the federal government or criticism from within his own party.
In fact, it has been a tight-rope walk for the chief minister, from his first day in office, to balancing politics with realpolitik. He had to do business with the federal government, as KP is heavily dependent on its resources and the real power brokers.
Government officials said that in the initial few months, Gandapur struggled to balance between focusing on governance and the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the province, and demands from the hawkish group within the party to launch protest caravans against Islamabad, at times giving marching orders without even bothering to check with him.
Dawn.com unpacks five major controversies from his 19-month tenure:
Corruption allegations
Allegations of corruption and financial irregularity have plagued the Gandapur administration since its first year.
Imran had sent a stern message from his prison cell to members of the KP government in August 2024 that they would be held accountable for corruption and governance issues in their departments.
Shakeel Ahmad Khan, the former minister for communication and works, was subsequently removed from his position.
In September 2024, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi alleged that Gandapur was involved in massive corruption in the province.
In May 2025, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) said a preliminary probe revealed that officials of the communication and works department, Upper Kohistan, in connivance with officials of district accounts office of Upper Kohistan and a branch of National Bank of Pakistan, had misappropriated more than Rs30 billion from different projects through bogus withdrawal of funds from the national treasury in the name of several contractors, who didn’t carry out any civil work.
The bureau claimed that the district accounts office of Upper Kohistan, without carrying out any verification of the alleged work done by the said contractors, passed the cheques amounting to billions of rupees, which were deposited by those contractors in their bank accounts.
Direct communication with Afghanistan
Another area of Gandapur’s policy that often landed him in direct confrontation with the federal government was his pursuit of a direct line of communication with the interim Afghan Taliban government as per Imran’s instructions.
In September 2024, Gandapur said he had requested the ‘authorities’ for permission to hold talks with the Afghan government for peace in the province on Imran’s instructions, warning that he would proceed on his own if the request was not considered.
The response was swift as the federal government and its allies lambasted Gandapur for his comments about unilaterally leading peace talks with Afghanistan, accusing him of exceeding his authority. The Foreign Office also jumped into the fray and unequivocally stated that conducting diplomatic negotiations with foreign governments was the sole domain of the federal government.
The issue resurfaced in January when Gandapur announced plans to send a delegation to Afghanistan for dialogue on bilateral issues. The provincial government also said it would engage cross-border tribesmen to curb militancy and ensure regional peace.
That led to Minister for States and Frontier Regions, Kashmir Affairs, and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam stating that negotiations with Afghanistan fell outside the provincial government’s jurisdiction.
Backing down from his earlier assertiveness, Gandapur said in March that he was waiting for the federal government’s approval regarding the terms of reference for a jirga to negotiate with the Afghan government and last month, he disclosed that his passport had been blocked since May 9, 2023, so he couldn’t travel to Afghanistan for holding peace talks.
The disclosure came after Imran directed Gandapur to visit Afghanistan and hold discussions with authorities regarding “mutual issues and peace and security to prevent the situation from deteriorating further”.
Role in PTI protests
Gandapur has also been the frequent victim of criticism by PTI supporters, particularly on social media, regarding his contribution and role in advocating for Imran’s release. The most challenges Gandapur faced emanated from within his own party.
The PTI staged a protest in Islamabad in October last year that saw clashes between its supporters and the police. Gandapur also reached the federal capital and went to KP House.
Confusion subsequently emerged as the party initially claimed but then retracted the claim that he was arrested from KP House. His decision to leave party workers in Islamabad and move to KP House had surprised many and also elicited criticism from the PTI’s political committee.
In a surprising turn of events, he resurfaced and entered the KP Assembly chamber on Oct 6 after the PTI demanded he be produced within 24 hours. Reacting to Gandapur’s sudden reappearance, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had said that he had “staged a drama” through his disappearance.
In a repeat occurrence during the party’s November 2024 protest, government ministers had alleged that Gandapur had again fled the party’s protest and abandoned its supporters.
There was something amiss, according to those in attendance. Ganda­pur, who was originally to lead the caravan to D-Chowk — was trailing far behind. The events that unfolded on November 26 not only deeply polarised the party that still rallies around its incarcerated chief, but also triggered and intensified a tug of war and jockeying for power bet­ween different groups within the PTI.
Former first lady Bushra Bibi had heaped scorn on Gandapur for abandoning her at D-Chowk — enough of a cue for the party’s social media warriors to start trolling the chief minister.
Those who are closely associated with Gandapur had blamed some party figures from Punjab for poisoning the party founder against him.
The acrimony was witnessed at a core committee meeting, where, according to some who sat through the proceedings, the two sides exchanged barbs after KP objected to being left alone to do the heavy-lifting while the Punjab chapter was nowhere to be seen when push came to shove.
But that acrimony, some party insiders had said, was just part of a larger issue — Gandapur’s inability to make any significant headway in their quest for some kind of relief for his jailed leader and his spouse.
The chief minister’s suggestions to convince power brokers to relocate the former prime minister and his wife and place them either under house arrest at their home in Banigala, or at a host of locations in KP, such as the Governor’s House, Nathiagali or the CM House in Peshawar, did not really cut any ice with those who actually wield power in the country.
His own party’s social media warriors, who once adored and called him ‘Khan sahib’s tiger’, then began trolling him. The difficult balancing act that he was trying to perform seemed to be becoming too heavy a burden for his shoulders to bear. For perhaps the first time in his political career, ever since his entry into power corridors, Gandapur seemed to be under pressure.
In a similar turn of events in July 2025, Gandapur seemed to throw a wrench in the works of a nationwide protest, annou­nced by Imran, which was expected to climax on August 5, marking two years of the former PM’s imprisonment.
At a press conference where party leaders were expected to announce the plan for this protest, Gandapur caused confusion when he came up with a new 90-day timeline for what he called ‘a final push’. Flanked by PTI leaders who had arrived in Lahore to launch their movement for the release of Imran and his spouse, Gandapur had said that the 90-day countdown had already begun.
However, the mixed messages had left party workers questioning whether this meant a postponement of the Aug 5 protest plan, or something else altogether.
The resulting discord in the party leadership and ranks had prompted Imran to prohibit his party members from publicly discussing the party’s internal matters. He himself had decried the lack of any “meaningful momentum” for the party’s planned Aug 5 protest and ordered its members to immediately shun all their differences.
The result was a muted turnout on Aug 5 that saw the party alleging that its plans were thwarted by the state’s crackdown.
Feud with Aleema Khanum
The latest controversy to embroil Gandapur came when a split between him and Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum came to the fore.
He met Imran on September 29 for over two hours, discussing differences in the party, with Imran ordering strict action against “those creating issues within the party”.
The very next day, Gandapur accused Aleema of creating a divide within the party and alleged that she was being facilitated by the Military Intelligence (MI) and “establishment”.
 
 

He confirmed there was a rift in the party and Aleema, with the help of some vloggers, was trying to provoke the party workers against him and to discredit the party leaders. He said he told the party founder that the factions were working for their vested interests and that had hurt the campaign for his release.
For six months, Gandapur weathered a storm. Not from a weak opposition but from his own party, backed by an unbridled overseas social media brigade, clamouring for his head.
He was called a ‘traitor’, ‘compromised’ and ‘establishment tout’. The noise reached such a fever pitch that some within his own cabinet began to wonder loudly about the prospects of replacing him.
Many in officialdom were left puzzled and wondering whether the mustachioed, long-locked strongman was indeed on his way out. “I never felt so weak,” Gandapur narrated to his jailed party leader.
For months, he said, he was trolled for refusing the chairman’s orders not to present and pass the provincial budget, hold direct negotiations with the Afghan Taliban to put an end to militancy in the volatile province and, more crucially, refuse support for military operations and drone attacks in the tribal districts.
Political action against PTI wishes
The sardar from Kulachi, Dera Ismail Khan, hardly had smooth sailing as KP’s eighteenth chief minister. For the first eight months, he was required to launch one protest march after another as the party attempted to pressure the powerful military establishment to eke out concessions for his leaders.
Governance, at the time, was placed firmly on the back burner. Furthermore, the times he took political action that seemingly went against Imran and the PTI’s wishes, such as supporting military operations to legislative actvity, further incensed the party’s supporters.
His political challenges became compounded after the D-Chowk fiasco last November, and were further exacerbated by subsequent events, beginning with the abortive attempt to pass the mines and minerals bill, which the party’s social media activists claimed was being sponsored by the military establishment.
The chief minister had to relent, however, when his incarcerated leader conveyed his own opposition to the bill.
Then came the budget. Orders from Adiala said the incarcerated leader should be consulted before it is presented to the house. Efforts were made to share the draft proposals and seek his nod, but things didn’t work out.
Then came another order, ‘Don’t pass the budget’.
Barrister Saif, self-acclaimed ‘Pindi boy’ and adviser to the chief minister, was dispatched to brief the leader that passing the budget was a constitutional requirement, and failure to do so would technically knock out the government. This time, Imran relented.
The unforgiving internet activists, however, trolled Gandapur again when the worsening security situation warranted a military response. The problem was further compounded by incidents involving drone attacks that resulted in civilian casualties.
The political storm was gathering, and the chief minister’s fate seemed to have been sealed when Imran’s frustration with him seemed to boil over, triggered by his “failure to stop” military operations in the province.</p><small>2025-10-08 18:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/082255102b3ce8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947471/mooney-ton-rescues-australia-in-stunning-world-cup-win-over-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Mooney ton rescues Australia in stunning World Cup win over Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>A superb century from Beth Mooney dragged defending champions Australia back from the brink of disaster before they completed a crushing 107-run win over Pakistan in the ICC Women’s World Cup clash in Colombo on Wednesday.

But a record ninth-wicket stand between Mooney, who was dismissed off the final ball of the innings for 109, and Alana King, who made 51 not out, turned the tide.

A superb century from Beth Mooney dragged defending champions Australia back from the brink of disaster before they completed a crushing 107-run win over Pakistan in a Women’s World Cup clash in Colombo on Wednesday.
The Aussies were staring down the barrel at 76-7 and then 115-8 after being asked to bat first with the Pakistan bowlers causing mayhem, left-arm spinner Nashra Sandhu finishing with 3-37 from her 10 overs.
But a record ninth-wicket stand between Mooney, who was dismissed off the final ball of the innings for 109, and Alana King, who made 51 not out, turned the tide.
The pair dragged their side from the doldrums to a competitive 221-9 and that proved plenty as Pakistan’s brittle batting folded meekly for 114 all out in 36.3 overs.
Sidra Amin was the only Pakistan batter to put up a fight with 35 while opening bowler Kim Garth, who used to compete for Ireland, was the pick of the Australian attack with 3-14.
In the end it was a comfortable win for the Australians but it hadn’t looked like that a little earlier.
After a top order collapse that left the dugout stunned, Australia needed a saviour and up stepped the ever reliable Mooney.
The left-hander produced her fifth ODI hundred while King played the perfect foil, matching grit with gumption in a 106-run partnership off 97 balls that breathed new life into the innings.
It was not just a rescue act, it was record breaking. The partnership eclipsed Australia’s previous best for the ninth wicket — 77 between Garth and Ashleigh Gardner — and also set a new Women’s World Cup benchmark, surpassing South Africa’s 66-run effort by Yulandi van der Merwe and Kim Price back in 2000.
Mooney’s innings was a masterclass in temperament, a classic backs-to-the-wall knock. She farmed the strike smartly, ran fast between the wickets and only unfurled the big shots towards the end.
“It was a pretty tricky situation. We wanted to get a partnership going and really had to grind to reach 221,” said Mooney.
“Alana King was incredible tonight. We’ve seen her do it before and it was nice to share that stand with her.”
Having rebuilt brick by brick, Mooney brought up her century with a nudge to mid-on off Fatima Sana, while King capped her maiden fifty in style, hoisting the Pakistan captain for six as Australia plundered 21 runs off the final over.
Mooney’s 109 off 114 deliveries, laced with 11 boundaries, ended when she holed out to cover off the final ball of the innings.
King remained unbeaten on 51 off 49, peppered with three fours and as many sixes, the highest score ever made by a number 10 or lower in women’s ODIs.
Pakistan never found their footing in reply, undone by Australia’s relentless discipline with the ball.
The seven-time world champions climbed back to the top of the points table, while Pakistan’s third straight defeat leaves their knockout hopes hanging by a thread.</p><small>2025-10-08 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/082135072d7b905.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947479/who-is-sohail-afridi-imrans-choice-to-lead-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Who is Sohail Afridi, Imran’s choice to lead KP?</strong></a><br><p>PTI’s Ali Amin Gandapur said on Wednesday that he will resign from his role as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister shortly after the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the role of provincial chief executive.
At just 35, Afridi has emerged as one of the most prominent young faces in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s political paradigm. Representing PK-70 Bara for the first time as an MPA, Afridi’s political struggle reflects a steady rise from student activism to a cabinet position.
Born in 1989 in Khyber district’s Bara tehsil, Afridi’s roots lie deep in the tribal heartland, an area that has seen immense transformation in recent years. A graduate in economics, his early years were marked by his involvement in student politics — a platform that paved the way for his future in provincial governance.
Afridi served as the provincial president of the Insaf Students Federation (ISF), the student wing of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), where he gained recognition for mobilising youth and advocating for educational reforms. His tenure in the ISF helped him establish a grassroots political base, particularly among first-time voters and students.
Elected to the KP Assembly from PK-70 Bara in 2024, Afridi made his legislative debut with a strong mandate from his native constituency. Later that year, he was inducted into the provincial cabinet as special assistant to the chief minister on communications, a role in which he contributed to the province’s connectivity and infrastructure agenda.
Last week, in a reshuffle within the provincial cabinet, Afridi was elevated to the post of minister for higher education, a portfolio that aligns closely with his academic background and early political activism.
Irfan Saleem, PTI’s additional general secretary and the party president in Peshawar, told Dawn.com that Afridi has been a party loyalist since student life, adding that whenever Imran Khan made a call for protest, he stood in the front row.
“He saw hardship and jails for the party,“ Saleem said. “We expect that he will take Imran Khan’s cause ahead.“
“When there were drone attacks, the Bara Khyber incident or other issues, he raised his voice,” he added. “He knows the party well and will handle it to end polarisation.”
Another PTI leader in KP, Deputy Information Secretary and social media head Ikram Katahna, told Dawn.com, “We welcome this decision as we stand with Khan and his decisions.”
Katahna added that Afridi is a grassroots worker and “a common man like us and he came to this stage”.
“The PTI is a party of common people and Sohail Afridi’s nomination proves it,” he added.</p><small>2025-10-08 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081944572296d24.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947474/palestinian-origin-yaghi-among-trio-to-win-nobel-chemistry-prize-for-work-on-hermiones-handbag-materials' target='_blank'><strong>Palestinian-origin Yaghi among trio to win Nobel chemistry prize for work on ‘Hermione’s handbag’ materials</strong></a><br><p>Palestinian-origin Omar Yaghi, Susumu Kitagawa and Richard Robson won the 2025 Nobel chemistry prize for developing a new form of molecular architecture, yielding materials that can help tackle challenges such as climate change and lack of fresh water.
The three laureates worked to create molecular constructions, known as metal-organic frameworks or MOFs, with large spaces through which gases and other chemicals can flow and that can be utilised to harvest water from desert air, capture carbon dioxide or store toxic gases.
 






Describing the “unheard of properties” of these materials, the award committee said some had a remarkably large surface area — a porous material roughly the size of a small sugar cube could contain as much surface area as a large football pitch.
“A small amount of such material can be almost like Hermione’s handbag in Harry Potter. It can store huge amounts of gas in a tiny volume,” Olof Ramstrom, member of the Nobel Committee for Chemistry, said.
Uses could include dealing with ‘forever chemicals’
The more than a century-old prize is awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and the winners share 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2 million), as well as the fame of winning arguably the world’s most prestigious science award.
Kitagawa told the Nobel press conference that he was deeply honoured by the award.
“My dream is to capture air and separate air to — for instance, in CO2 or oxygen or water or something — and convert this to useful materials using renewable energy,” he said.
After the discoveries, chemists have built tens of thousands of different MOFs, some of which “may contribute to solving some of humankind’s greatest challenges”, the Academy said, adding that additional uses included separating toxic PFAS, or “forever chemicals”, from water and breaking down traces of pharmaceuticals in the environment.
Kitagawa is a professor at Kyoto University in Japan, while Robson is a professor at the University of Melbourne, Australia, and Yaghi is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in the United States.
Kitagawa is Japanese, Robson was born in Britain but moved to Australia in his late 20s, while Yaghi is Jordanian-American.
‘Science is the greatest equalising force in the world’
Yaghi was born to Palestinian refugees in Jordan, where his family shared a one-room home with the cattle the family was raising.
“It’s quite a journey and science allows you to do it,” he said in an interview published on the Nobel website, adding that his parents could barely read or write.
“Science is the greatest equalising force in the world,” he said.
Yaghi, who said he was astonished and delighted to win the award, was 10 years old when he found a book on molecules in the library, and it was the beginning of a life-long love of chemistry.
“The deeper you dig, the more beautifully you find things are constructed,” he told the Nobel website.
Robson said he got the call from Stockholm half an hour before the official announcement and that he celebrated quietly at his home outside Melbourne.</p><small>2025-10-08 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627634-ppp-summons-top-party-body-meeting-as-pml-n-row-persists' target='_blank'><strong>PPP summons top party body meeting as PML-N row persists</strong></a><br><p>

The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy.
It took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
 
 

The legislation had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The CB is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. It resumed proceedings yesterday after over eight months, and unanimously allowed live-streaming of the case upon some petitioners’ request.
The pleas taken up also seek the formation of a full court to hear the matter. Hence, before proceeding further, the court will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB.
During today’s hearing, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan requested the formation of a 16-member bench to hear the pleas, as per the number of SC judges at the time of the 26th Amendment.
Several judges, including Justice Aminuddin, observed that the 26th Amendment was currently part of the Constitution. Some judges questioned whether the CB had the power to form a full court, while Justice Malik noted there was no restriction on issuing a judicial order for that.
The hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.
Requests to form a full court bench and to live stream the case dominated yesterday’s hearing, with the state lawyer expressing no objection to live stream the proceedings.
 


Commenting on today’s hearing, Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, who is one of the petitioners, said: “Justice Ayesha stood out with her observations, while her colleagues appeared to take refuge in Article 5’s ‘loyalty to the state’ clause”.
 






The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Hamid came to the rostrum and said the 26th Amendment was introduced in an “unusual” manner and passed by the parliament at night.
Hamid recalled that there were 17 judges present in the SC at the time the legislation was passed, including then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa, who later retired. Therefore, he contended, a 16-judge “full court” bench as of then should hear the pleas and pointed out that all eight judges in the current CB would be part of that bench as they were already serving as SC judges in October last year.
As per the SC’s website, there are currently a total of 24 judges in the SC, including CJP Yahya Afridi, after six new judges were appointed in February.
 
 

“This Amendment is against the very basic features of the Constitution,” he asserted, at which Justice Mandokhail said that the matter will be deliberated upon later and asked him whether the Amendment was currently a part of the Constitution.
In response to Hamid’s arguments, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “We depend on the Constitution. Lawyers also depend on the Constitution. Unless the Constitution is [further] amended, we will have to depend on the current Constitution.”
Justice Hilali also observed that whether the 26th Amendment was “right or wrong”, the court had not suspended it yet. “You consider the 26th Amendment a part of the Constitution, which is why you have challenged it.”
Here, Justice Mazhar noted that the CB was at the moment not considering the main question of the legislation’s legality, but the request for a full court and sought arguments on that.
Hamid responded that he was not detailing how the 26th Amendment was unconstitutional, but on the “effects of its powers”. He said it was for the first time after the legislation that the “authority to form benches was taken away from the chief justice”.
Noting that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) existed prior to last year’s constitutional tweaks, the LHCBA counsel said the 26th Amendment impacted the JCP’s formation as “judges became a minority” after the number of its members was increased.
 
 

“After the Amendment, the majority in the Judicial Commission went to the administrative side, which affected judicial independence,” Hamid said.
Upon Justice Mandokhail asking Hamid whether he was acknowledging the 26th Amendment or not, the lawyer replied in the negative.
At this point during the hearing, Justice Mazhar wondered whether a bench constituted after the 26th Amendment could decide a plea seeking the formation of a full court.
Justice Mandokhail, however, remarked that the Amendment was part of the Constitution for now. At Justice Afghan pointing out that Hamid had not specified in his petition that “to whom should the bench send the case”, the lawyer said the matter should be referred to the CJP.
Justice Hilali also asked whether the LHCBA counsel had made any request to the authority responsible for constituting the benches. To this, Hamid replied, “We are challenging the bench formation, which was constituted under the influence of the 26th Amendment.”
Here, Justice Aminuddin observed, “Right now, [we are] not at such a stage to consider who will hear the case. Possibly, there might be hearings for a month on the matter of who will hear the case,” he added.
“On what basis are you saying that we cannot hear the case?” the CB head questioned Hamid, remarking that it was not in the judges’ control to “go back to before the 26th Amendment”.
At this point during the hearing, Justice Malik said, “Whether a full court hears or a bench, no one is stopping any judicial order. The process continues after a judicial order.
“Where under the 26th Amendment is a full court being barred?” she asked, to which Hamid replied that the legislation did not do so.
 
 

Justice Malik observed, “When there is a request for forming a bench, we do not question the procedure. We give directions, after which the process is initiated.”
Here, Justice Aminuddin wondered under what authority the CB would constitute a full court, following which Justice Malik said there was “no restriction on forming a full court under a judicial order”.
“Where in the 26th Amendment is it written that a judicial order cannot be issued? Such is being done in ordinary cases, then why not in this case?” she countered.
Justice Afghan again raised the issue of Hamid not mentioning the said request in his petition.
Upon Justice Mazhar asking whether the CB could use Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution to issue the order for a full court, Hamid replied in the affirmative.
 
 

At one point during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the CB was not conceptualised by the SC but by the parliament. When Hamid said the bench should “forget” Article 191A, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the apex court, Justice Aminuddin said if that was forgotten, the SC would not exist anymore.
“A full court was always formed whenever questions were raised about the Constitution,” Hamid emphasised.
At this, Justice Mandokhail wondered if a “point decided by 17 judges in the past” can be reversed, to which the lawyer replied in the negative. “Will you not be glad if the previous decision is upheld and now a smaller bench hears the case?” the judge asked.
However, Justice Afghan noted that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 did not exist in the past. He remarked that CJPs in the past “kept using their powers to constitute full courts”, but now that authority lied with the SC Practice and Procedure Committee “as per the Constitution and the law”.
The petitions
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
As a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued.
 
 

The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.</p><small>2025-10-08 15:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08194231c70e9c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947465/man-arrested-in-kps-shangla-district-for-allegedly-raping-teenage-daughter-police' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested in KP’s Shangla district for allegedly raping teenage daughter: police</strong></a><br><p>A man was arrested on Wednesday on charges of allegedly sexually assaulting his teenage daughter in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bisham area of Shangla district, officials said.
“The victim reached the police station on Wednesday,” Bisham Station House Officer (SHO) Afzal Khan told Dawn.com. “A first information report (FIR) was lodged, and the suspect has been arrested.”
According to the FIR, the victim’s mother was divorced by her husband, who later married another woman from Swat. However, nine years ago, the stepmother also left and returned to her parents’ home.
“I live with two of my stepbrothers, one of whom is paralysed, and my father in a rented house,” she said, per the FIR.
The victim reported that she was at home and her brother had gone to Rawalpindi for work when her father called her to his room, where he showed her a knife and sexually assaulted her.
She alleged that her father also threatened her with murder if she told anyone about the ordeal.
The victim added that she went to the police station when she got the chance to lodge an FIR against her father and to get protection from him.
Police registered the FIR under Sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code and started further investigation into the case.
A senior doctor at the tehsil headquarters hospital, Bisham, who wished not to disclose his name, examined the victim and confirmed that she was raped.
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA -Pakistan), citing the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2017–18, said 28 per cent of women aged 15–49 have reported experiencing physical violence and 6pc have endured sexual violence, while 34pc of ever-married women have faced spousal physical, sexual, or emotional abuse.
It said that among them, 5pc reported experiencing spousal sexual violence. Alarmingly, 56pc of women who have endured physical or sexual violence have not sought help or confided in anyone about their experiences, largely due to socio-cultural barriers, economic dependency, lack of information and accessibility, and the absence of adequate support systems such as healthcare and psycho-social services.
Earlier this month, the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency arrested three people suspected of gang-raping and blackmailing a minor in KP’s Abbottabad, according to a police official.
In July, the KP police said they arrested a suspect after a 13-year-old maid was allegedly raped and murdered in Abbottabad.</p><small>2025-10-08 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08172853bdcc7dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947466/sindh-inspector-general-vows-to-protect-traders-amid-rising-incidents-of-extortion-in-province' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh inspector general vows to protect traders amid rising incidents of extortion in province</strong></a><br><p>In the wake of concerns expressed by the business community over increasing extortionism, Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Ghulam Nabi Memon on Wednesday vowed to provide full protection to economic and commercial activities in collaboration with traders across the province.
“Elements hindering economic activity would be eliminated with the cooperation of the businessmen,” the provincial police chief was quoted as saying in a police statement while reviewing a crime data report on Karachi, which was submitted by Additional IG Operations.
As per the police statement, 118 incidents of extortion were reported in Karachi so far this year, of which only 44 were genuine extortion cases, while the remaining 74 pertained to personal disputes and business quarrels. The statement added that of the 44 cases, 39 were “solved” — a success ratio of 87 per cent.
A police crime statistics report seen by Dawn.com linked 12 of the 44 cases to three specific groups: the Wasiullah Lakho group, the Samad Kathiawari group and the Jamil Changa group.
“These gang leaders are reportedly settled in Iran and use Iranian numbers to carry out their operations,” the report read. “Paperwork for [the] issuance of red notices has been completed, and all queries have been removed.”
Police spokesperson Syed Saad Ali was quoted as saying that a total of 78 suspects involved in these cases were identified, of which 43 were arrested and five others were gunned down in “encounters”.
The statement added that the Sindh IG met with the trading community around 10 days ago and since then, four extortionists were gunned down in police “encounters”.
“Law and order and business atmosphere are being further strengthened in Sindh province with [the] cooperation of traders,” the provincial police chief was quoted as saying.
IG Memon appreciated the business community’s decision to install CCTV cameras at their business centres and added that the Sindh government, police and other law enforcement agencies are standing with traders to promote economic activities.
“By utilising resources provided by the Sindh government, the police are carrying out effective action against the criminal elements on a daily basis,” said the Sindh IG.
The police’s latest crime data shows that, compared to last year, there has been a “significant” reduction in street crimes during the ongoing year. As of 2024, 252 incidents of street crimes were being reported daily, but this year, only 167 incidents have been reported, a decrease of 52pc.
According to a crime statistics report seen by Dawn.com, only six people were killed as of September 2025, compared to 13 as of January 2024.
Additionally, crimes like mobile snatchings went down from 2,305 as of January 2024 to 1,438 as of September 2025, while motorcycle snatchings fell from 865 to 472. The theft of motorcycles and cars also decreased, from 163 and 4,472 to 160 and 2,915, respectively.
“Overall, street crime has fallen by 36pc [while the] average per day street crime is down by 34pc,” the crime report read.
During the same period, there were 53 cases of robberies with murder and 189 robberies with injury. When looking at cases solved, the numbers were 37 and 122, respectively.
However, car snatching increased, with 25 incidents reported as of September 2025 from 17 in January 2024.
Similarly, 34 cases of kidnappings have been reported this year so far, involving 37 abductees. Two of them have been recovered safely by the police, while “concerted efforts are underway to recover [the] two remaining persons. Both kidnapping cases were ‘honey traps’,” the police’s statement read.
According to police, 46 kidnappers were arrested in 34 cases, while two others were gunned down in encounters.
In May, a senior police officer on Monday said that a total of 33 persons were shot dead in incidents of street crime, citing data collected by the police.
Special Investigation Unit Chief Senior Superintendent of Police Mohammed Shoaib Memon said that of them, 23 cases were reported through the arrest of culprits involved in heinous crimes, while 10 cases were under investigation.</p><small>2025-10-08 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081554159c9a4e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947455/ecp-decides-to-hold-local-govt-polls-in-punjab-in-last-week-of-december' target='_blank'><strong>ECP decides to hold local govt polls in Punjab in last week of December</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) decided on Wednesday to hold Punjab’s long-delayed local government (LG) elections in December’s last week and that the process of delimitation would initiate from tomorrow to be completed within two months.
Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions. In April 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on December 31, 2021. That means the elections were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022, but it could not be made possible as the provincial government kept on amending the LG law from time to time.
The order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was issued by a four-member ECP bench comprising Chairman Sikandar Sultan Raja, Nisar Ahmed Durrani, Shah Muhammad Jatoi and Babar Hassan Bharwana.
It stated that the election regulator had “decided to hold the local government elections in the province of Punjab on the basis of the existing local government law, i.e. the Punjab Local Government Act 2022 and Rules framed thereunder”.
The bench ordered the ECP office to initiate the process of delimitation from tomorrow (October 9) and complete it within two months.
“Thereafter, the election programme should be announced and the election should be held in the last week of December 2025. The office is expected to follow the timelines strictly,” the order said.
It referred to another one released after a June hearing held by the ECP on the matter, which stated that the ECP had accepted the Punjab government’s request for three months’ time for the completion of various activities pertaining to the election “in the interest of justice”.
“In case of failure, the commission will issue appropriate orders regarding the conduct of local government elections in the province of Punjab,” the June order had said.
Referring to it, today’s order stated that having received no response from the Punjab government after a period of three months, the ECP again fixed the matter for a hearing today and issued a notice to the local government secretary.
It said it the local government secretary appeared in person and said that the process of legislation for the Punjab Local Government Act was under the process of completion after being delayed by the floods. He added that the standing committee had finalised the process and the bill would be laid down in the Punjab Assembly for passage, requesting that some time be granted till the assembly session was convened.
The ECP said it had “exhausted all possible efforts’’ for the conducting of the Punjab local government elections in Punjab, but the provincial administration “acted in a dilatory manner to delay the conduct” of polls each time on one or the other pretext.
The bench added that it was the ECP’s constitutional obligation to organise and conduct elections in accordance with the Constitution and law, which entrusted it with “exclusive, broad and extensive powers to fulfil its constitutional responsibilities’’.
At the same time, it pointed out that it was also the constitutional responsibility of the provincial governments to ensure the establishment of a local government system in accordance with the Constitution and the law.</p><small>2025-10-08 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627614-who-is-sohail-afridi-tipped-to-be-next-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>Who is Sohail Afridi — the next KP CM?</strong></a><br><p>

The statement from the army brass, released after the 272nd Corps Commanders’ Conference (CCC) held at General Headquarters (GHQ), comes in the wake of last week’s provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership.
Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi had warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. He had said that Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
The Pakistan military had issued a strong response to the remarks and wanred that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country would “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”. It had said that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”.
A statement from the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued today said that the military brass also took notice of the remarks in today’s CCC.
“The forum pledged to counter any Indian aggression with a swift and decisive response, shattering any perceived notion of India’s relative safety accruing from geography. Any imaginary new normal will be met with a new normal of swift retributive response,” the ISPR said.
 






It added that the military leadership expressed grave concerns about the recent “irresponsible and unwarranted provocative statements” by the Indian civil and military leadership.
“Such rhetoric conforms to the well-known Indian propensity of whipping up war hysteria for political benefits. The participants agreed that unwarranted warmongering is likely to lead to heightened tensions and will endanger regional peace and security,” the ISPR said.
The military’s media wing said the meeting commenced with prayers for the martyrs of recent terrorist attacks “orchestrated by Indian terror proxies”.
Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir “commended the spirit, resolve and determination of the Pakistan armed forces in war against foreign-sponsored terror proxies and during extensive relief and rescue operations in the aftermath of recent floods, in conjunction with civil administration and other law enforcement agencies”, the statement said.
It further added that the forum undertook a “comprehensive review’’ of ongoing counter-terrorism operations, emerging threat paradigms and operational readiness and reaffirmed that the military remained ready to “thwart inimical designs of Pakistan’s adversaries across all domains”.
The ISPR also said that the CCC members affirmed that the “existing nexus between terror and crime with vested political patronage, which is gravely hurting the interests of the state and security of its people, will not be allowed to continue anymore, come what may”.
The military’s media wing further said that the participants expressed their resolve to pursue “comprehensive counterterrorism operations across all domains to continue to dismantle the networks of Indian-sponsored terror proxies” such as the Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
The participants also acknowledged the significance of Pakistan’s recent high-level diplomatic engagements and reaffirmed their commitment to global and regional peace. In particular, the military welcomed the landmark mutual defence deal between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and said it underscored “shared values, mutual respect, and a joint vision” for peace and security in the Middle Eastern and South Asian regions.
Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The pact was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh in September.
“The forum reiterated Pakistan’s uncompromising support for the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for their right to self-determination, as enshrined in relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The forum also reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and hoped for early ceasefire and delivery of humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. The forum reiterated Pakistan’s principled stance on Palestine issue, voicing support for the two-state solution with an independent Palestinian state, based on pre-1967 borders and Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
“In his closing remarks, the COAS, directed the commanders to ensure the highest standards of operational readiness, discipline, physical fitness, innovation and responsiveness. The COAS expressed full confidence in the operational preparedness of Pakistan Army to counter threats across the entire spectrum, from conventional and sub-conventional, to hybrid and asymmetric threats,” the military’s media wing concluded.</p><small>2025-10-08 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627604-armys-top-brass-vows-to-end-nexus-of-terror-crime-and-political-patronage' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Army warns India of 'swift, destructive response' to any aggression</strong></a><br><p>

The attack took place when he was on his way to drop his children off at school. According to a police press release, the shooting occurred on the Jerwar Road near Maso Wah, where the assailants riding a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire at his car.
“Rind died on the spot, while his children miraculously escaped unharmed,” the police said.
Witnesses added that the attackers fled the scene after the assault, spreading panic across the area. The police later transported the body to the District Headquarters Hospital of Mirpur Mathelo for medico-legal formalities.
The police statement said that upon receiving the information, Ghotki’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Anwar Khetran immediately reached the crime scene, inspected the site, and met with the victim’s family, issuing “strict orders to the concerned officers for prompt action”.
“The SSP Ghotki assured the victim’s family that all individuals involved in the murder would be arrested soon and brought to justice,” the statement added.
The police said that multiple angles are being investigated and evidence is being collected to determine the motive behind the attack.
According to a relative of the victim, Rind was associated with Mehran Newspaper and Royal News, and also served as an office-bearer of the Mirpur Mathelo Press Club. He had survived an earlier assassination attempt in which he had requested security from the local administration, but no effective measures were taken.
SSP Khetran confirmed in a statement that Rind had complained a few months ago about an incident of gunfire at his home, saying that police had made arrests at that time.
“We also arrested one person in connection with that on Oct. 4 (Saturday),” he added. “Rind was in contact with us and appreciated that the arrests were made.”
A few hours after the murder, another tragedy struck when Rind’s eight-year-old niece fainted upon hearing the news of the killing. She was rushed to Mirpur Mathelo Hospital and later referred to Sukkur due to her critical condition, but died on the way. Her body was handed over to the family after medico-legal procedures.
Suspects arrested
Ghotki’s SSP Khetran has said that two suspects have already been arrested in connection with Rind’s murder.
“The slain journalist had a dispute with members of his own community for the past four years, during which two people had previously been killed,” said SSP Khetran.
He said that individuals from both sides of the rival groups were already in jail, and that this was the third murder linked to the same dispute.
“All those involved in the murder of journalist Tufail Rind will be arrested,” the SSP added.
Sindh’s Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and sought an urgent report from Sindh Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon.
In his statement, the chief minister said, “Attacks on journalists are attacks on press freedom, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.”
Murad directed the police to conduct an impartial investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice at the earliest. He also expressed condolences to the victim’s family and assured them that justice would be ensured.
Locals in Ghotki and Mirpur Mathelo described Rind as a courageous journalist who always stood for the downtrodden. His funeral was attended by a large number of citizens, journalists, and political leaders.
Condemnations pour in
Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also condemned the killing, calling it a “tragic and deplorable incident”. He said the Sindh government stood with the bereaved family, adding, “Such attacks are equivalent to assaults on freedom of expression.“
Deputy Parliamentary Leader of Sindh Assembly and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) Pakistan’s representative, Taha Ahmed Khan, strongly condemned the “brutal murder”.
In a statement, Khan said that MQM Pakistan stood in solidarity with Rind’s family as well as with the journalist community during this difficult time.
Sindh Government Spokesperson and Mayor of Sukkur, Barrister Arsalan Islam Sheikh, expressed sorrow and regret over the incident, calling it highly condemnable.
“Attacks on journalists are actually tantamount to attacks on freedom of expression, which cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” Mayor Sukkur said in a statement.
Journalist, press associations demand justice
Rind’s murder sparked widespread grief and anger across the journalist community in Pakistan. Journalists across Sindh staged protests, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits and the introduction of effective laws to protect journalists. The protests included a sit-in observed in front of the SSP’s office.
 
 

The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), Karachi Press Club, Hyderabad Union of Journalists, Umerkot Press Club, Ghotki Press Club, and Mirpur Mathelo Press Club jointly condemned the killing, saying, “Another voice has been silenced — punished for speaking the truth.”
They urged the Sindh government to provide financial and legal assistance to Rind’s family and to formulate a clear security policy for journalists to prevent further bloodshed.
PFUJ’s Vice President Akbar Jafri said in a statement that the incidents of attacks, threats, kidnappings and brutal killings of journalists across the country were “clear evidence of the complete failure and indifference of the government and administration”.
He said that Rind’s murder was “proof that there is no effective policy for the protection of journalists across the country, including Sindh.”
Jafri pointed out that Rind had appealed on social media a few days ago regarding the threat to his life, but the government and administration ignored this appeal, which “resulted in the loss of another precious life”.
“The journalistic community is united and will continue to struggle for its rights and protection, because remaining silent now will be tantamount to waiting for more sacrifices,” he said.
Journalist Mazhar Abbas also posted on X, saying that the killing of journalists was “on rise again in Sindh”.
“Following Imtiaz Mir’s murder, another journalist Tufail Rind, has been killed within two weeks,” Abbas said. “Rind’s alleged killer has also shared his confessional statement’s video. This is quite alarming.”
Last month, anchorperson Imtiaz Mir was shot and wounded in Karachi’s Malir area, succumbing to his injuries few days later, according to his family and police.
 






Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation.
Reporters Without Borders (RSF) has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists.
According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.
In August last year, unknown armed men shot dead another Ghotki journalist, Muhammad Bachal Ghuniyo, who was associated with a private Sindhi TV channel.
Another Ghotki journalist, Nasrullah Gadani, who worked for a Sindhi newspaper, was shot at and seriously wounded in an attack in May 2024. He succumbed to fatal injuries at a Karachi hospital three days later.</p><small>2025-10-08 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/08122638140069a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947427/no-casualties-reported-as-fire-doused-at-factory-in-karachis-liaquatabad-rescue-service' target='_blank'><strong>No casualties reported as fire doused at factory in Karachi’s Liaquatabad: rescue service</strong></a><br><p>No casualties were reported after a fire erupted in a plastic factory in Karachi’s Liaquatabad area early on Wednesday and was extinguished after hectic efforts, according to a rescue official.
Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com, “The fire erupted in the plastic factory located in a market near Sindhi Hotel in Liaquatabad at around 7:30am.”
He said three fire tenders managed to control it, and no casualties were reported.
Liaquatabad Station House Officer Ghulam Yasin told Dawn.com that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit.
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
 
 

According to city planners and engineers, 70 per cent of residential, commercial and industrial buildings in Karachi lacked an adequate fire safety system. Citing official data of the city’s fire department, Fire Protection Association President Kunwar Waseem said the city witnessed nearly 3,000 such incidents in 2024.
On September 9, four firefighters and one cameraman of a private TV channel were injured when a huge fire destroyed a three-storey garment factory in New Karachi Industrial Area and also damaged two other adjacent factories.
Later that month, two women died and nine other people were rescued in a fire that erupted in a four-storey building in the city’s Defence Housing Authority.
In August, at least six people died in a fire inside a warehouse near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex, while eight were injured in another blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi earlier that month.</p><small>2025-10-08 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081156079114420.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947430/rawalpindi-atc-issues-bailable-arrest-warrant-for-aleema-khan-in-nov-26-protest-case' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi ATC issues bailable arrest warrant for Aleema Khan in Nov 26 protest case</strong></a><br><p>The Rawalpindi Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Wednesday issued a bailable arrest warrant for PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, in connection with the party’s November 26 case, dismissing an exemption plea filed by her to appear for a hearing.
More than 10,000 PTI supporters surged into the city on Nov 26 last year, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back. As the demonstrators inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk, the police and security troops employed intense teargas shelling to disperse them.
Aleema was to be indicted in the November 26 protest case registered at Sadiqabad Police Station during today’s hearing, but she did not appear before the court.
During the hearing, the prosecutor objected that the person applying on Aleema’s behalf was not her lawyer, and therefore was not authorised to file an application without a power of attorney.
On this basis, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah dismissed Aleema’s application for exemption and issued bailable arrest warrants for her.
The other 10 suspects in the case appeared in court, while the hearing was adjourned until October 11 (Saturday).
Early in September, the Rawalpindi police booked Aleema, party lawyer Naeem Panjutha and 40 other PTI-linked activists for alleged violence against a journalist outside Adiala Jail.
In October last year, Aleema, her sister Uzma, and other PTI supporters were arrested from Islamabad’s D-Chowk for clashing with the police and violating Section 144,  a legal provision that restricts gatherings of four or more people in an area to prevent public disorder or unrest. A few days later, they were released from the Jhelum District Jail after a judge granted them bail.</p><small>2025-10-08 10:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081421218877a09.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947448/mohsin-naqvi-says-afghanistans-visa-issues-for-asian-cup-qualifier-resolved' target='_blank'><strong>Mohsin Naqvi says Afghanistan’s visa issues for Asian Cup qualifier resolved</strong></a><br><p>Visa issues surrounding Afghanistan’s football team being able to play in Pakistan have been sorted out, allowing the team to travel to Islamabad for Thursday’s AFC Asian Cup qualifier at the Jinnah Stadium, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Pakistan Football Federation president Mohsen Gilani said that its Afghanistan counterpart had failed to ensure the presence of its full travelling squad at the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul for biometric verification, as most of the players were not living in the country.
The Afghanistan Football Federation was quoted by the Afghan Voice Agency as stating that it had sent the initial list of team members to the Pakistan Embassy on September 18, but “despite repeated follow-ups and official contacts, visas have not been issued to the players and officials”.
Today, Minister Naqvi took to X to announce the issue had been sorted out.
“Issued now,” he said in response to journalist Faizan Lakhani’s post saying the minister has ordered to sort out the visa issue of the Afghanistan football team.
“Thank you for highlighting it,” Naqvi added.
 






Uncertainty surrounded the qualifier due to the latter failing to secure visas for its players earlier.
Reports from Afghanistan said that all of its national team players had gathered in Dubai on Tuesday evening, and they were awaiting visa clearance.
Both Pakistan and Afghanistan are pointless after losing their opening two matches in Group ‘E’ against Syria and Myanmar.  The two sides have a double-header in this international window, with Afghanistan to host Pakistan in Al Ardiya, Kuwait, for the return game on October 14.

Huang’s reported message, aimed at reassuring employees, comes after panic and confusion had ensued among tech workers on H-1B visas, a large chunk of whom are from India and China.
Akin to the wider chip and tech industry, Nvidia has a significant number of employees from overseas. Huang has repeatedly asserted that about half the AI researchers in the world are Chinese.
“As one of many immigrants at Nvidia, I know that the opportunities we’ve found in America have profoundly shaped our lives,” Huang wrote in a message to staff, cited by Business Insider.
“And the miracle of Nvidia — built by all of you, and by brilliant colleagues around the world — would not be possible without immigration,” Huang added, according to the report.
Nvidia declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
Trump’s order bars new H-1B recipients from entering the United States unless the employer sponsoring their visa has made an additional $100,000 payment.
The administration has said the order does not apply to people who already hold H-1B visas or those who submitted applications before September 21.
H-1B visas allow businesses to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations.
Late in September, US lawmakers asked major US companies to explain why they are hiring thousands of foreign workers on H-1B visas while cutting other jobs.
According to the report, in his message to staff, Huang said that “legal immigration remains essential to ensuring the US continues to lead in technology and ideas,” and that the Trump administration’s “recent changes reaffirm this.”
California, home to Silicon Valley and multiple tech giants, including Nvidia, has consistently ranked first in the country since 2018 in the number of visa applications received annually, according to USCIS data.</p><small>2025-10-08 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/081209545f13eec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947416/apologised-to-pm-shehbaz-on-presumptions-about-supposed-minerals-deal-with-us-senator-aimal-wali' target='_blank'><strong>Apologised to PM Shehbaz on presumptions about supposed minerals deal with US: Senator Aimal Wali</strong></a><br><p>Awami National Party (ANP) Senator Aimal Wali Khan has said he has apologised to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after the latter provided him with a clarification on the questions he had earlier raised during a Senate speech regarding a presumed rare earth minerals deal with the US.
In a post on X on Tuesday, he said the PM had invited him for a meeting after his speech in the upper House of Parliament, and during the conversation, he told the premier: “If I can criticise openly, I also have the courage to apologise if I make a mistake”. He added that he had told the PM that if he was wrong in his presumptions about the deal, “I apologise”.
In his Senate speech, Khan had referred to a photograph circulating on social media that showed PM Shehbaz, US President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, who was holding an open briefcase that appeared to contain minerals. The photograph was released by the White House, after a September meeting of the three in the US, and showed Field Marshal Munir pointing to the contents of the briefcase and Trump looking at them.
Khan said in his speech in the Senate on Sept 30 that in the photograph, it seemed that a deal for the trade of rare earth minerals was being proposed. “Under what agreement, which law and the Constitution? This is dictatorship. This is, sorry to say, not democracy.”
He went on to question whether parliament held any importance.
Khan also spoke of the rights of smaller provinces and accused the ruling party in the Centre, the PML-N, of working on the terms of the military establishment.
 
 

The ANP leader also termed the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) — a committee that helps with foreign investments — an “unconstitutional institution”.
“The SIFC is financially taking Pakistan towards one unit. All your decisions are being made at one place … The SIFC is making Punjab’s agriculture policy […] It is the SIFC that is dealing with rare earth minerals,”  he alleged.
Following Khan’s speech, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar mentioned in the Senate on Tuesday that PM Shehbaz had met Khan and clarified details regarding his meeting with the US president.
Subsequently, Khan posted on X that after his speech in the upper house of parliament, the premier invited him for a briefing on his visit to the US.
“At the beginning of the meeting, he apologised to me and said that all of this should have happened in parliament prior to the US visit. I accepted his apology right away and said: “‘Look at my speech. I only talked about the supremacy of parliament. I did not ridicule anyone.’”
 






According to Khan, the premier clarified that he needed to take the army chief along with him on some visits. “Due to some strategic constraints, he takes the Field Marshal along with him,” he said.
“Referring to the picture of Trump, the Field Marshal and himself, [Shehbaz] said that the gift of minerals presented to the American president was purchased by the army chief from his own pocket and had nothing to do with any mineral deal — domestic or foreign,” Khan claimed.
The ANP leader said that he replied: “When I have the courage to criticise openly, I also have the courage to apologise for my mistake. If this picture has nothing to do with the minerals of KP and Balochistan or any deal, then I apologise.”
He added that the people of KP and Balochistan had a right on the minerals in their respective provinces and they “should be included in this. We are neither against development nor betterment of the economy”.
On Monday, Dawn reported that the federal and provincial governments withdrew police and Federal Constabulary security protection to Khan and his family following his critical speech in the upper house of parliament.
Today, ANP spokesperson Engineer Ehsanullah Khan said Khan’s recent speech in the Senate was an “unconditional affirmation of parliamentary supremacy”.
“The ANP has always been a torch-bearer of the supremacy of parliament. It was also the central idea of the party president’s speech in the Senate,” his statement posted on the ANP’s X account said. It added that Khan’s statement also made it “clear that the government will ensure implementation regarding the rights of smaller provinces, as they were stated in the Constitution.”
He further stated that the ANP valued the national role of defence institutions, but was also clear that “all institutions should work within the bounds of the Constitution”.

Starmer’s first official trip to India, which he hopes will boost economic ties between the two nations, sees him accompanied by a 125-member delegation that includes top business leaders including British Airways chief executive Sean Doyle.
 






The two-day visit follows his July meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in London, where the pair signed the trade accord.
Starmer is due to meet Modi tomorrow, and address a fintech conference in Mumbai alongside him.
“With India set to be the third biggest economy in the world by 2028, and trade with them about to become quicker and cheaper, the opportunities waiting to be seized are unparalleled,” Starmer said in a statement.
India and its former colonial ruler are the world’s fifth- and sixth-largest economies, with bilateral trade worth around $54.8 billion and investments supporting more than 600,000 jobs across both countries.
 
 

The visit “will provide a valuable opportunity to reaffirm the shared vision of India and the United Kingdom to build a forward-looking partnership”, India’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
Under the new deal, India will slash tariffs on imports of British goods such as whisky, cosmetics and medical devices, while Britain will reduce duties on clothing, footwear and food products, including frozen prawns from India.
‘Britain not seeking visa deal with India’
However, Starmer ruled out expanding visa access for Indian professionals despite pressure from industry.
“That isn’t part of the plan,” he told reporters en route to Mumbai. “We’re here now to take advantage of the free trade agreement that we’ve already struck. We’ve got to implement it.
“Businesses are taking advantage of that. But the issue is not about visas.”
Starmer said that visas had blocked previous efforts to seal a trade deal, and that, having reached an agreement which had no visa implications, he didn’t wish to revisit the issue when he meets Modi tomorrow.
The British premier said visas would not be on the table in order to attract tech sector professionals from India, after United States President Donald Trump hiked fees on H-1B visas, though he said more broadly he wanted to have “top talent” in Britain.
 
 

Asked if he would stop issuing visas to arrivals from countries that won’t take back foreign criminals or people wanted to deport, Starmer said it was a “non-issue” with India as there is a returns agreement, but it was something he would look at more broadly.
“We are looking at whether there should be a link between visas and returns agreements,” he said.
Starmer is trying to take a more restrictive stance on both immigration amid high public concern about the issue, as his Labour Party trails the populist Reform UK party in polls.
Rights groups have urged Starmer to raise the case of Scottish Sikh blogger Jagtar Singh Johal, detained in India since 2017 over an alleged plot to kill right-wing Hindu leaders. He has not been convicted, and one of the nine charges against him was dismissed in March.</p><small>2025-10-08 06:21</small></div><hr>
