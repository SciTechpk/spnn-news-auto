The decision comes into effect at once.
The Sindh local government department, acting on the directives of the chief minister of Sindh, issued a notification announcing the end of parking fees on public roads throughout the city’s 25 Town Municipal Corporations (TMCs).
As per the new policy, no municipal body or private entity is allowed to collect any parking fee from vehicles parked on roads anywhere in Karachi.
However, the move also granted the councils of the TMCs the authority to designate any ‘specified area’ within their remit as a charged parking space.
According to the notification, the Sindh chief minister “imposed a ban on charged parking fees from roads. The charged parking fees can be collected only on plots / plazas / areas specifically maintained by the specific Councils for such purposes”.

TMCs given authority to designate ‘specified area’ as charged parking space; fee collection will continue in cantonment board areas

Effective immediately, all Town Municipal Administrations (TMAs) have been ordered to stop the collection of parking fees and begin implementation of the policy without delay.
 
 

The local government department has also launched a formal campaign to enforce this directive, with warnings of strict action against violators. Importantly, the ban applies strictly to public roads.
Parking fees will now only be legally permissible in designated parking plazas, private plots, or specific council-approved zones. These areas are expected to be clearly marked to avoid confusion.
“This step has been taken purely in public interest,” said City Mayor Murtaza Wahab.
“Karachi’s residents have long demanded and at times suffered at the hands of illegal and arbitrary parking fee collection. This administration has delivered on its promise of transparency and accountability, ensuring that public roads remain public spaces — free to use.”
However, an official clarified that the charged parking would continue within the jurisdiction of six cantonment boards in Karachi. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) sources revealed that the concept of charged parking in Karachi was first introduced in the year 2000.
The initiative was envisioned by the then director general of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA), retired brigadier Abdul Haq, as part of a broader strategy to generate municipal revenue. At that time, he was overseeing the city’s infrastructure development and urban planning, and saw paid parking as a potential tool to fund civic services and manage growing vehicular congestion in the metropolis.
In February 2025, Mayor Murtaza Wahab hinted at abolishing the charged parking across Karachi as part of his broader vision to ease the financial burden on citizens.
However, the initiative faced delays due to existing contractual obligations, as several entities held valid charged parking agreements, which were set to expire in June.
 
 

During this period, the KMC continued to generate an average yearly revenue of Rs40 to 50 million from parking fees.
The abolition has been hailed by citizens and commuters as one of the most significant urban relief measures in recent years.
For decades, unauthorised contractors and so-called “parking mafias” had monopolised prime city spots, often charging arbitrary fees without any legal basis or standardised rate.
The KMC, which previously managed parking on 46 main roads, had already suspended such fees under a citywide policy revamp. Now, all 25 TMCs fall under the same directive, having a level playing field across the city.
The decision, the officials say, also reflects growing confidence in the financial stability of the KMC and other urban bodies, who are now able to carry out their operations without resorting to street-level revenue generation tactics that burdened citizens.
“No institution other than KMC in designated areas, and that too under regulation, can now engage in fee collection. The days of extortion in the name of parking are over,” said a KMC spokesperson, adding that the government had also directed all municipal commissioners to ensure compliance, with a clear warning that failure to implement the order would result in immediate disciplinary measures.

The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
On Monday, floods swept through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, causing landslides and leaving many stranded. At least nine people died and more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure were damaged as a result.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: “The Karakoram Highway is open for all types of traffic.”
He recalled that the main artery had been blocked due to landslides and mud flow on Friday, adding that machinery was sent to restore the road.
Faraq further said that rescue and search operations were underway across the region. The recent floods have caused severe destruction in the region, particularly in the Kunduz region and the Ghanche district, he noted.
 


“Floods in GB have destroyed many houses, water channels, communication roads, standing crops, shops and electricity poles,” the official said.
He added that the local government has distributed “hundreds of tents, thousands of food packets and medicines to the affected people” across the region.
Speaking about the search operation in Babusar, Faraq said, “There may be 10 to 12 missing tourists at the Babusar valley as a search operation was ongoing.”
“The Pakistan Army, GB Scouts, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers are taking part in the operation,” he said, adding that continuous landslides and increasing water flow were hampering the search.
Another rescue operation was underway in Fairy Meadows, according to the government spokesperson.

“Four stranded tourists at Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat basecamp, including one man and three women, were airlifted through Pakistan Army helicopters on early Friday,” he added.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and his cabinet will also hold a press conference today regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation operations, Faraq added.
Earlier this week, the National Disaster Management Authority issued a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country. It advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.
GB govt announces free flights for stranded tourists, locals
The GB government had started free and special flights yesterday to evacuate stranded tourists and local people, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza noted.
In a media briefing on Friday, Mirza said 135 people, including 80 tourists, were taken from Skardu to Islamabad through a C-130 flight. “A special C-130 flight will start from Gilgit to Islamabad to shift stranded tourists and local passengers to Islamabad,” he added.
He also said that the GB government made the arrangements with the NDMA and Pakistan Army to “facilitate safe evacuation of tourists, patients, and students who were stranded at multiple locations”.
A helicopter service was also launched to evacuate tourists stranded in the affected areas, he added.
The chief secretary further noted, “The main cause of most of the incidents was melting glaciers and cloudburst.”
He said that the cloudburst-induced destructive flood at Babusar valley washed away around eight kilometres of the road leading to Babusar Top, sweeping away two dozen vehicles and leaving hundreds of tourists and locals stranded.
 
 

“However, the stranded tourists at Babusar valley and Deosai areas were safely evacuated through timely efforts by locals, Rescue 1122, district administration, the Pakistan Army, Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), and local community volunteers,” he added.
Mirza stated that 12km of roads, 26 bridges, 20 vehicles, water channels, cattle sheds, shops, agricultural lands, crops, private and public properties, irrigation channels, and drinking water supply systems had been damaged in several areas of GB.
“The GB government is effectively dealing with the situation,” he said, asserting the administration was providing aid to the affected places.</p><small>2025-07-26 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615854-three-ttp-terrorists-killed-in-swat-operation-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>Three TTP terrorists killed in Swat operation: CTD</strong></a><br><p>

Harsh Vardhan Jain, 47, was operating an “illegal West Arctic embassy by renting a house” in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, which neighbours the capital, local police said.
Jain, according to police, claimed to be the ambassador of fictional nations “like West Arctica, Saborga, Poulvia, Lodonia”.
He allegedly used vehicles with fake diplomatic plates and shared doctored photos of himself with Indian leaders to bolster his claims.
“His main activities involved acting as a broker to secure work in foreign countries for companies and private individuals, as well as operating a hawala (money transfer) racket through shell companies,” the police said in a statement following his arrest earlier this week.
He is also accused of money laundering.
During a raid on Jain’s property, police said they recovered $53,500 in cash in addition to doctored passports and forged documents bearing stamps of India’s foreign ministry.
AFP was unable to reach Jain or his representatives for comment.
Westarctica, cited by the police as one of the countries Jain claimed to be representing, is a US-registered nonprofit “dedicated to studying and preserving this vast, magnificent, desolate region” of Western Antarctica.
In a statement, it said it had appointed Jain as its “Honorary Consul to India” after he had made a “generous donation”.
“He was never granted the position or authority of ambassador,” it added.</p><small>2025-07-26 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615853-rawalpindi-womans-murder-court-grants-three-day-pyhiscal-of-two-suspects' target='_blank'><strong>Rawalpindi woman's murder: Court grants three-day pyhiscal of two suspects</strong></a><br><p>

Three assailants were also killed in the ensuing clashes with security forces, a senior police official told the state news agency IRNA.
He said a mother and child were among those killed by the gunmen who threw a hand grenade into the building in Zahedan, the capital of Sistan-Baluchestan.
In a statement posted on its Telegram account, militant group Jaish al-Adl took responsibility for the attack and urged “all civilians to immediately evacuate the area of clashes for their safety”.
The Baloch human rights group HAALVSH, quoting eyewitnesses, said several judiciary staff members and security personnel were killed or wounded when the assailants stormed the judges’ chambers.
Sistan-Baluchestan province, near the borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan, is home to Iran’s Sunni Baloch minority, who have long complained of economic marginalisation and political exclusion.
The province frequently sees clashes between security forces and armed groups, including militants and separatists who say they are fighting for greater rights and autonomy.
The Iranian government accuses some of them of ties to foreign powers and involvement in cross-border smuggling and insurgency.
Though attacks targeting judges are rare, two judges were killed in January in a shooting attack at the apex court building in Tehran.</p><small>2025-07-26 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/261236547e1cf68.png?r=140935' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926707/pakistan-presents-immense-investment-opportunities-mustafa-kamal-tells-health-moot-in-beijing' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan presents immense investment opportunities, Mustafa Kamal tells health moot in Beijing</strong></a><br><p>Health Minister Mustafa Kamal urged international stakeholders to explore partnerships in Pakistan’s rapidly evolving health landscape, highlighting the country’s “immense” potential for investment, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Saturday.
Representing Pakistan at Boao Forum for Asia’s (BFA) Global Health Forum in Beijing yesterday, the health minister underscored that Pakistan presents “immense opportunities for collaboration, innovation and investment”.
Established in 2001, the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) is a non-profit international organisation promoting regional cooperation in Asia. It focuses on health issues related to economic development and wellbeing.
The roundtable featured health ministers from all over the world, who discussed equal access to healthcare and sustainable reforms.
 






“Pakistan is ready for partnerships in global health,” Kamal said, highlighting the country’s 250 million population, nursing cooperation and digital reforms.
He pointed out that there were “significant opportunities for global collaboration in the health sector”, according to a post on his X account.
The minister noted that Pakistan could play a role in mitigating a shortage of nurses and paramedics through training and cooperation.
He invited global partners to explore investment avenues, emphasising Pakistan’s commitment to providing strong returns, streamlined regulation, and government support.
“Without health, the economy cannot progress,” Kamal said.
 






The health minister also drew attention to the new Digital System for Licensing and Registration of Medical Devices for the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), which was launched by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday.
At the inauguration, the premier noted that the registration of life-saving medical devices and diagnostic products in Pakistan had become a critical issue earlier this year. He expressed hope that the applications for such equipment would now be decided within 20 days.
Last month, Kamal noted that Pakistan’s healthcare system was riddled with fundamental flaws and that the solution lay not merely in building hospitals but in improving the entire environment.
The minister has also called attention towards Pakistan’s high fertility rate, high burden of both communicable and non-communicable diseases, and need to eradicate polio.</p><small>2025-07-26 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/261253420e8dd3a.jpg?r=130121' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926694/3-key-ttp-terrorists-killed-in-joint-operation-by-swat-ctd-police' target='_blank'><strong>3 ‘key’ TTP terrorists killed in joint operation by Swat CTD, police</strong></a><br><p>Three wanted terrorists and “key operatives” of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed during a joint operation of the police and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) in the Barikot tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district on Friday.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — particularly Bannu, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks targeting police stations and posts. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
“Three wanted terrorists have been killed in Barikot in a major win for Swat CTD. Eliminating the enemies of regional peace, the CTD has killed three important operatives of the Fitna al-Khawarij,” KP Police said in a statement today.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to the banned TTP.
 
 

Among the terrorists was Ajmal, also known as Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad who was reportedly involved in at least nine terrorism-related cases. He was also involved in the killing of Village Defence Council members and carried a bounty of Rs2 million.
The second individual was identified as Matiullah, also known by the aliases Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, who was wanted in two terrorism cases.
The third slain terrorist was Rahimullah Rehmani, alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah, a resident of Sheray in Afghanistan’s Nuristan province. He, too, was wanted in two separate terrorism cases.
“The terrorists were involved in attacks on security forces and assassinations of police personnel,” said the KP police statement. “A network spreading terrorism with external funding was destroyed, and the terrorists were also wanted in improvised explosive device (IED) attacks and extortion cases.”
“This CTD operation is a blow to the operational wings of Fitna al-Khawarij in Swat and adjacent areas,” Malakand Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sher Akbar Khan was quoted as saying. “We are determined to uproot Fitna al-Khawarij.”
 
 

Speaking to reporters, Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan said that search and strike operations against militants would continue across the district. He added that security has been intensified at all entry and exit points of Swat to prevent any possible infiltration of miscreants.
“We will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,” the DPO asserted.
KP Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed praised the regional police and Swat CTD for striking the “operational command wing” of Fitna al-Khawarij, according to the police statement.
“Operations against terrorists will be further intensified to establish lasting peace and order in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.
In a series of incidents in KP yesterday, a police official was martyred in the Karak district while police thwarted a separate late-night terrorist assault on a police station in Bannu’s Basyakhel area.
 
 

Earlier this month, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a joint operation by the CTD and the police in Lakki Marwat. This came nearly a week after the leader of a peace committee and two of his companions were shot dead by terrorists in the same district.
Three terrorists were also killed in Lakki Marwat’s Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee, in which a cop was martyred as well.
A total of 670 terror incidents were recorded in 2024, while 212 militants were killed in counter-terrorism operations, according to a report issued by the CTD.</p><small>2025-07-26 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615838-tourists-stuck-in-chilas-due-to-flood-landslides-as-pmd-forecasts-more-rains' target='_blank'><strong>Tourists stuck in Chilas due to flood, landslides as PMD forecasts more rains</strong></a><br><p>

The Power Division confirmed that under three separate sale agreements, Wah Industries purchased the non-functional plants from Northern Power Generation Company Ltd (NPGCL), Central Power Generation Company Ltd (CPGCL), and Jamshoro Power Company Ltd (JPCL). The agreements were signed on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, respectively.
The sale price marginally exceeded the reserve price of Rs38.224bn, previously set under Wapda’s auction regulations, which stipulate that G2G sales cannot occur below reserve value. With these agreements, the total revenue from both auction phases has reached Rs46.73bn, including Rs9.053bn earned from the March 18 auction of seven plants with a combined capacity of 1,016 megawatts (MW).
A Power Division official disclosed that the relatively better-performing 415MW Guddu thermal power plant was withheld from this transaction due to interest from a leading US firm for its potential refurbishment at a higher price.
In a press release, the Power Division said the State Bank of Pakistan had set a reserve price of Rs45.817bn for 61 outdated units, while the concluded sale fetched Rs46.73bn. In the first phase, 31 units were sold for Rs8.475bn against a reserve price of Rs7.593bn.
The division added that the sold units had been accumulating billions of rupees in annual operational costs. Their disposal is expected to yield substantial public savings. Furthermore, around 3,200 surplus employees from the decommissioned plants have been transferred to distribution companies (Discos), while approximately 774 officers still remain at the sold sites.

Sale raises Rs46.73bn after auction failure; over 3,900 employees reassigned or retained

The G2G deal was finalised under directives from the Prime Minister’s Task Force on Energy, led by Lt Gen Zafar Iqbal, following the second failed auction and delays in realising proceeds from the first round.
As part of broader power sector reforms aimed at reducing ballooning capacity payments and circular debt, the government last year decided to shut down ageing, redundant Genco plants. It initiated an international bidding process to auction obsolete machinery and equipment —  excluding land — to reduce fiscal pressures stemming from salaries, plant operations, maintenance, and capacity charges.
The Generation Holding Company Ltd (GHCL) was given a three-month deadline by the Energy Task Force to complete the auction and transaction. While the first auction round was held on March 18, it failed to attract international bidders. Contractors who secured contracts were required to pay 18pc general sales tax and 10pc income tax to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on the contract amount.
According to contractual terms, the payment was to be made either fully in advance or in four instalments over three months: 30pc within seven days of contract signing (without equipment removal), 25pc after 30 days, another 25pc after the following 30 days, and the remaining 20pc in the final month.
Although dismantling was permitted early on, equipment removal from the sites was restricted until full payment. However, the proceeds from the deal have not yet been fully realised.

In the first incident, a girl in her teens reportedly jumped into the river in the Chew Bazaar area. Her body was later fished out and handed over to her parents after a postmortem at the District Headquarters Hospital.
Any eyewitness, Inamullah, who runs a medical store in Chew Bazaar, told Dawn that the girl was seen buying mantoo (Afghani snack) from a vendor in front of his shop, from there she proceeded to the centre of the bridge and jumped into the river in front of many passersby.
Sub-divisional police officer, city circle, Sajjad Hussain told Dawn that the parents of the deceased had migrated to Singoor village of Chitral town from the Mulkhow tehsil of Upper Chitral.

They all ended their life by jumping into river, say police

He said the immediate reason for her suicide could not be known, while the police had started an inquiry under section 174 of Criminal Procedure Code to ascertain the facts leading to the incident.
 
 

In the second incident, a newly-married young man, identified as Zar Nabi, ended his life in Raman village of Laspur valley of Upper Chitral by jumping into the river.
Mastuj sub-divisional police officer Sher Raja confirmed the incident and said the marriage of the deceased had taken place three days ago. He said the search for the body was in progress.
He said in another incident in Mastuj, a married woman from Nisur Gol ended her life by jumping into the river. Her body was later recovered.
Mr Raja said police had started an inquiry to ascertain the reasons in both cases.
In yet another incident, a girl student of grade-9 in Kosht village of Mulkhow ended her life in a similar fashion. Her body was still to be recovered.
The deceased admitted to a school in Islamabad had come to her village with her parents during the summer vacation.
EXPEDITION: After the first successful trekking expedition to the base camp of Trich Mir, the second expedition left Chitral city on Friday morning, which will trek to the base camp via Oveer village.
Lower Chitral deputy commissioner Rao Hashim Azeem saw the participants off.
To mark the 75th anniversary of the first successful ascent to the highest peak of the Hindukush system of mountains, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has declared 2025 as ‘Year of Terich Mir’ and is arranging and sponsoring expeditions to the base camp.
In this regard, a group of women will also leave Chitral in the first week of August for trekking to Trich Mir base camp.

The administration is in talks with several universities, including Cornell, Duke, Northwestern and Brown, the source said, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the administration is close to striking deals with Northwestern and Brown and potentially Cornell.
A deal with Harvard, the country’s oldest and richest university, is a key target for the White House, the official added.
 
 

A spokesperson for Cornell declined to comment. Other universities did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump and his team have undertaken a broad campaign to leverage federal funding to force change at US universities, which the Republican president says are gripped by antisemitic and “radical left” ideologies.
Trump has targeted several universities since returning to office in January over the pro-Palestinian student protest movement that roiled college campuses last year.
Columbia University said on Wednesday that it will pay more than $200 million to the US government in a settlement with the administration to resolve federal probes and have most of its suspended federal funding restored.
The Trump administration has welcomed the Columbia deal, with officials believing the university set the standard on how to reach an agreement, the official said.
Harvard has taken a different approach, suing the federal government in a bid to get suspended federal grants restored.</p><small>2025-07-26 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/261047383cd2d81.jpg?r=104951' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926693/death-toll-rises-in-thai-cambodian-clashes-despite-ceasefire-call' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll rises in Thai-Cambodian clashes despite ceasefire call</strong></a><br><p>Thailand and Cambodia clashed for a third day on Saturday, as the death toll from their bloodiest fighting in years rose to 33 and Phnom Penh called for an “immediate ceasefire”.
A long-running border dispute erupted into intense conflict involving jets, artillery, tanks and ground troops on Thursday, prompting the UN Security Council (UNSC) to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis Friday.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said 13 people were now confirmed killed in the fighting, including eight civilians and five soldiers, with 71 people wounded.
In Thailand, the army said five soldiers were killed on Friday, taking the toll there to 20 — 14 civilians and six military.
The death toll across the two countries is now higher than the 28 killed in the last major round of fighting between 2008 and 2011.
Both sides reported a clash around 5am (3am PKT), with Cambodia accusing Thai forces of firing “five heavy artillery shells” into locations in Pursat province, which borders Thailand’s Trat province.
 
 

The fighting has forced more than 138,000 people to be evacuated from Thailand’s border regions, with more than 35,000 driven from their homes in Cambodia.
After the closed meeting of the UNSC in New York, Cambodia’s UN Ambassador Chhea Keo said his country wanted a ceasefire.
“Cambodia asked for an immediate ceasefire — unconditionally — and we also call for the peaceful solution of the dispute,” he told reporters.
Border row
Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Nikorndej Balankura said on Friday, before the UN meeting was held, that Bangkok was open to talks, possibly aided by Malaysia.
“We are ready, if Cambodia would like to settle this matter via diplomatic channels, bilaterally, or even through Malaysia, we are ready to do that. But so far we have not had any response,” Nikorndej told AFP.
Malaysia currently holds the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional bloc, of which Thailand and Cambodia are both members.
Acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai has warned that if the situation escalates, “it could develop into war”.
Both sides blamed each other for firing first, while Thailand accused Cambodia of targeting civilian infrastructure, including a hospital hit by shells and a petrol station hit by at least one rocket.
Cambodia has accused Thai forces of using cluster munitions.
At the UN, Cambodia’s envoy questioned Thailand’s assertion that his country, which is smaller and less militarily developed than its neighbour, had initiated the conflict.
“[The Security Council] called for both parties to [show] maximum restraint and resort to a diplomatic solution. That is what we are calling for as well,” said Chhea Keo.
The fighting marks a dramatic escalation in a long-running dispute between the neighbours — both popular destinations for millions of foreign tourists — over their shared 800-kilometre (500-mile) border.
Dozens of kilometres in several areas are contested and fighting broke out between 2008 and 2011, leaving at least 28 people dead and tens of thousands displaced.
A UN court ruling in 2013 settled the matter for over a decade, but the current crisis erupted in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a new clash.</p><small>2025-07-26 05:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615820-terrorist-involved-in-attack-on-hangu-dpo-killed' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorist involved in attack on Hangu DPO killed</strong></a><br><p>

• Approves Rs72bn housing subsidy for 50,000 low-income families
ISLAMABAD: The government raised serious concerns on Friday over 29 per cent illegitimate profiteering in the edible oil and ghee market and approved a subsidised housing scheme for 50,000 low-income families during the current fiscal year.
Presiding over a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb was informed that international prices of edible oil and ghee had declined by 24pc in recent weeks, yet the local industry had failed to pass on the relief to consumers. In some cases, prices were increased by 4-5pc due to weak market oversight.
Officials said the local industry routinely engaged in unfair practices due to a lack of regulation. While the Ministry of Industries and Production assured the ECC of adequate national stock levels, it acknowledged the limited pass-through of international price declines to the domestic market.
The ECC directed strict monitoring to curb price distortions and potential cartelisation, urging the Ministry of Industries to coordinate with the Competition Commission of Pakistan, the National Price Monitoring Committee, and provincial governments.
Subsidised housing scheme
The ECC approved a markup subsidy and risk-sharing scheme to facilitate low-cost housing finance, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expected to formally launch the programme on Aug 14.
Initially planned for 200,000 units, the scheme will now target 50,000 housing units — five-marla houses or 1,360 sq. ft flats — for first-time homeowners. Loans of up to Rs2 million will be offered at a subsidised 5pc fixed rate, and up to Rs3.5m at 8pc for the first 10 years, with market rates thereafter. The tenure will be up to 20 years, with no processing fees or prepayment penalties.
The scheme includes a 90:10 loan-to-value ratio and a 10pc first-loss risk-sharing facility for participating institutions, including commercial, Islamic and microfinance banks, as well as the House Building Finance Corporation. It will be administered by the Pakistan Housing Authority Foundation (PHA-F).
The total subsidy over 20 years is estimated at Rs72bn, with Rs3.93bn allocated for 2025–26. Disbursements are projected at Rs100bn in the first year. The budgetary requirement will peak at Rs7.12bn next year before tapering off to Rs2.26bn by FY36.
The ECC also directed the Ministry of Housing & Works to develop a centralised database of the housing sector in coordination with federal and provincial bodies for better targeting and implementation. Three names have been proposed for the scheme: Apna Ghar-Roshan Mustaqbil, Mera Khwab-Mera Aashiyana, and Mera Ghar-Meri Jannat.
Steel sector policy: The ECC endorsed a Ministry of Commerce report on boosting the competitiveness of the steel sector under the National Tariff Policy 2025–30, aimed at reducing production costs and promoting export-led growth.
RLNG tariffs appeal: The ECC approved a summary for filing an appeal in the Supreme Court against the Lahore High Court’s decision to grant gas/RLNG tariff concessions to Ghani Glass Ltd. The committee noted that such concessions have been withdrawn from all sectors.
Green taxonomy: Pakistan’s Green Taxonomy was approved to help financial institutions identify climate-aligned projects, enhance transparency in green investments, and mitigate climate-related financial risks.
Skills bond guarantee: To promote skills development through outcome-based financing, the ECC approved a Rs1bn sovereign guarantee for the issuance of the Pakistan Skill Impact Bond (PSIB). The Ministry of Education was advised to explore public-private partnerships and reduce reliance on government guarantees.
Radio-based service charges: The Ministry of IT’s proposal to revise charges for Radio-Based Services was approved, with directives for regular revisions every 3–5 years in line with economic and technological shifts.
Ship-breaking industry status: The ECC formally declared ship-breaking and recycling as an industry. However, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs was asked to coordinate with the Power Division to assess the impact of shifting from commercial to industrial power tariffs.

Police have sought court orders for the exhumation of the deceased’s body to ascertain the cause of her death.
According to sources close to the investigation, as many as eight people, including the gravedigger, the graveyard secretary, the rickshaw driver who transported her body to the graveyard, her husband and family members including her brother, have been detained by police in connection with the case.
However, the police will charge them with murder and honour killing only in light of the postmortem report, which is expected after the exhumation of Ms Sidra’s body. The victim, 19, was married in February this year.
 







Seek court orders for exhumation of the deceased’s body to ascertain cause of death after making multiple arrests

Police initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of honour in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated.
 
 

As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered an FIR with the police under Section 496A.
Police sources said that the FIR was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow. However, the actual cause of her death will be determined after the exhumation.
“The purpose of registering the FIR for the woman’s abduction was only to avoid a murder investigation,” said a source.
In the FIR, the complainant stated that he was a resident of Pirwadhai and worked as a salesman at a cloth store in Bara Market, Rawalpindi.
He said he married Sidra Gul, 19, on January 17, 2025, and that she had been living with him since then.
On July 11, he claimed, a quarrel broke out between them over a petty issue after he returned home from work. He said he ignored the matter and went to sleep.
He further stated that after he went to sleep, his wife disappeared from the house, taking jewellery, clothes, and Rs150,000 in cash, without informing anyone.
After her disappearance, he said he inquired with her parents and searched for her, but could not find any clue to her whereabouts.
 
 

Later, he claimed he received information from local residents that his wife had a relationship with a man, had eloped with him, and was later illegally married to him, despite already being married.
He stated in the FIR that when he spoke to her family, they did not inform him about the alleged paramour and also refused to return his wife.
According to sources, shocking revelations emerged after the police began their investigation. The suspects had even erased the grave markers to cover up evidence.
Police have arrested around eight individuals in connection with the woman’s death, including the gravedigger, the graveyard secretary and relatives from both families.

The resolution, moved by Syed Zafar Ali Agha, a JUI-F MPA from Pishin, was adopted without opposition during the session presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai.
Speaking on the resolution, Mr Agha expressed concern that many private schools in the province follow curriculums that differ significantly from the Balochistan Textbook Board, which negatively affects student performance. He added that some institutions prioritise non-academic activities over education, depriving students of meaningful learning.
He also criticised the practice of collecting advance fees for vacation periods, particularly during the December to February winter break. “It is unjust to demand a three-month fee during the vacation, especially from students of low-income families,” he said.
The resolution urged the provincial government to ensure compliance with the Balochistan Textbook Board curriculum, ban non-academic activities and prohibit the collection of tuition fees during holidays — December to February in colder areas and May to July in warmer regions.

Resolution calls for end to fee collection during three-month vacations

It also called for the introduction of a standardised and reasonable fee structure up to the secondary level to ensure equitable access to quality education.
 
 

Responding to the resolution, Provincial Minister Raheela Hameed Khan Durrani said a unified national curriculum is being rolled out nationwide. “We have moved far beyond the ‘Alif, Anaar, Bay, Bakri’ level,” she said while referring to outdated teaching methods.
The minister acknowledged issues in matriculation exam marking and announced a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter.
Ms Durrani added that many previously closed schools had reopened and new teachers have been hired. She noted that government schools offer free education up to matriculation, while private institutions follow independent fee structures.
In his speech, Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti criticised mismanagement at the University of Balochistan. “New buildings are being constructed while staff salaries go unpaid,” he said.
Dr Abdul Malik Baloch of the National Party called for the establishment of catheterisation labs in provincial hospitals and proposed that the building of the Agricultural University be officially handed over to the university.
CM Bugti responded that the Agricultural College had earlier communicated that it did not require the building, citing low student numbers. It is currently in use by the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), though not under ownership.
He added that Balochistan’s youth could become a valuable workforce if properly trained and stressed the need to reform universities’ management structure.
“No one wants to see our teachers protesting on the streets,” he said, adding that 3,200 schools had reopened due to government policies and no school would be closed next year.
 
 

Provincial Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar acknowledged that healthcare in the province had historically been neglected and that doctors had not received promotions since 2013.
He said steps are now being taken to post doctors in rural areas to reduce patient overload in Quetta.
The minister also noted the lack of data within the health department and emphasised the need for doctors to serve in their home districts, including female doctors.
Provincial Minister Noor Muhammad Dummar addressed social media rumours regarding land allotments in Harnai and Ziarat, urging the assembly to present official records.
The speaker directed the Revenue Department to submit a complete record of forest land allotments in Ziarat from 2010 to the present.

President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Muhammad Jawed Bilwani, said that borrowing costs in Pakistan are among the highest stifling business growth. He noted that interest rates in Vietnam stand at 6.3pc, followed by Cambodia at 3pc, Indonesia at 6pc, and India at 5.5pc.
He added that Pakistan’s competitiveness is further eroded by steep energy costs, with electricity tariffs hovering around 16 cents per unit compared to 9 cents in Bangladesh, 8 cents in Vietnam, 10 cents in Cambodia and Indonesia, 7.2 cents in India, and just 5 cents in Sri Lanka.
A reduction in interest rates to 5-6pc would provide vital relief to businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which are disproportionately burdened by high financing costs, he said.
Bilwani also highlighted that over 75pc of domestic credit is consumed by government borrowing, leaving less than 25pc for the private sector. “This imbalance must be addressed through proactive monetary policy,” he added.

Industrialists call for sharp cut in SBP policy rate

He warned that Pakistan remains uncompetitive not only due to high interest rates but also because of elevated electricity, gas, and water tariffs, steep taxation, and one of the highest minimum wages in the region — all while labour productivity remains low. “These elements must be rationalised to lower the cost of doing business,” he said.
Korangi Association of Trade and Industry President Junaid Naqi, echoed the demand, pointing out that with inflation dropping to 3.2pc in June and the current policy rate at 11pc, there is no economic rationale for maintaining such a high interest rate.
“Industries are operating below capacity, new investments are stalled, and business confidence is at a low,” he said. “Persisting with outdated monetary policies will only worsen unemployment, depress investment, and cause revenue shortfalls.”
Vice presidents of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), Amaan Pracha and Asif Sakhi, along with Faisal Moiz Khan of the North Karachi Association of Trade and Industry and Sheikh Mohammad Tahseen of the Federal B Area Association of Trade and Industry, also jointly urged the central bank to bring interest rates down to single digits to spur industrial expansion.
They noted that easing interest rates would reduce pressures on manufacturers and help restore economic momentum.President of the United Business Group (UBG), Zubair Tufail, also called for a 4-5pc reduction in the policy rate, arguing that monetary easing is essential for economic revival.
Offering a differing view, Lasbela Chamber of Commerce and Industry  President Yakoob H. Karim urged an immediate rate cut from 11pc to 9pc  in the July 30 meeting, with a target of 5pc by end-2025 to support  long-term economic growth.

• Ex-State Dept official Elizabeth Horst made acting envoy to Pakistan
WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday and discussed trade, investment, counterterrorism cooperation and the clash between India and Pakistan in May, according to officials from both countries.
The meeting — the first such engagement between the foreign ministers of the two countries in three years — is being considered a breakthrough in diplomacy between Pakistan and the US.
On the same day, the US named an acting ambassador in Islamabad.
 






In Washington, Mr Dar and Secretary Rubio held their first meeting since working together in May to negotiate a ceasefire that ended a dangerous military standoff between India and Pakistan.
In a post shared after the meeting, Mr Dar said he discussed bilateral relations with Secretary Rubio.
“We reaffirmed our commitment to the long-term Pakistan-US partnership, with renewed focus on economic, trade, investment, IT/AI, and CT [counterterrorism] cooperation.”
 






Secretary Rubio, in a separate post, highlighted key economic and strategic aspects of the meeting.
“Met with Pakistani Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister today to discuss expanding bilateral trade and enhancing collaboration in the critical minerals sector,” he said.
Both leaders mentioned discussions on regional developments, an apparent hint at the India-Pakistan relationship and clashes in May.
Mr Rubio said he thanked FM Dar for “preserving regional stability”.
 






In his post, Mr Dar hailed the “constructive role” played by the US in reaching the ceasefire.
According to a statement issued by the Pakistan embassy in Washington, Mr Dar said the US role “helped avert a potential nuc­lear confrontation and restored calm to a volatile region”.
The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace and ongoing counterterrorism cooperation.
Secretary Rubio recognised Pakistan’s “unparalleled sacrifices” in the fight against terrorism and described Islamabad as a “constructive actor” in efforts to ensure regional stability.
Trade and investment
The talks also addressed the future of bilateral trade and investment.
Both delegations — led by their respective foreign ministers and joined by senior officials — discussed opportunities in agriculture, energy, technology, and critical minerals.
Mr Dar described Pakistan as an “attractive destination” for American investors and voiced optimism about progress in the ongoing trade dialogue.
US engagement in South Asia
Mr Dar and Secretary Rubio also discussed cooperation at various global forums, including the UN Security Council.
The meeting “reaffirmed the importance of close coordination at multilateral fora, including at the UN Security Council,” and exchanged views on “key regional and global developments,” Mr Dar said.
 
 

Later, in a conversation with NBC News’ Dan De Luce at the Atlantic Council, Mr Dar outlined Islamabad’s regional outlook and addressed pathways for managing India-Pakistan tensions.
“For peace in South Asia, we need continued US involvement,” he said, calling for an “open-eyed” policy that “understands the risk of disengagement.”
Mr Dar highlighted the need for “a sustainable mechanism for conflict resolution” in the region, adding that there could be no peace unless India agrees to hold dialogue on all issues, including Kashmir.
He also revealed the US and Pakistan were close to concluding a deal for extracting minerals from Pakistan and an agreement could be finalised in “weeks and days, not months.”
 


Responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s incarceration, Mr Dar drew a parallel with the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, who has spent years in a US prison.
He noted that Pakistan did not interfere in that process because “the Americans had followed their judicial system”.
Similarly, he said, Mr Khan was sentenced by Pakistan’s judiciary, which followed the due process of law.
“When the due process is followed, others do not have the right to interfere,” he said.
When asked if Pakistan would continue to buy weapons from China, Mr Dar said the country would go for whoever offered a better deal.
New US envoy
Meanwhile, the State Department has appointed Elizabeth Horst as the acting US ambassador to Pakistan.
Ms Horst, a senior career diplomat currently serving as the principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, has arrived in Pakistan to take charge of her position.
“I am back in Pakistan (where I started my diplomatic career 20 years ago), this time for a short stint as the acting ambassador,” she wrote in a social media post.
“What a joy to visit one of the most magical places in Punjab, the Lahore Fort. I saw how US support is helping preserve this magnificent monument and demonstrate our long-term partnership. The people-to-people ties and cultural bonds are what underpin our work.”
 



Ms Horst’s appointment, though temporary, is seen as both strategic and symbolic.
Her arrival signals Washington’s continued interest in maintaining high-level engagement with Islamabad, even as the Biden administration calibrates its broader South Asia policy.

A tribal jirga representing the erstwhile Fata region and backed by religio-political parties wants the merger of the tribal areas with the province reversed.
The federal government, while willing to offer some concessions, is not in favour of that demand. Separately, the KP government has said a firm ‘no’ to any kinetic operations in the province. On the other hand, the country’s security establishment apparently wants it to be known that it can resort to any option regardless of what Peshawar wants.
 
 

The people of KP, too, stand opposed to kinetic measures; at the same time, they also strongly desire to be rid of the militant presence. With the vitiated state of national politics preventing different stakeholders from coming together and working out acceptable solutions to KP’s many issues, the province’s social fabric continues to fray and warp.
One wonders why the reversal of Fata’s merger with KP is being brought up now. The ‘mainstreaming’ of the region was a significant milestone that finally opened the door to its overdue development and modernisation. Previously ruled under colonial-era laws, Fata residents were finally able to gain representation in the KP Assembly and elect their own leaders. They also gained access to regular courts, police and public services, which was a marked improvement over being governed by the Frontier Crimes Regulation and relying on irregular tribal militias for their security needs.
Progress on the administrative end has indeed been slow, and funding shortfalls have hampered development plans, but these are not enough reasons to roll back the 25th Amendment. The residents of that region deserve to be considered and treated like all other citizens of Pakistan, and the government has done well to reject the tribal jirga’s main demand.
At the same time, the province’s deteriorating security situation, which disproportionately affects the erstwhile tribal areas, needs a mature response. The lack of political consensus may be attributed to the establishment’s persistent interference in civilian affairs, but the KP government also has questions to answer.
 
 

In the past, the PTI appeared sympathetic to the Pakistani Taliban. It may be recalled that there was even a drive to ‘settle’ hardened militants in KP while it was ruling in the centre. Today, the party is criticising the state for its policy of ‘good Taliban, bad Taliban’. Has it finally accepted its mistake in trusting militant outfits — a mistake which cost the country numerous lives? And if so, what is it doing to make amends?
If military operations are not an option, then, as a representative of the people, the KP government should propose alternatives. The centre must not impose a solution, but Peshawar also cannot just stand by and complain.

• Karakoram Highway blocked again; tourists evacuated via C-130 flights
RAWALPINDI / LAHORE / GILGIT: The Pakistan Meteo­rological Department (PMD) has forecast another spell of monsoon rains across the country from July 29 to 31, urging provincial and district administrations to take precautionary measures.
According to the Met Office, weak monsoon currents are continuously penetrating the upper and central parts of the country and are likely to intensify next week. A westerly wave is expected to approach on July 29.
Rain accompanied by wind and isolated heavy showers is expected in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (including Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur) and Gilgit-Baltistan (Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche, Shigar) from July 27 to 31 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, rain and thundershowers are forecast from July 28 to 31 for several districts, inclu­ding Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohi­stan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbot­tabad, Haripur, Buner, Mala­kand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Kohat, Peshawar, Char­sadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi and Dera Ismail Khan.
In Punjab and Islamabad, rain with scattered heavy showers is expected in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Murree, Galiyat, Lahore, Gujra­nwala, Fais­alabad and several other cities between July 28 and 31. Southern Punjab, including DG Khan, Multan and Bahawalpur, will see similar weather from July 29 to 31.
 
 

In Balochistan, rain and thundershowers with isolated heavy falls are expected in the north-eastern and southern districts from the night of July 29 to 31 July, including Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibbi, Dera Bugti, Lasbela, Awaran, Khuzdar, Quetta, Zhob, Qilla Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Ziarat and Kalat.
In Sindh, mainly hot and humid weather will prevail, but rain and thunder showers are expected in several parts, including Tharparkar, Umerkot, Dadu, Larkana and Sukkur, on July 30 and 31.
The PMD warned of potential flash floods in hilly streams of KP, northeast Balochistan, northeast Punjab and Kashmir from July 29 to 31. Urban flooding is likely in low-lying areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore and Sialkot from July 28 (night) to July 31.
Landslides and mudslides may block roads in hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Murree, Galiyat and Kashmir during the forecast period.
Fifth monsoon spell
In a joint advisory, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of Punjab and the PMD forecast the fifth spell of monsoon rains in the province for the upcoming week.
Rain, wind and thundershowers with scattered heavy falls are expected in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and several other districts, while southern Punjab will receive rainfall between July 29 and 31.
 






PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia ordered all commissioners and deputy commissioners to remain alert and complete precautionary measures. Civil defence, rescue services and related departments have been instructed to ensure preparedness.
He warned of possible landslides in Murree and Galiyat and damage to mud houses and weak structures. He also urged citizens to avoid unnecessary travel, refrain from crossing flooded roads and stay away from electrical infrastructure.
According to a PDMA fact sheet, Punjab witnessed rainfall in many parts over the last 24 hours, with Multan receiving 117mm, Lahore 43mm, Sheikhupura 37mm, Hafizabad 15mm, Okara 13mm and Sahiwal 12mm.
Moreover, 10 people were injured due to roof collapses in the last 12 hours. However, there was no loss of life due to accidents caused by rain in the last 24 hours.
The fact sheet also revealed 54 per cent water storage in Mangla Dam, 79pc in Tarbela and medium-level flooding in the Indus River at Chashma and Taunsa.
The flow of water in the Chenab, Ravi, Jhelum and Sutlej rivers is currently at normal levels.
The Punjab government has banned bathing in rivers, canals and storm drains, warning of strict action against violators.
GB faces climate emergency
Meanwhile, the Gilgit-Baltistan government said on Friday that the region is in the grip of severe climate change impacts, as floods triggered by melting glaciers and cloudbursts continue to cause widespread devastation.
People in several areas faced shortages of drinking and irrigation water, electricity, internet, telephone services and road access, as floods, landslides and soil erosion damaged roads, water channels, irrigation systems, power infrastructure and optical fibre networks.
In a media briefing, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza confirmed that nine people, including two women and two children, have died since July 10, including eight in Diamer’s Babusar and Thor valleys and one in Astore.
 
 

He said many areas were cut off due to landslides and mudflows. The Karakoram Highway was blocked again at Chilas, after which C-130 flight operations were started to evacuate stranded tourists and patients to Islamabad. Four tourists were airlifted from Fairy Meadows near Nanga Parbat.
Floods destroyed 196 homes, damaged another 200 and swept away over 12km of roads, 26 bridges, 20 vehicles, agricultural land and other infrastructure, including water channels and communication lines.
Mr Mirza said relief efforts are underway, with tents, food and emergency supplies being delivered. He acknowledged the growing frequency of cloudbursts and glacier melt, attributing the disasters to climate change.
Special flights from Skardu and Gilgit to Islamabad have begun, with 135 people, including 80 tourists, flown out so far. Search operations are underway for 10 to 12 missing tourists in Babusar Valley.
The GB government asked citizens to follow travel advisories and announced plans to review early warning systems, including the UNDP-funded Glof-II project.

• Approves Skill Impact Bond project to provide funds to educational and skill development institutes
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said the government is fully committed to implementing the agenda of economic digitisation, rightsizing public institutions, and ensuring merit-based appointments of experts in government departments.
The premier expressed this resolve while presiding over a mee­ting to assess progress on the appoi­ntment of technical experts across federal ministries and departments, and to discuss measures for enhancing foreign investment.
At the meeting, the Publ­ic-Private Part­nership Authority presented a detailed briefing on current initiatives and future plans aimed at streamlining exp­ert appointments and increasing investor confidence.
The prime minister highlighted institutional reforms as a top priority of the federal government.
 






While asserting that there will be no compromise on merit and transparency in the appointment of experts, PM Shehbaz said: “We are fully committed to implementing our agenda of economic digitisation, rightsizing public institutions, and ensuring merit-based appointments of experts in government departments.”
The meeting was earlier briefed that appointments had been made on 15 technical expert positions whereas appointment process was underway for 47 additional technical positions.
“Some 30 candidates have been shortlisted for the appointment of chief executive officers, chief fina­ncial officers, and managing directors in seven key ministries and departments,” the meeting was told.
 
 

The PM was further apprised that initial rounds of interviews for appointments in the petroleum division and national vocational and technical training commission had been completed.
Federal ministries have designated focal teams to formulate strategies for investment and sectoral roadmaps for investment.
Meanwhile, sectoral frameworks related to investment in food security, maritime affairs, minerals, tourism, industry, housing, and energy were in their final stages.
The prime minister was further informed that pitch-books for 18 economic sectors had been prepared to allocate projects for investment from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan, Qatar and Kuwait.
Skill Impact Bond
PM Shehbaz also approved the country’s first Skill Impact Bond programme, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
Under the programme, funds will be provided to those educational and skill development institutions which will produce skilled professionals.
The initiative is designed to attract private investment for equipping the youth with market-relevant skills to foster sustainable employment.
Under this model, young people will receive training in contemporary skills aligned with industry needs, empowering them to actively contribute to national economic development.
He also instructed officials to offer opportunities for learning local languages of potential host countries, facilitating overseas employment for the Pakistani youth.
He said he would personally review progress of this project every two months.
 
 

The meeting was informed that so far 500,000 people have been registered under the digital youth hub whereas 1.7 million people downloaded the application.
The meeting was apprised that over 500 registered companies, around 47,000 job opportunities in Pakistan and approximately 100,000 in abroad in addition to that more than 2000 scholarships are available.
EU ambassador
Meanwhile, Amba­ssador of the European Union in Pakistan Riina Kionka paid a farewell call on the premier at Prime Minister’s House.
Underscoring the significance of the European Union as one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners, the premier reaffirmed the government’s commitment to the GSP Plus scheme, which had proved to be mutually beneficial for both sides.
 






Meeting with Dr Fouzia
Also, Dr Fouzia Siddiqui, sister of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, called on the prime minister, who assured her that the government would continue to provide all possible legal and diplomatic support in the matter of Dr Aafia Siddiqui who is detained in the Unites States.
“The government is in no way negligent regarding the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui,” the PM said.
 






On the instructions of PM Shehbaz, the government previously provided diplomatic and legal assistance in the case of Dr Aafia.
Later, PM Shehbaz welcomed Nawabzada Mohsin Ali Khan, former provincial president of PTI into the PML-N ranks during a meeting at the PM Office.

• Emphasises institutional support for judges while expecting district judiciary to uphold diligence, humility, empathy, and discipline
• Terms ethical integration of AI in court systems top priority
ISLAMABAD: Describing the district judiciary as the most precious jewel in the crown of Pakistan’s judicial system, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Friday unveiled a road map for safeguarding the judges from external influences by empowering, protecting and providing institutional support to ensure independent discharge of their duties.
“It is my dream to see an aggrieved citizen walk confidently into the court of magistrate or a civil court in his own local town instead of being burdened to appr­oach the high court or the Supreme Court for seeking redressal of his grievances,” CJP observed while speaking at a symposium marking the International Day for Judicial Wellbeing under the theme ‘The Human Dimension of Responsive Justice’.
The event brought together judges of the superior and district judiciary, legal experts, development partners, and institutional stakeholders for a landmark dial­o­­gue on judicial wellbeing in Pakistan here at the Federal Judicial Academy (FJA).
In his keynote address, CJP underscored the urgent need to humanise judicial reforms by recognising the emotional, psychological, and institutional pressures faced by judges, particularly at the district level.
The judge who is institutionally supported is always fair, supportive and effectively responsive, the CJP observed but said when the wellbeing of the district judiciary was at the centre stage, it is expected that its members remain committed to the highest ideals of the public service.
 
 

The members of the district judiciary must be diligent, disciplined, respectful, polite, humble and empathetic toward the citizen they serve, he emphasised.
“These standards are not an additional burden but always for them to honour their role – a role that matters not so much to the judiciary but to the entire nation,” CJP observed.
Referring to the superior judiciary, Mr Afridi shared, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) was also seized with the issue and deliberating on how to protect judges from extraneous pressures.
Sharing a number of concrete short- and medium-term reform policies adopted by the National Judicial Policy Making Committee (NJPMC) — a committee comprising all chief justices of the high courts and headed by the CJP, he said a committee had been formed with the decision that each high court will formulate clear guidelines for members of the district judiciary to follow in case they face any extraneous influences.
Along with the defined response of the high court to counter such instance, he said he had also invited the chief justices of the high courts to consider incorporating the role of CJP in the response framework to ensure strong and unified institutional support.
The message must be clear to all that CJP will stand to support independent, honest and steadfast judicial officers,“ he said.
The CJP also recalled how issues such as the performance evaluation mechanism of district judges, standardisation of their recruitment process, parity in service conditions, and access to international exposure were raised during his meetings with district judiciary members on his visits.
 
 

“Instead of deciding their destiny from the Supreme Court, let the district judiciary deliberate and propose to the apex court what should be done,” he stated.
In this regard, Justice Rehmat Hussain Jaffery — a retired Supreme Court judge with experience in the district judiciary — has been nominated to head a committee, also including Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan as a member.
One of the most critical aspects of the justice system, the CJP emphasised, is the institutionalisation of arbitration. He revealed that 20 trained and expert judges are already available in the judiciary for this purpose.
He announced that one district from each high court’s jurisdiction will be selected to implement this arbitration mandate. Progress will be reviewed after three months, and if successful, the model will be expanded to other districts.
Ethical guidelines for AI use
The CJP recalled how NJPMC discussed on ethical guidelines for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
 
 

Undoubtedly given the rise of AI and its benefits, it is our top priority to integrate the concept into the justice delivery system, he said.
He added the the Supreme Court was in contact with the Supreme Court of Peoples Republic of China and that of the Constitutional Court of Turkiye to enter into memorandum of understanding for judicial cooperation for a period of five years.

• Warrants issued for Shibli in capital police attack case
• ATC extends Qureshi’s bail in May 9 cases till Sept 19
ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Ale­ema Khan, the sister of former jailed PTI founder Imran Khan, has filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) accusing jail aut­horities of deliberately obstruc­ting her brother’s access to legal aid.
The petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, named the Adiala Jail superintendent and deputy superintendent as respondents.
The petition claimed jail officials had not returned power of attorney (PoA) documents submitted 10 days ago by Mr Khan’s legal team.
These documents are essential to authorise lawyers to file appeals in the Supreme Court against bail rejections, the petition noted.
 
 

The documents are critical as the deadline to file an appeal in the Supreme Court was approaching.
Any further delay would permanently bar Mr Imran from challenging bail denials, the petition argued.
It added that despite repeated requests by four senior advocates, jail officials neither processed the power of attorney nor communicat­ed updates with Mr Khan’s legal team.
The jail authorities’ “arbitrary, malafide, and unconstitutional” actions violated Mr Khan’s fundamental rights to legal representation under Articles 4, 9, 10A of the Constitution.
The petition claimed the delaying tactics were part of a broader pattern where the state instituted “politically motivated cases to suppress dissent”
Mr Khan’s sister requested IHC to order jail authorities to “facilitate Imran Khan’s signatures on the PoA before the limitation period expires, enabling appeals to the Supreme Court.”
Warrants out for Shibli
Separately, a judge in Lahore has issued non-bailable arrest warrants for PTI Senator Shibli Faraz and summoned Mr Khan in a case related to an alleged attack on Isla­mabad police outside Zaman Park.
The case dated back to March 2023, when Islamabad Police had arrived to arrest Mr Khan for skipping court hearings in the Toshakhana case.
However, the force failed to arrest Mr Khan.
The capital’s police lodged an FIR against Mr Khan, Mr Faraz and 150 other party workers for harassing and hurling life threats at the cops.
 
 

The FIR, registered at the Race Course police station, alleged Mr Khan, in connivance with Mr Faraz and other party workers, committed a crime by dodging and barring the Islamabad police from discharging their duty.
On Friday, the judicial magistrate at Cantonment Courts,  Sohail Rafiq, issued a written order regarding the proceedings of the case.
In its decision, the magistrate noted that Senator Faraz did not appear before the court and issued his non-bailable arrest warrant.
The magistrate summoned the PTI founding chairman in the same case for July 30.
Qureshi’s bail extended
The interim pre-arrest bail of PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi in seven cases linked to May 9 violence has been extended until Sept 19.
The cases include attacks on the Lahore Corps Commander House and Askari Tower, arson at the PML-N office and the burning of containers at Kalma Chowk.
ATC Judge Arshad Javed heard Mr Qureshi’s bail applications in five of the cases.
After the arguments, the judge extended the interim bail until the next hearing.
 
 

In the remaining two cases related to the Corps Commander House and Askari Tower attacks, ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill directed Mr Qureshi’s lawyers to present arguments at the next hearing.
All seven bail petitions were filed before Mr Qureshi’s arrest.
While his bail was earlier dismissed due to the detention, they were later reinstated following orders from the Lahore High Court.

• Senate unanimously adopts resolution condemning Israel’s sovereignty claim over occupied West Bank
ISLAMABAD: In a rare move, the attorney gereneral for Pakistan (AGP) has been summoned to appear before the Senate, after lawmakers from both sides of the aisle raised concerns on Friday about alleged interference in House by judiciary, with some senators demanded immediate appearance of principal law officer in the lower house.
The issue was raised by former deputy chairman Senate and PPP leader Saleem Mandviwalla while Senator Shahadat Awan, also from PPP, was presiding over the session. Mr Mandviwalla voiced concern the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and Lahore High Court (LHC) had recently issued stay orders against proceedings of the Senate standing committees.
He said that throughout his legislative career, he had never witnessed such interference work of committees, which are extension of parliament.
Terming the development ‘alarming’, Mr Mandviwalla urged the chair to summon the attorney general and demand a serious expla­nation. “We have never interfered in court proceedings,” he remarked.
 






While acknowledging that the Constitution and rules do not bar parliament or its committees from discussing sub judice matters, he said such discussions are generally avoided out of respect for the judiciary. However, in this instance, he noted, stay orders were issued despite the absence of any pending court cases.
“This is direct interference in the functioning and proceedings of parliamentary committees. The Attorney General must be summoned and asked what kind of joke this is,” he added.
When Mr Awan pointed out that the law minister was not present and suggested referring the matter to the attorney general via the secretariat for review of the case records, Mr Mandviwalla insisted that the attorney general, not the law minister, was the relevant authority.
 
 

Amid uproar with demands for immediate summoning of the attorney general, Mr Awan agreed to issue a notice to him to address the reservations of the House. “Let the Attorney General come to the House and brief it on the facts so that appropriate legal action can be taken,” he said.
However, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry proposed that the attorney general be called to the Senate chairman’s chamber.
Violation of Article 69
Referring to Article 69(1) of the Constitution, PPP Senator Zameer Ghumro said, “The validity of any proceedings in Majlis-i-Shoora (Parliament) shall not be called in question on the ground of any irregularity of procedure.” He criticised the stay orders as violations of the separation of powers principle.
“Have we ever interfered in the working of any institution?” he asked.
Senator Dilawar Khan said the parliament was supreme and there was no justification for any instruction to meddle in its affairs.
PTI senator Saifullah Abro criticised Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar over passage of controversial amendments meant to make judiciary a “toothless body” and demanded that the attorney general be immediately summoned in the House.
JUI-F senator Kamran Murtaza also deplored the interference of judiciary in the matters of parliament and said displeasure should be conveyed to the judiciary.
Under Article 57 of the Constitution, the attorney general has the right to speak and take part in the proceedings of either House, or a joint sitting. It, however, remains a question if the attorney general would make a rare appearance before the House or not. Sources in the Senate said the secretariat would send verbatim of the proceedings to him and sought a report, which would then be placed before the Senate chairman who would then decide future course of action.
Resolution on Palestine
Separately, the Senate also unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the Israeli parliament’s decision to assert sovereignty over the occupied West Bank.
The resolution was moved in the House by Senator Palwasha Khan, terming the Israeli parliament’s resolution illegal, illegitimate, and null and void under international law, United Nations Security Council resolutions, and the Geneva Conventions.
Allegations against ex-minister
A contentious issue cropped up during Question Hour, when Dr Chaudhry, the minister for parliamentary affairs, claimed a former finance minister had increased the allocation for BISP Nashounuma Programme to around Rs 20 billion at a time when a company owned by him was the sole supplier of specialised nutritional food under the programme.
Mr Chaudhry claimed the company owned by Miftah Ismail was awarded the contract without following the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and food valuing Rs97bn had been procured.
He also claimed that no competitive bidding process, which is required under PPRA regulations, was undertaken at the time.
While senators questioned why no action was taken earlier, the presiding officer, Senator Irfan Siddiqui, referred the matter to a Senate standing committee for consideration.
Later, In a post on X, Mr Ismail challenged his former PML-N colleague, Dr Chaudhry, to bring present evidence for his claims and proceed against him in NAB or FIA.
“Ismail Industries has been supplying the World Food Program (WFP) for over twenty years. The BISP programme was started before I became a minister and continued after I left and continues to this day,” said Mr Ismail.
“Every packet that WFP buys from us is according to an international tender under UN protocols and guidelines and we supply to WFP at the same rate globally. Besides Pakistan we supply to many other countries.,” the former finance minister wrote.

The deputy prime minister arrived in Washington, DC, on Thursday night, on the second leg of his eight-day visit to the US. He had arrived in New York on Monday to attend “high-level signature events” of Pakistan’s United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency, including a conference on Palestine.
A statement issued by the FO today said that Dar held his first meeting with Rubio. The two have previously talked over the telephone.
The FO said Rubio acknowledged Pakistan’s “everlasting sacrifices in the war on terror”.
“Pakistan has always played a positive role in global and regional peace,” the FO quoted the US secretary of state as saying.
The FO said that detailed discussions were held on bilateral relations and potential cooperation in various sectors.
“Discussions were held on promoting bilateral trade and economic relations, cooperation in important sectors, including investment, agriculture, technology [and] minerals. Counter-terrorism and regional peace were also discussed.”
 
 

FM Dar paid tribute to the efforts of President Donald Trump and the US leadership in promoting global peace, adding that their role and efforts regarding the recent Pakistan-India tension were “commendable”.
“Pakistan and the US seek further expansion and stability in bilateral relations,” he said.
The FO said FM Dar was optimistic about the positive progress in the ongoing trade dialogue between the two countries.
“Pakistan is an attractive destination for the American business community and investors. The two countries have a common approach and interests regarding regional peace. The Pakistani community in the US is playing a bridge role between the two countries,” the FO quoted him as saying.
Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to promoting bilateral relations and working together in various fields.
 






Dar said the two had a “comprehensive discussion on the full spectrum of bilateral relations”.
He added that both reaffirmed their commitment to the long-term bilateral partnership, with renewed focus on economic, trade, investment, information technology, artificial intelligence and counter-terrorism cooperation.
We also exchanged views on key regional and global developments. I appreciated the U.S. constructive role in facilitating the recent Pakistan-India ceasefire.
“We reaffirmed the importance of close coordination at multilateral fora, including at the UN Security Council. With continued dialogue and mutual respect, I am confident we can build a more stable, prosperous, and mutually beneficial future for both our nations.”
 






Meanwhile, the US State Department said Rubio expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran and its commitment to preserving regional stability.
“The two also discussed prospects for deepening bilateral counterterrorism cooperation, including countering ISIS-K, and the upcoming US-Pakistan Counterterrorism Dialogue in Islamabad this August.
“The secretary underscored the importance of expanding mutually beneficial bilateral trade and exploring prospects for enhancing collaboration in the critical minerals and mining sectors.”
Dar is also scheduled to speak at the US think tank, The Atlantic Council, “sharing Pakistan’s perspective on regional and global issues as well as the future of Pak-US relations.”
 






Upon arrival in the US capital, FM Dar was received by Ambassador of Pakistan to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and senior embassy officials.
Dar’s visit comes as Pakistan holds the presidency of the UNSC this month. Pakistan assumed the UNSC presidency for July, marking its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.
Addressing a reception hosted by Pakistan’s Mission in New York on Wednesday, Dar called for an inclusive dialogue and cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing turbulence across the world.
The deputy PM asserted that Pakistan’s leadership has been guided by “these very principles in both deliberations and concrete actions taken during its tenure”.
The UNSC unanimously adopted Pakistan-sponsored Resolution 2788, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.
Dar also announced Pakistan was seeking a seat at the UN Human Rights Council for the 2026-2028 term, with the Asia-Pacific Group endorsing its candidacy.

“The chair appreciated the initiative, noting that it was long overdue and would play a vital role in facilitating access to financing for green projects in the country,” a statement issued by the Finance Division read.
During a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change and Environmental Coordination in March, State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmad said the taxonomy will allow financial and non-financial companies to share a common definition of economic activities that can be considered environmentally sustainable.
The statement issued today noted that the ECC meeting was held under the chairmanship of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to deliberate on a range of important agenda items concerning industrial growth, environmental policy, skill development, housing finance, and telecommunications.
The meeting was attended by Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari, Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik, Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, along with senior officials from relevant ministries, divisions, departments, and authorities.
It added that the ECC reviewed and endorsed a report presented by the Ministry of Commerce on industrial competitiveness and export-led growth of the steel sector, in alignment with the National Tariff Policy 2025–30, aimed at reducing production costs and enhancing export competitiveness.
The committee also approved a summary by the Ministry of Commerce for filing an appeal in the Supreme Court against the decision of the Lahore High Court regarding the grant of gas and Regasified Liquefied Natural Gas tariff concessions to Ghani Glass Limited. The Committee found the appeal untenable in light of the fact that concessionary energy tariffs for five export-oriented sectors have already been withdrawn and are no longer available to any sector.
To support skills development through outcomes-based financing, the ECC approved a government guarantee of Rs1 billion for the issuance of the Pakistan Skill Impact Bond (PSIB), as moved by the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training.
In the housing sector, the ECC approved a markup subsidy and risk-sharing scheme for affordable housing finance, with the objective of expanding access to low-cost housing.
The committee also urged the ministry to develop a comprehensive, integrated database of the housing sector in coordination with relevant federal and provincial stakeholders, in order to ensure better targeting and effective implementation of the scheme.
The ECC was briefed by the Ministry of Industries and Production on the status of availability and pricing trends in the vegetable ghee and oil market. While noting the ministry’s assurance regarding adequate national stock levels, the committee expressed concern over the limited pass-through of declining international prices to domestic consumers.
It advised vigilant monitoring to prevent price distortions and potential cartelisation and emphasised the need for active coordination with the Competition Commission of Pakistan, National Price Monitoring Committee (NPMC), and provincial governments through the Ministry of Industries and Production.
The ECC also approved a proposal by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication for the revision of charges for Radio-Based Services (RBS). The committee directed the ministry to ensure periodic revision of RBS charges every three to five years, aligned with ongoing economic changes and technological advancements in the sector.
Furthermore, the committee endorsed a revised composition of the advisory committee overseeing the release of IMT spectrum, which is critical for improving next-generation mobile broadband services in Pakistan.
In conclusion, the ECC approved the formal declaration of ship breaking and recycling as a recognised industry, as recommended by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.
Last month, the government increased the price of gas by 50 per cent in an apparent move to meet the demand of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The ECC of the federal cabinet approved the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1.
The committee instructed the ministry to coordinate with the Power Division and share relevant data on power consumption patterns in the sector, to enable an accurate assessment of the implications of applying industrial power tariffs in place of the existing commercial rates.</p><small>2025-07-25 17:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2518521920172e3.png?r=190335' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926543/amid-epstein-furore-ghislaine-maxwell-seeks-relief-from-us-supreme-court' target='_blank'><strong>Amid Epstein furore, Ghislaine Maxwell seeks relief from US Supreme Court</strong></a><br><p>Even as an uproar over files relating to Jeffrey Epstein engulfs United States President Donald Trump and Congress, the US Supreme Court is due to wade into the controversy and decide whether to hear a bid by an associate of the late financier and convicted sex offender to overturn her criminal conviction.
The justices, now on their summer recess, are expected in late September to consider whether to take up an appeal by British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence after being found guilty in 2021 by a jury in New York of helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls.
Maxwell’s lawyers have told the Supreme Court that her conviction was invalid because a non-prosecution and plea agreement that federal prosecutors had made with Epstein in Florida in 2007 also shielded his associates and should have barred her criminal prosecution in New York. Her lawyers have a Monday deadline for filing their final written brief in their appeal to the court.
Some legal experts see merit in Maxwell’s claim, noting that it touches on an unsettled matter of US law that has divided some of the nation’s regional federal appeals courts, known as circuit courts.
Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice, said there is a chance that the Supreme Court takes up the case and noted the disagreement among appeals courts. Such a split among circuit courts can be a factor when the nation’s top judicial body considers whether or not to hear a case.
“The question of whether a plea agreement from one US Attorney’s Office binds other federal prosecution as a whole is a serious issue that has split the circuits,” Epner said.
While uncommon, “there have been several cases presenting the issue over the years”, he added.
Trump’s Justice Department appeared to acknowledge the circuit split in a brief filed to the justices this month, but urged them to reject the appeal.
Any disparity among lower court rulings “is of limited importance”, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the brief, “because the scope of a plea or similar agreement is under the control of the parties to the agreement”.
If the Supreme Court opts to grant Maxwell’s appeal, it would hear arguments during its new term that begins in October, with a ruling then expected by the end of next June.
Mounting pressure
Trump and his administration have been facing mounting pressure from his supporters to release additional information about the Justice Department’s investigation into Epstein, who hanged himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell, an autopsy concluded, while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges.
Deputy US Attorney General Todd Blanche, a former personal lawyer to Trump, met with Maxwell in Florida on Thursday in what her lawyer called “a very productive day”.
The administration reversed course this month on its pledge to release more documents about Epstein, prompting fury among some of Trump’s most loyal followers. The Epstein case has long been the subject of conspiracy theories, considering his rich and powerful friends and the circumstances of his death.
The Supreme Court’s 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump during his first term in office.
Whether the court would want to take on such a case that represents a political landmine is an open question. The justices hear relatively few cases — about 70 out of more than 4,000 appeals filed at the court each year — and have broad discretion to choose which ones will be on their docket. At least four of the justices must agree in order for the court to take up a case.
Epstein’s deal
Maxwell’s appeal focuses on a deal Epstein struck in 2007 to avoid federal prosecution in part by pleading guilty to state criminal offences in Florida of soliciting prostitution and soliciting minors to engage in prostitution. Epstein then served 13 months in a minimum-security state facility.
In 2019, during Trump’s first term as president, the US Justice Department charged Epstein in Manhattan with sex trafficking of minors. Epstein pleaded not guilty, but committed suicide before the trial at age 66.
Maxwell was arrested in 2020 and convicted the following year after being accused by federal prosecutors of recruiting and grooming girls to have sexual encounters with Epstein between 1994 and 2004.
Maxwell failed to convince a trial judge and the New York-based 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out her conviction based on the 2007 non-prosecution agreement, which stated that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”.
In the appeal to the Supreme Court, Maxwell’s lawyer David Markus said that in its reference to co-conspirators, the Epstein agreement had no geographic limit on where the non-prosecution agreement could be enforced.
“If the government can promise one thing and deliver another — and courts let it happen — that erodes the integrity of the justice system,” Markus told Reuters.
“This isn’t just about Ghislaine Maxwell. It’s about whether the government is held to its word,” Markus said.
The National Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers has urged the Supreme Court to hear Maxwell’s appeal, given the prevalence of plea agreements in the US criminal justice system and to ensure that the government keeps its promises.
The group represents thousands of private lawyers, public defenders, law professors and judges nationwide. It said in a filing to the justices that the lack of a geographic limitation means “no part of the Department of Justice may institute criminal charges against any co-conspirator in any district”.
Columbia Law School professor Daniel Richman, an expert in criminal law, said it was unusual for the US attorney in Florida to include protection for co-conspirators in the agreement to not prosecute Epstein.
That peculiarity might be reason enough for the Supreme Court to avoid the matter, Richman said, as it renders the case a poor vehicle for resolving whether pleas in one court district bind actions in all other court districts.
“There were many strange things about this deal,” Richman said, which will cut against the Supreme Court’s interest in taking up Maxwell’s appeal.
Richman said he hoped the political fallout would not play into the Supreme Court’s decision on whether to hear Maxwell’s appeal. If it does, Richman said, taking up the case could allow Maxwell to avoid cooperating with the government and dodge responsibility.
“A decision that would allow Maxwell to protect herself probably would not be something they would be interested in,” Richman said of the Supreme Court justices.</p><small>2025-07-25 17:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/25163630c7e468b.jpg?r=165829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926531/iran-and-europeans-hold-frank-nuclear-talks-with-un-sanctions-looming' target='_blank'><strong>Iran and Europeans hold ‘frank’ nuclear talks with UN sanctions looming</strong></a><br><p>Iran said it would continue nuclear talks with European powers after “serious, frank, and detailed” conversations on Friday, the first such face-to-face meeting since Israel and the United States bombed Iran last month.
Before the meeting in Istanbul, Iran also pushed back on suggestions of extending the United Nations resolution that ratifies a 2015 deal, nearing expiry, that was designed to curb its nuclear programme.
Delegations from the European Union and so-called E3 group of France, Britain and Germany met Iranian counterparts for about four hours at Iran’s consulate for talks that the UN nuclear watchdog said could provide an opening to resume inspections in Iran.
Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi said afterwards that both sides had presented specific ideas on sanctions relief and the nuclear issue.
“While seriously criticising their stances regarding the recent war of aggression against our people, we explained our principled positions, including on the so-called snapback mechanism,” he said.
“It was agreed that consultations on this matter will continue.”
The European countries, along with China and Russia, are the remaining parties to the 2015 deal — from which the US withdrew in 2018 — which lifted sanctions on Iran in return for restrictions on its nuclear programme.
A deadline of October 18 is fast approaching when the resolution governing that deal expires.
At that point, all UN sanctions on Iran will be lifted unless the “snapback” mechanism is triggered at least 30 days before. This would automatically reimpose those sanctions, which target sectors from hydrocarbons to banking and defence.
To give time for this to happen, the E3 have set a deadline of the end of August to revive diplomacy. Diplomats say they want Iran to take concrete steps to convince them to extend the deadline by up to six months.
Europeans want nuclear commitments from Iran
Iran would need to make commitments on key issues, including eventual talks with Washington, full cooperation with the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and accounting for 400 kilogrammes of near-weapons-grade highly enriched uranium, whose whereabouts are unknown since last month’s strikes.
Before the talks, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson had said Tehran considered talk of extending UN Security Council Resolution 2231 to be “meaningless and baseless”.
IAEA head Rafael Grossi said he was optimistic that nuclear inspection visits might be able to restart this year and that it was important to discuss the technical details now.
“We need to agree on where to go, how to do it. We need to listen to Iran in terms of what they consider should be the precautions to be taken,” he told reporters in Singapore.
The United States held five rounds of talks with Iran prior to its airstrikes in June, which US President Donald Trump said had “obliterated” a programme that Washington and its ally Israel say is aimed at acquiring a nuclear bomb.
However, NBC News has cited current and former US officials as saying a subsequent US assessment found that while the strikes destroyed most of one of three targeted nuclear sites, the other two were not as badly damaged.
Iran denies seeking a nuclear weapon and says its nuclear programme is meant solely for civilian purposes.</p><small>2025-07-25 16:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615763-fm-ishaq-dar-meets-us-top-diplomat-rubio-in-washington' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with FM Dar, US top diplomat praises Pakistan's sacrifices in war on terror</strong></a><br><p>

The PCB also said that Pakistan will play three T20 Internationals against the West Indies, scheduled on July 31, Aug 2 and 3, at the Central Broward Park and Broward County Stadium in USA’s Lauderhill.
“Salman Ali Agha will captain the T20I side, while fast bowlers Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali and Shaheen Shah Afridi return to the squad in this format,” the statement read.
It added that Pakistan will arrive in the USA on July 27 following the conclusion of the three-match T20I series in Bangladesh.

On Wednesday, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Registrar Office put on hold the processing of the contempt of court notices issued to PM Shehbaz and his cabinet members as the dealing staff decided to ascertain its validity first.
IHC Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq on July 21 had issued a contempt of court notice to the entire federal government, including the prime minister and all ministers, for refusing to file an amicus brief to support Dr Aafia’s case in the US.
“The government is in no way negligent regarding the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui,” the prime minister was quoted as having said by APP in a meeting today with Dr Fouzia.
On the instructions of PM Shehbaz, the government has previously provided diplomatic and legal assistance in the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui, a statement issued by the PM Office said.
“Furthermore, the prime minister not only wrote a letter to then-US president Joe Biden regarding this issue but also formed a committee headed by Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar to ensure further progress in the matter,” the statement added.
“The committee will remain in contact with Dr Fouzia and work to provide the necessary support in this regard.”
 






Dr Aafia, a neuroscientist and educator, was convicted by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan and has been serving her sentence at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Carswell in the US since 2010.
On July 12, the IHC expr­essed dissatisfaction over the federal government’s failure to submit a report in the case concerning Dr Aafia’s release, health and repatriation, with Justice Ishaq threatening to “summon the entire cabinet” if the report was not presented.
In February, the IHC was told that the proposal to exchange Shakil Afridi for Dr Aafia was unfeasible.
The law officer representing the federal government informed the court that Dr Aafia’s American lawyer Clive Smith had suggested the swap, but Pakistan and the US did not have any agreement for such an exchange.
Last year in October, PM Shehbaz had requested that Biden pardon and release Dr Aafia from jail.
In a letter dated October 13, which has been seen by Dawn.com, the prime minister expressed his concerns about Dr Aafia’s “fragile mental and frail physical health” while in prison. “Now 52 years old, she has served 16 years behind bars in the US.
“Numerous Pakistani officials have paid consular visits to Dr Siddiqui … all of them have raised their serious concerns about the treatment she has received,” the letter read. “In fact, they fear she may take her own life.”
Consequently, the US State Department declined to comment on the letter written by PM Shehbaz to the Biden administration.
When a journalist inquired about the letter, spokesperson Vedant Patel had stated: “Certainly, we would not get into private diplomatic communications,” seemingly confirming receipt of the correspondence.</p><small>2025-07-25 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615733-tiktoker-sumeera-rajput-found-dead-at-home-in-ghotki' target='_blank'><strong>TikToker Sumeera Rajput found dead at home in Ghotki</strong></a><br><p>
