“This action has been taken in light of the prevailing regional situation to safeguard national security and protect Pak­istan’s digital ecosystem,” the Pakistan Telecommuni­ca­tion Authority said, adding that the content it blocked was spre­ading misleading and harmful narratives aimed at manipulating public perception and undermining national unity.
On the other hand, IT minister Shaza Fatima said that the government foiled several cyberattacks, which she blamed on India, while an advisory by a cybersecurity body asked citizens to remain vigilant against possible cyberattacks in light of tensions with India.
Amid all this, the social media platform X, which was blocked in Feb last year, came back to life without any official word from the government, according to NetBlocks, a UK-based global internet monitor. NetBlocks said the platform was restricted by authorities in February 2024 after it was used to draw attention to instances of alleged election fraud.

Social media platform X (formerly Twitter) makes a comeback; CERT urges internet users to remain vigilant

According to IT Minister Shaza Fatima, all relevant institutions, including the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and technical wings of the IT ministry, were active and had successfully thwarted recent Indian cyberattacks. She added that not a single cyberattack from India had been allowed to succeed, and Pakistan remained vigilant to prevent any such attempts in the future.
‘Be vigilant’
In its statement, the Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT) asked the public to be wary of potential cyberattacks and keep monitoring the trusted cybersecurity entities for advisories and threat alerts. “We are doing our best to counter the situation and protect our systems,” CERT said, asking the citizens to avoid clicking suspicious links, unverified messages, emails, or social media links, and use trusted sources for updates.

• Discusses security situation with Chinese, Turkish and Italian reps
ISLAMABAD: Amid escalating tensions, the Indian chargé d’affaires was summoned to the foreign ministry on Wednesday to receive a strong protest over the unprovoked Indian strikes at multiple locations across Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. These strikes resulted in the deaths and injuries of several civilians, including women and children.
According to a statement issued by the Foreign Office, Pakistan conveyed to the envoy that India’s blatant act of aggression constitutes a clear violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty. The statement emphasised that such actions contravene the UN Charter, international law, and established norms governing inter-state relations.
Pakistan firmly rejected India’s baseless justifications for its hostile actions. The Indian side was warned that such reckless behaviour poses a serious threat to regional peace and stability, the statement added.
Meanwhile, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar briefed the Isla­­­mabad-based ambassadors on the Indian strikes in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir.
According to the FO, Mr Dar st­­ro­­ngly condemned the Indian ag­­gression that not only violated Pakistan’s sovereignty but also jeo­­pardised regional peace and stability. He also discussed the regional security situation following the Indian strikes with the ambassadors and ministers of China, Turkiye and Italy.
Ambassador of China to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong called on FM Ishaq Dar and discussed the current situation following India’s aggression against Pakistan.

• 13 people, including two girls, martyred in Subhan mosque strike
• Funeral of Bahawalpur victims held at Dring Stadium
LAHORE: Tensions between India and Pakistan have intensified after a series of Indian air and drone strikes resulted in the deaths of at least 31 Pakistani civilians, with many others injured, including 16 martyred only in Muridke and Bahawalpur.
As many as three civilians were kil­led when four Indian missiles struck Jamia Masjid Ummul Qura and an ad­­joining house in Muridke, some 40 kilometres from Lahore. The decea­sed were identified as Abdul Malik (from Jhang), Mohammad Alam (Samundri), and Midasar (Chunian).
Two others were injured and shif­ted to local hospitals. Sources said that the area had reportedly been evacuated earlier due to warnings of a possible strike, which helped reduce further casualties. The mosque was des­troyed and local authorities later arr­a­­­nged visits for both international and domestic media to inspect the site.
Bahawalpur
In Bahawalpur, officials confirmed that 13 civilians, including four men, seven women and two three-year-old girls, were killed in the missile strike on Subhan Mosque, located in the Chowk Azam area on the outskirts of Bahawalpur between the night of May 6 and 7.
The military’s media wing ISPR has yet to release an official list of the deceased. Most of the victims belonged to the same family, but they have yet to be officially identified.
When Dawn contacted the related government officials for the lists of the martyrs and injured, it was informed that the ISPR was finalising it before releasing it to the media.
 
 

High-level visits were conducted by Corps Commander Bahawalpur Lt Gen Aqeel, Divisional Commissioner Musarrat Jabeen and Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique, who met with the injured at Bahawal Victoria Hospital on directives from the Punjab chief minister.
The targeted mosque and madressah complex are located in Azam Chowk, not in Ahmedpur East as previously speculated.
The madressah premises also include residences, where most of the deceased lived and were targeted by the Indian missiles.
Dawn learnt that the private seminary during the last week had been evacuated by the local administration, apprehending any Indian assault on it. However, the residents of the seminary’s residential quarters and students were allowed to return just a day before the attack.
Witnesses reported hearing four po­­werful explosions that shook windows as far as Satellite Town and Ba­­ghdadul Jadeed Railway Station. Des­pite the panic, many residents rushed towards the blast site, chanting slogans in support of the armed forces.
Meanwhile, life went on as usual in Bahawalpur, with commercial activities in the grain, vegetable markets and local bazaars continuing on Wednesday along with the normal flow of traffic on roads.
However, public and private schools, colleges, and universities remained closed under the government’s orders.
The funeral prayers for victims were offered at Bahawalpur’s Dring Sta-dium under tight security measures.
Narowal
In Narowal’s Shakargarh sector, Indian forces launched drone and mortar shell attacks on civilian areas late Tuesday night. A government dispensary sustained partial damage, while mortar shells and drone munitions fell in surrounding fields but failed to detonate. The Pakistan Army also launched a counterattack on Indian forces. The Indian army also fired ammunition in the Harra and Sial villages.
A drone was later recovered from a tree and defused by the bomb disposal squad after being alerted by citi­­zens. Narowal Deputy Com­mis­sioner Syed Hassan Raza declared an emergency at all hospitals across the district, including BHUs, RHCs and DHQ Hospital. Doctors and paramedical staff were placed on 24-hour alert and full stocks of medicines and medical supplies were ensured.

India emerged as a unified nation-state in 1947, the People’s Republic of China two years later. Both boast a heritage that is more than 5,000 years old. Yet each has spent the past seven decades struggling to resolve unfinished business left by divisive powers — Great Britain and America. In India’s case, this included the disputed former kingdom of Jammu & Kashmir. In China’s case, it was the renegade island of Taiwan.
Today, China and India are determined to straddle the 21st century. They have hegemonic ambitions. India aspires to dominate its subcontinent; China, the rest of the world.
China is a post-1972 enemy of US’s making, just as Russia (once an ally against Germany) is a product of Europe’s post-1945 paranoia. Meanwhile, hostility in the subcontinent, has brought Pakistan and India yet again to the edge of an abyss.
Tensions following the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22 are simmering. It is a sign of the BJP government’s insecurity that it should have reacted so quickly and so pointedly after that incident. It accused Pakistan (without naming it) of masterminding the attack. It unleashed punitive measures such as an unwarranted suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, banning overflights, sealing borders, expelling Pakistani nationals, freezing trade, and appealing to the IMF and ADB to stop aid to Pakistan.

Even Dr Goebbels would have admired the jingoism of Indian media anchors.

It released a barrage of transparent propaganda aimed at winning the sympathy of the international community. Even Dr Goebbels would have admired the jingoism of Indian media anchors, chained all too obviously to the mothership of the Ministry of External Affairs.
Their aim is to convince their compatriots that India has won the phoney war. Realists know that both countries will have to revert (hopefully sooner rather than later) to a state of phoney peace — the period of uneasy relations that followed the Tashkent Agreement of 1966, the Shimla summit in 1972, and the Lahore Declaration of 1999.
Analysts meanwhile are busy calculating who has gained what, and who lost how much from this latest India-Pakistan confrontation?
Had this country carried out an attack at Pahalgam, it would have had everything to lose: the sympathy of the beleaguered Kashmiris, damage to its precarious solvency, its credibility with the IMF, agricultural dehydration, diplomatic isolation, and political schism within. And unlike 1999, there would have been no Bill Clinton in the White House to rescue it from a Kargil-type incursion.
India on its side has gained less than it had planned. It has dented the front-fender in its drive to obtain a seat in the Security Council. It enjoys less credibility in international circles than it assumed. It does not have the United Nations in its back pocket. Its blunderbuss diplomacy has backfired. It will have to admit that water is not an India-owned natural resource, and that impetuous repudiation of international agreements is bad policy.
Indian governments have yet to learn that anti-Pakistan patriotism is an obsolete, outworn tool with which to start a fire.
I had written this much when news came that very early on May 7, India had unilaterally attacked five targets in Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Pakistan, including Muridke, which is 55 kilometres from where I live. I drove around my neighbourhood. Everything appeared calm as the city woke up to another cloudless morning.
Since then, throughout the day, reports of attacks and counterattacks have inundated news channels. The phoney war has turned serious and in ea-rnest. Not quite the conventional war yet with sir­ens and air-raid shelters and a run on the banks, but an aerial-cum-cy­ber war with strategic objectives like airports, com­-mand centres, possibly even dams. The Indians have made the first strike. Any escalation will be at a time and place of Pakistan’s choosing.
I recall after the 1965 war M.M. Ahmad (then adviser to president Ayub Khan) talking to the Americans who feared an escalation, involving other allied countries. He told the US ambassador that for Pakistan it was already a world war.
Since those who start wars never ask for a public mandate before declaring hostilities, they should listen to voices outside their own minds. They should heed the ad­­v­­­ice of persons who fought wars against wars. “War does not determine who is right,” the philosopher and pacifist Bertrand Russell warned, “only who is left.” And the British prime minister Stanley Baldwin’s chilling advice to the living: “War would end — if the dead could return.” All sides should keep his warning in mind as they contemplate their next move.

The drivers of conflict have multiplied, the limits tested by these episodic stand-offs have been stretched, and the points of contact between their militaries during the kinetic manoeuvres in each of these stand-offs has multiplied.
From the first such stand-off, perhaps in 1990, till today, there is an unmistakable trajectory of escalation. What is driving this?
One of the big drivers is India’s attempt to end its difficulties in occupied Kashmir using a violent development model that has lain behind the rise of Narendra Modi. The model was born in the early 2000s that saw two pivotal developments in both India and Pakistan. Up until 9/11, Pakistan was being pushed increasingly towards global isolation and its economy was depleted to near breaking point. The country had undergone three rounds of debt rescheduling and just finished a gruelling, short-term Stand-by Arrangement with the IMF that left the populace battered with unemployment and sharply rising energy costs. There was no further growth path for Pakistan in those years other than deeper structural reform, which was proving too heavy a burden even for a dictator with near absolute power.
However, 9/11 changed all that overnight. Instantly, Pakistan went from being an international pariah to a front-line state in a superpower’s war, and was eventually crowned with the status of ‘major non Nato ally’. The volume of money that poured into the country, coupled with the generous terms of debt rescheduling extended by the Paris Club in December 2001, impacting a total debt stock of $12.5 billion, allowed the regime of Gen Musharraf to pump growth to unprecedented levels, creating a bubble economy that made more fortunes for more people than any similar period in the country’s history.

Modi’s model of development rested on the ability to efficiently dispossess people and take land required for large-scale projects.

This sudden reversal of fortunes in Pakistan came as a rude shock to our neighbours in India. Over the course of the 1990s, India and Pakistan were locked in a stand-off over Kashmir, which left India increasingly embattled by the uprising in the occupied territory and Pakistan in the grip of sanctions and isolation. India accused Pakistan of sponsoring the uprising in occupied Kashmir, and of providing training and cover to militants in the troubled valley. At one point, Pakistan came close to being placed on the State Department’s list of sponsors of terrorism, a designation that would have had far-reaching implications for the country had it come to pass.
By 2001, India’s policy of imposing a crushing isolation on Pakistan was finally bearing fruit when 9/11 came along and reversed it all. This was a big shock to the Indian foreign policy establishment, which had shouldered a tremendous cost in men and materiel for repression of the uprising in occupied Kashmir, under the hopes that pressure on Pakistan would eventually cause the uprising to die down. All those hopes were dashed once Pakistan became a superpower favourite again.
The Congress party had seen its fortunes sag throughout the 1990s, losing power to the BJP by the end of the decade. But in 2004, it scored a surprising victory at the polls and renewed its electoral strength again in 2009 by increasing its seats in the Lok Sabha from 153 to 206.
Yet trouble brewed behind this double movement in the early 2000s, which had seen the return to power of the Congress party in India and a reversal of Pakistan’s fortunes. This was when Modi made his appearance on the big stage of Indian politics with the Gujarat riots in 2002, cynically using communal hate and violence as a tool to grab power. Once in power, Modi unrolled a model of violent development, which fused rent-seeking alliances with billionaires at the federal level, with high levels of public expenditure on infrastructure projects to promote ports, power plants, luxury urban housing developments and more. This model of development rested on the ability to efficiently dispossess people and take land required for large-scale projects, high levels of government spending and a close, symbiotic relationship between wealthy elites, the party apparatus and the government machinery of India.
Fortunes changed following the Great Financial Crisis in 2008. The Congress party was at a loss for ideas on how to restart growth in India, and Musharraf’s growth bubble burst comprehensively while Pakistan’s troubles with the US mounted. As Pakistan sank once more into its pre-9/11 state of isolation coupled with a depleted economy, the Congress party hurtled towards its most stunning electoral defeat ever in 2014. That was Modi’s year, when he also brought this model of violent development as his party’s vision for achieving a final resolution of New Delhi’s long-running Kashmir problem.
Two ideas were central to this vision, and both have a pedigree in India’s policy conversation going back at least to the early 2000s. One was to revoke Kashmir’s special status granted under Article 370 of the Indian constitution. The second was to cast off the constraints of the Indus Waters Treaty. With both these done, the government would be in a better position to use public funds to initiate large-scale infrastructure projects through which to select winners and losers within Kashmir. The idea was to reward those who would play ball with the government, and crush those who wouldn’t.
These are the broad developments that imparted such inexorable momentum to the episodic return of stand-offs between India and Pakistan. Modi’s India wants to make Kashmir its own, regardless of the wishes of Kashmir’s inhabitants. Pakistan is determined to thwart this ambition, regardless of the cost it has to pay along the way. Neither side can win in this situation. Yet none can afford to lose either.

India’s provocative attack targeting several locations in Azad Kashmir and Punjab early on Wednesday comes after two weeks of sabre-rattling by warmongering officials and media personnel in that country following the tragic Pahalgam episode.
It appears that the danger has not passed, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told the nation last evening that India would “suffer the consequences” of its ill-advised moves. Earlier, there was a welcome show of political unity in the National Assembly, while the day began with a meeting of the National Security Committee, which dubbed New Delhi’s perilous actions as “acts of war”.
The deadly aggression against Pakistan has put both neighbours on the path to more conflict, unless a negotiated end to this dispute — and to the core issue of Kashmir — is found. Pakistan has responded to the blatant violation of its sovereignty resolutely, with the state saying that five Indian warplanes were downed during the hostilities. It is hoped that the message been understood in New Delhi, and that the latter’s shenanigans will not be repeated.
Aside from sites in Azad Kashmir, locations in Punjab were also hit. At least 31 people in Pakistan were killed in India’s so-called Operation Sindoor, according to the DG ISPR. This reckless act on India’s part could have resulted in more casualties had the intruders not been confronted in time. The Indian military’s claim that the attacks were “non-escalatory in nature” defies belief. Violating a country’s frontiers, hitting its cities and towns and murdering its people is not just escalatory; these are very much acts of war. Moreover, if the Indian state says only the ‘terror infrastructure’ was targeted, then how would New Delhi explain the fact that civilian neighbourhoods, as well as the Neelum-Jhelum hydropower project, were attacked? The fact is that the Indian state took this ill-conceived action to cover up for its massive security lapse in Pahalgam. What happened in the held Kashmir tourist spot was indeed deplorable, and the guilty should be brought to justice. Yet the BJP government has used the tragedy to create war hysteria against Pakistan, without any proof of this country’s involvement in that attack.
If India has solid evidence against Pakistan, why has it failed to make it public? Using Pahalgam as a casus belli against Pakistan seems to be a manoeuvre by the Modi regime to boost its standing domestically, and throw its weight around in the neighbourhood. This foolish gambit has failed and has brought the nuclear-armed neighbours to the brink of war.
Following the Indian attack, there has been a crescendo of global voices calling for restraint and de-escalation, with several states offering their good offices to mediate. Pakistan has shown itself ready to accept such offers, but will India respond positively to prevent the slide towards all-out war? The events of the past few weeks have once again demonstrated that the Kashmir dispute remains a global flashpoint. While India may believe its own fiction that the Kashmir dispute has been ‘resolved’, Pakistan, the Kashmiris as well as the world community continue to acknowledge the fact that the region remains disputed. Pakistan and India have fought several wars over Kashmir, and are on the precipice of a fresh conflict due to it.
Therefore, in order to establish long-term peace in South Asia, both states need to talk to each other, frankly and meaningfully. This may be a bitter pill to swallow for the Hindu revivalist BJP regime, which has never stopped dreaming of ‘Akhand Bharat’. But it would be to its own detriment if it does not shed its ideological fantasies and come to the table with Pakistan and the Kashmiris to achieve a solution acceptable to all. The alternative is perpetual hostility. In the immediate future, the global community must step up efforts to de-escalate, and media and civil society on both sides should stop fanning the flames of war.

• Lawmakers laud forces on successful defence of the realm
ISLAMABAD: Lawmakers in the National Assembly on Wednesday stro­ngly condemned the brutal aggression demonstrated by India resulting in loss of civilian lives in Pakistan.
In an impassioned speech on the floor of the lower house of parliament, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said: “Only thieves and cowards attack at night. If they had even an ounce of courage, they would have announced their attack during the day.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said that India has become barbaric and blind due to its arrogance, but the valiant people of Pakistan will make them see. “We do not condone war and never have, but India should brace itself because Pakistan is yet to respond, and it will not do so during the night, or on the basis of lies, but as per international laws and UN Charter.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in his address in the National Assembly, called for a complete unity and offered to meet political leaders, including those from the opposition PTI.
He said the great victory of Pakistan and frustration of the evil designs of the enemy was made possible by unity, concord and consultations.
Inviting all political forces to join hands to seize the opportunity of making Pakistan a great nation, he said he was ready to meet them in the speaker’s chamber. “We should peek into the past to learn a lesson from it, and not to sling mud at each other,” he remarked.
The prime minister said Pakistan delivered a befitting response to India, shattering the myth that the hostile neighbour has left Islamabad far behind in conventional warfare. He emphasised that Pakistan is fully capable of defending its geographical boundaries, whether in conventional or nuclear warfare. He reaffirmed the competence of the country’s armed forces in defending the motherland.
“We should pass a resolution to pay tributes to General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, General Syed Asim Munir, Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar for doubling nation’s honour,” he remarked.
Expressing his views on the floor of the house, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan welcomed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s offer of talks with the opposition.
“It is a moment when politics takes a back seat to patriotism. This country belongs to all of us. Today, politics has been silenced, but on both sides of the aisle, the whole nation is united for Pakistan’s defence,” said Gohar.
He warned India against any repeat of the mistake it had committed.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, expressing his views in parliament, said clear instructions were given to the forces to engage only those aircraft that drop payloads inside Pakistani territory. “Otherwise, we could have brought down 10 to 12,” he said. “India’s reckless attack has jeopardised regional peace,” he noted.
He said that Pakistan reserves the right to respond under Article 51 of the UN Charter.
JUI-F’s Ghafoor Haideri and MQM-P’s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui also hailed the befitting response to Indian aggression while expressing their views in the house.

According to PAA, some airspace, particularly sections over Lahore, will  rem­ain closed for another 24 hours due to “operational reasons,” a  revised notice to airmen (NOTAM) said.
The NOTAM specified that  certain airspace sections over Lahore would be temporarily  unavailable at all altitudes from 10:50am on May 7, until 12:20pm on May  9, while flights taking off from or landing at Islamabad International Airport  were directed to contact Air Traffic Control (ATC) for clearance.
The PAA  said in a statement that it has formally conveyed its concerns to the  International Civil Avi­ation Orga­n­isation (ICAO) “rega­rding the seri­ous  risks posed to civil aviation safety by India’s rec­kless and provocative  actions.” This followed an earlier complete closure of Pakistan’s  airspace for 48 hours after a military confrontation with India on  Tuesday night.
While the PAA issued a revised  NOTAM later on Wednesday, stating that airs­pace in Islamabad, Rawa­­l­pindi, and Karachi was fully  restored, it reiterated the Lahore restrictions.
A CAA spokesman told Dawn that  “only a few routes between Lahore and Islamabad will remain closed, but  other routes between the two cities would remain functional.”
The  PAA also stated that all airports across Pakistan “will remain fully  operational,” adding the country’s airspace “continues to be open and  secure for civil aviation activities.”
Indian airports closed
The airports in India’s north will remain closed till 5:29am on May 10, as per the NOTAM issued to airlines, accessed by The Hindu. The airports span Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir as well as Leh, and States of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. This resulted in a large number of flight cancellations by Indian airlines operating domestic routes.
These include airports at Jammu and Srinagar in J&K and Leh; Amritsar, Chandigarh, Patiala, Halwara airports in Punjab; Shimla and Dharamshala in Him­achal Pradesh; Jodhpur, Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Kishangarh in Rajasthan; and Bhuj, Jamn­agar, Rajkot, Mundra, Porbandar, Kandla, Keshod, and Bhuj in Gujarat, as per a NOTAM issued by the Airports Authority of India.
Additional airports impacted were Gwalior and Hindon, according to information posted by airlines on X. Many of these airports are used jointly by airlines and the Indian Air Force.
International flights were among those affected by the escalated military tensions between India and Pakistan, including those of US carriers, as they couldn’t use Pakistan’s airspace to enter into India.

In barely a day, New Delhi’s pre-dawn strikes on six sites in Pakistan and Islamabad’s thunderous shoot down of five Indian fighters have drawn both nuclear-armed neighbors into a high wire act of provocation and reprisal.
India claimed it targeted militant groups allegedly linked to the April22 Pahalgam attack, which claimed 26 lives, but behind this flimsy excuse Delhi’s broader ambition seems crystal clear: to assert its regional dominance and redefine its relationship with Pakistan, whom it sees as an impediment to its rise as a regional power.
Delhi never produced public evidence tying Pakistan to the attack, nor did it heed international entreaties for restraint; instead it moved decisively as Indian leaders bid to achieve a “new normal” in ties with Pakistan, one in which preemptive and punitive strikes become instruments of policy.
Indian media later amplified official claims that some of those killed in Bahawalpur had ties to Jaish-e-Muhammad’s Masood Azhar, bolstering Delhi’s narrative that its strikes were against militants.
“No credible media outlet has confirmed it yet. But, indeed, if his (Masood Azhar’s) family members have been killed in these strikes then it will be a setback to Pakistani narrative of dismantling JeM and LeT. Once again worries of supporting jihadi proxies will arise with potential repercussion including re-imposition of FATF’s gray-list,” said Abdul Basit, a fellow at the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research of the S.

Pakistan’s riposte to Indian strikes was as swift as it was stark: five Indian jets, including state of the art Rafales, were downed in a textbook exercise of self-defence. The message was unambiguous — no fighter, however advanced, is invulnerable.
Notwithstanding all the saber rattling, both capitals know that the real danger is the specter of uncontrolled escalation in this equation of India seeking to subdue Pakistan and Islamabad wanting to deny New Delhi the “new normal” it craves.
Each side has played its hand to maximum effect, yet each also understands that pushing the envelope too far would risk mutual destruction. Their moves are restrained by nuclear arsenals that hover like proverbial Damocles’ swords, forcing both sides to stay just below the nuclear rung.
Asked about next possible steps by the two sides, former defence secretary Gen Asif Yasin Malik believed that in order to stay below nuclear threshold they would avoid crossing redlines like ground operations or threatening sensitive territorial targets. “For the above design they would prefer air combat or missile warfare,” he maintained.
For now, nuclear deterrence holds — but is very fragile.
Brig Naeem Salik, who head Strategic Vision Institute, warned that an Indian response to Pakistan retaliation would push the two sides further up the escalation ladder. “The most dangerous possibility in all this cycle would be inadvertently hitting a sensitive target that would lead to jumping rungs right up to the top of the escalation ladder,” he warned. Islamabad has avoided going into that domain.
“Should deterrence stability erodes, the responsibility will rest squarely with India. Pakistan’s measured and restrained posture, even in the face of serious provocations, reflects its enduring commitment to avoid escalation,” a senior Pakistani official said while speaking on the background.
The loss of those Rafales is more than a hit to Indian prestige; it hands India’s hawks fresh ammo to demand retaliation. Yet more strikes risk deeper Pakistani counterpunches — and once the tit for tat cycle gains momentum, the shadow of the nuclear option will loom larger in the public mind.
In Islamabad, the narrative of righteous self-defence against “Indian aggression” as authorised by the National Security Committee has intensified calls for a firm response. But every victory on the battlefield carries its own peril: the temptation to press an advantage, even as the clock ticks ever closer to all-out war.
Behind the scenes, diplomats from Washington to Beijing — and even Qatar and other Gulf countries — are rushing to cool tempers before the flames spread. But deep seated mistrust between the two countries cannot be erased by phone calls or back channel notes alone. External mediators invariably arrive after the fact or tread too lightly, and the real power dynamic remains squarely between Delhi and Islamabad: first show strength, then exercise caution.
Former Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahm­ood, while emphasising that de-escalation in this highly volatile environment would be extremely challenging, urged major powers “to substantially step up their diplomatic engagement guided by an honest and principled approach.”
“While condemning India’s aggression, and recognising Pakistan’s inherent right to self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, they would need to employ their influence and respective leverages in full measure to dissuade India from persisting with its bellicose rhetoric and belligerent actions,” he maintained, adding that major powers would need to do something beyond crisis management and press India to move towards conflict resolution.
This is the tightrope on which both countries now teeter — projecting power without toppling into outright conflict. Each hopes to climb down once the moment is advantageous for it, yet history reminds us that such exits are always provisional, carved out between rounds of tit for tat and are vulnerable to the slightest miscalculation.
In the days ahead, military action may give way to genuine restraint or the two sides may move further up the escalation ladder at a pace at which diplomatic brakes cannot engage swiftly enough. Either way, the world will learn that when two nuclear neighbours reach the edge of war, the margin for error shrinks to almost nothing—and the only true safeguard is the discipline to step back.
Moreover, the downing of five Indian Rafale jets is a significant blow to India’s military prestige and could spark debates in the West about its capability to serve as a “net security provider” in the region —a role envisioned by the US and its allies to counterbalance China. Losing five in a day, even if from standoff range, raises questions about India’s capabilities to handle state of art Western technology.
“The US may hope India comes away from the crisis more skeptical of its non-US-original equipment. The US will also be very interested to learn about how capable any Chinese air-to-air or surface-to-air missiles were in this conflict,” said Christopher Clary, a nonresident Fellow with the South Asia Program of the Stimson Center in Washington, DC.

According to the Indian Express, Indian Home Min­ister Amit Shah chai­red a security review meeting via video conferencing on Wedn­esday after­noon with the Lieutenant Governors of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, chief ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Uttara­khand, Punjab, Rajas­than, Gujarat and West Bengal, and a representative from the Sikkim government.
“All states should make their preparations as per the guidelines issued for the mock drill. Arrang­ements should be made for smooth operation of essential services like hospitals, fire brigade etc. and uninterrupted supply of essential goods should be ensured,” said Home Minister Shah in a statement.
“Strict vigil should be kept on anti-national propaganda by unwanted elements on social and other media platforms and prompt action should be taken in coordination with state governments and central agencies. Every effort should be made to maintain seamless communication and the security of vulnerable points should also be further strengthened,” he said, adding that he also asked the states to stop the spread of fear among the people of India.
He also asked the states to keep disaster response forces, civil defence, Home Guards and NCC on alert. “Efforts should be made to ensure public participation through citizens and non-governmental organisations. Coordination between the local administration, army and paramilitary forces should be further enhanced,” he said. Senior officials of the home ministry, including the Union Home Secretary, IB director, DGs of BSF and Central Industrial Security Force were also present at the security review meeting.
“All the senior officials of the paramilitary forces were asked to strengthen border outposts to cover prominent routes and stop infiltration,” an official said, adding that the DGs said they had called back personnel on leave and instructed all personnel to ensure necessary precautions and appropriate arrangements to handle any potential contingency.
Another official said the Sashastra Seema Bal has been asked to ensure security on the borders with Nepal and Bhutan.

The military confrontation between Pakistan and India began a little after 1am on Wednesday with the Indian air strikes when the neighbouring country launched what it termed “Operation Sindoor”. Soon after reports emerged, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) confirmed the strikes, saying that India had carried out the attacks from within its airspace. The military spokesperson provided an updated damage assessment of the scenario at around 4am, reporting the death of eight civilians.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed the downing of two Indian jets around 2:45am after Pakistan launched its swift response, while the confirmation for the third plane, a Rafale aircraft, came an hour later. Confirmation of the fourth and fifth Indian jets being taken down came after 5am by Tarar and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif.
Providing further updates on the casualties on Wednesday night, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said the number of lives had risen to 31 civilians across six localities that India hit, with 57 injured.
 


White flag by India on LoC: Tarar
Talking to the media around 7am at the information ministry, Tarar asserted that India had waved a white flag at the Line of Control and “accepted defeat”. The minister said this as footage of a white flag played in the background.
“They have been forced to wave a white flag,” Tarar said. PTV News also shared footage of a white flag hoisted seemingly on top of a structure.
According to PTV News, the white flag was hoisted by the Indian army at the Chora Complex along the LoC.

Tarar further said that “several” posts of the Indian army across the border had been destroyed by the armed forces.
He recalled that Pakistan had called for a probe into the Pahalgam attack but India “conducted this attack and then fled from it”. “It is a cause of shame for them that they targeted innocent labourers and citizens,” he added.
According to the minister, Pakistan did not target any civilians in India in its retaliatory actions.

In an interview to Bloomberg TV, Defence Minister Asif said that Pakistan has shot down five Indian planes and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles, with checkposts destroyed along the Line of Control.
 






Similarly, appearing on Geo News at 5:09am, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also said that Pakistan had downed five Indian jets.
“[We shot jets down] in Akhnoor, Ambala, Barnala and in Jammu. We also shot down quadcopters and a big drone,” he stated. “It is an ongoing situation, we need to see what India does.”
The military, Reuters reported, said the five Indian fighter jets included three Rafale planes and one each of Russian planes, a Su-30 and MiG-29.
 


A spokesman for the military told Reuters Indian planes were only targeted after they attacked Pakistan.
There was no word from India on the downing of the jets, which would be the most serious loss for the Indian military in decades and risked further escalation.
The Rafale fighter is a new addition to India’s military, part of a plan to modernise its military, reduce dependence on Russian-origin equipment, and boost domestic weapons production to supply forces deployed along two contentious borders with Pakistan and China.
Before the clash, the Indian Air Force operated 36 Rafale fighters, while the navy’s aircraft fleet mainly comprises Russian MiG-29 jets.
India signed a deal with France’s Dassault Aviation on Monday to buy another 26 Rafale fighter aircraft worth 630 billion rupees ($7.4bn) for its navy in late April.
Tarar earlier said that Pakistan’s military response was ongoing but did not share operational details. “We shot down two Indian planes and we are responding to Indian aggression right now as we speak,” he told British broadcaster Sky News.
“Indian media, in a state of frenzy, is continuously running fabricated stories about losses of Pakistani Air Force and false claims of damaged aircraft,” PTV had said, stating, “No Pakistan Air Force aircraft has sustained any damage.”

The prime minister has summoned a meeting of the National Security Committee at 10am.
In the wake of the attack, Punjab has shut all educational institutions across the province today, and all exams scheduled for today have been postponed, according to a notification from the Punjab Higher Education Department.
“However, examinations scheduled by [or] on behalf of International Examining bodies shall not be affected by this postponement,” the notification said.

The strikes come as tensions have been escalating intensely between the two countries in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Last week, Pakistan reinforced its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granted “operational freedom” to his military. The military had warned of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, while diplomatic channels had remained engaged to prevent escalation.
ISPR damage assessment: 4am
In a short press briefing, DG Chaudhry provided the stats from the damage assessment: “A total of 24 impacts have been reported by India, with different weapons, in six localities. In these six localities, eight Pakistanis have been slain, 35 have been injured and two are missing, based on our damage assessment.”

“In [Bahwalpur’s] Ahmedpur East, Subhan mosque was targeted,” he added. “Here, there were four strikes and five innocent Pakistanis were slain, including a three-year-old girl. Thirty-one civilians have been injured, including 25 men and six women.”
He said one mosque was destroyed, while four quarters in which people were living were also destroyed.
“In Muzaffarabad, Bilal mosque was targeted. There were seven impacts, in which one girl has been injured and a mosque was destroyed,” the DG ISPR said.
“In Kotli, Abbat Mosque was targeted. There were five impacts and two people died, including a 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old boy. A woman and her daughter are both injured,” DG Chaudhry added.
“In Muridke, Umalkura Mosque was targeted and there were four strikes. One man has been slain, while another is injured. Two people are missing,” he said. “A mosque has been destroyed and potters have sustained economic damages,” DG Chaudhry added.
“In Sialkot district, in the village of Kotki Lohara, there were two strikes,” he added. “One missile misfired, while one fell in an open field. There was no damage.”
“Near Shakargarh, there were two strikes with no damage. There was minor damage to a dispensary,” he added.

The DG ISPR said that the “unprovoked, cowardly attack” will be met with a befitting response. “We are giving it and will continue to give it,” he said.
A statement by state broadcaster PTV News, quoting security sources, said: “Pakistani forces are giving a befitting reply to Indian aggression. According to initial reports, the Pakistan Air Force has shot down two enemy aircraft. All Pakistani Air Force aircraft are safe. Pakistan armed forces are giving a befitting reply to the enemy’s aggression.”

PTV reported that Pakistan had also destroyed an Indian brigade headquarters in a retaliatory strike. It did not specify the location of the retaliatory strike.
A post from the broadcaster said that India is being given a “befitting response” at multiple locations.

PTV additionally reported that an Indian checkpost along the Line of Control in AJK’s Dudhnial sector was destroyed in a missile strike. It also shared footage of an Indian checkpost that the Pakistan Army destroyed along the LoC in AJK’s Kot Kotera sector.
Citing security sources, PTV News said that the armed forces also shot down an Indian drone in the Barnala district of India’s Punjab. It also posted footage of white smoke rising from a forest area, saying it was from a destroyed Indian jet.

Appearing on British broadcaster Sky News around 2:45am, Tarar said Pakistan’s response is ongoing, but did not share operational details.
When asked about the potential for escalation, Tarar said it “is an evolving situation”.
He reiterated that Pakistan was expecting an attack by India and said that “they would be the aggressor”.
“We offered an investigation into the whole Pahalgam episode, we wanted a fair and transparent investigation. But … India, without evidence, has targeted civilians, women and children. India had no right to do that,” he added.
“As the minister for information, I have occupied a seat of responsibility,” Tarar said. “I have taken an oath and I will give you verified information.”
When asked why India blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack, Tarar replied: “This area (Pahalgam) is a good 200km from the LoC. The FIR was filed in 10 minutes, but police arrived after one and a half hours.”
Tarar accused India of “running away” from an investigation into the Pahalgam attack and accused India’s governing party of “wanting a reason to attack Pakistan”.
“We have a high morale and we will respond to Indian aggression,” he said.
“India has no evidence whatsoever to link Pakistan to this incident,” he stressed. “India has attacked civilians … without any justifiable cause and because we have the right to self-defence, we will defend our country, we will respond.”
Questioned about terrorists found hiding in Pakistan in the past, including Al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden, Tarar rejected the allegations and reiterated that Pakistan was facing terrorist attacks “every second week”.
“If you’re talking about the history — the Soviet invasion, the cold war — then that’s a different story,” he said.
Tarar also maintained that the US had thanked Pakistan for its efforts in the war against terrorism and “for the good fight we are fighting”.
“India will now face Pakistan’s very fierce response, because we are never the aggressors,” he said.
Referring to Pahalgam, Tarar said India “is questioning its own government”.
“They have no evidence, they have no facts and they ran away from the investigation which Pakistan had offered,” the minister added. They attacked our civilians, they attacked our mosque today, they attacked five localities. Pakistan will now respond and will respond very, very effectively.
“Our desire for peace should not be mistaken for weakness,” he said.
When asked about India’s strikes, Tarar said that no terrorist infrastructure was hit.
“When I took foreign and local journalists to a village near the LoC … tomorrow morning, I was planning to take them to Bahawalpur and Muridke to show them where the strikes have occurred, to show that the local population is living there.
“We totally deny India’s allegations regarding terrorists,” Tarar maintained. “We have complete evidence that women and children have been targeted, there are civilian casualties in this and we will bring the evidence to foreign and local media. There are no terrorist camps.”
Questioned about the possibility of de-escalation, Tarar said that the situation is ongoing, adding, “let’s see how it turns out”.
Speaking to ARY News at 1:06am about the initial details of the attack, DG Chaudhry said: “All of our air force jets are airborne. This cowardly and shameful attack was carried out from within India’s airspace. They were never allowed to come and intrude into the space of Pakistan.”
He noted: “Let me say it unequivocally: Pakistan will respond to this at a time and place of its own choosing. This heinous provocation will not go unanswered.”
“This temporary happiness that India has achieved with this cowardly attack will be replaced with enduring grief.”

Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told ARY News that civilian areas were attacked.
“The attacks were carried out on civilian areas,” Asif said, adding that the “cowards” attacked from their own airspace. “They never left their house. Let them come out, we will respond fittingly.”
When asked about Pakistan’s decisions, Asif replied that Pakistan will retaliate.
“We will give a far greater response than their own strike,” the minister said. “Not only did they attack civilians but they did it from their own airspace.”
On Geo News, Asif clarified that the strikes were launched from within India’s airspace.
“Women and children have been martyred in civilian areas. India is claiming it was targeting terrorist camps,” he said. “There is no such thing, international media can visit the targets so that India’s lies are exposed. We are offering international media to come wherever attacks have happened.”
The defence minister further said: “They don’t have the courage to attack us in our airspace, and they are firing on women and children. Mosques have been destroyed.”
He vowed that “we will give a befitting response,” he said. “They will immediately receive their due.”
Multiple loud explosions were heard in Azad Jammu and Kashmir close to the mountains around the city of Muzaffarabad after midnight, multiple Reuters witnesses said.
After the explosions, the city’s power was blacked out, the witnesses said.

Confirming the development, the Indian government said: “A little while ago, the Indian armed forces launched Operation Sindoor” and hit infrastructure in Pakistan and AJK from which it alleged “terrorist attacks against India have been planned and directed”.
“Our actions have been focused, measured and non-escalatory in nature. No Pakistani military facilities have been targeted. India has demonstrated considerable restraint in selection of targets and method of execution,” it said in the statement.
‘Cowardly attack’
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the “cowardly attack”, stating that Pakistan “reserves the right to respond forcefully to this warlike act imposed by India”.
“The deceitful enemy has carried out a cowardly attack on five locations in Pakistan,” the PM wrote. “Pakistan fully reserves the right to respond forcefully to this warlike act imposed by India, and a robust response is being given.
“The entire nation stands with the Pakistan Armed Forces, and the morale and spirit of the entire Pakistani nation are high. The Pakistani nation and the Pakistan Armed Forces know well how to deal with the enemy,” he added.
“We will never allow the enemy to succeed in its nefarious objectives.”

In another post on X at 4am, the PM wrote, “The treacherous enemy has launched a cowardly attack on five locations within Pakistan. This heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished.
“Pakistan reserves the absolute right to respond decisively to this unprovoked Indian attack — a resolute response is already underway,” he wrote, adding that the entire nation stands united behind its armed forces, and morale and resolve “remain unshaken”.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the brave officers and soldiers of Pakistan,” the PM added. “The people of Pakistan and its forces are fully prepared to confront and defeat any threat with our strength and determination. The enemy will never be allowed to achieve its malicious aims.”
 






A statement from the presidency said President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned India’s cross-border aggression against Pakistan that targeted the civilian population.
“Pakistan will give a befitting reply to Indian aggression. Indian provocation will be countered with full force and unwavering resolve to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
“Targeting civilian areas, unprovoked Indian attack is a clear violation of international law, UN Charter and Pakistan’s sovereignty. The entire Pakistani nation is united behind its brave armed forces.
“India’s cowardly actions expose the true face of a fascist regime. The Indian government is ready to put regional peace and security at stake to advance its political agenda,” the president said.
He said Pakistan’s armed forces were fully prepared and capable of defending every inch of the motherland.
 






In a post on X, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar strongly condemned the attacks, accusing India of “jeopardising regional peace”.
“Pakistan strongly condemns India’s aggression, which is [a] flagrant violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty, the UN Charter and international law,” he wrote. “Pakistan reserves the right to respond as per Article 51 of the UN Charter. We will protect our sovereignty & territorial integrity by all means.”
 






“Pakistan must launch an immediate strong counter strike against India. We have to teach India and fascist Modi a lesson India will never forget. It is imperative that PM Imran Khan is released from Adiala because he is the single person who can unify the country,” demanded Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub.
 






The Foreign Office said that in an unprovoked and blatant act of war, the Indian Air Force, while remaining within Indian airspace, violated Pakistan’s sovereignty using standoff weapons, targeting the civilian population across international border in Muridke and Bahawalpur, and across Line of Control in Kotli and Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
“India’s act of aggression has resulted in martyrdom of civilians, including women and children. This act of aggression has also caused grave threat to commercial air traffic.
“We strongly condemn India’s cowardly action, which is a flagrant violation of the UN Charter, international law, and established norms of inter-state relations.
In the wake of Pahalgam attack, the Indian leadership has once again used the bogey of terrorism to advance its sham narrative of victimhood, jeopardising regional peace and security. India’s reckless action has brought the two nuclear-armed states closer to a major conflict.“
The FO said the situation continues to evolve and Pakistan reserves the right to respond appropriately at a time and place of its choosing, in accordance with the Article-51 of the UN Charter, and as enshrined in international law.
“The government, armed forces and people of Pakistan stand united in the face of Indian aggression. They will always act with iron resolve to protect and preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan.”
“We the people of Pakistan stand together as a nation against this ugly, senseless, foolish Indian aggression. We are shoulder to shoulder with our fighting forces and will defend our homeland against this cowardly Indian attack,” said former president Arif Alvi.
 






Former FM and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said: “I strongly condemn India’s cowardly attack on Pakistani territory and civilian targets. Such acts of aggression will not go unanswered. Pakistan’s brave armed forces, including our valiant Air Force, are responding with resolve. Any misadventure will be met with full force. Pakistan stands united.”
 






He said India’s “cowardly and unprovoked attacks on civilian targets” were acts of war. “The targeting of innocent women and children is not strength, it is savagery. Pakistan’s armed forces, backed by an unbreakable nation, are responding with full force. Every aggression will be crushed. We will not tolerate violations of our sovereignty. Pakistan is united, defiant, and ready.”
 






When asked by reporters at the White House about the strikes, US President Donald Trump called India’s actions a “shame”.
“It’s a shame we just heard about it … I guess people knew something was going to happen, based on a little bit of the past. They’ve been fighting for a long time,” he said. “They’ve been fighting for many decades … I just hope it ends very quickly.”
 






Meanwhile, the White House said Rubio has spoken with his counterparts from India and Pakistan, encouraging both sides to engage in discussions to settle the escalating military confrontation.
“He is encouraging India and Pakistan to re-open a channel between their leadership to defuse the situation and prevent further escalation,” said US National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes in a statement.
Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval briefed US Secretary of State Marco Rubio shortly after New Delhi’s strikes, the Indian embassy in Washington said.
Rubio later posted on X that he was “monitoring the situation between India and Pakistan closely”. He echoed Trump’s comments earlier today that this hopefully ends quickly and will continue to engage both Indian and Pakistani leadership towards a peaceful resolution,“ he said.
 






United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres was very concerned about Indian military operations in Pakistan and AJK, his spokesperson said, while calling for maximum military restraint from both countries.
“The world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan.”
China called on both sides to exercise restraint and put peace and stability first, its foreign ministry said in response to the military escalation.
The Chinese ministry said in a statement that it regrets India’s military action and is concerned about the current situation.
United Arab Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed called on India and Pakistan to exercise restraint, de-escalate tensions and avoid further escalation that threatens regional and international peace, the Emirati state news agency WAM reported early on Wednesday.
The minister stressed the importance of heeding the voices calling for dialogue and mutual understanding to prevent military escalation, strengthen stability in South Asia, and avoid further regional tensions, WAM added.
According to the Foreign Office, Turkish FM Hakan Fidan called Dar to express Turkiye’s solidarity with Pakistan “against India’s unprovoked aggression violating Pakistan’s sovereignty and killing innocent civilians”.
“He (Fidan) expressed concern over the deteriorating regional security situation. Both leaders agreed to remain in close coordination on the evolving situation,” the FO wrote in a post on X.
 






The FO said that on Dar’s direction, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations in New York has informed the UN Security Council of India’s open aggression and threats to international peace and security.
Michael Kugelman, an expert on Washington’s relations with South Asian nations, noted: “India’s strike on Pakistan is of much greater scale than the one in 2019.
“Pakistan’s response, which according to many reports included downing several Indian jets, has also exceeded the scale of 2019.  They’re already higher up the escalatory ladder than any time in [the] 2019 crisis,” he added.

Pakistan airspace closed as of now following Indian strikes: sources
Meanwhile, sources in the Civil Aviation Authority said Pakistan’s airspace was to be completely closed and the Islamabad International Airport was closed for flights, with all flights diverted to Karachi airport.
The sources said the airspace was initially closed for 48 hours and all flights were cancelled, with passengers advised to return home.
“Major change in air routes in the region. All foreign flights rerouted to Pakistani airspace. Foreign flights leave Pakistani airspace and head towards the Arabian Sea. Flights withdrawn from Pak-India airspace, new route to the Arabian Sea adopted. International flights away from Pakistani airspace,” the sources said.
British news outlet The Guardian quoted Pakistan International Airlines as saying that all domestic and international flights on the ground have been put on hold while all inbound and outbound flights are being diverted to Karachi.
“Authorities have advised passengers not to come to the airport and to return home,” it reported.
The Flight Radar 24 online tracker showed that international flights to Karachi were still scheduled.
Meanwhile, the British Foreign Office issued a travel advisory advising against all but essential travel to Pakistan.
Qatar Airways temporarily suspended flights to Pakistan.
 






Several Asian airlines said on Wednesday they were re-routing or cancelling flights to and from Europe because of the fighting, Reuters reported.
The airlines included Thai Airways, Vietnam Airlines and Taiwan’s China Airlines and Taiwan’s EVA Air.
Ready at any time: Khawaja Asif
Earlier, Asif said that a clash with India “can happen anytime” amid the ongoing tensions between the two countries in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the headquarters of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) earlier in the day, where he was briefed on the country’s preparation for a “conventional threat”. Asif was also part of the visit.
Speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ on the briefings in the ISI HQ, the defence minister reiterated that he had already said before that a clash with India was imminent.
“That is still imminent today and can happen anytime,” he said, adding that a confrontation could be “one of the choice” India could want to adopt but “we have developed a countermeasure for every choice, whether that is a surgical strike or ground attack or air attack or naval engagement.
“We are ready for them everywhere at all times.”
He said the “crux” of today’s briefing was that “every kind of incursion or attack is being expected from them.”
Asif added that the briefing also delved into Pakistan’s strategy for responding to any situation.
 


Questioned about the chance of an ambush on a large scale, the minister said such actions were always taken on a small scale and added that he did not see any possibility of a big ambush or movement since it was detected immediately.
“We are continuously monitoring them,” he said, referring to Indian activities on the border. “Everything is in our watch. It is not the matter that they’re doing something hidden, which will cause an ambush.”
Asif said Pakistan’s preparation was complete and the government would not sit idly by. “A befitting response will be given to them at every level the moment they make a move.”
Meanwhile, the United States on Tuesday again called for calm between India and Pakistan, after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned of stopping water from flowing across borders.
“We continue to urge Pakistan and India to work towards a responsible resolution that maintains long-term peace and regional stability in South Asia,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters.
She did not comment on Modi’s latest comments but said that the US was “aware of various reports” on the situation and was “engaged”. “We remain in touch with the governments of both countries at multiple levels,” she said.
 


Pakistan has also taken the matter to the United Nations Security Council, which was briefed on the country’s stance on the Pahalgam attack and India’s “unsubstantiated” allegations.
In the latest moves by the two nuclear-armed nations, the Civil Defence in Rawalpindi has activated its 14 posts in the garrison city while all states in India were set to conduct mock drills for “effective civil defence”.
PM Shehbaz briefed on country’s preparations during visit to ISI HQ
PM Shehbaz’s visit to the ISI HQ in Islamabad entailed a detailed briefing on the prevailing security environment, “with a particular focus on preparedness for [a] conventional threat in the light of India’s increasingly aggressive and provocative posture along Pakistan’s eastern border”, a statement from the PM Office (PMO) said.

“The leadership was apprised of regional security developments and the evolving threat matrix, including conventional military options, hybrid warfare tactics and terrorist proxies,” it added.
The premier was accompanied by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Asif and the services chiefs, the PMO said.
The services chiefs — Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar — were part of the visiting team, according to a group photo released on the occasion.
The picture also showed ISI Director General Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — who was recently appointed as the country’s national security adviser — and the DG ISPR present there.
 
 

PM Shehbaz and the accompanying dignitaries “underscored the imperative of heightened national vigilance, seamless inter-agency coordination, and reinforced operational readiness to deter and decisively respond to any violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, the PMO said.
Commending the ISI’s “professionalism and strategic acumen”, the prime minister lauded its “critical role in safeguarding national interests and enabling informed national security decision-making under complex and dynamic conditions”.
“Pakistan Army is one of the most professional and disciplined force in the world,” the premier was quoted as saying. He reaffirmed that the entire nation was standing with “our brave armed forces”.
“The leadership reaffirmed Pakistan’s unambiguous resolve to defend the homeland against all threats — conventional or otherwise,” the statement read.
The leaders reiterated that with the nation’s full support, the armed forces, supported by all other elements of national power and state institutions, remained “fully prepared to uphold Pakistan’s security, prestige, and honour under all circumstances”.
PM Shehbaz also visited the newly established National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre (Niftac) and formally inaugurated its state-of-the-art headquarters, “which will serve as the central node for coordinating Pakistan’s national counterterrorism strategy”, the PMO said.
“Niftac, a federal institution, integrates over 50 relevant federal and provincial departments and agencies into a unified intelligence and threat management architecture supported by a centralised national database.”
The statement added that at the subnational level, Niftac is linked to six Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centres (Piftacs), including those in AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan, ensuring seamless coordination from the federation to the provinces.
Commending the efforts of all stakeholders involved in operationalising this vital capability, the prime minister described Niftac as a quintessential national platform for collaborative threat assessment and response. He underscored that “dismantling the nexus between terrorism, illicit networks, and external sponsorship requires robust and efficient institutional mechanisms.”
PM Shehbaz said Niftac would play a pivotal role in uprooting terrorism and its support structures from the country.
Modi vows to stop waters key to Pakistan
Meanwhile, Modi said that water from India that once flowed across borders would be stopped.
Modi did not mention Pakistan specifically, but his speech comes after New Delhi suspended its part of the 65-year-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which governs water critical for consumption and agriculture.
“India’s water used to go outside, now it will flow for India”, Modi said in a speech in New Delhi. “India’s water will be stopped for India’s interests, and it will be utilised for India.”
Pakistan has warned that tampering with its rivers would be considered “an act of war”.
However, experts also pointed out that India’s existing dams do not have the capacity to block or divert water and can only regulate the timing of when they release flows.
Islamabad accused India of altering the flow of the Chenab River, one of three rivers placed under Pakistan’s control according to the IWT.
“We have witnessed changes in the river (Chenab) which are not natural at all,” Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Pirzada told AFP.
“The majority impact will be felt in areas which have fewer alternate water routes,” Pirzada warned.
“One day the river had normal inflow and the next day it was greatly reduced,” Pirzada added.
In AJK, large quantities of water from India were reportedly released on April 26, according to the Jinnah Institute.
“This is being done so that we don’t get to utilise the water,” Pirzada added.
Afghan FM hails Pakistan’s steps to ease trade, travel amid tensions with India
On Tuesday, the FO Dar held a telephonic conversation with Afghan Acting FM Amir Khan Muttaqi who “appreciated Pakistan’s proactive steps to ease trade and facilitate travel”, amid rising tensions with India.
It added that Muttaqi extended an invitation to Dar to visit Afghanistan again. “He conveyed prayers and best wishes for the government and people of Pakistan,” the FO said.
Dar also briefed his Afghan counterpart on recent provocation and “illegal and unilateral measures” by India against Pakistan, reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to peace and safeguarding its sovereignty.
Both leaders expressed satisfaction with the pace of progress made by the two sides in bilateral relations since the deputy PM’s visit to Afghanistan on April 19, with a focus on trade, connectivity, economic cooperation, people-to-people contacts and reactivating political consultative mechanisms.
The two sides also agreed on the importance of maintaining high-level contacts for fostering long-term cooperation to promote peace and security in the region and beyond, the statement concluded.

• Military’s response proved ‘superiority in conventional war’
• NSC authorises military to act at ‘time, place, and manner of its choosing’

• Apex committee warns India ‘has once again ignited an inferno’
• Two cabinet members hint at lowering of tensions if India avoids further escalation
ISLAMABAD: PM Shehbaz Sharif declared that Pakistan has decided to avenge the overnight incursion as the National Security Comm­ittee — the apex security forum — authorised the armed forces to undertake corresponding actions in self-defence at a time, place, and manner of its choosing.
India conducted several strikes inside Pakistan, including in Azad Kashmir, early on Wednesday. Pakistan respo­nded swiftly and downed “five jets” of the Indian air force, immediately forcing them to retreat.
As the fear of an India-Pakistan war loomed large, PM Shehbaz convened a meeting of the National Security Committee to review grave developments arising out of India’s unprovoked and unlawful act of war. This meeting took key decisions, which it shared in a statement, followed by the premier’s address to the nation.
In his speech, PM Shehbaz said India attacked six different places in Pakistan and expressed sorrow over the loss of innocent lives. “We solemnly swear that we will avenge each and every drop of blood of our martyrs,” he said, adding that India targeted innocent people in Pakistan.
India has made a blatant mistake and now it will have to bear the consequences, said the premier, adding Pakistan has proved that it was capable of responding to any sort of aggression in a befitting manner. “India thought that Pakistan would retreat, but it forgot that we are a brave nation ready to fight till the last drop of our blood,” he added.  He said it “took only a few hours” for the Pakistani military to bring the enemy to its knees. “With the grace of God, our jets created such a storm in the sky that the enemy screamed. Five war jets, which were the pride of India, are now just ash and rubble.”
PM Shehbaz has said that Pakistan and its military forces have once again “proved their superiority over the enemy in conventional warfare”.
‘Coordinated missile, air and drone strikes’
A statement issued by the NSC after its meeting said Indian jets “deliberately targeted the civilian areas, on the false pretext of presence of imaginary terrorist camps, resulting in the martyrdom of innocent men, women, and children, and causing damage to the civilian infrastructure, including mosques”. It said the Indian strikes also caused “grave danger to commercial airlines” in the air, endangering the lives of thousands. The statement also expressed concern over the targeting of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project, which was a violation of international conventions.
The NSC said the blatant violations of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity clearly constituted acts of war under international law.
Pakistan has been emphatically rejecting Indian allegations claiming the presence of terrorist camps on its territory, the statement said, recalling Pakistan had offered a transparent and neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack but its offer was not accepted.
“The international media personnel had already visited these ‘imaginary terrorist camps’ on 6 May 2025, and more visits were planned for 7 May, 2025. However, apprehensive of its falsehood being exposed…the Indian leadership…has now gone to the extent of attacking innocent civilians in order to satiate its delusional thoughts and short-sighted political objectives,” the statement said, adding that the attack on innocent people “was neither tolerable nor acceptable”.
“India, against all sanity and rationality has once again ignited an inferno in the reg­ion; the responsibility for ensuing consequences shall lie squ­arely with India,” it warned.
“In consonance with Article 51 of the UN Charter, Pakistan reserves the right to respond, in self-defence, at a time, place, and manner of its choosing to avenge the loss of innocent Pakistani lives and blatant violation of its sovereignty,” it said.
Reconciliatory note
As tensions boil over, two cabinet members struck a reconciliatory note, with PML-N stalwart and PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah saying that the government and the army chief had committed to the world that Pakistan would not take any “irresponsible action” if India did not further escalate.
“We have given a befitting response. If they (India) do further actions, then we will give an even more befitting response,” he said after the NSC meeting. His colleague Khawaja Asif also appeared cautious in his response, saying Pakistan was “trying to avoid” a full-blown war.
Speaking to CNN, Defence Minister Asif said New Delhi’s deadly barrage on Punjab and Azad Kashmir was a “clear-cut violation” as India crossed an international boundary. “This is a clear-cut violation, and an invitation to expand the conflict and maybe convert it into something much more wider and much more dangerous for the region.” He insisted that Pakistan’s military was braced “for an all-out war,” after India raised the “stakes”.
“What happens next is we are prepared for an all-out war. There is absolutely no doubt, because India is inc­r­easing the intensity, the stakes of this conflict,” added Kh Asif. “So… we can’t be caught with our guards down.”

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday mourned the loss of 31 lives in attacks by Indian forces on civilians, terming New Delhi’s actions “terrorism” and accusing it of continuous ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC).
Despite a ramping up of rhetoric from the Indian side, diplomatic channels remained open, as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed contact between the national security advisers of India and Pakistan, and US President Donald Trump urged both sides to stop the violence.
“I want to see it stop. And if I can do anything to help, I will. I will be there,” he said.
The Pakistan military touted the downing of five Indian fighter jets as a major victory — a claim which was seemingly acknowledged when Indian officials admitted that at least three of their aircraft had “crashed” within their territory.
On Wednesday, as both countries continued to trade heavy artillery fire, authorities revealed the extent of the damage caused by Indian strikes on six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir.
The military’s chief spokesperson said that at least 57 people had been injured in the attacks, while a hydropower project was also shelled by Indian forces.
Muzaffarabad Deputy Commissioner Mudasser Farooq said the intake structure of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (NJHP) was targeted the previous night, which damaged the intake gates and a hydraulic protection unit. An ambulance belonging to the project was also hit.
Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that as per the Geneva Conventions, it was prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless objects that were indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as drinking water supplies/installations and irrigation works.
Trump’s plea & NSAs’ chat
Donald Trump called for India and Pakistan to halt their fighting immediately, and offe­red to help end the worst violence between the two nuclear-armed neighbours in two decades. “It’s so terrible,” Mr Trump said at the White House. “I get along with both, I know both very well, and I want to see them work it out. I want to see them stop.
“They’ve gone tit-for-tat, so hopefully they can stop now, but I know both. We get along with both countries very well, good relationships with both, and I want to see it stop. And if I can do anything to help, I will. I will be there,” he said.
Meanwhile, in an interview to TRT World, Foreign Min­ister Ishaq Dar confirmed that the national security advisers of India and Pakis­tan had been in touch. Mr Dar was questio­n­­ed about whether the NSAs had spoken after the overnight action, to which he said: “Yes there has been contact between the two.”
Pakistan had recently named ISI Director General Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik as the NSA, while his counterpart from India is Ajit Doval. Earlier, NDTV quoted Do­­val as telling his foreign counterparts that India has no in­­tention to escalate. How­ever, other voices in the Indian government seemed to contradict his sentiment.

Indian ‘operation’ and ‘crashes’
According to New Delhi, its strikes targeted “terrorist camps” that served as rec­ruitment centres, launchpads, and indoctrination centres, and housed weapons and training facilities. “Intelligence and monitoring of Pakistan-based terror modules showed that further attacks against India were impending, therefore it was necessary to take pre-emptive and precautionary strikes,” Indian Foreign Sec­retary Vikram Misri, the top official in its external affairs ministry, told the briefing.
Pakistan claimed to have shot down at least three Rafale fighters, and two Russian-made fighter jets during engagements.
Although India did not confirm Pakistan’s claim of shooting down five of its jets, local government sources in Indian-held Kashmir told Reuters that three fighter jets had crashed in separate areas during the night.
All three pilots had been hospitalised, the sources added. Indian defence ministry officials were not immediately available to confirm the report.
Images circulating on local media showed a large, damaged cylindrical chunk of silver-coloured metal lying in a field at one of the crash sites.
Meanwhile, CNN quoted a French security official as saying that at least one of the dow­ned aircraft was, in fact, a Rafale aircraft.
Preparations in AJK, held Kashmir
Meanwhile, preventive me­­asures were taken along the Line of Control on Wednesday, as the AJK government on Wednesday established a Cen­tral Emergency Response Cen­­tre to coordinate rescue, relief, and damage assessment efforts.
Officials in Muzaffarabad, Haveli, Poonch, and Kotli noted that a precise evaluation of property losses was still underway. As part of the emergency measu­r­­es, all educational institutions across the region were ordered closed until further notice.
In Muzaffarabad’s Shawai area, a mosque struck by missiles — killing three people, including its 80-year-old caretaker — remained the focus of high-profile visits throughout the day.
Among the visitors were members of the United Nations Military Observers Group for India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP), who were briefed by military officials on the unprovoked Indian attack.
Deputy Commissioner Faro­­oq said many residents had been evacuated from Shawai overnight and returned home by the afternoon. Residents who lived near the mosque shared harrowing accounts of the attack.
“At first, we had no idea what was happening. My daughter and I had just stepped into the veranda when she was struck by shrapnel. We immediately ran for cover,” said Safeer Awan, a lawyer whose house is located just metres from the mosque.
Erdogan conveys solidarity
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has spoken by phone with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to convey his solidarity after Indian strikes, Reuters reported.
During the call, Mr Erdogan told the premier that Turkiye supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies” in the crisis, his office said in a statement.
Mr Erdogan also described Islamabad’s call for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack as “appropriate”.
Meanwhile, the UN has renewed its call for “maximum restraint”, APP reported. Responding to questions at a news briefing at UN Headquarters in New York, UN Spokesperson Stephanie Tremblay reiterated that the world cannot afford a military confrontation between the two nations.
Asked whether the UN personnel serving the United Nations Observer Group in India and Pakistan, which monitors the Line of Control, were safe, she said, “Yes, we checked and everybody was safe.”

The case pertains to the military trials and the subsequent sentencing of civilians for their role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023.
The 5-2 ruling came as the CB accepted a set of 38 intra-court appeals (ICAs) moved by the federal and provincial gover­nments as well as Shuhada Forum Balochistan, among others, against the widely-praised October 2023 ruling that declared that trying the accused civilians in military courts violated the Constitution.

Highlights:

SC restores three provisions of Army Act struck down earlier
Bench orders legislation within 45 days to ensure civilians’ right to appeal

Minority ruling declares military court sentences as ‘without jurisdiction’, against Constitution

Lawyers, PTI slam ruling, voice concern over fair trial


The bench — led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also including Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, and Shahid Bilal Hassan — had been reviewing whether the trial of civilians in military courts was Constitutional or not.
Justice Aminuddin announced the 10-page short order of the majority ruling. The bench also directed the government to make the necessary amendments in the PAA within 45 days to allow the convicted individuals the right to appeal their sentences before a high court.
On the other hand, Justices Mandokhail and Afghan dissented from the verdict, dismissing the appeals in a separate order and upholding the earlier ruling that declared military trials as null and void.
 
 

That Oct 23, 2023 verdict by a five-member bench — led by Justice Ijazul Ahsan and comprising Justices Munib Akhtar, Yayha Afridi, Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi and Ayesha A. Malik — had declared the military trials of civilians as unconstitutional by a majority of 4-1.
While the bench unanimously emphasised that the cases of the May 9 suspects will proceed before criminal courts, the majority ruling had struck down Section 2(1)d(i) and 2(1)(d)(ii) as well as Section 59(4) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952.
In today’s pivotal verdict, the constitutional bench — formed under the 26th Amendment — restored those sections of the PAA.
Section 2(1)(d)(i) says that those persons not otherwise subject to PAA become subject to the law if they were accused of seducing or attempting to seduce any army officer from his duty or allegiance to the government.
Likewise, Section 2(1)(d)(ii) says individuals could be tried under PAA if they have committed an offence in relation to any work of defence, arsenal, naval, military or air force establishment or station, ship or aircraft or otherwise in relation to the naval, military or air force affairs of Pakistan an offence under the Official Secrets Act 1923.
Section 59(4) says that any person who becomes subject to PAA will liable to be tried under this act.
The short order stated that by a majority of five judges, “ICA no.5/2023 and other connected appeals are allowed and the impugned judgment, dated 23.10.2023, […] is set aside.
“Whereas, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan dismissed the aforesaid intra-court appeals,” it added.
While the CB did not specify a timeframe, a detailed verdict is expected later as only short orders were issued today.
‘Rights struck a death blow’: Lawyers, PTI slam ruling
The PTI — whose supporters and activists are among those handed the sentences by military courts — and lawyers strongly criticised the verdict and expressed their concerns about the right to fair trial.
Lawyer Reema Omer termed the order “terrible”. “A pity the highest court of the land is on board with such militarisation of justice in the country,” she said on X.
Noting the court’s directives on legislation about right to fair trial, Omer said: “While important, [it is] insufficient to make military trials of civilians consistent with fair trial.”
She highlighted that the dissenting order clearly pointed out “how military trials of civilians violate the right to a fair trial in a number of ways, and why active military officers are not competent per se to conduct indepedent and impartial trials”.
 


In another post, Omer shared an analysis by the International Commission of Jurists that detailed why military trials “reflect a glaring surrender of human rights”.
Renowned rights activist and lawyer Jibran Nasir also strongly condemned the verdict, saying it had “surrendered our fundamental right to due process and fair trial”.
“Last night we faced an external threat from a foreign enemy. This morning we have been exposed to an internal threat to our democracy and freedom by our own Supreme Court,” he quipped, referring to the India-Pakistan military escalation.
Nasir affirmed: “While we stand with our armed forces to protect our borders, we in the midst of this crisis and wartime hysteria must not lose sight of the very constitutional rights and freedoms which we are fighting to protect.”
 


Lawyer Hassan A. Niazi lamented: “Pakistan’s fundamental rights — battered and waning — were struck a death blow today. Even the judicial arm cedes its space.”
The lawyer added that the dircetives on right to appeal could not “redeem the fact that civilian trials in military courts are unconstitutional and violate basic human rights”.
“We have entered the era of ‘militarisation’ of justice — spearheaded by a ’constitutional bench,” he said.
 


PTI MNA Omar Ayub Khan termed the ruling a “weaponised decision” that he said “would be used for targeting” Imran and his party.
“The decision has been given on a day when purportedly the installed regime and the establishment want to build ‘National Cohesion’,” he added, referring to the ongoing situation faced by the country in the wake of India’s strikes last night.
“The judges who have ruled in favour of allowing civilians trial in military courts will not be remembered kindly by history,” the NA opposition leader said, adding that the 26th Amendment was passed with “ill intent” and Imran as the “sole target”.
PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh mentioned the timing of the verdict, saying, “Dropping the military courts verdict amid a war-like situation is a deliberate move to mask injustice.”
 


PTI’s Hammad Azhar said it was “despicable to use hostilities on the border to encroach on civilian rights and trample the Constitution”.
“Weak leaders use conflicts for personal branding whilst statesmen see it as [an] opportunity to unite the country,” he added.
Majority ruling
Detailing the reasons briefly, the majority order stated: “There was, in fact, no question with regard to the suspension of any fundamental right involved within the sphere of influence or realm of Article 233 of the Constitution.”
Recalling the arguments presented by Attorney General of Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, the order noted that 39 military installations, army works/establishments at various places were targeted/attacked “within a span of four to six hours”.
 
 

“Peaceful assembly, association, or public demonstration/protest within the bounds and precincts of reasonable restrictions imposed by the law is not prohibited, but without violating or breaking the law, or taking the law in one’s hands,” the ruling stressed.
It noted that the AGP had pointed out that due to the striking down of some sections of the PAA, no action can be taken even against “hardcore criminals and terrorists” involved in attacks on army installations, personnel or civilians, or against “persons accused of espionage or spies of enemy countries”.
Citing the cases of Brig (retired) F. B. Ali, Shahida Zahir Abbasi and District Bar Rawalpindi, the bench noted that the “various provisions were vigorously highlighted by the learned counsel for the appellants to demonstrate” that the right to a fair trial was fully protected under the PAA.
On the right to appeal, the order said that AGP Awan had reiterated that if the CB referred the matter to the government/parliament to amend the law and create a window of an independent right of appeal over and above the one already provided under Section 133-B of the PAA, it would be considered seriously.
Subsequently, the CB referred the matter to the government/parliament for “considering and making necessary amendments/legislation” in the PAA and allied Rules within 45 days to provide an independent right of appeal in the high court against the convictions handed by military courts under Section 2(1)d(i) and 2(1)(d)(ii) read with Section 59(4) of the PAA.
 
 

It clarified that individual cases/writ petitions before high courts challenging ATC orders, “allowing the transfer of case/custody of any accused to the military court for trial, shall be decided by such courts on its own merits”.
“In our view, the provisions merely accentuating the right to a fair trial and due process in any statute and its actual application and proper implementation during the trial are two distinct features and situations,” the order stated.
The majority ruling further said: “We, in unison, sensitise the need for legislative changes, which will also be compliant to the requirements laid down under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) for maintaining and preserving the constitutional and societal norms in the existing legal framework.”
Minority ruling disagrees with military trials
In their dissenting order, Justices Mandokhail and Afghan set aside the convictions and sentences awarded to civilians by military courts over the May 9 riots, declaring them as “without jurisdiction”.
The judges observed that the trial of civilians by military courts violated Articles 2A, 9 (security of person), 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention), 10A (right to fair trial), 19A (right to information), 25 (equality of citizens) and 227(1) (provisions relating to the Holy Quran and Sunnah) of the Constitution, as well as “offends the fundamental principle of independence of judiciary”.
 
 

They determined: “The accused under custody shall be treated as under-trial prisoners. Their cases stand transferred to the concerned courts of competent jurisdiction for trial. Upon receipt whereof, the concerned courts should proceed with their trials expeditiously and decide the same at the earliest, in accordance with law.”
The judges were of the opinion that suspects “who have completed/undergone their sentences or have been acquitted of the charge by the court martial or forum of appeal under the PAA shall have the effect of their discharge” under section 169 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The order pointed out that Section 2(1)(d) did not “qualify for exemption
from fundamental rights” as it related to “persons not otherwise subject to the PAA (‘Civilians’)”, and hence, cannot be retained as part of the PAA .
“The courts martial comprising of executive, being outside the scope of Article 175(3) of the Constitution, cannot prosecute civilians,” the judges observed.
They clarified that the reasons for their judgment would be detailed “later on”.
Military court convictions
On December 13, 2024, the SC’s constitutional bench conditionally allowed military courts to pronounce reserved verdicts of 85 civilians who were in custody for their alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.
 
 

Subsequently, on December 21, military courts sentenced 25 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement. Days later, another 60 civilians were handed jail terms for a similar period over the matter.
On January 2, the mercy petitions of 19 accused were accepted on humanitarian grounds, while 48 other pleas have been processed to Courts of Appeal.
The sentencing of civilians by military courts was not only condemned by the PTI, but the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union also raised concerns, saying the move contradicted international laws.</p><small>2025-05-07 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603505-crushing-blow-made-india-realise-pakistans-strength-readiness-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Crushing blow made India realise Pakistan's strength, readiness: PM</strong></a><br><p>

The statement comes hours after the Pakistani military brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by the neighbouring country at six sites in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
“HBL Pakistan Super League X will continue as planned with Islamabad United set to take on Quetta Gladiators later today at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium,” the PCB said in a press release issued on Wednesday morning.
The statement added that the toss for today will take place at 7:30pm, with the first ball to be bowled at 8pm.
The tenth edition of the HBL PSL started on April 17. This year’s event marks a decade of the country’s very own franchise T20 tournament, which has over the years attracted sizeable crowds stadiums as well as a dedicated online viewership.
Tonight’s match sees the return of HBL PSL to Rawalpindi for four matches on  May 7, 8, 9 and 10. Thereafter, the final group stage match is scheduled in Multan on May 11, the PCB added.
The Qualifier is set to take place in Rawalpindi on May 13, while both Eliminators (1 and 2) and the final of the marquee event are to take place on May 14, 16 and 18, respectively, at the Gaddafi Stadium.
The last PSL match before a day’s break on May 6 was played between Multan Sultans and Peshawar Zalmi at the Multan Cricket Stadium on Monday.
It was a game reflective of the dismal campaign the home side has had. The Multan side couldn’t muster any strength to stave away Peshawar ; overrun by Babar Azam’s side, who hauled themselves firmly into PSL playoffs contention with a clinical seven-wicket victory.</p><small>2025-05-07 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/07113017a4e1b5f.jpg?r=122835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909071/psx-bleeds-as-fears-of-indian-military-action-come-true' target='_blank'><strong>PSX bleeds as fears of Indian military action come true</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday witnessed yet another bloodbath this year — tumbling by over 3,500 points — as investors’ fears of a military action by India against Pakistan came true last night.
The Pakistani military brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by its neighbouring country at six sites in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 6,560.82 points (5.78pc) to stand at 107,007.68 from the last close of 113,568.50 when the market opened at 9:30am.
Due to the massive dip, the market was immediately suspended briefly.
This marked the second-largest intra-day plunge (points-wise), ranking next to the nearly 8,700-point loss that followed the United States’ tariff announcement last month.
However, the market started recovering slightly, reaching 112,457.37 points at around 10:34am, before closing at 110,009.02 points — 3,559.48 points (3.13pc) below yesterday’s close.
“The market opened under pressure today following Indian strikes on unarmed civilians in Pakistan,” said Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.
 
 

“Some selling has been observed, though volumes remain low as investors assess the evolving situation,” Farooq said, adding that recovery was expected once tensions begin to de-escalate.
Shahbaz Ashraf, chief investment officer at Frim Ventures, also attributed the sell-off to “heightened geopolitical tensions following reports of Indian strikes on multiple Pakistani locations”.
“The flare-up has rattled investor sentiment, with fears of further escalation weighing on the market,” he said. However, Shahbaz added, analysts remained “cautiously optimistic, hoping the conflict will remain short-lived with likely mediation from global powers”.
“Importantly, with macroeconomic indicators showing signs of recovery, market watchers believe this correction could be temporary. Many view the pullback as a potential buying opportunity, especially for long-term investors looking to accumulate quality stocks at lower valuations,” he noted, explaining the gains witnessed later.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the impact of today’s selling pressure would be short-term and the market would “recover once this ends”.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, also observed that the PSX was “feeling the impact” of last night’s developments.
Echoing Shahbaz’s opinion, Awais said the plunge “may present a buying opportunity, as we do not expect the situation to escalate further”.
“The conflict between India and Pakistan has escalated dangerously,” said Sakib Sherani, economist and head of Macro Economic Insights, adding that India’s request to the International Monetary Fund earlier this week to review loans disbursed to Pakistan was adding to Islamabad’s woes.
 
 

“All these actions will hurt Pakistan’s fragile economic recovery.”
“Reports of the IMF programme being affected purely because of representations by one country on the board of the IMF are overblown,” said former State Bank of Pakistan chief, Reza Baqir.
“A longer-term conflict is in neither country’s interest,” he stressed.
In the past few days, panicky investors have continued to reduce their holdings as Pakistan had expressed a heightened possibility of a military action by India in the wake of the latter’s allegations regarding a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
International rating agency Moody’s has warned that sustained India-Pakistan tensions could negatively affect Pakistan’s growth.
It also said that escalating tensions could cause a setback to nascent macroeconomic stability and also disrupt Pakistan’s access to foreign funding flows.
On the other hand, Moody’s noted that macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable. However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.
 
 

“The reliance of Pakistan on external capital inflow — in recovery from an external account crisis, in the midst of an IMF programme, and with under three months of import cover compared to over nine months in India — makes its asset prices much more sensitive to any conflict than those in India,” said Hasnain Malik at Tellimer in Dubai, Reuters reported.
Pakistan’s finance ministry said it had held an emergency meeting to review market resilience and national financial security, adding that robust measures to safeguard economic infrastructure and provide clarity and confidence to markets are being implemented.
India’s equity benchmarks end little changed
Meanwhile, India’s equity benchmarks ended with little change, coming off early losses, as rising geopolitical tension between India and Pakistan offset expectations of easing global trade tensions.
The benchmark Nifty 50 and Sensex closed 0.1pc higher each at 24,414.4 and 80,746.78, respectively. The 50-stock index had opened 0.6pc lower, while the Sensex had slipped 0.9pc at open.
Eleven of the 13 major sectors logged gains.
 
 

Volatility in Indian shares .NIFVIX, which has risen in eight out of the 10 trading sessions since the Pahalgam attack, was hovering near a three-week high.
India’s top two stock exchanges, the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange temporarily restricted access to their websites for overseas users, Reuters reported, citing sources.
However, the ability of overseas investors to trade on Indian markets remained unaffected.
“Investors were taking short positions in the market in anticipation of an Indian retaliation. Now that the news is out, they are covering those positions,” said Dharmesh Kant, head of equity research at Cholamandalam Securities.</p><small>2025-05-07 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603497-indian-strikes-martyr-student-her-brother-and-army-officers-7-year-old-son-in-ajk' target='_blank'><strong>Indian strikes martyr student, her brother and army officer's 7-year-old son in AJK</strong></a><br><p>

The Pakistani military brought down five Indian jets in retaliation for late-night strikes launched by its neighbouring country at six sites in Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
The plans were fine tuned at an emergency meeting presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb through video link from London currently on a two day visit to promote investment opportunities in the country.
The emergency meeting was convened to assess the current financial landscape in light of escalating regional tensions following the recent belligerent Indian aggression.
The finance minister said: “Pakistan’s financial system remains stable and secure, and all relevant authorities are working in close coordination to uphold national economic integrity in the face of emerging challenges.”
The participants of the meeting were informed that contingency plans have been reinforced to ensure operational resilience and secure communication lines across financial institutions.
The meeting was attended by the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the finance secretary, and senior officials from the Finance Division.
In a comprehensive and strategic discussion revolving around the situation and functioning of equity, debt, foreign exchange and interbank markets, the participants conducted a rapid risk assessment and evaluated the current threat perception with an emphasis on ensuring national financial stability and security.
“Recognising the critical importance of market stability, the participants of the meeting reaffirmed the government’s firm commitment to maintaining business continuity across all financial and allied sectors,” the finance ministry said.
Key assurances were extended to stakeholders, underscoring that robust measures are being implemented to safeguard Pakistan’s economic infrastructure and provide calm, clarity, and confidence to the financial markets.
“The participants also emphasised the importance of heightened vigilance against a wide range of threats, with a special focus on cybersecurity and communication infrastructure,” it added.
“To maintain proactive oversight, the meeting decided on regular reviews of the evolving situation. These ongoing evaluations will support the government’s efforts to provide consistent guidance and timely reassurance to the financial markets and the wider business community.”
Soon afterwards, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) convened an emergent meeting to assess the situation in the wake of geopolitical tension in the region.
“In order to preserve market stability and investor confidence at this time, the SECP reaffirms its commitment to ensure continuity in capital market operations,” a statement read.
The Capital Market Infrastructure Institutions (CMIIs), including the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), National Clearing Company of Pakistan and Central Depository Company, also participated in the meeting. They assured that robust and efficient risk management measures are in place for ensuring smooth functioning of Pakistan’s capital markets.
“In response to the current situation, the SECP has advised all CMIIs to immediately enhance their security protocols and operational continuity measures,” the statement read.
“This includes strengthening cybersecurity defenses across all trading, risk management, clearing, and settlement systems and activating full business continuity plans. The CMIIs were further advised to reinforce their physical security arrangements at all facilities,” the statement added.
“The SECP remains vigilant and will issue further updates, as necessary. Market participants are encouraged to continue operations as usual, with the SECP and CMIIs closely monitoring developments to safeguard market integrity,” it concluded.</p><small>2025-05-07 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603477-supreme-court-restores-army-act-to-original-form-with-5-2-majority-decision' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court allows civilian trials in military courts with majority verdict</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan reported eight deaths and said it had responded to the Indian strikes.
This is what global leaders have said about the latest hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours:
Turkish foreign ministry
Turkiye warned of the “risk of all-out war” between India and Pakistan, in a statement from the Foreign Ministry.
“Last night’s attack by India poses the risk of all-out war. We condemn this provocative move and attacks targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure,” the ministry wrote.
German foreign ministry
The German government called to prevent “any escalation” and urged to “protect civilians.”
Berlin, in contact with both countries, has opened a crisis unit to “monitor the situation closely,” the Foreign Ministry said on X. This is the most serious military confrontation between India and Pakistan in two decades.
Qatar foreign ministry
The state of Qatar, in a statement posted on X, expressed concern over the continuing escalation, urging both countries “to exercise maximum restraint, give priority to the voice of wisdom, respect the principles of good neighbourliness and resolve the crisis through diplomatic means. “
 






Chinese foreign ministry
“India and Pakistan are neighbours that cannot be moved apart, and they are also China’s neighbours,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said in a statement.
“We call on both India and Pakistan to prioritise peace and stability, remain calm and restrained and avoid taking actions that further complicate the situation,” the spokesperson added.
Beijing also offered to play a mediating role in reducing tensions.
“We are willing to work together with the international community and continue to play a constructive role in easing the current tensions,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.
UK Trade Secretary Jonathon Reynolds
The UK is ready to support both India and Pakistan to de-escalate tensions, Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said.
“Our message would be that we are a friend, [and] a partner to both countries. We stand ready to support both countries. Both have a huge interest in regional stability, in dialogue, in de-escalation and anything we can do to support that, we are here and willing to do,” he told BBC radio.
Russian foreign ministry
Russia’s foreign ministry in a statement said it was “deeply concerned by the escalation of military confrontation,” and called on the parties to “exercise restraint to prevent further deterioration.”
The foreign ministry hoped the tensions could be “resolved through peaceful, diplomatic means.”
Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi
“In regard to the terrorist act that occurred in Kashmir on April 22, our country firmly condemns such acts of terrorism. Furthermore, we express strong concern that this situation may lead to further retaliatory exchanges and escalate into a full-scale military conflict. For the peace and stability of South Asia, we strongly urge both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and stabilise the situation through dialogue.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot
France also called on India and Pakistan to show restraint.
“We understand India’s desire to protect itself against the scourge of terrorism, but we obviously call on both India and Pakistan to exercise restraint to avoid escalation and, of course, to protect civilians,” Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, said in an interview on TF1 television.
“I don’t think anyone has an interest in a lasting confrontation between India and Pakistan,” he said, adding that he would be speaking with his counterparts in India and Pakistan.
Earlier today, US President Donald Trump expressed disappointment over the incident, calling it a “shame”, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hoped for engagement towards a peaceful resolution. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres urged both countries to exercise “maximum military restraint”.</p><small>2025-05-07 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603463-in-pictures-ground-reality-as-pakistan-india-tensions-flare' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Ground reality as Pakistan-India tensions flare</strong></a><br><p>

• Ex-Indus water commissioner says Delhi’s actions violate IWT, independent expert’s decision on Baglihar
LAHORE: Flows in the River Chenab increased substantially on Tuesday — a day after they slowed to a trickle — after India ostensibly caved to international pressure over its illegal act of stopping river water from flowing to Pakistan.
Following its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, New Delhi had severely cut flows in the Chenab, which slowed from 34,000 cusecs on Sunday to around 3,000 cusecs on Monday.
The very next day, however, the situation improved, with inflows at Marala recorded at 28,300 cusecs on Tuesday.
“The situation started improving on Tuesday with discharge of water by India from up to downstream. Hope it will improve more in coming days if there is no halt on part of India,” a senior official told Dawn.
According to a report shared by the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority, the inflows and outflows in Chenab at Marala were recorded as 28,300 cusecs and 19,100 cusecs respectively.
The inflows from Indus River at Tarbela were gauged as 95,300 cusecs, whereas the outflows were 50,000 cusecs.
The inflow of 37,000 cusecs was recorded at River Kabul at Nowshera, whereas the River Jhelum at Mangla was gauged as having inflows of 43,500 cusecs and outflows of 32,000 cusecs.
The water level in Tarbela dam, which has a minimum water operating level of 1,402 feet and a maximum conservation capacity of 1,550 feet, is currently at 1,444.30 feet. The live storage in the dam was recorded as 0.902 MAF on Tuesday.
With a current water level of 1,137 feet, Mangla dam recorded 1.235 MAF live storage. The minimum operating level of the dam is 1,050 feet, whereas the maximum conservation capacity is 1,242 feet.
Meanwhile, the Chashma reservoir recorded a live storage of 0.208 MAF with a current water level of 646.90 feet. The minimum operating level of the lake is 638.15 feet whereas its maximum conservation level is 649 feet.
International pressure
According to a senior official, who did not wish to be named, the reason behind the release of water a day after India had halting flows in the Chenab seemed to be pressure exer­ted from international quarters.
“All of India’s hydroelectric projects in the Chenab basin are run-of-the-river, which have reservoirs meant for power generation. They cannot hold waters in such reservoirs for more than 36 hours. But releasing water the very next day shows that they have done this after being pressed internationally,” the official explained. “I think India will not repeat this act again,” he hoped.
The official further said the related government departments in Pakistan are also monitoring the rivers’ flows very closely these days.
Talking to Dawn, former Pakis­tan’s Indus Waters Commissioner Syed Jamat Ali Shah termed the halting of flows in Chenab as a breach of the treaty, as well as a violation of the opinion of the neutral expert on Baglihar Dam.
“The neutral expert, in his decision, had termed maintenance of Baglihar dam necessary keeping in view the massive deposition of sand coming along with river water into the dam meant for power generation and not for water storage. However, according to verdict, the sand can only be flushed out when the water flows at Baglihar are recorded at 70,000 cusecs, which usually happens in the monsoon season only,” he explained.
Mr Shah said that such large quantities of water were not available, India apparently first flushed out the silt by opening spillways, and then closed them to start filling the dam.

• Omar Ayub complains to speaker about his speeches being censored
• Ayaz Sadiq asserts his right to expunge remarks ‘in the House and in chambers’
ISLAMABAD: National Assembly pro­­ceedings were not broadcast live on its official social media platforms for a second consecutive day, on Tuesday, as the House continued a discussion on tensions with India following the Pahalgam attack.
But when Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan raised the issue of his speech being censored, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq asserted his authority, saying he had the right to expunge anything deemed “against national interest”.
The proceedings were not live-stre­amed on the NA’s official YouTube and Facebook channels, while PTV aired speeches from the treasury benches only.
When contacted for comment, a senior National Assembly Secretariat  official said that live-streaming of parliamentary proceedings had been  stopped on social media in view of the sensitivity of the prevailing  situation between Pakistan and India, adding that the live-stream would  resume soon.
On Monday, the opening speech of the opposition leader on the state of India-Pakistan relations, a walkout staged by JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, as well as speeches by other opposition lawmakers, were not televised on PTV.
Though censorship of “objectionable parts” of opposition lawmakers’ spee­ches has become something of a norm, a complete blackout of proceedings during debate on an important issue is quite unprecedented.
The NA’s media wing usually shares the link of the live broadcast, via social media channels, with reporters through a WhatsApp group. However, this practice has not been witnessed for the past two days.
Omar Ayub also raised the issue of censorship in the National Assembly on Tuesday, but only to the extent of his own speech.
At the outset of proceedings on Tuesday, he regretted that his speech was not live-streamed. He said that his entire speech was based on facts, adding “We pointed out again and again — you can check your record — that there was no live feed…”.
“Let us know if somebody does not like our voice,” he remarked. He said he also sought a copy of his speech from the NA staff, which was not provided. He also talked about pressure on his staff and said that he has to type all his correspondence himself.
In response, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said his speech was shown on closed-circuit TVs in the entire NA Secretariat.
However, the speaker asserted his authority to expunge anything he deemed to be against the national interest. In view of the responsibility of the chair, he said, he would rather delete anything that was inappropriate in his opinion. “You will get a copy of the rest of your speech”, the speaker told the opposition leader.
Mr Sadiq also said that he would review all the speeches and then decide which parts should be deleted. “I can expunge remarks during the proceedings, as well as in the chamber,” he said.
Talking about the concerns raised by Mr Ayub over his staff, the speaker said: “Rest assured, if they do your work and somebody tries to harass or stop them, I will take the responsibility.”
In a separate letter to the NA speaker, Omar Ayub complained, “Despite your ruling and personal commitment made on the floor of the House, my speech was, in fact, blocked, censored, and the continuity of parliamentary proceedings and debate was deliberately interrupted by the Media and Photography Wing of the NA”.
He complained his request for access to the official audio and video recordings of his speech from the NA general media and photography wing were denied without any lawful justification, “even though no portion of the speech was ordered to be expunged by the Chair”.

• Both judges question ECP’s legal grounds for seeking review
• Counsel argues July 12 verdict granted relief to a ‘non-party’
• Constitutional Bench issues notices to respondents, seeks commission’s reply to PTI’s contempt petition
ISLAMABAD: In a move that left at least two judges visibly bewildered, the 13-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notices to the respondents on petitions seeking to revisit the July 12, 2024, verdict that allocated reserved seats to the PTI.
However, Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi insisted that the presiding judge, Justice Aminuddin Khan, formally record their opposition to issuance of notices to the respondents, as they had dismissed the review petitions outright — which had been filed by the PML-N, PPP and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP),
The two judges indicated that they would later provide separate reasoning for their stance.
Although the hearing was adjourned until Wednesday, a revised cause list issued later in the day showed that Justice Ayesha and Justice Aqeel would no longer be part of the larger bench.
 
 

Consequently, the strength of the Constitutional Bench would be reduced from 13 to 11 members: Justices Aminud­din Khan, Jamal Khan Man­d­o­khail, Muhammad Ali Maz­har, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi.
“Since they have dismissed the reviews, there is no occasion for them to remain on the bench now,” observed a senior counsel on condition of anonymity. “They have given a final judgement, so they cannot sit on the bench.”
The bench also issued notices to Attorney General (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan under Section 27A of the CPC and ordered the ECP to furnish a reply by Wednesday on the contempt of court petition instituted by PTI leader Kanwal Shauzab for not implementing the July 12 judgement. Interestingly, the contempt of court case has been delisted and will not be heard on Wednesday.
After consulting the other judges, Justice Aminuddin began dictating the order amid heated arguments, which took the two judges by surprise.
In its July 12 short order, the Supreme Court, by a majority of eight to five, held that the 41 returned candidates out of a total of 80 MNAs were and are the returned candidates of the PTI and, therefore, members of the PTI’s Parliamentary Party in the National Assembly for all constitutional and legal purposes.
When senior counsel Sikan­dar Basheer Mohmand appea­red on behalf of the ECP, Jus­tice Ayesha questioned how the commission was aggrieved by the July 12 judgement and whether the review petition was maintainable without implementing the court’s earlier verdict. Justice Aqeel also inquired how the ECP was a party to the matter.
In response, the counsel pointed out that the initial hearing before the Supreme Court was not initiated as a public interest case but as an appeal against the order of the Peshawar High Court, as a result of which the commission was made a necessary party in the case, adding that the ECP had not approached the court on its own.
But Justice Ayesha questio­ned how the ECP could appear before the court without first implementing the majority decision of the Supreme Court, especially when the court had already interpreted the commission’s decision regarding PTI in its judgement.
Justice Hashim Kakar also wondered that when the July 12 judgment — whether delivered rightly or wrongly — had not been implemented, what guarantee was there that the decision of the present bench would be implemented.
The counsel, however, tried to explain that the judgement had been partially implemented, adding that the commission had also submitted additional grounds along with its review petition.
Justice Ayesha, however, questioned how the commission could decide which parts of the judgement to implement and which to disregard.
The counsel responded that the SC, through its July 12 judgement, had granted relief to a party that was not even before the court.
At this, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail questioned whether the court was sitting as an appellate forum, also clarifying that he was not interested in the present case specifically but was concerned about the powers of the Supreme Court. While acknowledging respect for the ECP as a constitutional body, Justice Mandokhail expressed regret over the direction in which the commission was taking the court.

Rocks and mounds have become visible in different parts of the reservoir, especially at the main storage site and the spillways, which speaks volume about the impacts of climatic changes and alarming water table reduction. If heavy rainfall does not occur within the next 10 to 15 days, the water level in the dam is expected to fall drastically to almost the dead level.
The authorities said the catchment area of the dam, which included Margalla Hills and Galiyat, had not received enough rain, worsening the situation.
The dam authorities feared that they would have to suspend water supply for irrigation purposes to the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa besides curtailing drinking water supply to Rawalpindi and Islamabad.

Officials say they would have to suspend supply for irrigation purposes besides curtailing drinking water supply to Rawalpindi, Islamabad

They said at present water in the reservoir was available only for about 35 days if there is no rainy spell in its catchment areas.
A Wapda official told Dawn on Tuesday that the water level at the dam was 1,935 above mean sea level (AMSL), which was just 25 feet higher than the dead level of 1,910 AMSL.
He said that due to the low rains in the dam’s catchment areas and persistent dry spell, springs in the catchment areas had dried up. The inflow wasrecorded on Tuesday at only 82 cusecs and the outflow 235 cusecs per day.
He added that 90 cusecs per day was being supplied to Capital Development Authority (CDA) and 6.18 cusecs to other civic bodies and small beneficiaries, including the University of Engineering and Technology Taxila. He said that 48 cusecs per day was also released to the KP irrigation department and 42 cusecs daily to Punjab for irrigation.
He said that due to the persistent situation, authorities had planned to suspend water supply to KP and Punjab for irrigation purposes next week.
On the other hand, Wasa has implemented a “Water Control Plan” to manage the crisis, which includes crackdowns on water theft, penalties for water bill defaulters, and restrictions on non-essential water use. Officials warned that without significant rainfall in the next 10 to 15 days, the water level could fall to critical level, possibly exacerbating the situation.
Wasa sources said that a water rationing plan had been prepared for implementation in the second half of May. Wasa Managing Director Mohammad Saleem Ashraf said the daily water demand in Rawalpindi had reached over 50 million gallons, but the supply stood at just 30 million gallons - creating a significant daily deficit of 20 million gallons.
The dam is situated near Potohar Plateau and the village of Khanpur in KP, about 40km from Islamabad and 15km from Haripur. The dam caters to domestic water supplies in Rawalpindi and Islamabad besides supplying water to the agricultural and industrial areas surrounding the twin cities.
