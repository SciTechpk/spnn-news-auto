The development comes as the ordinance was set to lapse in early March.
The rules were suspended in the Senate to take up the bill, which was moved by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, for immediate consideration.
The preamble of the bill, a copy of which is available with Dawn, stated that it was expedient to establish a dedicated virtual assets regulatory authority to licence, regulate and supervise virtual assets and virtual asset service providers to “ensure investor protection, transparency and market integrity in Pakistan”.
It further stated that it was necessary to provide a comprehensive legal framework to empower the said authority to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, proliferation financing and other illicit activities involving virtual assets, in accordance with international standards.
Regulatory authority
The bill provides for the establishment of the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority, envisioning it as an autonomous corporate body empowered to licence, regulate and supervise virtual asset service providers and issuers in the country.
Elaborating on the body’s functions, the legislation says it will “protect customers and investors and the integrity of Pakistan’s virtual asset markets by establishing and enforcing appropriate safeguards and conduct of business requirements, prudential and operational-resilience, risk-management standards, and measures to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit use of virtual assets”.
It shall also attract investment and encourage companies operating in the field of virtual assets to base their businesses in Pakistan.
Moreover, PVARA shall “promote responsible innovation, digital financial inclusion and the development of compliant virtual asset markets within a framework that manages risks and supports financial stability and market integrity”.
The body shall promote, develop, govern, and regulate the adoption, deployment, and scalable use of blockchain technology and distributed ledger technology across Pakistan, the bill further states.
The legislation also states that PVARA will coordinate with the Financial Monitoring Unit, National Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Authority and other relevant authorities, as well as law enforcement agencies, to combat money laundering, terrorist financing and other illicit activities associated with virtual assets, in accordance with the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2010, other applicable laws and international standards.
The regulatory body will also advise the government on “regulatory, supervisory, technical or emerging-risk matters relating to virtual assets, digital asset markets, tokenisation, stablecoin structures, blockchain, distributed ledger technology, cyber-risks or any matter connected with its mandate”.
The bill also authorises PVARA to devise “regulations, standards, directives, guidelines, handbooks and circulars, or any other instrument”, consistent with the objectives of the legislation and other applicable laws.
It will also be authorised to set risk-management, cybersecurity, data protection and technical standards and “issue, vary, suspend or revoke licences, approvals or directives under this Act and prescribe conditions for such actions”.
The bill further states that it may prescribe licencing conditions, eligibility criteria, renewal requirements and any additional obligations for those issued licences under the yet to be formalised PVARA law.
It will also be authorised to conduct on-site inspections and off-site monitoring of licencees and other entities to ensure compliance with this PVARA law and other relevant rules and regulations.
Moreover, the bill states, the body may also ensure compliance with “data protection, data governance and cyber security obligations by virtual asset service providers subject to supervisory follow-up”.
It will also be empowered to impose administrative sanctions in accordance with the provisions of the PVARA law and “levy such fees, charges and penalties as may be prescribed by rules” devised under this law.
PVARA will also operate regulatory sandboxes in a “transparent and accountable manner” and “enter into cooperation or mutual assistance arrangements with domestic and foreign regulators and law enforcement agencies to facilitate information sharing and coordinated action, including mutual recognition of regulations and licences”, the bill states.
It further details that the body will comprise a chairperson — who will be appointed by the federal government — two secretaries, from the law and finance ministries each, State Bank of Pakistan’s governor, Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan chairperson, National Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Authority chairman, Pakistan Digital Authority chairperson and two independent directors “with proven expertise and a strong track record possessing expertise relevant to virtual asset markets, digital technology and digital finance”.
The directors will also be appointed by the federal government.
“The members of the authority, other than ex-officio members, shall hold office for a term of three years and shall be eligible for one further term of three years,” the bill states.
Penalties
The bill states that “whoever, willfully, provides an unlicenced virtual asset service shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term up to five years, or with fine up to Rs50 million, or both”.
It adds that whoever conducts an initial virtual asset offering in contravention” of the rules and regulations established under the PVARA law shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term up to three years or with fine up to Rs25m or with both.
The bill also penalises market manipulation and insider trading.
It further states that “a virtual assets appellate tribunal shall be established and no court shall take cognisance of a legal dispute under this Act or the rules or regulations made thereunder to which the jurisdiction of the Virtual Assets Appellate Tribunal extends”.
The tribunal’s jurisdiction has been described as: “Any virtual asset service provider, licencee, or any other person aggrieved by an order of the PVARA may prefer an appeal before the Virtual Assets Appellate Tribunal within 30 days of the date on which the order was communicated.”
In July last year, the government had announced that President Asif Ali Zardari had approved the ‘Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025’ to establish an independent regulator for virtual assets and cryptocurrencies.
However, an official statement from the office of the state minister referred to it as the ‘Virtual Assets Act, 2025’, leading to confusion and concerns about why the draft law had not been moved to the National Assembly or Senate, as required for a bill to become an act of parliament.
The confusion was clarified later when the authorities confirmed to Dawn that the regulation was not an act of parliament but rather an ordinance, issued under Article 89 of the Constitution. The provision allows the president to issue an ordinance in urgent matters when both houses are not in session; such ordinances remain in effect for 120 days and do not require passage through the National Assembly and Senate.
In November last year, the Senate extended the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025, for another 120 days.</p><small>2026-02-27 19:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/27152510cbb47b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976140/ecp-again-suspends-notification-declaring-ppps-ali-hassan-zehri-winner-from-pb-21' target='_blank'><strong>ECP again suspends notification declaring PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri winner from PB-21</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday again suspended the victory notification of PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri, who contested the Balochistan Assembly PB-21 Hub constituency in the Feb 8, 2024, general elections.
The development comes a day after the electoral watchdog had declared Zehri the winner of PB-21.
“Pursuant to the order passed by the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad dated 26th February, 2026 […] whereby Mr. Ali Hassan Zehri was declared returned candidate from PB-21 Hub, are hereby suspended, till further orders,” said a notification by the ECP released on Friday.
The recounting saga
Originally, Balochistan Awami Party’s (BAP) Muhammad Saleh Bhootani, who had secured more than double the votes obtained by Zehri, was declared the winner in the constituency.
But, a recount at 39 polling stations two months after the Feb 8, 2024, general elections led to Zehri being declared the winner.
While the original count had not even declared him the runner-up, the recount not only got him the top spot but also pushed down Bhootani to the third spot. After the recount, the percentage of polled votes had also changed from 55.15 per cent to 58.48pc.
The significant change in the electoral figures was linked to a saga involving the arrest of five individuals from the strong room where the electoral record had been stored. They were allegedly found with three plastic bags containing fake ballot papers and were attempting to tamper with ballot papers on Feb 11, 2024, hours after the ECP ordered a recount at 39 polling stations for the first time.
Interestingly, the increase in the number of rejected votes exactly matched the decrease in the votes originally secured by BAP’s Bhootani.
The votes secured by Bhootani were reduced from 30,910 to 17,403, translating into a difference of 13,507. The number of rejected votes increased from 3,648 to 17,155, also a rise of 13,507.
Meanwhile, the number of polled votes jumped from 76,976 to 87,483, showing an increase of 10,507 votes. Of these, 9,854 were secured by Zehri originally, taking his total from 14,120 to 23,974.
A further 441 votes were added to the tally of Rajab Ali, the initial runner-up, keeping his position unchanged, while the remaining 212 votes were distributed among other candidates, except Bhootani.
Zehri was subsequently notified as the winner from PB-21 on Dec 19, 2024.
The ECP initially ordered a recount on Feb 11, 2024, but the process was marred by violence, arrests, and allegations of fake ballots. After multiple rounds of litigation, the Supreme Court on Nov 20, 2024, annulled all proceedings and directed the ECP to decide the matter afresh.
Despite this, the electoral watchdog on Dec 16, 2024, in a split 3-2 decision, upheld the recount and notified Zehri as the winner, prompting Bhootani to approach the Balochistan High Court and later the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
Earlier this month, the FCC suspended Zehri’s notification and directed the ECP to re-examine the pending requests for a recount.
In its judgment, the FCC observed: “Recounting is always allowed on the basis of some material establishing illegality and irregularity in the count, and the powers to recount should be exercised sparingly after satisfaction, on the basis of material or evidence, that there has been any inclusion or exclusion of ballot papers in the count.
“The sanctity of the ballot is sacrosanct and, therefore, should not be permitted to be violated on frivolous, vague or indefinite allegations not supported by adequate statements of detailed material facts. It should only be allowed to do full justice between the parties, without a roving inquiry aimed at fishing for material to declare the election void.”
Last week, Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail removed Zehri from the Sarfaraz Bugti-led provincial cabinet with immediate effect. Zehri had earlier submitted his resignation to the chief minister.
IHC issues notices on Bhootani’s plea
As the ECP kept the winner in the PB-21 constituency unchanged on Thursday, the IHC took up a plea filed by Bhootani against the ECP’s February 25 order.
Subsequently, the court noted in its written order that the petitioner had sought a declaration that the ECP’s Feb 25 was “illegal and unlawful”.
The petitioner further sought a direction to the ECP to uphold the election result as incorporated in Form-47 prepared after provisional consolidation, and also sought instructions for the returning officer to prepare Forms-48 and 49 accordingly, the order said.
Form-47 provides a detailed look at the number of votes cast and/or cancelled while Form-48 provides an insight into the number of votes cast for each candidate in a particular constituency. Form-49 is the official result of each constituency and candidate.
The IHC order further said that the petitioner’s counsel contended that the Feb 25 order, prima facie, was “illegal and was passed in clear violation of Section 95(6) of the Elections Act, 2017”.
The counsel argued that it was coram non judice (lacking proper authority) and that there was no reason or material available before the ECP to justify the order for recounting, the IHC noted.
Rather, the lawyer insisted, the ECP’s order was passed merely on the basis of a “hypothetical assumption”.
“Even otherwise, no reasons were recorded, which is mandatory under Section 95(6) of the Elections Act, therefore, the order, being coram non judice, is liable to be set aside,” the IHC order further quoted the lawyer as saying.
The counsel also argued that when the recounting order was issued, the ECP did not issue a proper notice to the petitioner, “and without affording an opportunity of hearing, passed the order in violation of Article 10-A of the Constitution”.
The counsel requested the court to issue notices to the respondents “with the direction to file their report and para-wise comments within fortnight”.
After issuing notices to the respondents, the court decided that the operation of the Feb 25 order shall remain suspended until the next hearing.

The development comes as several ‘drone attacks’ were reported from across part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Subsequently, during his press briefing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) chief Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry stated that Afghan forces attempted to use “rudimentary drones” to attack areas like Swabi and Abbottabad.
“However, the anti-drone system over there and the effective deployment took them out,” he said.
According to local reports, at least six people were injured in three drone attacks in Bannu, Swabi and Abbotabad.
In Bannu, a mosque in the Mirbaz Barkazai area was targeted by a quadcopter around Iftar, leaving five worshippers injured. The attack occurred in the evening, while people were inside the mosque breaking their fast.
The incident in Swabi, which occurred near a girls’ school, was one of the first reported incidents of a drone attack in the area. According to Assistant Superintendent of Police Muhammad (ASP) Numan, at least one schoolgirl was injured, while other children narrowly escaped.
The incident occurred in Pabbini, a village located in the mountainous region of Gadoon Amazai, when children were playing near the school. The school had closed early on account of Friday, and the injured girl, identified as Amna, had just stepped out when the drone struck.
ASP Numan said that the injured girl was taken to the hospital for treatment, while residents of the village gathered in large numbers at the site of the attack.
“It was a self-made drone that also contained explosives,” he told Dawn.
Meanwhile, in Abbotabad, no loss of life or property was reported when a drone flying over the cantonment area was brought down by forces around 1pm, the local DPO confirmed.
Ban on drone flying
In view of drones being used, ostensibly by Afghan Taliban forces, to stage attacks inside Pakistani territory, drone-flying has been banned across the country.
In a letter addressed to the chief secretaries of Punjab, Karachi, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan as well as the Islamabad chief commissioner, the interior ministry said, “It has been decided to impose an immediate ban on outdoor flying of quadcopters/ UAVs with immediate effect and until further orders.”
It added: “In this regard, the provincial governments are requested to ensure strict enforcement of said ban.”
Subsequently, the administrations of Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Sindh and Balochistan notified a comprehensive ban on flying UAVs of any sort, for different periods of time.
Punjab had already banned the flying of drones and UAVs in its jurisdiction for 30 days, starting on Wednesday.
The Islamabad administration banned the use of drones, phantoms and camcopters in the federal capital for a period of two months under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which can be extended for another two months.
The ban applies to everyone, except law enforcement agencies and the Islamabad administration.
A spokesperson for Gilgit-Baltistan police told Dawn that flying drones had been banned in all districts with immediate effect, on the orders of the interior ministry.
The region witnessed demonstrations in favour of the Pakistan Army, and security checking was also heightened following the skirmishes between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Home and Tribal Affairs Department issued a notification banning the use of drones, quadcopters and UAVs for one month, classifying it as a “direct or indirect threat and … potential risk to the lives and properties of citizens as well as infrastructure of the government”.
In a separate notification, the additional chief secretary of Sindh also imposed a similar restriction on the use of helicams, drones, UAVs and quadcopters for two months.
The ban, however, would not apply to law enforcement or intelligence agencies and would be enforced by local police.
The Balochistan home department also imposed an immediate and complete ban on the use, possession, and operation of drones, UAVs, quadcopters, camcopters, and other remote-controlled aerial devices across the province.
According to an official notification, the decision was taken in view of security concerns, including the potential use of such devices for surveillance, espionage, transportation of prohibited items and explosives, spreading fear and panic, and disrupting law and order.
The measure was described as necessary to safeguard public safety and protect sensitive installations, public gatherings, key personalities, and official convoys.

Syed Irfan Raza and Iftikhar A. Khan in Islamabad, Jamil Nagri in Gilgit, Manzoor Ali in Peshawar, Rashid Javed in Abbottabad, Muqaddam Ali Khan in Swabi and Muhammad Waseem Khan in Bannu contributed to this report.

New Zealand would have joined England in the knockouts with a win in their final Super Eights match and they scored 159-6 after opting to bat.
England lost wickets early and looked like they would be squeezed out at 117-6, needing 43 from the last three overs.
But Ahmed and Jacks took 22 off the 18th over from Glenn Phillips to turn the match on its head.
Ahmed blasted 19 off seven balls in his first T20 World Cup match alongside Jacks, who made an unbeaten 32 off 18, to see England to 161-6 with three balls to spare.
England will move on to a semi-final in Mumbai on Thursday against either India or the West Indies, who clash on Sunday to decide the final semi-final berth.
New Zealand now have to wait on the outcome of Saturday’s clash between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Kandy to know if they have qualified for a semi-final in Kolkata against South Africa.
Pakistan have an inferior run rate so they need to win by 64 runs or inside 13 overs to overtake the Kiwis and deny them a place in the final four. If Pakistan qualify, then the semi-final would be played in Colombo.







England used five spinners to bowl 16 of the 20 overs on a turning track.
The 2010 and 2022 champions had never bowled so many overs of spin before in a T20 international.
Jacks returned the best figures with 2-23, while Adil Rashid picked up 2-28 and is now England’s leading wicket-taker in the tournament with 11.
Rashid was complemented by fellow wrist spinner Ahmed, who was called up in place of Jamie Overton, and took a wicket with his first ball before finishing with 2-28 from three overs.
Glenn Phillips top scored with 39 off 28, including four fours and a six, while opener Tim Seifert scored 35.
Liam Dawson (1-32) and Jacob Bethell (0-13) were the other spinners employed by England.</p><small>2026-02-27 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/272202484b1db76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976202/un-nuclear-watchdog-report-says-iran-must-allow-inspections-points-at-isfahan-as-place-of-interest' target='_blank'><strong>UN nuclear watchdog report says Iran must allow inspections, points at Isfahan as place of interest</strong></a><br><p>The UN nuclear watchdog issued a confidential report on Friday urging Iran to let it inspect all its nuclear sites and pointing at Isfahan as a place of interest because of a new enrichment plant and near-bomb-grade uranium that was stored there.
The report was sent to members of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ahead of a quarterly meeting next week of its 35-country board, amid nuclear talks between the United States and Iran, the latest round of which was held on Thursday with no breakthrough.
Like previous IAEA reports, it could be used by Washington to support its argument that Tehran has not been transparent about its nuclear activities, at a time when US President Donald Trump has massed forces in the region and threatened new military action.
The United States and Israel bombed Iranian nuclear sites last June, and Iran has since refused to show what happened to its stockpile of highly enriched uranium or allow IAEA inspectors access to sites where enrichment took place.
“While the Agency acknowledged that the military attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities had created an unprecedented situation, it is critical for it to conduct verification activities in Iran without any further delay,” the report seen by Reuters said.
Indispensable and urgent
Allowing inspections was “indispensable and urgent”, it said.
It also said a successful outcome in the US-Iranian negotiations would have a “positive impact on the effective implementation of safeguards in Iran and the resolution of issues described in this report”.
The IAEA estimates that Iran had 440.9 kilogramme of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent before last year’s Israeli-US attacks — enough, if enriched further, for 10 nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA yardstick.
The agency and Western powers believe the bulk of that is still intact.
Washington wants Tehran to give it up.
The report provided new details about activity at Isfahan, where diplomats have said much of the Islamic Republic’s most highly enriched uranium has been stored in a tunnel complex that appears to have averted destruction last June.
For the first time, the report confirmed that material enriched to up to 20 pc and 60 pc had been kept there.
In satellite imagery, the IAEA had observed “regular vehicular activity around the entrance to the tunnel complex at Isfahan in which (uranium) enriched up to 20 pc and 60 pc U-235 … was stored,” it said.
The US-Israeli attacks are believed to have destroyed or badly damaged the three uranium enrichment sites known to have been operating at the time.
Shortly before Israel launched its attack, Iran said it was setting up a fourth enrichment plant in Isfahan, though the IAEA still does not know its precise location or whether it is operational, the report said.
“It is a matter of increasing concern that Iran has never provided the Agency with access to its fourth declared enrichment facility since it was first declared by Iran in June last year,” the report said.</p><small>2026-02-27 17:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/27212333b8aed29.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976198/lahore-court-dismisses-post-arrest-bail-plea-of-canadian-national-in-cybercrime-case' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore court dismisses post-arrest bail plea of Canadian national in cybercrime case</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A judicial magistrate at the district courts on Friday dismissed the post-arrest bail petition of a Canadian national pursuing doctoral research in Pakistan in a cybercrime case.
Magistrate Naeem Wattoo announced the decision while hearing the bail plea of Hamza Ahmad Khan, after arguments from the prosecution and defence.
Khan was booked by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) for targeting state institutions and leadership through “disseminating misinformation and disinformation” under sections 20 (offences against the dignity of a natural person), 24 (cyber stalking) and 26A (spoofing) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act.
During the proceedings, the investigating officer (IO) told the court that the suspect had been uploading “derogatory posts against the state functionaries and state institutions with the intention to harm the reputation of the state functionaries”.
On behalf of the petitioner, Advocate Asad Jamal argued that the suspect had been falsely implicated in the case.
He said the case was based on digital evidence, which required strict proof. He said that keeping the petitioner behind bars was unwarranted.
In the order, the judicial magistrate said, “Allegations of such derogatory and malicious campaigns directed against the heads of institutions of state and constitutional functionaries cannot be treated as trivial or casual matters.”
The order said that in the digital era, the dissemination of inflammatory content through social media platforms produced instantaneous and far-reaching consequences.
“Statements aimed at undermining the dignity and authority of state leadership have the potential to erode public confidence in constitutional institutions, fuel polarisation, create unrest and instability within the country,” it added.
The order maintained that these allegations required serious judicial consideration and could not be brushed aside lightly. While dismissing the bail plea, the magistrate said, “I am not inclined to extend the concession of bail to the accused.”
Hamza, who arrived in Pakistan on Feb 13 to pursue his doctoral thesis, went missing from Lahore on Feb 19. The police also registered a first  information report into his disappearance. However, on Feb 23, it emerged that he had been taken into custody by the NCCIA for posting anti-state content on social media platforms.</p><small>2026-02-27 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653279-six-nation-conference-in-warsaw-applauds-pakistans-crackdown-on-illegal-migration' target='_blank'><strong>Six-nation conference in Warsaw applauds Pakistan's crackdown on illegal migration</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes after Pakistan’s security forces launched an operation, dubbed Ghazab lil-Haq, against the Afghan Taliban after the latter launched unprovoked attacks along the border between both countries on Thursday.
According to the PMO handout, PM Shehbaz held a meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong at the Prime Minister’s House.
During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on regional and international issues of mutual interest, agreeing to maintain close coordination and consultation to contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region and beyond.







The statement said that PM Shehbaz underscored Pakistan’s resolve to “provide a secure and conducive environment for Chinese personnel, investments, and institutions in Pakistan“.
During the meeting, the prime minister reaffirmed the enduring all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China, characterised by deep mutual trust, ironclad friendship, and shared commitment to mutual support on core interests, it added.
The prime minister conveyed his warm greetings and best wishes to President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang, and the Chinese leadership and people, particularly on the occasion of the Chinese New Year, the handout said.
It stated: “He expressed appreciation for China’s consistent and steadfast support to Pakistan on economic, security, and developmental fronts, particularly through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which remains a flagship project of Belt and Road Initiative and a cornerstone of bilateral cooperation.”
While highlighting the importance of accelerating ongoing CPEC projects, the handout said the prime minister stressed the need to enhance cooperation in agriculture, IT, and mining and minerals.
The handout said that Ambassador Zaidong briefed PM Shehbaz on recent developments in China-Pakistan relations and conveyed the warm greetings from the Chinese leadership.
“He reiterated China’s firm support for Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and socio-economic development.”
China calls for Pakistan-Afghanistan ceasefire
Earlier on Friday, China had called for a ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan, adding it was talking to both sides to try to end clashes that have left Beijing “deeply concerned”.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said China was “deeply concerned about the escalation of the conflict” after Pakistan carried out air strikes in Afghanistan, including the capital Kabul.
China “calls on both sides to remain calm and exercise restraint… achieve a ceasefire as soon as possible, and avoid further bloodshed”, she told a regular press briefing.
“China has consistently mediated the conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan through its own channels and is willing to continue playing a constructive role in easing tensions.”
The ministry and China’s embassies in Pakistan and Afghanistan were “working with relevant parties in both countries on this matter”, she said.

“I want to make one thing clear: the oppressive Afghan Taliban regime has to make a clear choice. The choice is to choose between Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Baloch Liberation Army, Daesh, Al Qaeda, the terrorists and terrorist organisations and Pakistan,” he said while giving a briefing on security forces’ response to unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban on Thursday.
“They have to make this choice. It has been made clear by the government of Pakistan. It is not something new I am saying … They have to make this choice. Whether they choose terrorists and terrorism or Pakistan. We are clear … Let it be known that our choice is absolutely clear. It will always be Pakistan over everything,” he said.

 


“The Pakistan Army and the people of Pakistan have never hesitated in making any sacrifice for this choice and they never will,” he asserted.
At the outset of the briefing, the DG ISPR gave a breakdown of the security forces’ response.
“The Afghan Taliban regime, which is the master proxy of all these terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan … that master proxy … came into action last night … along with the terrorists of Fitna al Khawarij,” he said.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term that the state used for banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The DG ISPR said that Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khawarij opened fire and carried out physical raids on 53 locations along the Pak-Afghan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“This aggression was done by this master proxy in coordination, in collusion and in support of a terrorist organisation. That’s what happened last night,” he said.
Talking about Pakistan’s response to the aggression, he said: “We were ready.”
He said that Pakistan’s armed forces responded “immediately and effectively”, adding that the attack was repulsed at all 53 locations.
“They came with armed quadcopters [and] big and small weapons. We shot down their quadcopters and silenced their weapons,” he said.
He added that not only were the attacks effectively repulsed, but Pakistan, exercising self-defence, responded and gave a “befitting reply”.
Giving details of Operation Ghazab lil-Haq — which was launched in response to the attacks by Afghan Taliban — he said so far 274 Taliban regime personnel and khawarij had been killed and more than 400 were injured.
“Seventy-three posts of the Afghan Taliban along the Pak-Afghan border have been totally destroyed. Eighteen posts have been captured,” he said.
As per conservative estimates, 115 tanks, armoured vehicles, and artillery pieces of the Afghan Taliban forces had been destroyed, he said.
He further said that the headquarters and military installations — which were providing support to terrorist organisations and helped them plan — were targeted and hit.
In these airstrikes, 22 locations in Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia, Nangarhar, Khost, and Paktika were targeted, he said.
“All these targets were very carefully selected based on intelligence. They are military targets, and great care was exercised so that there is no civilian collateral damage,” he asserted.
He said that these targets included corps headquarters, brigade headquarters, battalion headquarters, sector headquarters, ammunition depots, logistics bases, and places providing shelter to terrorists and their supporters.
He further said that at several places, the “cowardly Afghan Taliban forces and the khawarij with them” not only fled but also abandoned the dead bodies of their accomplices, which had been “secured” in accordance with the Geneva protocols.
He said that 12 Pakistan Army soldiers had been martyred, while 27 were injured and one soldier was missing in action. He then played several video clips of the action undertaken against the Afghan Taliban.
He further stated that Afghan media and their proxies were floating lies on social media regarding the targeting of civilians.
“At no place was any civilian infrastructure targeted. These are all military targets. These are all the infrastructure from where Pakistan was attacked,” he asserted.

 


He also played a clip showing Pakistan Army soldiers taking down the Afghan flag and hoisting Pakistan’s flag at a checkpost along the Pak-Afghan border.
“The nation is proud of these soldiers who have rendered their lives, their sweat and their blood for the protection of the land and the honour of the people of Pakistan,” he said.
“Whether on ground or in the air, the armed forces of Pakistan gave an effective, immediate and brutal response; a well-deserved response to the terrorists and their facilitators,” he said.
He went on to say that the Afghan Taliban were threatening that they would respond to Pakistan.
“We saw that they also tried to use some rudimentary sort of drones for attacking Abbottabad and Nowshera. However, the anti-drone system over there and the effective deployment took them out,” he said.

 


He added that this “again showed” how Afghan Taliban had become a “master proxy”.
“It is difficult to distinguish where the Taliban regime ends and where the terrorism starts. The lines have blurred. Therefore, it is necessary to make it clear that if anyone tries to carry out any terrorist activity in Pakistan … its response will be given to terrorists, their guardians, and those who protect them. No place will be safe for them as we also have equal rights,” he said.
During the question-answer portion, the DG ISPR was asked about credible information pointing to India’s involvement in the recent attack.
“It is absolutely clear that Indian sponsorship, abettment and design are behind any terrorist incident in Pakistan. The base of the operation is… they use the area that is under the oppressive regime of the Afghan Taliban. So that is how they work.”
He further said: “Pakistan armed forces … are always vigilant.”
In response to another question, the DG ISPR said that the Afghan Taliban regime had signed the Doha accord and had made certain promises “while presenting a different face to the world”.
“They made promises in writing. They promised an inclusive government. Is there an inclusive government there? That women’s rights will be respected. Are women’s rights being respected there? Do they get equal opportunity?”
He said that the Afghan Taliban had also vowed that its territory would not be used for terrorism.
He said that while “clarity” regarding the Afghan Taliban did not exist before, it did now.
“We now have supreme clarity. Your civil leadership, your military leadership, your intelligentsia, your media, the children of this country; there is absolute clarity about what the Afghan Taliban regime is,” he said.
He said that the whole world was also saying the same.
“We are the bulwark state which is standing against this terrorism. It is not only Pakistan; the threat is to the whole region. Not to the whole region [but] to the whole world,” he said.
The DG ISPR said that “everyone understands” that the actions taken by Pakistan last night were in self-defence and for the safety of the people.
“Everyone understands that,” he said. He recalled clashes with Afghanistan in October last year, saying friendly countries had understood Pakistan’s stance at that time.
He further stated that the whole nation was united in the war against terrorism.
“Let there be no doubt — whatever political divisions we may have, whatever different political perspectives we may have; all political parties, all political leaderships are absolutely clear that no place can be given to terrorism and its facilitation in Pakistan,” he said.
He recalled the National Action Plan of 2014, saying that political parties were behind it.
“Since then, all political parties … have always respected, followed, and said yes to this revised NAP, which is now called vision Azm-i-Istehkam,” he said.
He also talked about Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, paying tribute to the province’s police force.
“Is there anyone who denies their sacrifices and martyrdom. [Is there anyone who] … is not standing with them. No one. The whole nation is together,” he said.
“I must take this opportunity to give our biggest homage to the very brave and proud police of KP, which are on the frontline,” he said, adding: “We are proud of them. The nation salutes them.”
In response to another question, the DG ISPR said that the number of Afghan Taliban operatives and terrorists killed was 274 as of now, but was “much higher”.
“I have said it earlier, that the distinction between the master proxy and terrorists … it has blurred,” he said, adding that they were acting “more or less” the same.
He further said that the operation against the Taliban regime was ongoing.
“The operation is continuing. It is under the instructions of the prime minister of Pakistan, the civil leadership. And we are achieving the desired results,” he said.
He reiterated that the Afghan Taliban regime “has to make a choice”.
“They have to choose between Pakistan, and the terrorists and terrorism. Our choice is absolutely clear. Our first and last choice is Pakistan, its security, and the protection of its people,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-27 16:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653289-pakistans-mahnoor-omer-named-among-times-women-of-the-year-2026' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's Mahnoor Omer named among TIME's Women of the Year 2026</strong></a><br><p>

The statement came in the aftermath of Pakistan launching Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban after “unprovoked firing” from across the border overnight.
In its statement, the FO said that Pakistan’s actions came in response to “repeated terrorist attacks by Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan against Pakistan emanating from Afghan soil, as well as the latest unwarranted and provocative actions by the Taliban regime”.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Fitna al Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.







It said that the armed forces carried out “precise operations, inflicting heavy losses on terrorist outfits and targeting their logistical support bases in Afghanistan” on the night of February 26.
The statement maintained that the actions taken by Pakistan were “in exercise of its right to self-defence and to ensure the safety and security of its citizens, as well as that of the wider region and beyond”.
It warned the Afghan Taliban regime and terrorist groups against “any further provocations” in attempts to “undermine the security and welfare of the people of Pakistan”, stating that they will be met with “a measured, decisive and befitting response”.
The FO reiterated Pakistan’s desire for “peace and stability” in the region, adding that the country had “remained patiently engaged in political and diplomatic efforts aimed at addressing the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil”.
“However, it is unfortunate that Pakistan’s numerous goodwill gestures and highly responsible approach were misconstrued, resulting in increased terrorist attacks from Afghan soil, with the active support and backing of the Taliban regime, as well as India,” the statement read.
The FO reaffirmed Pakistan’s “strong resolve and determination” towards eliminating terrorism emanating from the Afghan soil.
It also called upon the “Afghan regime to end the impunity with which Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan continue to operate from Afghan soil”.
It expressed the faith that the international community will “play its role in sending a clear message to the Taliban regime that it must not continue to renege on its obligation to take concrete and verifiable action against these terrorist outfits and end its support for them”.
The statement reiterated that Pakistan held the right to “take all appropriate actions in its self-defence and to protect its citizens in accordance with international law, including the UN Charter”.</p><small>2026-02-27 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/271928427bfe7ae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976179/t20-world-cup-india-aim-for-fearless-cricket-ahead-of-west-indies-showdown' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: India aim for ‘fearless cricket’ ahead of West Indies showdown</strong></a><br><p>India revived their T20 World Cup campaign with their “fearless” brand of cricket ahead of a winner-takes-all decider against the West Indies for the last semi-final berth.
Hot favourites to defend their title on home soil, India thrashed Zimbabwe by 72 runs in Chennai on Thursday to bounce back from their heavy defeat against South Africa in their Super Eights opener.
India’s batting, led by opener Abhishek Sharma’s blistering 55 and an unbeaten 50 by Hardik Pandya, piled up 256-4, the second-highest total in the history of the tournament.
In a brutal show of power hitting, the Indian batters demolished the opposition bowling with 17 sixes and 17 fours at the M.A. Chidambaram Stadium.
India face the West Indies, who went down to South Africa by nine wickets, in Kolkata on Sunday to decide the second semi-finalist from Group 1.
“We want to play fearless cricket, the brand of cricket we played today and we played since last year,” batter Tilak Varma said.
“The same intent we want to keep in the next game as well. And going ahead in the tournament, we take the same intensity (forward).”
The left-handed Varma hit a 19-ball 44 as he put together an unbeaten 84-run stand with Pandya, who capped off the innings with two sixes to raise his fifty.
It all came together for India after they rejigged their opening combination with the return of Sanju Samson, who handed the team a quick start with his 24 off 15 balls.
The left-handed Abhishek hit form with his first T20 World Cup fifty after he struggled in the tournament with three ducks in four innings.
“It’s important when the openers give us a good start, the same confidence follows to number three, four and five,” said Varma.
“And we discussed that whatever the situation is, (even) if we lose three-four wickets in powerplay, we will bat with the same rhythm,” he added.
“And we want to show the fear in opposition bowlers, that these guys are ready to hit each and every ball.”
‘Keep that intensity’
India, the world’s top-ranked T20 team, came into the World Cup on the back of huge totals in bilateral contests and was tipped to cross the 300-run mark at the tournament.
But their batting had looked fragile and was often exposed, including by minnows the United States, who reduced them to 77-6 in their opener.
Varma remains cautious of his team’s plans against the West Indies, who posted 254-6 against Zimbabwe in their Super Eights opener.
“So if the wicket is not good, then we’ll adjust, and we’ll keep that intensity on,” said Varma.
“I would not say we want to score more than 250 — but if we get a good start, then of course we’ll go for it.”
The Indian bowling has looked good.
On Thursday, left-arm quick Arshdeep Singh returned figures of 3-24 to limit Zimbabwe to 184-6.
He surpassed senior paceman Jasprit Bumrah as the leading bowler for India at the T20 World Cup with 35 wickets to Bumrah’s 33.
“We have been doing well for the past couple of years, so even after a blip or a defeat, the belief of the group was there,” Arshdeep told reporters.
“We knew we just had to come and follow our processes, and the result will come our way. So the thought was very simple and we are enjoying it.”
The 2024 champions have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side has ever won the trophy on home soil.</p><small>2026-02-27 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/271808409bb67cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976164/senate-passes-resolution-condemning-unprovoked-afghan-taliban-aggression-calls-on-kabul-to-cease-hostile-acts' target='_blank'><strong>Senate passes resolution condemning unprovoked Afghan Taliban aggression, calls on Kabul to cease hostile acts</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The upper house of Parliament on Friday unanimously adopted a resolution that condemned the unprovoked aggression by the Afghan Taliban, and demanded that the neighbouring country immediately cease all hostile actions and prevent the use of its soil for terrorism or aggression against Pakistan
The House, through the resolution moved by PPP Parliamentary Leader Sherry Rehman, condemned the recent unprovoked aggression and hostile cross-border actions from Afghanistan, describing them as blatant violations of international law, established diplomatic norms, and the principles of peaceful neighbourly relations.
The Senate declared that any attempt to challenge the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or national security of Pakistan constituted a direct affront to the dignity of the nation and would be met with a firm, proportionate, and decisive response.
“For over forty years, Pakistan has borne extraordinary economic, social, and security burdens in hosting millions of Afghan nationals, extending humanitarian assistance, facilitating peace efforts, and consistently advocating for Afghanistan’s stability in international forums often at immense cost to its own national development and internal security,” it said.
It expressed deep disappointment that instead of reciprocal goodwill, Pakistan continued to face hostile rhetoric, cross-border violations, and the persistent presence of anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil, reflecting a troubling pattern of ingratitude and disregard for bilateral understandings.
“While Pakistan remains committed to constructive engagement, regional peace, and mutually respectful relations, its patience must not be misconstrued as weakness, nor its desire for stability mistaken for inability to respond decisively,” the resolution said.
It demanded that the Afghan Taliban regime immediately cease all hostile actions, prevent the use of Afghan soil for terrorism or aggression against Pakistan, and honour their international obligations and commitments to peaceful coexistence.
The Senate also called upon the international community to take serious note of these developments and to urge the Afghan Taliban regime to adhere to international norms and prevent further destabilisation of the region.
Speaking in the Senate, Rehman said that Pakistan had exercised maximum restraint and upheld all diplomatic avenues, but recent hostile actions from Afghan soil had compelled the state to respond within the framework of the international law.
“The agreements that the Afghan Taliban signed in Doha have now been forgotten. Everyone can see the level of adherence to the commitments made in the presence of important stakeholders,” she remarked.
She emphasised that “Pakistan did not close the door on diplomacy at any stage, but was forced to respond”.
“Under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, every country has the right to defend itself,” she said.
“A fundamental question before Afghanistan is whether it accepts responsibility for its own territory or not.”
She strongly rejected the mischaracterisation of Pakistan’s defensive measures.
Meanwhile, PTI Parliamentary Leader Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said, “Pakistan always comes first and that the entire Pakistani nation stands united against terrorism.”
He further stated: “In case of aggression, the nation has both the right and the resolve to respond decisively in defence of its sovereignty.”
Senator Zafar said that since the birth of Pakistan, two countries — India and Israel had tried to damage it.
“These two nations came together and decided a long time ago that they would use Afghanistan’s soil to destabilise Pakistan,” he said.
“Today, two well-known criminals of the world, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have again gotten together,” he said.
“One is committing genocide in Gaza while the other is committing genocide in occupied Kashmir. Both have declared that they will use Afghan soil for their nefarious designs against Pakistan,” he stated.
“If any country commits terrorism on Pakistani soil, then it deserves full and mighty retaliation. No aggressor can be spared,” he said.
He said the Senate should use its collective wisdom and go beyond merely passing resolutions and propose practical regional long-term solutions.
“This is the Senate’s real job,” he added.
Senator Zafar also suggested establishing a permanent regional body, comprising neighbouring and regional stakeholder states, like China, to ensure compliance with a collective security framework addressing terrorism emanating from Afghanistan.
Such a mechanism, he said, would facilitate coordinated regional action, intelligence sharing, and monitoring of counter-terrorism commitments to effectively address cross-border security threats.
He also cited Article 4, which guarantees protection of law and due process, and Article 9, which protects the right to life and liberty.
Speaking on PTI founder’s health, Senator Zafar said, “The life, health, safety and release of former premier Imran are matters of paramount importance for the entire nation.
“The issues affecting Imran’s health directly relate to his right to life,” he said.
Senator Zafar emphasised that it was the state’s constitutional obligation to ensure the proper medical treatment and well-being of a former prime minister.
Addressing Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah’s calls for political dialogue, Senator Zafar said that meaningful dialogue required the government to fulfil its constitutional obligations first by allowing the PTI founder’s trusted doctors and legal representatives to be involved in his medical treatment.
“If the government maintains that proper treatment was already being provided, there should be no objection to permitting independent doctors chosen by Imran to participate in the process, particularly at a time when national unity is essential,” he said.
What is wrong with this request?” he asked.
Zafar stressed that adherence to constitutional principles, protection of fundamental rights, and national unity were essential for effectively confronting terrorism and safeguarding Pakistan’s future.</p><small>2026-02-27 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2719204503020f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976173/petrol-diesel-prices-likely-to-rise-by-rs7-for-next-fortnight' target='_blank'><strong>Petrol, diesel prices likely to rise by Rs7 for next fortnight</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The prices of all petroleum products were estimated to increase by Rs4.50 to Rs7 per litre on Saturday for the next fortnight ending March 15, owing to a slight upward trend in the international market.
Official sources said the benchmark crude prices had slightly moved up this week in view of regional tensions. Therefore, the price of all products, including petrol, high speed diesel (HSD), kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) were inching up and set to significantly impact the pricing pattern on February 28 for the following fortnight.
Based on existing tax rates, the sources said the ex-depot prices of petrol, HSD, LDO and kerosene had been estimated to go up by about Rs4.50 per litre, Rs4.70, Rs7, and Rs5 per litre, respectively, depending on final calculations on Saturday.
The ex-depot petrol price set by the government currently stands at Rs258.17 per litre but is sold at more than Rs259.30 per litre at retail stations. The official prices for HSD currently stands at Rs275.70 but is sold in the retail market on the higher side of Rs277 per litre.
The kerosene and LDO rates currently stand at Rs180.53 and Rs161.72 per litre, respectively. However, kerosene oil is nowhere sold below Rs300 per litre in the open market.
Together with customs duty, the petroleum levy and the climate support levy, the government is currently charging about Rs105 per litre taxes on petrol and about Rs98 on HSD.
Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of the middle and lower-middle class.
While the heavy transport sector runs on HSD, its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Besides the petroleum levy, the government is also charging about Rs17-18 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000–800,000 tonnes compared to just 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.
The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470tr during the current fiscal year.</p><small>2026-02-27 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653266-taliban-regime-seeks-dialogue-after-pakistan-inflicts-heavy-losses-in-borde' target='_blank'><strong>Taliban regime seeks dialogue after Pakistan inflicts heavy losses in border clashes</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes after Pakistan’s security forces launched an operation, dubbed Ghazab lil-Haq, against the Afghan Taliban after it launched unprovoked attacks along the border between both countries on Thursday.
According to a handout by the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz said that zero tolerance should be adopted against the nexus between the Afghan Taliban and Fitna al Khwarij and its malicious actions.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
“The actions of the Afghan Taliban regime and Fitna al Khawarij against Pakistan are unacceptable,” he said.







He added that the country’s armed forces, under the leadership of Chief of Defence Forces Asim Munir, were always ready to defend the country.
“Pakistan knows how to defend itself against any aggression,” he asserted.
The premier also praised the professional capabilities of the armed forces for repelling attacks by the Afghan Taliban regime in the border areas and for retaliating vigorously.
“The entire nation stands with the armed forces for protecting the homeland,” he said.</p><small>2026-02-27 12:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653253-over-270-taliban-regime-personnel-terrorists-killed-in-pakistans-retaliatory-response-ispr-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Over 270 Taliban regime personnel, terrorists killed in Pakistan's retaliatory response: ISPR chief</strong></a><br><p>

However, the visuals are doctored.
The iVerify Pakistan team investigated this content and determined that it is false.
To reach this conclusion, iVerify Pakistan analysed the visuals for discrepancies, verified aircraft serial records and ran the content through multiple AI-detection tools.
Multiple Indian and Afghan users on social media platform X shared visuals on February 27, claiming that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet amid the current conflict between the two countries. However, the visuals are doctored.
Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban, after the neighbouring country opened fire on multiple locations across the border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on February 26.
Authorities in Kabul had called it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend.
On Feb 27, a pro-Afghan account shared an alleged video showing a downed Pakistani F-16 engulfed in flames on X with the following caption: “Big breaking news. This is a Pakistani military F-16, American-made, that Afghan defensive forces have shot down.”
The post gained 773,700 views.







The video with similar claims was subsequently shared by other propaganda — both pro-Afghan and pro-Indian — accounts, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here.
These accounts also shared still images of the alleged fighter jet.
A pro-Afghan account shared the image with the following caption: “Security sources reported that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani jet that had entered Afghan territory. Security sources have confirmed this news to several media outlets.”
That post gained 257,600 views.







Other shares can be seen here, here, here and here.
Another video of the same downed F-16 aircraft was also shared on X with the following caption: “Here’s his latest video.”
The post gained 80,200 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the current conflict between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
A keyword search was conducted to corroborate whether any credible mainstream international or Pakistani media outlets had reported any such alleged downing of an F-16 jet, but yielded no results.
A close analysis of the viral videos and images revealed discrepancies in the aircraft’s markings.
The serial number visible on the tail of the jet in the viral video is “85510”. The same serial number is also printed on the body of the aircraft in the viral video, whereas the body of the original F-16 aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) does not contain any serial number.
Additionally, the size and proportions of the aircraft appear inconsistent when compared to verified images of an F-16.



Furthermore, in the viral video, a structure appears to be protruding from the tail of the aircraft and sits above the exhaust. However, upon closer inspection of actual F-16 aircraft images, this particular feature is noticeably absent, with the exhaust instead jutting out from the body.



Running the video through multiple AI-detection tools flagged it as being AI-generated. Attestiv.video gave it a 61 per cent suspicion rate, while AI or Not indicated the video was 70pc AI-generated and flagged the text in the video as 100pc AI-generated.









When iVerify Pakistan contacted a Pakistan Air Force officer for comment, they too identified key discrepancies about the viral F-16 aircraft video and said the exhaust appeared disproportionately large compared to genuine F-16 models.
The officer also said that the tail number did not match any existing F-16 aircraft in the air force.
Contacted for comment, Dawn news editor Ali Osman said the jet’s dimensions were “distorted”, adding that the burn marks on the tail fin also looked irregular.
A search of aircraft records on the f-16.net database shows that the serial number “85510” belongs to a United States F-16 aircraft that crashed in Arizona in 1990.
The viral circulating image was also analysed using AI-detection tools, with Fake Image Detector flagging it as computer-generated or modified.



The image presents the same discrepancy of a protruding part above the jet’s exhaust, unlike what a real jet looks like. The serial number is different as well, showing “85610” instead of “85510”.
The image also features a random and unexplained grey block at the top.
The second video of the same alleged crash was also analysed via Attestiv.video, which returned an 83pc suspicion rate.



It also presented the inconsistency of a different serial number from the first video. Moreover, the flames and smoke clouds in the video also appeared unnatural and looked inconsistent.



Therefore, the fact check determined that the claim that viral visuals show a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet allegedly shot down by Afghanistan amid the current conflict between the two countries is false. The visuals are doctored, as evidenced by being flagged by AI-detection tools, and present numerous discrepancies from what an actual F-16 jet looks like.

Spot gold edged down 0.1 per cent to $5,181.18 per ounce by 08:37 GMT. The metal has climbed 6.5pc so far in February, bringing gains for the seven months to a whopping 58pc.
US gold futures for April delivery were up 0.1pc at $5,198.10.
The benchmark 10-year yield fell to a three-month low on the day, decreasing the opportunity cost of holding non-interest-paying gold.
“There are two things (supporting gold). First is the tariff uncertainty which is there in the market right now, and on the other hand, the Iran and the US situation,” said ANZ analyst Soni Kumari.
The United States and Iran held indirect talks in Geneva on Thursday over their long-running nuclear dispute, with the Omani mediator saying the two sides had made progress.
They plan to resume negotiations with technical-level discussions scheduled next week in Vienna.
“The latest rounds of talks have not produced a clear outcome, leaving geopolitical risks present but not escalating. This has kept gold at elevated levels, though it has not yet provided sufficient momentum to establish a sustainable bullish trend,” said Linh Tran, Senior Market Analyst at XS.com.
The US began collecting a temporary new 10pc global import tariff on Tuesday. However, the rate will rise to 15pc for some countries, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has said.
On the data front, the number of Americans filing new applications for jobless benefits increased slightly last week, but the unemployment rate was steady in February.
Spot silver rose 1.7pc to $89.87 per ounce, and was headed for a 6.2pc gain on the month.
Spot platinum climbed 4.1pc to $2,365.33 per ounce, a four-week high, while palladium gained 2.1pc to $1,821.28.</p><small>2026-02-27 12:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/27141124fd74832.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976130/sc-objects-to-ptis-plea-seeking-imrans-transfer-to-hospital-of-his-choice' target='_blank'><strong>SC objects to PTI’s plea seeking Imran’s transfer to hospital of his choice</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Friday raised objections to a plea seeking the transfer of PTI founder Imran Khan to a hospital.
The application was filed by PTI lawyer Sardar Latif Khosa on February 25, pursuant to Order XXXV Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules 2025, after Imran underwent government-facilitated follow-up treatment for his eye ailment.
PTI lawyers Khosa, along with Naeem Panjotha, appeared before SC Chief Justice Yahya Afridi on Friday, seeking the scheduling of PTI’s application.
However, CJP Afridi told the lawyers that the “application was returned with objections a day earlier”.
“Your petitions will remain pending until further orders,” he said to the lawyers.
“There is no such application at the moment, on which proceedings can be held,” he added.
Khosa informed CJP Afridi that the PTI counsels had requested an early hearing, adding that the court had ordered the former premier’s treatment.
At this, CJP Afridi said that the court had not issued an order; rather, it was the government that had given assurances for the treatment.
“You should read the court’s decision again as the health issue is not pending,” CJP Afridi remarked.
Khosa informed the court that the transfer application was made “not on legal or political but humanitarian grounds”. In response to this, CJP Afridi held that the former premier’s recent medical check-up was carried out on “humanitarian grounds”.
“Please try to understand what I am saying,” Khosa insisted, at which Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan remarked, “I have known you since 1992, I understand everything you are saying”.
“Khosa sahib, you are a senior lawyer, you understand the procedure,” the CJP said, directing Khosa to meet the SC registrar.
“If the SC registrar does not give a copy of the objections, then you may come to court,” CJP Afridi said.
“If the order was issued yesterday, then how did no one inform us?” Khosa said.
As per a source, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan also met CJP Afridi and sought the transfer of the incarcerated former premier to a hospital, citing family and party concerns about his health.
However, he was told that SC would not interfere while his cases remained pending before the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
Imran’s health, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
According to a doctor at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Imran was brought to the hospital for follow-up treatment on February 24.
However, his party took exception to the government’s “secrecy” regarding the treatment.
Meanwhile, the application, available with Dawn, was filed on behalf of Imran and named the Islamabad district election commissioner as the respondent, as it invoked the Toshakhana case in which the PTI founder was first arrested on Aug 5, 2023.
The plea had requested the SC that Imran be “immediately shifted to Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, for proper treatment of his eyes from [a] retina specialist”.
The plea also sought Imran’s access to his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf, “who may be associated with all the procedures of examination and treatment”.
In his application, Khosa highlighted that Imran was 73 years old, adding that “his advancing age and declining health are matters of grave concern not only for his family but for the people of Pakistan at large”.
“The conduct of a medical examination in secrecy, without notice to the family or independent doctors, has given rise to serious apprehensions,” he contended.</p><small>2026-02-27 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2715035788dc13a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976137/iran-urges-us-to-drop-excessive-demands-to-reach-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Iran urges US to drop ‘excessive demands’ to reach deal</strong></a><br><p>Iran said on Friday that in order to reach a deal, the United States will have to drop its “excessive demands”, tempering the optimism expressed after talks seen as a last-ditch bid to avert war.
The Oman-mediated talks follow repeated threats from US President Donald Trump to strike Iran, and with the United States conducting its biggest military build-up in the region in decades.
Trump, on February 19, gave Iran 15 days to reach a deal, and while Iran has insisted the discussions focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran’s missile programme and its support for armed groups curtailed.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Trump’s negotiating team would demand that Iran dismantle its three main nuclear sites and hand over all its remaining enriched uranium to the United States.
Without specifying what demands he was referring to, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Friday told his Egyptian counterpart that “success in this path requires seriousness and realism from the other side and avoidance of any miscalculation and excessive demands”.
Following the talks in Geneva on Thursday, Araghchi told state TV that the negotiations “made very good progress and entered into the elements of an agreement very seriously, both in the nuclear field and in the sanctions field”.
He said the next round would take place in “perhaps less than a week”, with technical talks at the UN’s nuclear agency to begin in Vienna on Monday.
Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi also announced technical discussions were to be held next week in Vienna.
“We have finished the day after significant progress in the negotiation between the United States and Iran,” he said in a post on X.







Araghchi, in a post on X, called the latest round of talks “the most intense so far”.
“It concluded with the mutual understanding that we will continue to engage in a more detailed manner on matters that are essential to any deal — including sanctions termination and nuclear-related steps,” he wrote.







UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi joined the negotiations, a source close to the talks told AFP.
‘Big lies’
US President Donald Trump said in his State of the Union address that Iran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”.
He also accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes.
The accusations were delivered in the same forum in which then-President George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.
The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”.
On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that Iran is “not enriching right now, but they’re trying to get to the point where they ultimately can”, adding that Tehran “refuses” to discuss its ballistic missile programme and “that’s a big problem”.
Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic Republic was not “at all” seeking a nuclear weapon.
US Vice President JD Vance told the Washington Post on Thursday there was “no chance” that a long-threatened strike on Iran would result “in a Middle Eastern war for years with no end in sight”.
Parallel to the talks is a dramatic US military buildup in the region, with the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week.
Washington currently has more than a dozen warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier — the USS Abraham Lincoln — nine destroyers, and three other combat ships.
It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers in the region.
The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed.
However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000 km — less than a third of the distance to the continental United States.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that the US briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
In January, Tehran launched a mass crackdown on nationwide protests. Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.</p><small>2026-02-27 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2714544101f8822.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976128/where-do-pakistan-afghanistan-go-from-here' target='_blank'><strong>Where do Pakistan, Afghanistan go from here</strong></a><br><p>When states escalate, they are usually clear about their capacity and objectives. The Afghan Taliban, however, appeared to abandon that principle at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border last night, triggering an intense military confrontation — including airstrikes and artillery exchanges — across the Durand Line as well as deep into Afghan territory.
The immediate backdrop of these tensions is not new. Islamabad has for years maintained that the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), a Pakistani terrorist group affiliated with the Afghan Taliban, operated from Afghan soil because of the official patronage it enjoys there.
Only hours before the latest crisis erupted, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi plainly stated that Pakistan’s quarrel was not with the Afghan people but with terrorist safe havens that threaten Pakistani lives.







That was the political setting; it emphasised the need for patient engagement and discreet signalling. The Afghan Taliban, however, chose to announce what it described as “large-scale offensive operations” along multiple border towns, in a language that was both public and declaratory.
A miscalculation by Kabul?
There may have been reasons why the Taliban regime opted for that course. Firstly, the border remains, in the Afghan political imagination, a colonial imposition.
Secondly, the Taliban leadership sought to signal that it would not acquiesce to cross-border action, especially after Islamabad’s February 22 strikes against terrorist sanctuaries on the Afghan territory, and frame the move as a defence of territorial integrity.
However misplaced that logic may be, given that the initial breach of Afghan sovereignty occurred when terrorist groups were allowed sanctuary there, the public mobilisation still serves a domestic purpose as it projects resolve to constituencies that expect the regime to defend Afghan soil.
Another calculation may have been that the escalation would remain contained. There is precedent. In October last year, after intense clashes, back channels and Qatari-Turkiye mediation produced a ceasefire. Though the understanding was uneasy, it worked. Kabul may have assumed that another round of tit-for-tat exchanges would similarly be cooled by intermediaries once tempers had flared.
But that assumption proved risky.
Pakistan responded not with ambiguity but with a named operation — “Ghazab lil-Haq” or “Righteous Fury” — and carried out airstrikes that reached deep into Afghan territory, including targets around Kabul, Kandahar, Paktia and Nangarhar. Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif spoke in unusually blunt terms, saying patience had reached its limit and characterised the situation as open war.







Pakistan’s logic was clear. Terrorism inside the country surged after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan in August 2021, and even more sharply over the past year and a half. As a result, there is zero tolerance in Islamabad for threats perceived to be emanating from Afghan soil. In that context, a declared offensive by Afghan forces against Pakistani positions was unlikely to go unanswered because any perception of restraint in the face of a televised provocation would have carried both morale and political costs.
Resultantly, there was a spiral which neither side could easily control. Casualty figures differ widely, with claims and counterclaims dominating the official messaging.
Beyond the battlefield
But far from the borders and the war zones lies the question of strategic arithmetic. The Taliban’s strengths are rooted in unconventional and guerrilla-style warfare, whereas Pakistan’s advantages lie in its conventional force structure, air power and deterrent capability.
It implies that a head-on military contest would therefore never favour Kabul. That is where the Taliban appear to have misstepped; by shifting the theatre from deniable sub-conventional activity to overt interstate confrontation, they exposed themselves to costs they were ill-equipped to absorb.
Yet, force alone will not settle the underlying grievance. Islamabad’s central complaint is neither territorial expansion nor ideological contest; rather, it is the presence of terrorists who strike inside Pakistan while operating from Afghan soil.

 

The concern is not merely rhetorical. Year after year, United Nations Security Council monitoring reports have documented the continued presence and activity of the TTP in Afghanistan and described linkages between the group and the Taliban regime. The international record, therefore, is also clear.
Now that the issue is terrorist sanctuaries, the remedy cannot be spectacle. It has to be structural.
First, Kabul will need to address, credibly and verifiably, the question of armed groups operating from its soil; mere denials will not suffice.
Secondly, regional stakeholders with access to both capitals should be re-engaged at senior levels.Qatar and Saudi Arabia facilitated de-escalation in October last year. They are trying again. Others with leverage, including China and Turkey, can play quiet roles. Russia and Iran, too, have offered their good offices.
Third, both sides must reduce the temperature of public rhetoric since declarations of open war may satisfy domestic audiences but would complicate compromise, which has to ultimately happen.

 

There is no gainsaying the fact that there are no simple exits in such scenarios. Escalation acquires its own momentum, and each strike invites a reply, narrowing the space for discretion. As a result, economies suffer, border communities absorb the shock, and terrorist groups thrive.
For durable security, Islamabad must convert its battlefield advantage into diplomatic leverage rather than allow it to harden into permanent hostility. Meanwhile, this conflict must drive home to Kabul that a policy of hosting terrorist sanctuaries carries strategic costs.
If that lesson is not absorbed, what is now a crisis will solidify into a recurring pattern, and hostility will become entrenched.

The minister made the statement while addressing a meeting of the executive committee of the Organisation of Islamic Council (OIC) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.
The meeting was taking place against the backdrop of the Israeli government approving a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the occupation of the territory in 1967.
Addressing the meeting, the foreign minister took note of the “latest illegal measures taken by Israel to convert areas of the occupied West Bank into so-called state property”, stressing that Israel’s actions reflected “an annexationist and expansionist mindset bereft of any regard for international law or humanitarian norms”.
At the outset of his address, Dar highlighted the continued ceasefire violations committed by Israel, its expansion of illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank and annexation attempts, which he maintained posed a threat to any “prospect for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East”.
He recalled that in September 2025 at the UN General Assembly (UNGA), “leaders and foreign ministers of a group of eight Islamic countries, including Pakistan, engaged with the president of the US to end the bloodshed in Gaza and [..] secure a permanent and sustainable ceasefire and advance a comprehensive peace process with Palestinian brothers and sisters”.
He further recalled that during the consultation held, the group of eight countries was “given assurances that annexation of the West Bank will not take place”.
However, the minister told the moot that “on the ground, Israel continues with brazen impunity to expand illegal settlements”.
He maintained that Israel’s actions amounted to a violation of “international law, the UN Charter, and the UN Security Council Resolution 2803”.
“These violations embolden further aggression, erode regional stability and trample the rights and dignity of Palestinians,” he added.
Dar called on the international community to “act decisively” to halt the violations being committed by Israel, and “uphold international law, as well as ensure delivery of the assurances made” in September 2025.
He recalled that a joint statement was issued along with eight other Islamic countries, which Dar said, “clearly highlighted our shared concern on Israel’s continued violation of the ceasefire and attempts to impose unlawful sovereignty, expand settlements, and enforce a new legal and administrative reality in the occupied West Bank”.
The foreign minister reiterated that “Pakistan remains fully engaged as part of the group of eight other Islamic countries to secure a permanent and sustainable ceasefire, immediate start of the reconstruction and a credible time-bound political pathway towards an independent Palestinian state”.
Dar vowed that Pakistan will continue to “remain at the forefront in advancing the Palestinian cause”.
He outlined that the OIC member needed to “collectively ensure the immediate reversal of all Israeli measures aimed at the de facto annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory, including the occupied West Bank”.
He also called for the “protection of holy sites, including Al Aqsa Mosque”, as well as the “an immediate end to displacement (of Palestinians) and demographic manipulation”.
Dar stressed the need for the “full implementation” of the UNSC resolution 2803.
The foreign minister called for the immediate “reconstruction and recovery of Gaza with full Palestinian ownership” and “accountability for war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law”.
Recalling the recent statement made by US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, suggesting he would not be opposed to Tel Aviv taking over large swathes of the Middle East, the foreign minister maintained that such statements were “ irresponsible, deeply concerning and condemnable”.
“At a time when initiatives such as the Board of Peace and the Comprehensive Plan to end the Gaza conflict [..] seek to chart a credible political horizon, remarks of this nature directly contradict those objectives and weaken collective diplomatic efforts.”
Dar held that Pakistan stood with “its brotherly Arab nations in defending their territorial integrity and will continue to oppose any attempt at legitimising occupation”.
Further, drawing parallels between Palestine and India-occupied Kashmir, Dar called on the OIC moot to “step up its efforts for a just resolution” for the dispute.
In his concluding remarks, the foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s stance on the Palestinian cause, stressing that the people needed “concrete measures to end their suffering and to secure liberation from Israeli occupation”.
“Pakistan, along with its brotherly OIC countries, stands ready to rise to this challenge with unity, resolve and purpose,” he added.
On February 25, OIC — along with Pakistan, the Arab League and 20 other Muslim and European countries — jointly condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank.
Dar arrived in Saudi Arabia on a two-day visit a day earlier.
He is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting, the Foreign Office said on Thursday, adding that he would “undertake brief visits to the Holy Cities” as well.</p><small>2026-02-27 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/271107152f04bf6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976109/bears-take-charge-as-kse-100-closes-over-800-points-lower' target='_blank'><strong>Bears take charge as KSE-100 closes over 800 points lower</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, closed in the red, down 830.92 points from its previous close of 168,893.08.

According to officials, an intense exchange of fire continued throughout the night along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. However, the situation has since calmed after the firing subsided by morning.
Security sources stated that the Pakistan Army responded swiftly and in a coordinated manner by targeting multiple Afghan Taliban checkposts located across the border in Afghanistan’s Paktia province.
During the operation, Pakistani forces reportedly took control of five key Afghan checkposts and raised the national flag at the captured locations. Among the posts brought under control were two opposite Shawal, two facing the Angoor Adda sector, and one located opposite Zarmilan, security sources confirmed.
The operation, officials said, was aimed at restoring stability in the sensitive border region and effectively countering hostile activities.
Sources further revealed that Pakistani forces also destroyed an Afghan terminal in the Angoor Adda area, which was allegedly being used for military-related purposes.
As a result of the strong and coordinated response by Pakistani forces, Afghan Taliban elements reportedly suffered significant losses. Security officials confirmed that the Afghan Charlie Post and Afghan Babri Post in the Angoor Adda sector were completely destroyed during the engagement.
Authorities described the military response as a defensive measure intended to safeguard Pakistan’s territorial integrity and preempt any potential threats arising from cross-border hostilities.
While the situation remains tense, security forces are said to be on high alert and fully prepared to respond to any further aggression.
Officials added that developments in the border belt are being closely monitored to prevent escalation and maintain stability in the region.
Guns fall silent in Landi Kotal
With guns falling silent on the border, authorities are busy ascertaining any damage caused by last night’s artillery firing from the Afghan side.
Residents in Landi Kotal said they spent a sleepless night due to the continuous noise of heavy gunfire, which caused panic among the civilians located in the area.
Residents in Landi Kotal also held a demonstration against what they called the unprovoked aggression from the Afghan side, calling for an early ceasefire.</p><small>2026-02-27 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653186-operation-ghazab-lil-haq-pakistan-bombs-taliban-targets-in-afghanistan-kills-133-operatives' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US won't intervene in Pak-Afghan tensions, praises Pakistan leadership</strong></a><br><p></p><small>2026-02-27 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653183-world-urges-restraint-as-pakistan-afghanistan-border-tensions-spike' target='_blank'><strong>World urges restraint as Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions spike</strong></a><br><p>

PESHAWAR: Pakistan’s sec­urity forces swung into action after Afghan Taliban fighters launched unprovoked attacks along the border between both countries under the cover of darkness, the government said on Thursday night.
However, they received “an immediate and effective response” from Pakistan’s security forces, the information ministry said in a statement.
The action — dubbed ‘Ope­ration Ghazab Lil Haq’ — continued into the early hours of Friday, and by state media reports suggested the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had joined the response, targeting Afghan positions, including an ammunition depot in Nangarhar province, inflicting substantial damage.
However, there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) until going to press.
Authorities in Kabul had claimed launching a large-scale offensive, calling it a response to Pakistani strikes against terrorist hideouts on Afghan soil over the weekend.
Islamabad squarely blames Kabul for allowing terrorists aligned with the outlawed TTP and so-called Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) groups to use its soil as a safe haven.
Earlier, in its weekly briefing on Thursday, the Foreign Office had said that the strikes against terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan were carried out to pre-empt imminent attacks inside Pakistan, and that utmost caution was exercised to avoid civilian casualties.
‘Heavy casualties inflicted’
According to the information ministry, Pakistani forces had inflicted heavy losses on the Afghan Taliban in the Chitral, Khyber, Mohmand, Kurram and Bajaur sectors.
According to security sources, Afghan Taliban fired at various places on the Pak-Afghan border. A counter-attack saw their positions destroyed, forcing the Afghan fighters to flee, they said.
Giving details, sources said that Afghan positions across the border from the Chitral and Bajaur sectors were destroyed, while forces responded with full force to excursions in the Nawagai sector of Bajaur, Tirah in Khyber, Mohmand district and the Arandu sector of Chitral.

In a late night tweet, Info­rmation Minister Attaullah Tarar said that at least 36 Afghan Taliban attackers had been killed by Pakistani forces. However, subsequent reports by state-run Pakistan Television put the toll at 58.
In a post on X, PTV News said over 100 Taliban fighters had been injured, at least 12 Afghan posts had been completely destroyed, while five of their positions had been captured Mr Tarar also said that two Pakistan Army personnel had been martyred, while three were injured, in the line of duty.







He accused the Taliban regime of launching attacks in Pakistan’s border regions in defence of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) outlaws, adding that Kabul’s patronage of terrorists had been laid bare for the world to see.
The information minister also refuted claims by Afghan and Indian media of killing or capturing dozens of Pakistani soldiers, asserting that the Taliban regime had resorted to “propaganda and lies to cover up its embarrassment”.
Ground reports
According to reports from areas along the border, Afghan fighters initiated hostilities around Iftar time near Torkham and Landi Kotal.
Local sources said that artillery shells were fired from the Afghan side, at least two of which fell in open areas, causing no damage to life or property.
In addition, Afghan families cleared by the authorities to return to their country — who were waiting at Zero Point for their departure — had been sent back to the Landi Kotal holding center as the security situation deteriorated at the border crossing point.
The Torkham border has been closed since October 12 last year due to the diplomatic row between the two countries.
Afghan shelling in Bajaur’s Lowi Mamund tehsil resulted in injuries to five people, including three women. The injured were being treated at DHQ Khar.
State-run Pakistan TV also carried visuals from a mosque that was damaged after being targeted by Afghan fire.



Witnesses in Mohmand also reported also reported intense fighting, but there was no word on casualties from the area.
An exchange of fire was also reported from Kurram and the Angoor Adda border area.
No quarrel with ordinary Afghans: FO
Earlier, at his weekly media briefing, FO spokesman Tahir Andrabi said that Pakistan’s actions over the weekend “were proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence”.
Military officials said the operation destroyed seven terrorist targets and killed between 70 and 80 terrorists. Afghan authorities, however, had alleged civilian casualties and condemned the strikes as a violation of their sovereignty.
Responding to questions about civilian harm, Mr Andrabi said the “intelligence-based selective targeting” of these seven terrorist camps and hideouts, located in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, were “primarily to ensure safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions,” he said.
Addressing bilateral tensions, he said Pakistan’s dispute was not with the Afghan people.
“In terms of people-to-people relations, we have nothing against the people of Afghanistan. The contentious issue is the terrorist outfits that operate in Afghanistan, and the official support and impunity being offered to that terrorism.
“As regards the people of Afghanistan, we respect them, and we have traditional historic linguistic ties with them. We do not wish any harm to the Afghan people,” he said.

“Taken together, Israel’s actions appear aimed at making a permanent demographic change in Gaza and the West Bank, raising concerns about ethnic cleansing”, Turk said in a speech before the UN’s Human Rights Council in Geneva.
Turk pointed in particular to an ongoing, year-long Israeli military operation in the West Bank’s north that has caused the displacement of 32,000 Palestinians. Elsewhere in the West Bank, entire Bedouin herder communities have been displaced by increasing harassment and violence from Israeli settlers, including near Mikhmas to the east of Ramallah, and Ras Ein al-Auja, in the Jordan Valley, since the start of the year.
In addition to roughly three million Palestinians, more than 500,000 Israelis live in settlements and outposts in the West Bank, which are considered illegal under international law.

Far-right minister Smotrich vows to encourage ‘emigration’ from Palestinian territories

Israel has approved a series of initiatives this month backed by far-right ministers, including launching a process to register land in the West Bank as “state property” and allowing Israelis to purchase land there directly, in a move condemned by several countries as well as Hamas.
Israel’s current government has accelerated settlement expansion, approving a record 54 settlements in 2025, according to Israeli settlement watchdog NGO Peace Now.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967.
‘Maximum land, minimum Arabs’
In the Gaza Strip, most of the territory’s 2.2 million inhabitants have been displaced at least once since the start of the conflict on October 7, 2023. “Intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the denial of humanitarian assistance appeared to aim at a permanent demographic shift in Gaza”, the UN human rights office said in a report last week.
Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich also vowed to encourage “emigration” from the Palestinian territories in February.
“We will finally, formally and in practical terms nullify the cursed Oslo Accords and embark on a path toward sovereignty, while encouraging emigration from both Gaza and Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the Biblical term for the West Bank.
“There is no other long-term solution,” added Smotrich, who himself lives in a settlement in the West Bank.
“They want maximum land and minimum Arabs”, Fathi Nimer, a researcher with Palestinian think tank Al-Shabaka, said, referring to a commonly used phrase used to describe Israeli settlement tactics.

ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday highlighted structural fiscal challenges being faced by the federal government and called for comprehensive and forward-looking reforms in the Natio­nal Finance Commission (NFC) Award.
Speaking at the concluding session of the Pakistan Governance Forum, the minister, however, clarified that the constitutional vertical distribution of resources between the federation and provinces was not under review.
Mr Iqbal noted that from approximately Rs14 trillion in federal tax revenue and Rs5 trillion in non-tax revenue, around Rs8.2 trillion was transferred to the provinces under the NFC Award. After these transfers, he said, the federal government retained fiscal space of approximately Rs11.07tr against total expenditures of nearly Rs17.5tr.
“Nearly 50 per cent of federal expenditure goes toward debt servicing and approximately 25pc toward defence,” he explained. “After meeting these obligations, the federation must finance pensions, salaries, running expenses, development, grants, and social protection largely through borrowing. This equation is not sustainable.”
He further noted that despite social welfare being a provincial subject following the 18th Amendment, the federal government continued to fund major national social protection initiatives, such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), currently costing approximately Rs716bn. Additionally, he said, the federation bears financial responsibilities for Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).
Turning to the NFC formula, the minister said with 82pc weightage assigned to population, there was little fiscal incentive for provinces to pursue population stabilisation.
“Similarly, with 10pc weightage link­­ed to poverty, provinces may inadvertently benefit from remaining poor rather than being rewarded for reducing poverty,” he said, proposing recalibrating the formula to incentivise poverty reduction, human development improvements, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, and population stabilisation.
Call for ‘true partnership’
Senior Punjab Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, who participated in the event via video link from Lahore, presented a comprehensive analysis of the objectives, challenges and current fiscal realities of the NFC Award while emphasising the need to protect the rights of smaller provinces.
She said the NFC should operate as a true partnership between the federal government and the provinces ensuring transparency, fairness and cooperation in all fiscal matters.
She noted that any future NFC framework must begin with a realistic assessment of national debt servicing obligations, defence financing requirements, climate vulnerability and water security challenges, which collectively place significant pressure on the federation’s fiscal space.
Ms Aurangzeb highlighted that expanding the tax base, improving the tax-to-GDP ratio, encouraging provincial revenue generation and promoting economic growth were essential to ensuring long-term fiscal stability.

The figure was down on 2024 when almost 9,200 deaths were recorded, but the International Organi­sation for Migration (IOM) said numbers nonetheless reflected the “global scale” of the crisis faced by migrants.
“The continued loss of life on migration routes is a global failure we cannot accept as normal,” said IOM Director General Amy Pope. She argued for safer legal routes, adding: “These deaths are not inevitable.”
Funding cuts for aid groups, crackdowns on humanitarian NGOs and limited access to data are making it more difficult to accurately track deaths, the UN agency said.
Sea crossings such as the perilous journey across the Mediterranean Sea from Africa to Europe remain among the deadliest routes for migrants, the report said.
At least 2,108 people went missing while trying to cross the Mediterranean in 2025, and another 1,047 died or vanished while trying to cross to Spain’s Canary Islands, according to the IOM. The actual figures are “likely higher”, it said.
The first two months of 2026 have already seen “an unprecedented number of migrant deaths” in the Mediterranean, the agency warned, with
606 people recorded dead on the crossing as of Tuesday — even as arrivals in Italy decline sharply.

“This is not an additional cost. You were given a lower tariff. You enjoyed Rs15bn in free working capital for 90 days. Now cost recovery is being done through the FCA,” said Rehan Akhtar, representing the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the Power Division, at a public hearing at the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
He was responding to a tirade by representatives of the business community from Karachi and Lahore — Rehan Javed, Tanveer Barry and Aamir Sheikh — who said the prime minister’s Rs4.04 per unit tariff reduction had been partly offset by a Rs1.78 per unit higher FCA for electricity consumed in January and recovered in March. They said the tariff rebasing from a fiscal year to a calendar year had been introduced as a facility for consumers but was resulting in higher FCAs because of a lower base rate.
Mr Javed said the FY26 reference fuel cost for January would have resulted in only 54 paise per unit in additional FCA instead of Rs1.78 per unit if the base tariff had not been shifted to the calendar year starting Jan 1, thereby imposing an additional Rs1.24 per unit burden. He feared the trend would be disastrous in June for all consumers.

Industrialists claim tariff relief has eroded; govt insists Rs15bn ‘free’ working capital is being recovered

Mr Akhtar said there was no change in the cost of power supply in either case. The lower reference fuel cost meant consumers were charged a lower electricity rate in January, and its actual cost would be recovered in March. A higher reference rate for January would have allowed distribution companies (Discos) to charge a higher fuel cost in January, retain Rs15bn for the following two months and then adjust it in March bills.
He said that, subject to Nepra’s approval, the new Rs1.78 per unit FCA in March would replace the existing 28 paise per unit FCA in February, resulting in a net additional FCA of Rs1.50 per unit. This would lead to a Rs2.55 per unit negative adjustment in the quarterly tariff after two months.
Mr Akhtar also explained that 46 per cent of industrial consumers and 35pc of agricultural consumers had availed themselves of a cheaper incremental package, which resulted in 14.4pc (11 million units) demand growth. As a few cheaper power plants — including nuclear, LNG and coal-based plants — were on forced outage for technical reasons, relatively more expensive plants, including furnace oil-based ones, were utilised to meet demand, leading to a higher FCA.
The CPPA reported that electricity consumption was 14.4pc higher than the pre-approved reference, around 12pc higher than the same month last year, and 8pc higher than December 2025.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Consti­tutional Court (FCC) ruled on Thursday that tax authorities can conduct raids and searches of taxpayers’ premises under Section 175 of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO) 2001, even in the absence of any pending proceedings against them.
Headed by Justice Aamer Farooq, a three-judge FCC bench rejected a plea moved by M/s Sceptre Pvt Ltd against a Dec 24, 2025, Sindh High Court decision that had validated a tax raid on the petitioner’s premises.
The petitioner had challenged the raid conducted by tax authorities under Section 175. It said the section should be applied in case of ongoing proceedings, adding that a notice under Section 176, requiring certain documents and information, could not form the basis for a raid.
Authored by Justice Farooq, the judgement explained that Section 175 empowered the tax commissioner to act for the enforcement of any provision of the ordinance.
The words used by parliamentarians under the law are “enfo­rcement”, and “enforcement” requires “breach”. When a law is breached, then it is “enforced”. If the statute had used the word “implement”, then the situation would have been different, the judgement said.
Thus, the examination of Section 175 shows that the words used were very cle­ar and simple, that this pro­­vision can be invoked for the enforcement of any provision of the law, the ju­­dgement emphasised, ad­­­ding that the SHC had correctly rejected the petiti­oner’s plea on the grou­nds of the precedent set in the earlier Agha Steels case.
Although the bench does not agree with the view expressed in the Agha Steels case, the petition is nevertheless liable to be dismissed, Justice Farooq observed.
Even if the requireme­nts laid down in the previous case were not strictly followed, the mere fact rem­ained that the tax commissioner — or an authorised officer — was empowered to act for the enforcement of the law under Section 175, he added.
In view of the referred provision of law and the factual aspects of the matter, the impugned judgment does not suffer from any infirmity warranting interference, Justice Farooq observed.
The cardinal rule of the construction of acts of parliament is that they should be construed according to the intention expressed in the acts themselves, Jus­tice Farooq said, adding that the rationale for beg­i­nning with the ordinary and natural meaning of the statutory language was that legislation was often drafted to address specific situations in clear and straightforward terms.
In such instances, the words used are precise and are not intended to extend beyond their plain scope or to be expanded into bro­a­der contexts, he added.
Since the primary obje­c­tive of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the intention of the lawmaker, the most appropriate and reliable method is to commence with the ordinary and clear meaning of the words used, as per the judgement.
“If the legislature says that a deed shall be ‘null and void to all intents and purposes whatsoever’, how can a court of equity say that in certain circumstances it shall be valid?” Justice Farooq observed.
The principle emerging from that dictum is clear: where the language of the legislature is express and unequivocal, the courts are not at liberty to qualify, di­­lute, or contradict it, he said.
Applying the same reasoning to the present case, when parliament has exp­ressly provided that “in or­­­­der to enforce any provision of the law, the commissioner or any authori­sed officer will at all times and without prior notice, have full and free access, including real-time electronic access to any premises, place, accounts, documents or computer”.
How can a court of law then read into the statutory provision to say that a proceeding must be pending before Section 175(1)(a) of the law to trigger the raid. The answer is that it cannot. Courts must be restrained from granting relief in a manner that runs contrary to clear and express statutory provisions, the judgement said.

MANSEHRA/ISLAM­ABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday vowed that the government would go to any extent to eradicate terrorism from the country and those involved in militancy would not go unpunished.
During his visit to the residence of Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz in Mansehra to offer condolences, the PM assured the officer’s family of the government and the Pakistan Army’s full support.
“We, the federal government and the Pakistan Army, are with you and will never leave you alone, as Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz Tanoli is our pride and embraced martyrdom while gallantly commanding forces against the country’s enemies,” he assured the family members.
The PM said that Lt Col Shahzada Gul Faraz laid down his life while safeguarding the country, setting an example of bravery and courage. “The entire nation and I are proud of our martyrs and their families and would never forget the sacrifices they rendered for our motherland,” PM Shehbaz added.
He also announced the establishment of a Daanish school named after the slain officer to commemorate his martyrdom. He also visited the grave of the fallen officer to offer Fateha.
On Feb 21, Lt Col Gul Faraz and sepoy Karamat Shah were martyred in the suicide bombing during an intelligence-based operation in Bannu district, the Inter-Services Public Relations had said.
Ramazan package
The PM formally launched the Rs38 billion Ramazan package to provide financial support to deserving families across the country. While chairing a meeting on the Ramazan Relief Package, PM Shehbaz termed the assistance package “the largest and most comprehensive”, saying that the amount per household had been increased from Rs5,000 to Rs13,000.
According to the premier, the disbursement will follow a “transparent digital system successfully used last year”. Cash assistance is being delivered directly to beneficiaries through digital wallets, ensuring efficiency, transparency, and respect for recipients’ dignity by eliminating long queues, he added.
The PM was briefed that 64 per cent of the eligible individuals had received financial assistance eight days into Ramazan, while the verification and distribution of money to the remaining beneficiaries had been underway.
The briefing also noted that 12 banks and fintech companies were partnering with the government for distribution, and the beneficiaries had completed 1.1 million digital transactions and over 1.227 million automated calls had been made to inform people about the assistance package.
The prime minister praised the performance of departments involved in the disbursement of the package, saying that the digital wallet system provided a convenient and transparent means of reaching beneficiaries.
