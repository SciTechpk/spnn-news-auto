• Seven judges accept review petitions by ECP, PML-N et al; three judges ‘partially allow’ them
• 77 reserved seats in national and provincial assemblies will be distributed among other parties
• Ruling coalition can now comfortably achieve two-thirds majority in NA
ISLAMABAD: The Constit­utional Bench (CB) on Friday overturned the Supreme Court’s earlier judgement in the reserved seats case — effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures.
The decision, handed down by a majority of seven judges, supersedes the July 12, 2024 majority judgement by eight judges, which had declared the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.
“[B]y majority of seven namely Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan, Justice Musarrat Hilali, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, all civil review petitions are allowed and the impugned majority judgment of July 12 is set aside, as a consequence thereof, Civil Appeal Nos. 333 of 2024 and 334 of 2024 filed by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) are dismissed and the judgment rendered by the Peshawar High Court is restored,” announced Justice Aminuddin Khan, who was presiding over the 12-judge CB hearing the case.

Through the March 25, 2024 order, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the party joined by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024 polls — of reserved seats.
On the date of the first hearing of this case, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had rejected outright the review petitions filed by the PML-N, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and PPP.
Subsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of CB, even though they were considered part of the bench.
Meanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.
In his July 12 dissenting order, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.
The July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days — explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgement.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.
However, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all 80 returned candidates, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.
What the decision means
“Practically, the beleaguered PTI is no longer a parliamentary party, therefore the 77 reserved seats — including the National Assembly and the provincial assemblies — will be allocated among the parliamentary parties present in the respective assemblies, since they cannot be kept vacant,” a senior counsel explained.
Consequently, the ECP will also have to recall its suspension of earlier victory notifications, which it had issued soon after the July 12 judgement.
Of these 77 special seats, 22 seats will be divided amongst different political parties in the National Assembly, of which 19 seats are allocated for women and three for non-Muslims, he explained.
 
 

Of the 22 vacant reserved seats in the National Assembly, 15 will be allocated to PML-N, four to PPP and three to JUI-F, which sits on the opposition benches, he said.
After this process, the ruling coalition will achieve a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the magic number required to attain a two-thirds majority is 224. PML-N’s tally will rise from 110 to 125, the PPP’s strength will increase from 70 to 74, while the JUI-F will have 11 seats rather than the 8 they currently hold.
As ten judges had allowed the review petitions — seven completely and three partially — the counsel explained, those who had earlier joined the SIC could face the defection clause under Article 63A of the Constitution, if they chose to rejoin PTI after this judgement.
Last-minute recusal
At the outset of Friday’s proceedings, the strength of the 11-judge CB was further reduced to ten when Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself.
During the hearing, while pointing towards senior counsel Hamid Khan, Justice Panhwar observed that he felt personally hurt with the way the counsel had argued. Since the counsel had no faith in him, he had no option but to recuse himself.
With the permission of the chair, Justice Panhwar read out an order he had written, stating that during the proceedings of the reserved seats case, all counsel — including Faisal Siddiqi for SIC and Salman Akram Raja for PTI and Kanwal Shauzab — had expressed confidence in the composition of the bench.
 
 

However, during the previous hearing, senior counsel Hamid Khan had raised an objection targeting the inclusion of certain judges — including Justice Panhwar himself — who were appointed after the passage of the 26th Constitutional amendment.
The counsel has questioned the propriety of our participation in this bench for the adjudication of the present matter, Justice Panhwar observed.
“In the light of the objection raised and in deference to the judicial propriety, irrespective of its merit or the timing of assertion, I considered it appropriate to recuse myself from further hearing of this case,” Justice Panhwar announced, adding that his recusal was not an admission for disqualification, but intended to uphold the institutional integrity and objectivity of these proceedings.
“Greatly appreciate that,” replied Hamid Khan. At this, Justice Khan retorted that it was not a matter of appreciation.
“This is only because of your conduct,” regr­etted Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail. The court then retired and assembled later after a considerable time.
The recusal of Justice Panhwar was also noted by the CB in its short order, saying that after he recused himself and contributed a separate note, the bench was reconstituted with all available members of the CB.

• Circular debt crosses Rs4.9tr; unfunded pensions, weak governance deepen fiscal strain
ISLAMABAD: With relentless financial haemorrhaging of nearly Rs342bn in just six months, the cumulative losses and unfunded pension liabilities of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have crossed Rs7.5tr — almost three times the country’s defence allocation of Rs2.55tr for FY26, and over seven times the upcoming year’s Public Sector Develop­ment Programme (Rs1tr).
The Ministry of Finance informed the Cabinet Commit­tee on State-Owned Enterprises (CCoSOEs) on Friday that total SOE losses now exceed Rs5.8tr — nearly one-third of the recently passed Rs17.5tr federal budget for 2025-26.
Presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurang­zeb, the meeting was briefed by the Central Monitoring Unit of the Finance Division on the biannual performance of federal SOEs for the period July to December 2024.
The report outlined the worsening state of SOEs, including cumulative losses of Rs5.8tr, with Rs342bn incurred in just six months.
Despite repeated increases in electricity and gas tariffs over the past three years, circular debt in the oil, gas and power sectors has surged to over Rs4.9tr — almost double the defence budget — severely affecting cash flows and asset valuations.
The committee was told that government fiscal support to SOEs — via grants, subsidies, loans and other injections — also exceeded Rs600bn in just six months, equivalent to nearly 10pc of total revenue receipts.
Unfunded pension liabilities in power distribution companies (Discos) and other SOEs, estimated at Rs1.7tr, remain off the government’s books, as do the pension obligations of Pakistan Railways.
Government guarantees currently stand at Rs2.2tr, while costs related to debt rollovers and financial restructuring further tighten fiscal space. The meeting was informed of persistent governance issues, particularly weak transparency in beneficial interest disclosures under IFRS Section 30, and other regulatory compliance gaps. A lack of strategic alignment and operational inefficiencies were identified as urgent areas for reform.
The cabinet committee noted with concern the staggering Rs5.8tr in cumulative losses, including Rs342bn in just six months — a daily average loss of Rs1.9bn, according to an official statement.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb deplored inefficiencies in Disco operations, delays in grid upgrades by NTDC, and ballooning pension obligations. He warned that weak governance standards are undermining fiscal space and deterring investor confidence.
He stressed the need for urgent reform in the power and energy sectors, where circular debt has crossed Rs4.9tr, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to enhancing transparency, financial discipline, and accountability across SOEs.
He vowed to push through governance and operational reforms to ensure the financial sustainability of public sector entities.
Mr Aurangzeb also directed that all government-nominated directors on SOE boards exercise due diligence and actively contribute to improving financial and operational performance through informed decision-making.
Ironically, each SOE board includes at least one senior official from the finance ministry — alongside representatives from relevant line ministries — who receive generous remunerations for attending quarterly board meetings, yet the financial bleeding remains unchecked.
The finance minister underscored the importance of aligning business plans with national priorities and tackling operational challenges in a coordinated and timely fashion. The meeting was also attended by ministers from the ministries of Power, Maritime Affairs, and Science and Technology.
The committee approved the appointment of chairpersons for Quetta Electric and Gujranwala Electric, as well as the constitution of the Board of Directors for the Independent System Market Operator (ISMO) and an independent director for GENCO Holding Company Ltd (GHCL), as proposed by the Power Division.
It also approved the nomination of independent directors for the boards of Multan Electric Power Company (MEPCO), Power Information Technology Company (PITC), and the formation of the board for Energy Infrastructure Development and Management Company (EIDMC).
Additionally, the committee approved a summary from the Ministry of Railways seeking the winding up of three railway subsidiaries — RAILCOP, PRACS, and PRFTC.

• Insists Trump’s Nobel nomination a joint civil-military decision
• Dismisses claim Islamabad sought ceasefire
ISLAMABAD: Foreign Mini­ster Ishaq Dar on Friday ruled out the possibility of Pakistan joining the Abraham Accords, stating that such a move would effectively mean abandoning the country’s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict and recognising Israel.
Speaking at a news conference at the Foreign Office, Mr Dar, who also serves as deputy prime minister, reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
His comments came in response to recent remarks by US Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who suggested that more countries, which were not previously “contemplated”, were preparing to join the US-brokered accords, which normalise ties with Israel.
Witkoff had joined President Donald Trump at the White House lunch for Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“We are not ready to recognise Israel until the two-state solution to the Palestine conflict is accepted,” Mr Dar said. “There is no change in our stated policy on the Palestine issue.”
He added that signing the Abraham Accords would be tantamount to abandoning Pakistan’s long-standing demand for a Palestinian state with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders. “Let it be clear to everyone that our seven-decades-long policy rem­ains unchanged,” he said.
Trump’s Nobel nomination
Addressing criticism over Pakistan’s nomination of President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, Mr Dar said the decision was made jointly by the country’s civilian and military leadership.
He emphasised that the nomination, submitted prior to the start of the Israel-Iran conflict, was based on Trump’s role in de-escalating tensions between India and Pakis­tan and his remarks regarding the Kashmir dispute.
The foreign minister recalled that Trump “tweeted 15 or 16 times about that”.
Trump’s repeated cla­i­ms on social media about his role in facilitating the May 10 ceasefire between Pakistan and India have irritated New Delhi.
“The decision to nominate President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize was in the context of his role in the India-Pakistan conflict and his statements on the Kashmir issue,” Mr Dar said.
“It was a collective decision by the civil-military leadership. I signed the letter on June 11, days before the Iran-Israel war began. The prime minister’s approval was obviously part of the process.”
Mr Dar referred to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s remarks at a June 4 event at the US Embassy, where he reportedly called Trump “a man of peace”.
The nomination has stirred controversy within Pakistan, with many questioning the rationale behind the move.
Indian ceasefire claims
Responding to Indian officials’ statements that claimed Pakistan had sought a ceasefire, FM Dar dismissed the assertions and reiterated Islamabad’s position that dialogue must be based on equality.
“We didn’t ask anyone for a ceasefire, nor would we ask anyone for dialogue,” he said.
“If India wants talks, we are ready. But we are a dignified nation, we won’t beg. Pakistan is prepared to talk on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir and terrorism, at any venue, but in a respectful manner. The ball is in their court. It takes two to tango.”
His remarks directly challenge New Delhi’s narrative and reaffirm Pakistan’s readiness for dialogue grounded in mutual respect and national dignity.

• Iranian foreign minister denies any plans for renewed nuclear talks
WASHINGTON: The US military did not use bunker buster bombs on one of Iran’s largest nuclear sites last weekend, because it is so deep that the bombs likely would not have been effective, the US’ top general told senators during a briefing on Thursday.
CNN reported that the comment by Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine is the first known explanation given for why the US military did not use the Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb against the Isfahan site in central Iran.
US officials believe Isfahan’s underground structures house nearly 60pc of Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile, which Iran would need in order to ever produce a nuclear weapon.
B-2 bombers dropped over a dozen bunker-buster bombs on Iran’s Fordow and Natanz nuclear sites. But Isfahan was only struck by Tomahawk missiles launched from a US submarine.
The classified briefing to lawmakers was conducted by Caine, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, CNN reported.
 
 

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy told CNN on Thursday night after receiving the briefing that some of Iran’s capabilities “are so far underground that we can never reach them. So they have the ability to move a lot of what has been saved into areas where there’s no American bombing capacity that can reach it.”
Separately, President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to bomb Iran again if it resumes efforts to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels, and made the claim that he saved Ayatollah Ali Khamenei from an assassination, lashing out at the Iranian supreme leader for claiming victory in their recent conflict.
 
 

Asked at a White House news conference whether he would consider new bombing raids if Iran’s nuclear ambitions persist, Trump said, “Sure. Without question. Absolutely.”
He added, “I don’t believe that they’re going to go back into nuclear anytime soon. They spent over a trillion dollars on nuclear, and they never got it together, and nothing was moved from the site.”
In a fiery post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said: “I knew EXACTLY where he was sheltered, and would not let Israel, or the US Armed Forces, by far the Greatest and Most Powerful in the World, terminate his life,”
Trump posted on Truth Social. “I SAVED HIM FROM A VERY UGLY AND IGNOMINIOUS DEATH, and he does not have to say, ‘THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP!’”
Trump said he had been working to ease sanctions on Tehran but reversed course after Khamenei’s defiant speech.
Meanwhile, Iran swiftly rejected Trump’s assertions that talks were imminent. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said there was “no plan” for new negotiations, directly contradicting the US president. “I would like to state clearly that no agreement, arrangement or conversation has been made to start new negotiations,” Araghchi said on state television.

They demanded the recovery of a child who had been kidnapped outside his home. It was the second instance of kidnapping in a month. The child was recovered after a few days, but the previous victim — the child of a labourer — had been killed because his relatives couldn’t afford the large ransom. Kidnapping children for ransom has turned into a regular feature in recent years — in addition to the long list of other horrendous crimes in the province, which include murders, robberies, illegal occupation of private property, bloody tribal feuds, ‘honour killings’, denial of water to small farmers, etc.
Last year, Sindh Police reported that as many as 230 children had been kidnapped or missing since 2023 in Karachi alone. Crime has become the most profitable ‘business’ in Sindh, including in the upper reaches of the province, where it is rampant.
 
 

The provincial government has failed for years to discharge its primary constitutional obligation — protecting life, limb, honour and property — even though it holds immense power — politically, financially and administratively — after the passage of the 18th Amendment. The result is that a chronically lawless and violent environment is affecting every aspect of life — economic, social, cultural, demographic and even climatic.
Unemployment is rampant as the private sector is shy of investing in job-creating industries. Agriculture, the mainstay of the local economy, and employment are in decay, thanks to broken infrastructure, water shortages, climatic elements including recurring floods, and more ominously, generational tribal feuds and violence. The age-old ethos reinforcing multi-faith and multicultural relations have come under untenable stress, with religious minorities, particularly the Hindu community, trapped in the crosshairs of both religious bigots and criminal mafias. People are leaving an unsecure and lawless rural society to seek better economic and living conditions in the urban areas, especially Hyderabad and Karachi.
The state’s failure to enforce its writ is not simply endangering public safety, it’s also posing a risk to the environment as forests vanish and riverine lands are illegally occupied and used for agriculture, drastically affecting fauna and flora.
 
 

However, the provincial (and federal) government’s response to Sindh’s worsening law and order remains characteristically dismissive.
The deplorable state of affairs is referred to as the ‘old normal’. In other words, the lawlessness and insecurity are claimed to be rooted in the local ‘culture’ and societal structures, rather than the government’s incompetence, bad policies and failed governance. The ‘old normal’ narrative is also linked to the overall poor order in the country. It is true that the pathetic state of affairs, including kidnapping for ransom, can in some ways be traced to the infamous jailbreak of the mid-1980s, when hundreds of hardened criminals from Sukkur Central Jail were ‘facilitated’ in their escape in order to create an environment of fear and insecurity among the people of Sindh and thereby justify the deployment of federal forces to quell the democratic struggle.
Rural society also saw a new a surge of neo-tribalisation and neo-feudalisation under martial law. Feudal-tribal forces were used — with the helped of a re-empowered bureaucracy and a compliant clergy — to atomise society into castes, clans, tribes and sects. The aim was to sow division in democratic ranks, and to garner a pro-regime political base through non-party elections.
Gen Musharraf, however, flipped the system. He empowered the local feudal-tribal forces at the cost of both political forces and bureaucracy. Thus, for the first time, the nazim personified both political and state power. Consequently, the very matrix of power and societal control was transformed. The rural populace was virtually placed at the mercy of these socially regressive and politically repressive forces.

What is there for the people of Sindh in this elitist configuration of power?

 
 

Ironically, the PPP government has further enhanced the power matrix. It has not only enabled its local feudal-tribal political affiliates to exercise dominant control over the local bureaucracy and police, but to also enjoy the trappings of democratic legitimacy through elected offices.
No wonder, besides the cash-transfer programmes that have helped the PPP cultivate a large constituency among the poorest of the poor, the other significant factor behind its continuing spell in Sindh, and elsewhere, constitutes the support of these electables, forming mostly the local feudal-tribal forces. Meanwhile, the PPP has changed tack vis-à-vis the establishment. It has ‘won over’ the powers that be by, arguably, allowing them a free hand in provincial affairs and allotting large tracts of urban and agriculture land to them. The establishment also seems happy with the PPP for ‘quietening’ an otherwise historically restive province at a time when the state faces serious security challenges in KP, Balochistan, and even Punjab.
Thus, the PPP’s self-serving political strategy has worked for it. It has enjoyed power in Sindh (for over 16 years) and elsewhere. And there seems to be no imminent threat to its status, particularly with the establishment appearing to be pleased with the party’s leadership for playing a crucial role in the passage of the 26th Amendment, which has not only boosted the current hybrid regime, but also bestowed on the party the unique status of acting both as a ‘catalyst’ of change and a ‘balancer’ in the contending troika — the establishment, PML-N and PTI.
 
 

But what is there for the people of Sindh in this elitist configuration of power, given that swathes of the populace continue to live under the shadow of fear?
Their rights and liberties are trampled upon by organised criminal gangs while the local bureaucracy and police remain criminally negligent or complicit. And for how long will these hapless people be treated as the ‘means of elitist empowerment’, rather than — as promised by the founding fathers — the ‘ends’ of the ‘social compact’ that guarantees them security, equality, justice, dignity and honour?
But alas, as these hapless people continue to wait for the state to discharge its part of the bargain, the compact — discarded, disfigured and disregarded — itself has become a victim of the curse of the ‘old normal’.

• Opposition disrupts proceedings by chanting slogans against govt, in support of Imran Khan
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly witnessed a rumpus once again on Friday, as the lower house wrapped up budget formalities, while the speaker asserted his right to expunge remarks he deemed to be against the “national interest”.
On Friday, the House approved all supplementary grants pertaining to different ministries and divisions for the years 2023-24 and 2024-25.
Excess demands for grants for the financial year 2023-24, which were moved by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, were also approved.
During the approval process, opposition lawmakers continuously chanted full-throated slogans against the government and the upcoming fiscal year’s budget, as well as in support of their jailed leader, Imran Khan.
They gathered in front of the speaker’s dais, raising slogans and tearing up copies of the agenda. However, the government benches responded to opposition slogans with equal force.
Unmoved by the uproar, the finance minister continued to present demands for supplementary grants, which were passed before the House was abruptly prorogued.
The opposition members also staged a brief walkout from the House but soon returned to continue their protest.
Speaking in the House, Mr Aurangzeb praised members from both sides of the aisle for their active participation and valuable input in the federal budget process for the fiscal year 2025-26.
He noted that contributions, and constructive feedback from both the treasury and opposition benches played a vital role in the successful completion of the budget process. He appreciated them for openly expressing their views during the debate, describing it as a hallmark of democratic culture.
Speaker asserts his right
The episode began right at the outset of proceedings, when Leader of the Opposition in House Omar Ayub Khan got into an argument with Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
The opposition leader drew the speaker’s attention towards Rule 284 and asked him as to who had expunged his speech from a day earlier.
When the speaker claimed that he had expunged the speech, Mr. Ayub confronted him, saying, “When did you do it? I saw your cars leaving myself?” Mr Ayub said that what was happening had never occurred in the past. “No Speaker has ever done this before,” he added, referring to the policy of censorship and blackout.
“I have to look at the national interest. I will do what is in the national interest and will keep on doing it”, the speaker said. The opposition leader replied it was about amendments and there was nothing against national interest. He also raised the issue of what he called unreasonable remarks against former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse made by the law minister. “Otherwise, it would lead to a situation where we will be at each other’s throats, and you will be responsible for it,” he warned the NA speaker.

The budget target is ambitious: to grow the economy by 4.2pc despite the private sector’s weakened appetite for investment and without any major public fiscal stimulus. The aim is also to collect Rs14.1tr in taxes to contain the fiscal deficit to 3.9pc, besides imposing new taxes worth Rs463bn, which include levies amounting to Rs36bn.
The powers the FBR would like in order to collect taxes of Rs389bn through enforcement measures have, however, been tempered on the PPP’s insistence. For example, the power to arrest tax evaders or short-filers will be used only in cases where the irregularity exceeds Rs50m.
There will be no arrest during the inquiry stage or without the approval of a committee. The offence has also been made bailable. Likewise, spending curbs on ineligible persons have been eased somewhat. The tax on imported solar panels has been reduced to 10pc from the proposed 18pc. Similarly, the rate of income tax on earnings between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2m has been reduced further from 2.5pc to 1pc.
The fact that interest payments of Rs8.2tr remain the single largest allocation expenditure highlights the small fiscal space for infrastructure development — needed for growth and provision of public services — on account of unsound policies. Defence spending is set to consume Rs2.55tr, followed by a subsidy bill of Rs1.1tr.
Allocations for development have come down to Rs1tr — equal to the civil and military pension bill — compared with the original estimate of Rs1.4tr for the outgoing year. Despite the squeeze on resources and the government’s unwillingness to effectively tax politically important sectors like retail, agriculture and real estate, tax expenditure or exemptions to commercial for-profit civil and military organisations have jumped to over Rs5.3tr.
The next budget is more or less a reflection of previous ones; ie, it is an attempt to balance the books within the overarching framework dictated by the IMF, with a few changes here and there.
The macroeconomic targets are unrealistic, and we are likely to see all or most of them being missed at the end of the next fiscal year. Some might argue that the government has little leeway to manoeuvre the budget for fear of breaching the IMF’s guidelines. But this amounts to misleading the public.
The IMF programme focuses on debt sustainability; it does not stop policymakers from making the decisions that they chose not make for decades. We are where we are not due to any exogenous factors. The country cannot progress unless our ruling elites admit their part in its consistent economic decline.

The spectre of that disaster has haunted the city in all kinds of palpable and impalpable ways. One of the latter has undoubtedly been the undercurrent of Islamophobia that has cast a pall over the skyscrapers and streets of New York. Muslims have been suspected, profiled on the streets, attacked on subways, vilified and pilloried. So have the causes related to Muslims. A prime example has been how students protesting against the genocide in Gaza have been hunted down and prosecuted.
On Tuesday, however, the city appeared to finally turn the page. Following a ranked-choice election, a 33-year-old Muslim immigrant, the son of a professor and a filmmaker, became the Democratic Party’s nominee for mayor of NYC. The win is historic in many ways, Zohran Mamdani is set to be the youngest mayor, the first Muslim American mayor, the first immigrant mayor, and the first mayor who has won on a Democratic-socialist platform.
 
 

Unlike the rest of the Democratic Party, which has stayed quiet on Gaza, Mamdani has openly and repeatedly condemned the genocide. More importantly, Mamdani has an openly socialist agenda that pledges to help the city’s middle class — crushed by the affordability crisis — by promoting city-owned grocery stores, free childcare and freezing rents for those struggling to live in the city
The chances that he will go from mayoral candidate to mayor in the election in November are high. New York is a Democratic city and the candidate who wins the Democratic primary usually goes on to win the city-wide race in the mayoral election. In the run-up to the election, most polls predicted that Mamdani’s opponent, former governor Andrew Cuomo, would win the primary.
This did not happen, and around midnight on the day of the election Cuomo conceded to Mamdani, whose vote counts were ahead by eight points. Mamdani’s other opponent, current NYC mayor, Eric Adams, has faced challenges of his own. Even though he has vowed to run as an independent, his indictment on corruption charges and the fact that he was pardoned by President Donald Trump would have consequences even if he were to run against Mamdani as an independent.
 
 

This does not, of course, mean that the road ahead is easy or entirely clear. Mamdani’s support among the younger voters, South Asian and East Asian immigrants, as well as in middle-class neighbourhoods of the city allowed him to raise the maximum $8 million that candidates are permitted in an election. However, his opponents can spend large amounts to attack him.
This was evident in the run-up to the voting, when former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg funded the main attack advertisements against Mamdani. These ads focused on painting Mamdani as an extremist, mostly owing to his open and unapologetic support for Muslim and Palestinian causes. For his part, Mamdani’s ads were positive and colourful and sought to mobilise the diverse population of America’s largest city to finally vote for definitive change.
Another reason why Mamdani’s win has been shocking is that NYC is also home to the largest population of American Jews in the country and one of the largest outside the state of Israel. Mamdani’s openly anti-Zionist stance has irked many in this community. His win has shocked the many rich, pro-Zionist political donors and groups in the city. It is very likely that they will use their money to try and bring down Mamdani’s candidacy to thwart the history-making moment that otherwise would have seen a Muslim immigrant as mayor of America’s largest city in terms of population.

One of the main reasons why Mamdani’s win has been shocking is that NYC is home to the largest population of American Jews in the country.

 
 

So far, Mamdani’s campaign has been able to absorb all of these attacks. One reason for this is that his win is rooted in the strong foundation of grassroots organisation among the Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Arab communities that make up a solid vote bank in Queens, where Mamdani is from.
These communities now have decades of experience in organising and dealing with Islamophobic attacks that paint their leaders as terrorists — in fact, anything even remotely linked with Islam — as inherently extremist. Mamdani’s win suggests that even the general population of NYC is fed up of these attacks and of being saturated with the same old Islamophobic propaganda that has been flung around to taint each and every Muslim American candidate for just about anything.
As important as this is the courage that Mamdani has so far shown in espousing a Democratic-socialist agenda. Average rents for a two-bedroom apartment in NYC are often upwards of $5,000, creating a crisis in which the city’s middle class find themselves facing crushing inflationary costs. Crime has risen in the city and the subways have become unsafe and prone to attacks by the mentally ill and homeless, who have no place to go. Women especially feel unsafe in the city’s public transport system, which was once NYC’s pride.
 
 

Mainstream Democrats have shied away from proposing solutions to these problems, just as they have turned their back on rising Islamophobia and the increasing harassment of migrants and undocumented people. Mamdani’s win suggests that Democratic voters are eager to move farther left instead of centre, which has been the party’s preference at the national level.
At the same time, while a win for Mamdani is probable, it is not a given. Many months lie between now and November, and Mamdani’s enemies are formidable. However, in having come this far and proving so many people wrong, Zohran Mamdani has shown that change is possible even in a city, that has for quite long now treated Muslims as suspects.

THIS screengrab from a viral video shows the ill-fated family from Sialkot, who became stranded as the river swelled around them.

SWAT: At least 13 tourists drowned in the flooded River Swat on Friday after being caught in the gushing water while having breakfast on the riverbank, rescue officials confirmed.
The casualties occurred near Mingora as the water level in the river rose following two days of rainfall.
According to eyewitnesses, 22 tourists, who had arrived from Sialkot and Mardan, were having breakfast along the river near the Bypass in Shangla, a popular picnic spot, when they were caught in the flood.
Niaz Khan, the spokesperson for Swat Rescue 1122, said eight bodies had been recovered so far, while the search was underway for five missing individuals.
He confirmed that all other trapped people were successfully rescued.

The deceased were identified as Ayan, 7; Rubina, 45; Ajwa, 18; Sharmeen, 16; Murab, 18; and Tazmeen, 20; from Sialkot, and Aishal Naseer and Farman Hussain from Mardan.
Muhammad Mohsin, a tourist from Sialkot who managed to survive, said 17 people were sitting for breakfast, of which 10 drowned, while seven were saved by locals and Rescue 1122 divers.
Videos of the incident showing the victims stranded in the flooded river went viral on social media.
Eyewitnesses and locals said the tourists, including families, were caught off guard by the rapidly rising water level.
They claimed the tourists remained stranded for over an hour, but rescue teams didn’t arrive in time to save them. Locals tried to save the trapped tourists, with one man, Muha­mmad Hilal, rescuing three people from the gushing river. According to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Aut­hority (PDMA), 16 persons were washed away, of whom three were rescued and nine dead bodies have been recovered. Four persons were still missing.
PDMA has put the death toll at 10, including four men, three women and four children.
In its report, the authority claimed the victims “went into the [middle] of River Swat”.
Earlier, the PDMA had issued a flood alert after water as the discharge level in Swat river at Khwazakhela surged to 77,782 cusecs — a very high flood state.
Fayaz Zafar, a local journalist, said despite the warning, the district administration didn’t take preventive measures, such as imposing Section 144, which could have restricted public access to riverbanks.
Locals also pointed to gravel mining in the riverbed as a contributing factor to the disaster, as it “altered the natural flow of the river”, making it more prone to flooding.
Deaths in other areas
According to PDMA, six people got trapped in flooded water bodies in Lower Dir. Five of them were rescued, while the search for one person, who drowned near Ghari Rahimabad, was underway.
They included two women, as many children and an elderly man, officials said.
The dead body of one person was also recovered from the Swat river in Malakand.
In Abbottabad, Rescue 1122 recovered the bodies of two children who drowned in the Door river on Thursday.
According to officials, the identities of the deceased had not been confirmed. Their bodies were shifted to Civil Hospital, Havelian for legal formalities.
The region received heavy rainfall, especially in Abbottabad and the surrounding hilly areas of Galiyat, which inundated residential areas and flooded water bodies.
The main Abbottabad-Mansehra Road remained blocked for several hours at Supply and at Kala Pul due to overflowing water.
In Door river has also swelled in Harno, Abbottabaed, after which, the local administration warned tourists against approaching the riverbank.
Additionally, police have set up a checkpoint on the road leading to the river to restrict public access.
Responding swiftly to emergency calls, the Rescue 1122 Water Rescue and Disaster Team rushed to both sites. After intense efforts, they successfully evacuated all the trapped individuals to safety without any casualties.
In Shangla, three vehicles were damaged after being hit by falling rocks during a landslide, triggered by heavy rains in Bely Baba area on Friday morning.
Flash floods were also reported in different rivers, including the Indus.
Umar Rehman, the Shangla police spokesperson, told Dawn the vehicles which were parked near a hotel.
He said a portion of the hotel was also affected by the landslide. However, no casualties were reported.

Currently, the 120-strong house has 93 PTI-backed MPAs, who were elected as independents, while 25 seats reserved for women and non-Muslims were vacant due to the cases pending before the apex court.
After the increase in their stre­ngth, the opposition members will be in a position to requisition assembly sessions. So far, they did not have sufficient numbers for the purpose.
Friday’s judgement restored several March 2024 notifications of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to declare 25 candidates of opposition parties elected to rese­rved seats in the provincial assembly.
On May 13, 2024, the ECP had suspended several notifications, declaring MNAs and MPAs as returned on reserved seats, in light of an earlier order of the Supreme Court.
Through those notifications, 21 of the MPAs elected on seats reserved for women and four MPAs elected on seats reserved for non-Muslims were suspended.
The suspended MPAs-elect included eight from the JUI-F, six from the PML-N, five from PPP and one each from Awami National Party and Pervez Khattak’s PTI-Parliamentarians.
Similarly, out of the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, two were allocated to the JUI-F and one each to the PML-N and PPP.
Presently, out of 27 opposition MPAs, nine each belong to the JUI-F and the PML-N, five to PPP and two to each ANP and PTI-P.
Following the latest SC decision, the strength of the opposition will include 19 from the JUI-F, 16 of the PML-N, 11 from the PPP and three each from the ANP and PTI-P.
After the Feb 2024 general elections, the ECP issued a notification on Feb 22, 2024, about allocation of five of the total 26 seats reserved for women in the provincial assembly. Those five MPAs included two of JUI-F and PML-N each and one of PPP.
The ECP had not allocated the remaining seats to any other party as it had not decided the fate of Sunni Ittehad Council, which was joined by 87 of the PTI-backed independent MPAs.
Apart from the provincial assembly, the eight MNAs elected on reserved seats for women from KP also stood restored. These MNAs include four from PML-N, and two each from JUI-F and PPP.
Above all Senate elections have yet to be conducted in the province.

Mahrang Baloch, along with other BYC leaders — Beebow Baloch, her father Ghaffar Baloch, Sabghat Ullah Shah Jee and Bebarg Baloch — was arrested on March 22 and sent to Quetta District Jail under MPO-3.
This marks the fourth extension of their detention. After completing three months in custody, the authorities issued a fresh notification extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Superintendent of Que­tta District Jail Ham­eed Ullah Peechi confirmed the extension. “I have rec­eived orders from the authorities concerned about extending the detention of Dr Mahrang Baloch and others by 15 more days. They will remain in jail for 15 more days,” he said.
The BYC spokesperson strongly criticised the provincial government for the repeated extensions and termed the fresh orders illegal. He dema­nded the immediate release of all detained leaders.
 
 

Dr Sabhia Baloch, a BYC leader, said: “The continued detention of these leaders after three months is illegal and unconstitutional.” She accused the government of using various tactics to prolong their imprisonment and demanded their immediate release.
Ms Baloch and over 150 other political workers were arrested on March 22 from a sit-in camp near the University of Balochistan. The protest had been organised to demand the handover of the bodies of individuals allegedly killed in a security forces operation against suspects involved in the attack and hijacking of the Jaffar Express in Bolan.
 
 

The Home Department withdrew the arrest orders for the other detainees and released them. However, detention orders for Ms Baloch and the four other BYC leaders were not withdrawn.

A notification issued by the interior ministry, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said the approval followed requests by all provincial governments, besides governments of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
It added the federal government authorised the deployment of army troops and civil armed forces under Sections 4 and 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, for Muharram security duties in aid of civil power, subject to laws enforced in the country.
“The exact number, date and area of deployment of Pakistan Army and CAFs troops/assets will be worked out by all provincial governments including Government of Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Govt. of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and ICT administration in consultation with concerned stakeholders on the basis of on-ground requirement/assessment.

Deployment approved on requests from provinces, GB and Azad Kashmir

“The date of de-requisitioning of the said deployment will be decided subsequently after mutual consultation among all stakeholders,” the notification said.
Copies of the notification besides others have been sent to the secretary to the prime minister, secretary of ministry of defence, secretaries of home departments, governments of Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan, GB & AJK, chief commissioner of ICT, military operations directorate, GHQ, inspectors general of Frontier Corps, (North and South), inspectors general of Frontier Corps, Balochistan (North and South), director generals of Pakistan Rangers (Punjab and Sindh), commandant of Frontier Constabulary, director general of Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts, and inspectors general of Police, Punjab, Sindh, KP, Balochistan, GB, AJK and Islamabad.
Ashura, the 10th of Muharram, will be observed on July 6. Muharram is the month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide. It commemorates the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where Imam Hussain, the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), and his family members and companions were martyred.
Keeping in view the need for extra security due to the spike in religious activity during the first 10 days of Muharram, authorities make arrangements accordingly.
A day earlier, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi chaired a meeting on nationwide Muharram security plan at the Ministry of Interior.
During the meeting, security plans for all provinces, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad were reviewed in detail.
It was decided in the meeting to launch a crackdown against elements spreading religious hatred on social media during Muharram and take strict legal action against them.
Moreover, it was decided to send clear recommendations to Pemra and PTA to curb hate content on electronic and social media. It was also decided that all necessary measures will be taken to ensure peace and order during Muharram.
It was also agreed that any decision to suspend internet or mobile phone services will be made in consultation with provinces, keeping in view the security concerns.
Mr Naqvi directed the authorities to make decisions regarding internet and mobile service suspensions the basis of ground realities and the security situation.

• Committee approves supplementary grants worth Rs856bn; passes the buck on sugar import to minister-led body
ISLAMABAD: The government has increased the price of gas by 50 per cent in an apparent move to meet the demand of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the federal cabinet approved the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1.
The rate for non-domestic consumers has been increased by 29pc to cumulatively raise an additional Rs72 billion.
The ECC meeting on Friday, chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, also approved supplementary grants of Rs856bn.
However, the committee failed to reach a decision over the import of sugar and passed the responsibility to a political committee led by the National Food Security and Research minister.
Increase in gas price
The summary for the revised natural gas pricing structure for the fiscal year 2025–26 was moved by the Petroleum Division.
The ministry sought app­roval for up to 56pc increase in gas rates for protected domestic consumers and 37pc increase in fixed charges.
The additional burden on consumers was to be offset by disbursing the amount —saved due to the removal of subsidy — through the BISP social safety programme.
However, the ECC decided to increase fixed charges by 50pc for domestic consumers and shift partial burden to bulk, power sector and industrial consumers.
The increase in gas rate for the power sector would have around Rs0.12 per unit additional impact on the average power tariff.
In doing so, the ECC increased fixed charges for protected consumers by 50pc from Rs400 to Rs600.
Likewise, fixed charges for non-protected domestic consumers were increased by 50pc from Rs1,000 to Rs1,500.
The meeting also abolished the one-slab benefit to domestic consumers — both protected and non-protected — who would now be charged at the first tariff slab of each category.
The ECC also increased gas rates for bulk consumers by 9.5pc from Rs2,900 to Rs3,175 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu).
The gas rates for the power sector were increased by 29pc instead of 25pc proposed by the Petroleum Division from Rs1,050 to Rs1,350 per mmBtu.
Likewise, a 9.3pc increase was approved for industrial (process) consumers from Rs2,150 to Rs2,350 per mmBtu.
A statement issued by the Ministry of Finance said the Ogra law required the federal government to notify revised consumer gas prices within 40 days of Ogra’s determination to ensure cost recovery and regulatory compliance.
“The submission also aligns with structural benchmarks agreed with the IMF, including rationalisation of captive power tariffs and a shift from cross-subsidies to direct, targeted support for low-income consumers,” it added.
The statement said the ECC decided to maintain gas prices to protect household consumers with only fixed charges re-adjusted to recover the asset costs.
“It also allowed price of gas for bulk consumers, power plants operating on natural gas and industry to be increased by an average value of around 10pc,” the statement said.
This would ensure the revenue requirement of Rs888.6bn — Rs534.46bn for SNGPL and Rs354.2bn for SSGCL — determined by Ogra for FY26.
At the existing price of gas effective since February 01, the estimated revenues of both Sui companies by the end FY26 was Rs847.714bn — Rs493.54bn for SNGPL and Rs354.18bn for SSGCL, leaving a shortfall of Rs41bn.
The gas tariff revisions cleared by the ECC are assumed to meet the Rs41bn revenue deficit.
The petroleum division warned that the government was already engaged with the IMF to replace cross-subsidies with direct, budgeted subsidies, i.e., through the BISP.
Sugar import
The ECC also discussed the issue of sugar imports to stabilise prices in the local market and constituted a 10-member steering committee for further deliberations.
The committee, led by the food security minister, also included the commerce minister, SAPM on foreign affairs, Finance Division secretary, FBR chairman and others will submit its recommendations to the ECC.
The ECC also discussed proposed changes in the home remittances incentive schemes and asked the State Bank of Pakistan and the Finance Division to propose and present a plan by July 31.
The meeting considered a finance ministry’s proposal to launch a risk coverage scheme for small farmers and under-served areas and gave an in-principle approval to the scheme.
The ECC noted the scheme was likely to bring 750,000 new agricultural borrowers into the formal financial system and generate an incremental credit portfolio of Rs300bn during its disbursement tenure of three years.
The meeting approved a total of 14 supplementary grants worth Rs856bn.
Major among them included Rs832bn to the Ministry of Finance for repayment of debt, Rs15.84bn for the Ministry of Defence to cover the shortfall in admissible pay and allowances, in employees-related and non-employees related expenditures and clear the outstanding dues as part of the PM’s Package for the martyrs of the recent clashed with India and Rs5.5bn grant to Strategic Plans Divisions as rupee cover to Pakistan Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission.

• Islamabad welcomes, India rejects ‘supplemental award’ as it exposes Kishenganga and Ratle hydel projects to Pakistan’s objections
ISLAMABAD: In a major boon for Pakistan in its dispute over the ‘one-sided’ suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague has ruled that India’s actions have no bearing on its competence to adjudicate the matter.
The court found that its competence cannot be affected by the unilateral decision of a party taken after the initiation of arbitral proceedings, regardless of whether India’s recent decision was characterised as a suspension of the treaty, or otherwise.
The court further found that it has a continuing responsibility to advance proceedings in a timely, efficient and fair manner, notwithstanding India’s position on “abeyance”.
It also declared that these findings also apply to the Neutral Expert, appointed in separate proceedings.
The decision, which was hailed by Islamabad and “rejected by New Delhi, marks a major legal win for Pakistan. At the heart of the decision is a clear message that India cannot unilaterally suspend or sideline the treaty.
 
 

The court based its ruling firmly on the treaty’s text, especially Article XII(4), which says the treaty stays in force unless both countries agree to end it through a formal agreement. This leaves no room for one side to walk away or put the treaty on pause. This is consistent with the provisions of international law, particularly the principle of pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept).
The ruling also emphasises the importance of the treaty’s built-in dispute resolution system. According to the court, letting one country unilaterally ignore the arbitration process would undermine the treaty’s very purpose. This reflects the principle that treaties should be interpreted in a way that gives their provisions real meaning and effect.
Crucially, the court has rejected India’s claim that it could simply pull out of the proceedings and halt arbitration. It has also reaffirmed its own authority to decide on its jurisdiction, pointing out that once the process has started, it can’t be disrupted by one party backing out.
‘Supplemental award’
Friday’s decision by The Hague-based Court of Arbitr­ation was a ‘Supplemental Award on the Competence of the Court’ in a matter initiated by Pakistan.
In these proceedings, Pakistan had requested the court to address the interpretation and application of IWT to certain design elements of the run-of-river hydro-electric projects (Kishen­ganga and Ratle) that India was permitted by the treaty to construct on the tributaries of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab, before those rivers flow into Pakistan.
In the unanimous decision, the court found that its competence cannot be affected by the unilateral decision of a party taken after the initiation of the arbitral proceedings, regardless of whether India’s recent decision was characterized under international law as a suspension of the treaty or otherwise.
Pakistan had initiated the present arbitral proceedings in 2016. Subsequently, India reques­ted that the World Bank appoint a neutral expert (a highly-qualified engineer) to address certain design and operation questions that were essentially identical to some of the questions presented by Pakistan in its request for arbitration.
In December 2016, the World Bank, which has a special but essentially ministerial role under the Treaty, decided to “pause” the process of appointing the Chairman of the Court of Arbitration and the Neutral Expert. This pause was lifted in 2022, following which the Court of Arbitration was empaneled and the neutral expert was appointed.
On July 6, 2023, the Court issued its Award on the Competence of the Court, in which the court carefully considered objections to the competence of the Court raised by India (by way of correspondence to the World Bank).
In a unanimous decision, the court rejected each of the objections raised by India and determined that the court is competent to consider and determine the disputes set forth in Pakis­tan’s request for arbitration.
The court then recalled the well-settled rule of customary international law that events occurring after the initiation of proceedings can have no effect on the jurisdiction of the relevant court or tribunal.
This rule, reflected in decisions of the International Court of Justice and international arbitral tribunals, confirmed the Court’s conclusion that, once established, the court’s jurisdiction cannot be defeated by a party’s unilateral action.
Applying these findings to India’s decision that the “Indus Waters Treaty 1960 will be held in abeyance with immediate effect”, the court found that it was not open to India to take unilateral action to suspend these proceedings, regardless of how India’s position was characterized or justified under international law.
Reactions from Islamabad, New Delhi
The government of Pakistan noted that the court had affirmed its competence in the light of recent developments, and that unilateral action by India cannot deprive either the court or the Neutral Expert, in the proceedings initiated by India, of their competence to adjudicate the issues before them.
Pakistan looks forward to receiving the court’s award on the First Phase on the Merits in due course following the hearing that was held in Peace Palace in The Hague in July 2024, a statement said.
The high priority, at this point, the statement said, was that India and Pakistan find a way back to a meaningful dialogue, including on the application of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
 
 

It recalled that to this end, PM Shehbaz Sharif had stated on June 24, 2025 that Pakistan was “ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu & Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism.”
Meanwhile, India “categorically rejected” the supplemental award by the Court of Arbitration on its Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects, saying that it “never recognised” the Court of Arbitration.
“India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,” India’s Ministry of External Affairs said.
“Today, the illegal Court of Arbitration, purportedly constituted under the Indus Waters Treaty 1960, albeit in brazen violation of it, has issued what it characterises as a “supplemental award” on its competence concerning the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.”
The MEA described the Court of Arbitration’s latest declarations as a “charade at Pakistan’s behest”.
 
 

“Until such time that the Treaty is in abeyance, India is no longer bound to perform any of its obligations under the Treaty. No Court of Arbitration, much less this illegally constituted arbitral body, which has no existence in the eye of law, has the jurisdiction to examine the legality of India’s actions in exercise of its rights as a sovereign,” it said.

“Based on this egregious tax, we are hereby terminating all discussions on trade with Canada, effective immediately,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform.
He added that Canada will soon find out the levy it needs to pay to do business in the United States, calling his country’s northern neighbour “very difficult” to trade with.
 


Washington has previously taken issue with Canada’s digital services tax, requesting dispute settlement talks last year over the matter.
While Canada’s digital services tax is not new — it was enacted last year — US service providers are “on the hook for a multi-billion dollar payment in Canada” by June 30, noted the Computer and Communications Industry Association.
While Canada has been spared from some of Trump’s most sweeping duties, such as a 10 per cent rate imposed in early April on nearly all trading partners, it faces a separate tariff regime.
Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has also imposed steep levies on imports of steel, aluminium and autos.
Last week, Canada said it would adjust its 25pc counter tariffs on US steel and aluminium after Washington doubled its levies on imports of both metals to 50pc — if a trade deal was not reached within 30 days.</p><small>2025-06-27 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611294-pakistan-welcomes-arbitration-court-ruling-on-iwt' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan wins key round in Indus Waters Treaty dispute with India</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s unproven allegations. As part of its global outreach, a delegation led by Bilawal visited the United States, London and Brussels.
Addressing reporters at the National Press Club in Islamabad, the PPP chairman stressed that through spreading false information, both in the media and through diplomatic channels, India stripped itself of credibility.
“Pakistan gained victory on the narrative front, which is beneficial,” Bilawal said. “The whole world saw what the Indian [and] Pakistani media were doing.
 
 

“People all over the world were reading and accepting Pakistani media reports. The entire world knew that [the Indian] government was already lying, and their media had insinuated that they produced credible journalism,” the PPP chairman added.
Addressing reporters, he said, “You showed in these five days that we have an impartial and credible media. Every country has their problems, but the Pakistani media community played the biggest role in the narrative victory during those five days, due to the media community’s credibility.”
Thanking the journalist community for their accuracy and reporting, Bilawal added that he was proud of how Gen Z — the first generation born into the digital age — handled social media during the four-day war.
“For politicians, our word is our weapon; every political party handled the narrative the way they could, not just on local forums but internationally as well,” he stated. “But even more than that, Pakistani media’s role was historic, and their credibility was established on an international level during those five days.”
Speaking further, Bilawal emphasised that India, for the first time, spread disinformation through diplomatic channels, not just through the mass media.
“This is the first time our neighbour was communicating lies on even diplomatic hotlines to different countries,” he lamented. “India didn’t show transparency, which is why its credibility suffered.”
He added that it took India a month to accept their missile “might have been neutralised”, while Pakistan openly confirmed shooting down a number of their aircraft in self-defence.
“India’s war was based on lies; that’s when Pakistan stood with the truth,” Bilawal stated. “When they blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgham attack, we didn’t deny history. If our PM hadn’t asked for an impartial investigation on an international level, then India would have been successful in convincing the world that we were behind the Pahalgham attack.”
Bilawal said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “took the right decision at the right time, which is why we could establish credibility”. The PPP chairman also said that Pakistan’s own “credibility problem” was largely resolved through making the media more transparent.
“We speak not just for the Pakistani people but for the Indian people, too. We don’t want hatred to pass down through generations. The new generation will not accept India’s message of hate.”
Military parity and peace
The PPP chairman noted that during the conflict, Pakistan not only established its credibility on the international stage, but it also highlighted that it is a military power on par with its much larger neighbour.
“For Pakistan, it is a big victory that we shot down their missile,” he said. “We have established military parity.
“Look at how big a defeat it is for India: as soon as we (the delegation) were leaving America, one of their military officers, under oath to their House, said that Pakistan is a phenomenal partner in the fight against terrorism,” he added, referring to US Central Command chief Army General Michael Kurilla. “This is their strategic partner saying this.”
The PPP chief also highlighted that following the operation, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was invited to the White House for lunch, hailing it as a “major achievement”.
Stating that Pakistan wants to resolve issues through dialogue and under the framework of international law, Bilawal accused India of pursuing a more warlike agenda, through steps such as Operation Sindoor and the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.
“India’s case is that Pakistan is ‘Terroristan’, that they will stop our water and kill us through thirst,” the PPP chairman said. “They conspired to label Pakistan as a terrorist state. We foiled that conspiracy. We got Pakistan off the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) grey list and onto the white list. India failed on every front.
“A ceasefire between Pakistan and India means dialogue should follow,” he maintained. “In principle, India should engage in dialogue. The Indian prime minister told Pakistan’s youth, ‘eat bread or face bullets’.”
Bilawal maintained that Pakistan was a nation that wants peace and operates with a “peace through strength” policy.
“We want peace between both countries,” Bilawal said. “Principally, that is what India should do, but India now calls this ceasefire a ‘pause’. He (Indian PM Narendra Modi) is not a peacemaker but a warmonger.
“Modi was once the Butcher of Gujarat, then the butcher of Kashmir, and now he wants to become the butcher of the Indus Valley Civilisation,” Bilawal warned, although he expressed hope that the US was “trying to fulfil the promise they made to us and to maintain peace”.
Nuclear thresholds
Speaking about the Kashmir issue, Bilawal highlighted that the dispute had become internationalised, contrary to New Delhi’s goals.
“India constantly tried to keep the Kashmir issue an internal one, but after the war, it has become an international issue,” he said. “An issue which can lead to a war between two nuclear countries cannot be an internal issue. Even India, instead of calling it an internal issue, is calling it a bilateral issue now.”
In response to a question about the US-mediated ceasefire, Bilawal challenged Indian claims that New Delhi did not request one by saying: “If Modi says India didn’t wish for a ceasefire, he should simply say once that Trump is lying.”
The PPP leader also highlighted that there are no mechanisms between the two to resolve nuclear disputes.
“We are the only two nuclear-armed countries that have no nuclear dispute resolution mechanism. We brought the threshold down so much that if there is any terrorist attack in any country, that means there will be a war,” Bilawal noted.
“In such conditions, Pakistan’s stance is a position of a responsible state, a responsible nuclear power. India’s position is of a revisionist power that doesn’t abide by international law and the international rules-based order, and if it insists on keeping the entire world on tenterhooks, then it is not responsible enough to have a nuclear power,” the PPP chief stated.</p><small>2025-06-27 18:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/27220137889b0e1.jpg?r=220203' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920607/fo-welcomes-un-decision-to-remove-all-references-to-pakistan-from-report-on-children-and-armed-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>FO welcomes UN decision to remove all references to Pakistan from report on children and armed conflict</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday welcomed the United Nations Secretary General’s decision to remove references to Pakistan from its annual report on children and armed conflict.
The UN’s Children and Armed Conflict agenda, led by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, works to protect children affected by war by monitoring six grave violations: killing and maiming, recruitment and use of children, sexual violence, abduction, attacks on schools and hospitals, and denial of humanitarian access. The annual report of the Secretary-General lists parties committing these violations, aiming to hold them accountable and promote measures for child protection in conflict zones.
In its latest report released on June 17, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General noted that, “In view of the level of grave violations in Pakistan and the preventive measures adopted as agreed by the government in June 2025 in cooperation with the United Nations to protect children, the situation of Pakistan will be removed from my next report.”
A statement issued by the FO said, “This significant outcome is a testament to the Government of Pakistan’s constructive, sustained, and intensive engagement with the United Nations, including close cooperation with the Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary General for Children and Armed Conflict.”
The statement said that the decision was an international recognition of the “strong institutional, legislative, and policy measures implemented by Pakistan” for children’s rights and well-being.
“It is an affirmation of Pakistan’s firm commitment to aligning its national legal and institutional frameworks with international norms and best practices for safeguarding children affected by conflict and violence,” the statement added.
It mentioned that Pakistan reaffirmed its commitment to collaborate closely with the United Nations to enhance and strengthen efforts for protecting and promoting children’s rights, ensuring a safer and brighter future for generations to come.
 






Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also welcomed the decision, stating, “This reflects our sustained, constructive engagement and reaffirms Pakistan’s commitment to child protection.”
“It also marks a significant recognition of Pakistan’s national efforts to uphold child rights and ensure their well-being,” he wrote on X.
 






From Gaza to the Democratic Republic of Congo, violence against children in conflict zones reached “unprecedented levels” in 2024, the UN’s annual report said on Monday.
The report verified 41,370 grave violations against children in 2024, including 36,221 committed in 2024 and 5,149 committed previously but confirmed in 2024 — the highest number since the monitoring tool was established nearly 30 years ago.
The new high beats 2023, another record year, which itself represented a 21pc increase over the preceding year. With more than 4,500 killed and 7,000 injured, children continue to bear “the brunt of relentless hostilities and indiscriminate attacks,” the report said.</p><small>2025-06-27 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/272037326a91fd4.jpg?r=204946' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920602/us-supreme-court-curbs-power-of-individual-judges-to-block-trump' target='_blank'><strong>US Supreme Court curbs power of individual judges to block Trump</strong></a><br><p>The United States Supreme Court handed President Donald Trump a major victory on Friday by curbing the power of lone federal judges to block executive actions.
In a 6-3 ruling stemming from Trump’s bid to end birthright citizenship, the court said nationwide injunctions issued by district court judges “likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to federal courts”.
The top court did not immediately rule on the constitutionality of Trump’s executive order seeking to end automatic citizenship for children born on American soil.
But the broader decision on the scope of judicial rulings will remove a big roadblock to Trump’s often highly controversial orders and reaffirm the White House’s power.
“Federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them,” said Justice Amy Coney Barrett, author of the opinion.
“When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too,” Barrett said in an opinion joined by the other five conservative justices on the court.
The three liberal justices dissented.
The ruling has far-reaching ramifications for the ability of the judiciary to rein in Trump or future American presidents.
The case was ostensibly about Trump’s executive order signed on his first day in office ending birthright citizenship.
But it actually focused on whether a single federal district court judge has the right to issue a nationwide block to a presidential decree with a universal injunction while the matter is being challenged in the courts.
Trump’s birthright citizenship order has been deemed unconstitutional by courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington state, leading the president to make an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in an effort to get the top court to strike down the use of nationwide injunctions.
The issue has become a rallying cry for Trump and his Republican allies, who accuse the judiciary of stymying his agenda against the will of voters.
Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship is just one of a number of his agenda items that have been blocked by judges around the country — both Democratic and Republican appointees — since he took office in January.
During oral arguments in the case before the Supreme Court in May, both conservative and liberal justices had expressed concerns about the increasing use of nationwide injunctions by district courts in recent years.
‘Nuclear weapon’
Justice Samuel Alito, an arch-conservative, said nationwide injunctions pose a “practical problem” because there are hundreds of district court judges and every one of them is “convinced” they know best.
Solicitor General John Sauer compared nationwide injunctions to a “nuclear weapon”, saying they “disrupt the Constitution’s careful balancing of the separation of powers”.
The Trump administration had asked the Supreme Court to restrict the application of a district court’s injunction solely to the parties who brought the case and the district where the judge presides.
Past presidents have also complained about national injunctions shackling their agenda, but such orders have sharply risen under Trump, who has seen more in two months than Democrat Joe Biden did during his first three years in office.
Trump’s executive order on birthright citizenship decrees that children born to parents in the United States illegally or on temporary visas would not automatically become citizens.
The three lower courts ruled that to be a violation of the 14th Amendment, which states: “All persons born or naturalised in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”</p><small>2025-06-27 15:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611263-pti-slams-scs-reserved-seats-verdict-announces-protest' target='_blank'><strong>'Dark day': PTI rejects SC's reserved seats verdict, announces protest</strong></a><br><p>

Commissioner Meike Kamp said in a statement on Friday that she made the request because DeepSeek illegally transfers users’ personal data to China.
The two US tech giants must now review the request promptly and decide whether to block the app in Germany, she added.
DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment. Apple and Google were not immediately available for comment.
 
 

According to its own privacy policy, DeepSeek stores numerous personal data, such as requests to its AI programme or uploaded files, on computers in China.
“DeepSeek has not been able to provide my agency with convincing evidence that German users’ data is protected in China to a level equivalent to that in the European Union,” Kamp said.
“Chinese authorities have far-reaching access rights to personal data within the sphere of influence of Chinese companies,” she added.
The commissioner said she took the decision after asking DeepSeek in May to meet the requirements for non-EU data transfers or else voluntarily withdraw its app. DeepSeek did not comply with this request, she added.
DeepSeek shook the technology world in January with claims that it had developed an AI model to rival those from US firms such as ChatGPT creator OpenAI at much lower cost. However, it has come under scrutiny in the United States and Europe for its data security policies.
Italy blocked it from app stores there earlier this year, citing a lack of information on its use of personal data, while the Netherlands has banned it on government devices.
US lawmakers plan to introduce a bill that would ban US executive agencies from using any AI models developed in China.

Sri Lanka’s north bore the brunt of the conflict in the 37-year-long Tamil separatist war, which was brought to a bloody conclusion in May 2009. Many among the Tamil minority lost their land title deeds during the years of displacement, and the area was also hit by the 2004 Asian tsunami.
The Supreme Court order concerning nearly 6,000 acres of land came a day after UN human rights chief Volker Turk ended a three-day visit, during which he urged the authorities to return private lands still occupied by troops.
The UN estimates that at least 100,000 people died in the war, with 40,000 of them from the Tamil minority killed by troops in the final months of the conflict.
 
 

Turk also asked Sri Lanka to investigate allegations of war crimes and punish the perpetrators. Successive Sri Lankan governments have refused internationally backed investigations, and there has been no credible local accountability mechanism.
Former Tamil legislator MA Sumanthiran, who petitioned the court, said it has stopped a land grab.
“The government promised three months ago not to go ahead with acquiring these private lands, but never took any action,” Sumanthiran told AFP. “That is why I went to court.”
Sumanthiran said security forces in the northern Jaffna peninsula still occupied about 3,000 acres.</p><small>2025-06-27 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611212-public-anger-erupts-after-rescue-fails-stranded-swat-tourists' target='_blank'><strong>Public anger erupts after rescue fails stranded Swat tourists</strong></a><br><p>

There were at least 127 violent hate-related reports mentioning Mamdani or his campaign in the day after polls closed, said CAIR Action, an arm of the Council on American Islamic Relations advocacy group, which logs such incidents.
That marks a five-fold increase over a daily average of such reports tracked earlier this month, CAIR Action said in a statement.
Overall, it noted about 6,200 online posts that mentioned some form of Islamophobic slur or hostility in that day long time-frame.
Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist and a 33-year-old state lawmaker, declared victory in Tuesday’s primary after former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo conceded defeat.
Born in Uganda to Indian parents, Mamdani would be the city’s first Muslim and Indian American mayor if he wins the November general election.
“We call on public officials of every party — including those whose allies are amplifying these smears — to unequivocally condemn Islamophobia,” said Basim Elkarra, executive director of CAIR Action.
The advocacy group said its hate monitoring system includes its own scraping and analysis of posts, online submissions by the public and notifications from law enforcement. About 62 per cent of the anti-Muslim posts against Mamdani originated on X, CAIR Action said.
People close to Republican President Donald Trump, including one of his sons, are among those spreading anti-Muslim rhetoric, advocates said.
Donald Trump Jr, the president’s son, wrote on X on Wednesday that “New York City has fallen” while sharing a post that said New Yorkers had “voted for” 9/11.
 






Also on Wednesday, Republican US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene posted an AI-generated picture of the Statue of Liberty draped in a burqa.
 






President Trump has pursued domestic policies that rights advocates have described as anti-Muslim, including banning travel from some predominantly Muslim or Arab countries in his first term and attempting to deport pro-Palestinian students in his current term.
The White House, which did not respond to a request for comment, has denied claims of discrimination against Muslims. Trump and his allies have said they oppose Mamdani and others due to what they call the Democrats’ “radical left” ideology.
Threats
The New York City Police Department said earlier this month its hate crime unit was probing anti-Muslim threats against Mamdani.
Manjusha Kulkarni, co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, which documents hate against Asian Americans, and CAIR said attacks against Mamdani mirrored those endured by other South Asian and Muslim political figures, including former Vice President Kamala Harris and Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.
Republicans have called Mamdani antisemitic, citing his pro-Palestinian advocacy and his criticism of Israel’s military assault on Gaza after an attack by Hamas militants in October 2023.
Mamdani has condemned antisemitism and has the backing of New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, who is Jewish. Lander also ran in the Democratic primary.
Rights advocates have noted rising antisemitism and Islamophobia since the start of the Israel-Gaza war, with fatal US incidents including the shooting of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington and the stabbing of a Muslim child in Illinois.
Mamdani and other pro-Palestinian advocates, including some Jewish groups, said their criticism of Israel is wrongly conflated with antisemitism.</p><small>2025-06-27 10:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611213-india-is-biggest-state-sponsor-of-terrorism-in-region-field-marshal-munir' target='_blank'><strong>India biggest state sponsor of terrorism in region, says Field Marshal Munir</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress. This year, Pakistan has undertaken three nationwide Polio campaigns so far — in February, April, and May. Polio eradication efforts in Pakistan routinely face security issues.
According to the press release, the case was detected in an 18-month-old child from the Union Council Amakhel in KP’s Tank district.
“With this latest detection, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 13, including seven from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, four from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” the statement said.
The case comes only a week after KP recorded its sixth case of the year in Bannu in a 33-month-old baby, while another two cases were recorded in the province last month.
In May, Pakistan launched its third drive of the year against the crippling disease aiming to vaccinate 45 million children under the age of five. The government has vowed to eradicate Polio by the end of this year.
“The fight against polio has required a tremendous sacrifice from all stakeholders, including law enforcement personnel who have rendered invaluable services,” Federal Minister for Health Syed Mustafa Kamal said at an event in May.
“This mission will continue until we reach complete eradication,” he added.
“Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, along with timely completion of all essential immunisations,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-06-27 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/27133222efdd8db.jpg?r=133242' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920564/world-bank-reaffirms-support-for-pakistans-economic-agenda' target='_blank'><strong>World Bank reaffirms support for Pakistan’s economic agenda</strong></a><br><p>Federal Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema held high-level discussions on Thursday with the World Bank leadership in Washington DC, and welcomed the strengthened collaboration with the global financial institution in strengthening the economy, according to statement by the ministry on Friday.
In January, the World Bank pledged to provide $20bn to Pakistan under a 10-year country partnership framework (CPF) to support inclusive and sustainable development within the country.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had welcomed a $40 billion “investment” by the World Bank, stating that the inflow will open “a new chapter” in various sectors of the economy.
In a meeting with WB Operations Managing Director Anna Bjerde and South Asia Regional Vice President Martin Raiser, the federal minister welcomed the strengthened collaboration between Pakistan and the Bank over the past year, the statement read.
This enhanced engagement has culminated in the development of the new country partnership framework (CPF) 2026-2035, a transformative ten-year strategy backed by $40bn commitment from the World Bank, it added.
The minister appreciated World Bank’s support, particularly during critical challenges, including the Covid-19 pandemic and devastating 2022 floods.
“As our largest development partner, the World Bank has played an indispensable role in Pakistan’s socio-economic progress and improving the lives of our citizens,” Cheema stated.
With the CPF now successfully launched, the minister emphasised the government is focused on finalising a comprehensive implementation framework in collaboration with the WB.
He welcomed Pakistan’s transition to the WB’s Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region under Vice President Ousmane Dione, noting this move will “create valuable opportunities for knowledge exchange and regional synergy”.
In a separate meeting with WB Executive Director Abdelhak Bedjaoui, the minister acknowledged his effective representation of Pakistan’s economic interests.
Cheema suggested regular visits by the executive directors to constituent countries to better understand development needs and opportunities for the WB’s engagement. They discussed the Bank’s recent approvals, including the $700mn Reko Diq mining project and $400mn risk participation facility.
The minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working closely with the WB country team to achieve the CPF’s development objectives and transformational impacts.
The WB leadership assured full support for the effective implementation of the CPF, underscoring the institution’s continued commitment to Pakistan’s sustainable economic development.</p><small>2025-06-27 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/27125643398908e.jpg?r=125710' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920553/psx-rises-by-nearly-1600-points-a-day-after-federal-budget-is-passed' target='_blank'><strong>PSX rises by nearly 1,600 points a day after federal budget is passed</strong></a><br><p>Bulls regained control of the trading floor as shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) climbed nearly 1,600 points at the close of the first session on Friday, a day after the passage of the federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year.
The KSE-100 index climbed 1581.77 points, or 1.3 per cent, to stand at 123,628.23 at the close of the first session, from the last close of 122,046.46 points.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “[The] passage of [the] federal budget with the absence of aggressive incremental revenue measures and slight relief for salaried and business is also well received by the investors.”
The National Assembly on Thursday passed the federal budget for the FY25-26, with an outlay of Rs17.57 trillion, despite opposition calls for the budgetary proposals to be made public and for the passage to be delayed until public input had been sought.
“The ceasefire between Iran and Israel has redirected investor focus toward improving macroeconomic fundamentals. Lower inflation and a record current account surplus are strengthening the case for a potential decline in interest rates to single digits,” Ashraf added.
He continued that stocks linked to the power sector and oil and gas exploration, along with those in their supply chains, are gaining momentum amid expectations of circular debt clearance before the fiscal year-end.
“We anticipate the market rally to sustain, supported by continued monetary easing, as inflation is projected to fall even below the FY25 estimate of 4.5pc in FY26,” he concluded.
Yesterday, the PSX had reversed its upward trajectory after two days of gains, as investors opted for profit-taking at elevated levels, dragging the benchmark index into the red.
Earlier in the week on Tuesday, shares climbed by 6,079.16 points in the wake of US President Donald Trump announcing a complete ceasefire between Israel and Iran to end a 12-day war.
The benchmark index experienced two days of gains, before reversing trends on Thursday.</p><small>2025-06-27 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/271244126ae99ba.png?r=124458' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920561/india-accused-of-illegal-deportations-targeting-muslims' target='_blank'><strong>India accused of illegal deportations targeting Muslims</strong></a><br><p>India has deported without trial to Bangladesh hundreds of people, officials from both sides said, drawing condemnation from activists and lawyers who call the recent expulsions illegal and based on ethnic profiling.
New Delhi says the people deported are undocumented migrants.
The Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long taken a hardline stance on immigration — particularly those from neighbouring Muslim-majority Bangladesh — with top officials referring to them as “termites” and “infiltrators”.
It has also sparked fear among India’s estimated 200 million Muslims, especially among speakers of Bengali, a widely spoken language in both eastern India and Bangladesh.
“Muslims, particularly from the eastern part of the country, are terrified,” said veteran Indian rights activist Harsh Mander. “You have thrown millions into this existential fear.”
Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy since a mass uprising in 2024 toppled Dhaka’s government, a former friend of India.
But India also ramped up operations against migrants after a wider security crackdown in the wake of an attack in the west — the April 22 killing of 26 people, mainly Hindu tourists, in Indian-held Kashmir.
New Delhi blamed that attack on Pakistan, claims Islamabad rejected, with arguments culminating in a four-day conflict that left more than 70 dead.
Indian authorities launched an unprecedented countrywide security drive that has seen many thousands detained – and many of them eventually pushed across the border to Bangladesh at gunpoint.
‘Do not dare’
Rahima Begum, from India’s eastern Assam state, said police detained her for several days in late May before taking her to the Bangladesh frontier.
She said she and her family had spent their life in India.
 
 

“I have lived all my life here — my parents, my grandparents, they are all from here,” she said. “I don’t know why they would do this to me.”
Indian police took Begum, along with five other people, all Muslims, and forced them into swampland in the dark.
“They showed us a village in the distance and told us to crawl there,” she told AFP.
“They said: ‘Do not dare to stand and walk, or we will shoot you.’”
Bangladeshi locals who found the group then handed them to border police who “thrashed” them and ordered they return to India, Begum said.
“As we approached the border, there was firing from the other side,” said the 50-year-old. “We thought: ‘This is the end. We are all going to die.’”
She survived, and, a week after she was first picked up, she was dropped back home in Assam with a warning to keep quiet.
‘Ideological hate campaign’
Rights activists and lawyers criticised India’s drive as “lawless”.
“You cannot deport people unless there is a country to accept them,” said New Delhi-based civil rights lawyer Sanjay Hegde.
Indian law does not allow for people to be deported without due process, he added.
Bangladesh has said India has pushed more than 1,600 people across its border since May.
Indian media suggests the number could be as high as 2,500.
The Bangladesh Border Guards said it has sent back 100 of those pushed across — because they were Indian citizens.
India has been accused of forcibly deporting Muslim Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, with navy ships dropping them off the coast of the war-torn nation.
Many of those targeted in the campaign are low-wage labourers in states governed by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, according to rights activists.
Indian authorities did not respond to questions about the number of people detained and deported.
But Assam state’s chief minister has said that more than 300 people have been deported to Bangladesh.
Separately, Gujarat’s police chief said more than 6,500 people have been rounded up in the western state, home to both Modi and interior minister Amit Shah.
Many of those were reported to be Bengali-speaking Indians and later released.
 
 

“People of Muslim identity who happen to be Bengali speaking are being targeted as part of an ideological hate campaign,” said Mander, the activist.
Nazimuddin Mondal, a 35-year-old mason, said he was picked up by police in the financial hub of Mumbai, flown on a military aircraft to the border state of Tripura and pushed into Bangladesh.
He managed to cross back, and is now back in India’s West Bengal state, where he said he was born.
“The Indian security forces beat us with batons when we insisted we were Indians,” said Mondal, adding he is now scared to even go out to seek work.
“I showed them my government-issued ID, but they just would not listen.”</p><small>2025-06-27 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611191-five-bodies-recovered-after-18-members-of-same-family-swept-away-in-swat-river' target='_blank'><strong>Swat River tragedy: Nine dead, four missing after 17 swept away by flash floods</strong></a><br><p>
