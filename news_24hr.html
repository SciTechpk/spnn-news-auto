Rind, the special aide to the Chief Minister for political and media affairs, said on X that over 70 terrorists had been killed over the past two days at different locations by security forces across the province.
“Following this, terrorists attempted to carry out attacks at a few places in Balochistan, which the police and the Frontier Corps (FC) thwarted by taking timely action.”







According to a Dawn correspondent, while mobile phone services were working, data services were suspended in Quetta, Sibi and Chaman.
An emergency was imposed in all government hospitals across the province on the directives of Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar and Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman.
Kakar was supervising the provision of medical treatment to those “injured in the Quetta firing”, a statement from the provincial health department said.
The health minister directed Quetta Trauma Centre Managing Director Dr Arbab Kamran and Quetta Civil Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Abdul Hadi Kakar to ensure the “immediate” provision of medical facilities.
According to the statement, the operating theatres of the Quetta Trauma Centre and Civil Hospital have been put on alert, and additional doctors have been deployed.

The two had fallen into the sewer at the site of the under-construction Data Darbar expansion project near Bhatti Gate on Wednesday. While the woman’s body was found late at night the same day, the 10-month-old child’s body was recovered on Thursday.
Earlier, police presented the arrested officials before the magistrate at district courts and sought their 14-day physical remand. The request was heard by Judicial Magistrate Shafqat Abbas.
During the hearing, a counsel for the accused opposed the police plea, arguing that a physical remand was unnecessary.
The defence counsel informed the court that Rs10 million had been paid to the aggrieved family in the form of a cheque on humanitarian grounds, producing a photocopy of the cheque issued.
He admitted that the incident was tragic.
The magistrate approved a four-day remand, directing that the police complete their investigation during the remand period and produce the suspects again on February 3.
In the court order seen by Dawn, the investigating officer (IO) was directed to also investigate the case “on the aspect of contributory negligence of officers/officials of Wasa (Water and Sanitation Agency) and the civil administration as well responsible to look after the ongoing construction project at the place of occurrence”.
Last month, a seven-year-old boy in Punjab’s Bahawalpur district fell into an open manhole in Dhanote town near Lodhran city and died.
The same month, a three-year-old boy’s body was recovered from an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal area, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.</p><small>2026-01-31 07:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/31093430ce97d1d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970095/imrans-procedure-completed-smoothly-vitals-remained-stable-pims-executive-director' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s procedure completed ‘smoothly’, vitals remained ‘stable’: Pims executive director</strong></a><br><p>The executive director of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, revealed early on Saturday that the eye procedure of incarcerated former premier Imran Khan was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention.
The video statement by the hospital’s head comes after the PTI approached the Supreme Court on Friday, seeking its assistance in arranging a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians, with the help of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP).
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had earlier confirmed that Imran underwent a “20-minute” medical procedure for an eye ailment on the night of January 24 at Pims in Islamabad.

 


“It (the procedure) was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes. During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions and follow-up advice and documents,” said Sikander.
The doctor said the former premier, aged 74, complained of “reduced vision in his right eye”, adding that a “qualified ophthalmologist” from the hospital conducted a “complete eye assessment at Adiala jail”.
Sikander elaborated that the doctor dispatched to the prison conducted “strict lab examination, [ocular] endoscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, essential laboratory tests and OCT of the retina”.
He added that based on the initial assessment, the diagnosis of right central vein occlusion was made and a hospital-based treatment was recommended.

 

“Accordingly, Mr Niazi was brought to Pims on the night of last Saturday, Sunday for the advised procedure.”
The head of the hospital said Imran, after arrival at Pims, was “explained in full” about the procedure.
“Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure. The procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocol and monitoring,” said Dr Sikander.
Imran’s eye condition and ‘secret transfer’ to Pims
On January 28, the PTI said had raised concerns about Imran’s health, saying it had learned through credible reports that he had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye, which could cause permanent eyesight damage if not treated promptly.
The party had alleged that the jail administration was insisting that the treatment be provided inside the prison, contrary to a medical expert’s advice to take him to a hospital.
The next day, a report, quoting a senior doctor at Pims, said Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on the night of January 24 for a medical procedure, which was “completed when the time reached in the A.M.”.

 

The doctor said there was “extraordinary movement” on Saturday night, and the operation theatres and the anaesthesia room were cordoned off ahead of Imran’s arrival at Pims.
On Thursday, the information minister confirmed that the PTI founder underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment at Pims on the night of January 24. He said it was a “20-minute” procedure and that the ex-premier was “absolutely healthy”.
Subsequently, the PTI condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians.
The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also termed Imran’s transfer to the hospital without the knowledge of his family and personal physicians a “criminal negligence”.
Imran’s sister, Noreen Niazi, who had earlier raised doubts about his brother’s ailment, reiterated concerns that his family and lawyers were not being kept informed and demanded that his medical reports be made public.
Then on Friday, the PTI staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court, following which it said the ex-premier’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.</p><small>2026-01-31 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/31110913924f9a4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970098/united-states-approves-major-arms-deals-to-saudi-arabia-israel' target='_blank'><strong>United States approves major arms deals to Saudi Arabia, Israel</strong></a><br><p>The United States on Friday approved multibillion-dollar weapons sales to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, at a point of high tensions with Iran.
The State Department said it green-lighted a $3.8-billion sale of 30 Apache attack helicopters to Israel, which has agreed to a fragile ceasefire in Gaza.
“The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability,” the State Department said in a statement.
“This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” it said.
Also in the package was a $1.8 billion sale of joint light tactical vehicles.
The United States sends billions of dollars worth of military supplies per year to Israel, largely in aid rather than sales.
Israel and Hamas reached a US-backed ceasefire in October that largely paused two years of war.
Tensions are high elsewhere in the region as the United States deploys a major military contingent in waters near Iran.
The State Department also approved a $9-billion sale to Saudi Arabia for 730 Patriot missiles, which are used to defend against incoming attacks.
Israel last year carried out a major bombing campaign against nuclear and other military sites in Iran.
Iran has faced growing pressure after major protests against the clerical state, which has responded by killing thousands of protesters.
Saudi Arabia has voiced caution about an attack on Iran as Gulf monarchies fear instability that could jeopardise their reputation as business havens.
The Trump administration has said that the Gaza ceasefire is now in its second phase, with a focus on disarming Hamas.
Earlier in November, US President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia was being designated as a “major, non-Nato ally”.
The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments.
The White House also announced the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the Kingdom, however, the jets will be less advanced than those operated by Israel, in line with a US law that guarantees Israel’s military edge in the region.</p><small>2026-01-31 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/31104926148d1db.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969997/karachi-mayor-wahab-orders-kmc-affairs-probe-after-graft-allegations-surface' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Mayor Wahab orders KMC affairs probe after graft allegations surface</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has ordered an inquiry after the Karachi Constructors Association (KCA) levelled serious allegations of large-scale corruption against officials of the civic body’s engineering department, claiming that billions of rupees in development funds had been misappropriated through fraudulent practices.
The inquiry was announced by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who took notice of the concerns raised by the contractors’ body and directed the municipal administration to conduct a comprehensive and impartial examination of the tendering, bidding and procurement processes within the KMC.
A couple of days ago, the KCA, which represents contractors working with civic bodies and government organisations, accused senior engineering officials of manipulating tenders, procuring substandard materials and awarding contracts to favoured contractors without competitive bidding.
The association also alleged that contractors were subjected to excessive commission demands and blackmailing, making it difficult for them to execute development schemes in a transparent and timely manner.

Asks municipal commissioner to submit report within three days on tendering, bidding, procurement processes

Responding to the allegations, the KMC on Friday issued a statement announcing that Mayor Wahab had taken “serious notice” of the complaints and ordered a comprehensive and impartial inquiry into the matter.

 

According to the statement, the mayor has directed Municipal Commissioner of KMC, Sumera Hussain, to conduct a detailed examination of all aspects of the tendering, bidding and procurement processes under question.
“The inquiry will assess whether established rules, regulations and standard operating procedures were duly followed and determine if any irregularities or lapses occurred at any stage,” the press statement said, adding that the municipal commissioner had been asked to submit a detailed report within three days.
The mayor reiterated that transparency, accountability and fair governance remained top priorities of the metropolitan administration.
He assured contractors, stakeholders and the public that any individual found responsible for misconduct or violations of rules would be dealt with strictly in accordance with law, without discrimination.
At the same time, the statement noted that if the allegations were found to be baseless, the facts would be placed on record to protect the credibility of the institution and its officials.
Meanwhile, KCA chairman S.M. Naeem Kazmi welcomed the move, but cautioned that the inquiry should be conducted in its true spirit and not merely as a formality.
“We want to make it clear that growing corruption has made it impossible for us to compete. We welcome the mayor’s decision, but he must ensure that the inquiry produces the desired results,” he said.

Will it be able to extricate itself from the self-made problem of creating cycles of foreign exchange shortages and bare sufficiency (after IMF help), accompanied by fiscal profligacy as seen in its inability to contain needless expenditures and raise sufficient revenues to keep its debt at sustainable levels? For answers, we would need to contemplate our economic history, which readers can do at their leisure.
Here, let’s first look at the similarities between a drug addict and a person addicted to borrowing. A drug addict consumes substances to avoid the pain of withdrawal symptoms or to sustain the feeling of pleasure. A habitual borrower consumes goods or adopts a lifestyle his income can’t afford to sustain. In both cases, the immediate payoff (relief, pleasure, social status) is concrete but the future cost (health collapse, insolvency) remains an abstract, often discounted, idea.
In both cases, an identical ethical and economic problem emerges, which economists call a ‘moral hazard’. It is a state when someone believes he is protected from the consequences of his actions and consequently behaves more carelessly or takes bigger risks. If an addict knows that his family and friends will repeatedly get him medical treatment, the perceived cost of continued drug abuse declines. His behaviour becomes less constrained by the consequences of drug use. The risk of greater and repeated substance consumption rises. Over time, the same drug dose produces reduced effects. The addict takes more to maintain the same psychological state.

There are certain similarities between a drug addict and a person addicted to borrowing.

Similarly, a borrower who expects bailouts, debt rollovers, or forgiveness from lenders may spend money beyond sustainable limits, in the assumption that there will be future relief. In both cases, either there is no full understanding of the consequences of risky behaviour or the risks associated with this behaviour are not accepted. Any external support, though stabilising in the short run, weakens discipline. Initial borrowing solves a temporary problem or boosts consumption. Over time, the income increasingly becomes committed to debt servicing; additional money is borrowed just to maintain the same lifestyle. Debt ceases to fund growth and instead funds survival.
Denial is also a key similarity. The addict says, “I can quit anytime’; the compulsive borrower claims, ‘growth will rebound’. Both ignore warnings and personal narratives are used to postpone reality. This cognitive dimension reinforces the moral hazard and deepens over-indebtedness.
While this discussion is only with reference to individuals, it is surprising to see our governments exhibit similar behaviour (readers need only recall that the current IMF programme is our 25th). Over-borrowing and substance abuse aptly reflect our government’s high debt through the abuse of foreign exchange mostly by keeping the rupee overvalued, which primarily increases imported consumption (together with fiscal profligacy). This abuse is sometimes caused by directly selling foreign exchange to the market, and at others by not buying more from it.

 

How should the problem of ‘moral hazard’ be addressed? This problem does not go away completely but can be lessened by imposing ‘conditions’ on the drug addict, habitual borrower and government by the ‘rescuers’. Family and friends should warn the drug addict that they will not help if he continues with substance abuse. Compassion requires the family to help but with conditions. The family forces him into rehab but bears its costs. The addict, in return, gradually builds discipline to lessen dependence on substances, and eventually drops the habit. Of course, it isn’t that simple. Returning to sobriety depends on the addict’s recognising that he faces a long-term health problem and has to firmly adhere to strict rehab rules. The addict also must have regular therapy sessions.
Of course, the comparison with governments is hardly complete but it does provide insights, the core one being that the addict cannot forgo substance abuse unless he reforms himself. The critical difference for the government in this analogy is that it fully understands the risks associated with over-borrowing. We can give the benefit of the doubt to an addict because the effect of drugs on his nervous system may hamper his understanding of the associated risks to his health and life, but not to the government. Likewise, we can show compassion to the addict but not to the government. Hence, the ethical aspect of the moral hazard is more severe for the government than the addict.
Drug addicts need therapy; should the government also get it? It does in a way — from the IMF in six-monthly reviews, and in between whenever economic symptoms (reflected in data) start signalling deviations from discipline. Therapy in this case is talk about what is a good policy (good economic behaviour) and what is not. Therapy is ineffective in this case because the government is intelligent and already knowledgeable about good policies.
This discussion is not with reference to the current IMF programme, which is going well. It is with reference to the past and future. Our authorities (the IMF uses this term that covers all kinds of governments: democratic, hybrid, autocratic, etc) have shown considerable discipline in generating primary surpluses through raising revenues that cover more than its expenditure (other than interest payments). This, however, came about mostly through increasing taxes on existing taxpayers, without containing unnecessary expenditure. Except for PIA’s recent privatisation, there is no concrete attempt at reform. Good things have happened on the foreign exchange front, not because of reforms, but because of bounty in terms of more remittances that increased dollar reserves. Exports have stagnated and the rupee remains appreciated in real terms. Whenever the dollar build-up is in accordance with the IMF’s prescriptions, the Fund seldom objects to overvalued currency other than urging the authorities to leave the exchange rate to be truly determined in the interbank market. Our analogy with the drug addict leaves us with only one conclusion. Unless our authorities commit to implementing reforms, only they will benefit from the IMF packages, while the masses, who bear the costs of postponed reforms, will continue to suffer.

Published in Dawn, January 31st, 2026</p><small>2026-01-31 04:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/697d419ad8065.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970045/a-rare-opportunity' target='_blank'><strong>A rare opportunity</strong></a><br><p>SIX years ago, one of the rarest moments of consensus was achieved under the then PTI government when prime minister Imran Khan and leader of the opposition Shehbaz Sharif agreed on a consensus candidate for one of the most important constitutional positions for a struggling democracy like Pakistan. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Shehbaz Sharif and his party, the PML-N, had agreed on Imran Khan’s proposed name of Sikandar Sultan Raja as the new chief election commissioner of Pakistan. Prior to that, Imran Khan and his party had bitterly criticised the previous CEC, justice (retired) Sardar Muhammad Raza Khan for his alleged bias and partisanship. Imran Khan had welcomed the appointment of Sikandar Raja as the new CEC and expressed relief that he and his party could, after all, expect fair treatment from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
This sense of relief, however, did not last very long and Imran Khan started criticising the new CEC as well in the harshest of terms. After his removal as PM, he explained that he had proposed Mr Raja’s name at the behest of Gen Qamar Bajwa, then army chief, and he himself didn’t know anything about Mr Raja. This conduct had practically rendered meaningless the constitutional scheme of appointing the CEC and members of the ECP through consensus of the ruling party and the opposition.
Subsequent developments made CEC Raja and his colleagues in the ECP a prime target of the PTI’s criticism with its leader seeing the entire Commission as complicit in depriving the party of its election symbol, holding the PTI responsible for receiving prohibited foreign funding and stripping it of reserved seats during the 2024 election cycle.
As Mehmood Khan Achakzai has finally assumed the mantle of the new leader of the opposition, another rare opportunity is at hand to appoint a new consensus CEC and two ECP members, without allowing consensus to be induced by a third party. If free, fair and credible elections have to be ensured, the new appointees should not only be strictly non-partisan but also brave enough to withstand any external pressure to influence the outcome of the election — certainly, a tall order.

One hopes that the PM and opposition leader strive for a consensus on the next CEC.

The consultation on the appointment of the CEC and ECP members should ideally be initiated about three months before the expiry of the incumbents’ term to ensure the timely completion of the consultative process between the leaders of the House and opposition and in the parliamentary committee. But fresh appointments have generally been made after a delay which has even extended to more than a year.

 

Before the 26th Constitutional Amendment of 2024, the CEC and ECP members would retire upon the completion of their terms. But after the amendment, incumbents can indefinitely continue in their positions until their successors assume office. The government, which seems to be quite happy with the incumbents, therefore, doesn’t lose anything by continuing with the status quo. The opposition, especially the PTI, on the other hand, would like to see the incumbents replaced as soon as possible, so it is in the interest of the opposition to actively participate in the consultative process mandated by the Constitution.
The process is usually initiated by the PM and this is what Shehbaz Sharif did by formally inviting Omar Ayub, the former leader of the opposition, for a consultative meeting in May last year. Sadly, Omar Ayub, instead of accepting the invitation, refused to meet the PM and, instead, asked the Speaker of the National Assembly to constitute a parliamentary committee for the purpose. But, as per the Constitution, the parliamentary committee cannot be formed before the consultation between the PM and leader of the opposition has concluded. The opportunity for making headway on the fresh appointments of CEC and ECP members was, therefore, lost.
It is hoped that PM Shehbaz Sharif will extend a fresh invitation to the new leader of the opposition to meet and hold consultations on the three pending appointments in the ECP. It is also hoped that Mr Achakzai, unlike his predecessor, will not miss the opportunity and strive to reach a consensus. If they can agree on three names for each position, it would become easier for the parliamentary committee to pick a candidate for each position. The consensus between the PM and opposition leader can’t be ruled out because, after all, Imran Khan and Shehbaz Sharif had once agreed on the name of a new CEC back in 2020. Even if the two do not agree on the names, the process would move forward as each would then give three names for each position, which would mean that the parliamentary committee would have to consider six names for each position and agree on one. This process would not be easy as the parliamentary committee would have equal representation from the ruling party and the opposition, as indicated in the Constitution, and a decision by the committee would be made by a two-thirds majority as provided in the committee rules. Reaching cross-party consensus in a 12-member committee will be more complicated and the process may stall for a long time. It will, therefore, be far better that a consensus is reached during the meeting of the PM and opposition leader.
The constitutional provision prior to the 26th Amendment was more in conformity with the spirit of the basic law, ie, the CEC and ECP members should not expect an extension of their terms so they would not be tempted to extend any favours to the government. The provision of de facto extension in the tenures of the CEC and ECP members by allowing them to stay in their positions indefinitely under the 26th Amend­ment, runs counter to the original scheme. It is, therefore, much better to make fresh appointments in the ECP as soon as possible.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Thursday, reaffirming the need for “sustained dialogue and diplomatic engagement” at this critical time.
The foreign ministers of both states also had a phone conversation, with Ishaq Dar emphasising that diplomacy was “the only viable way forward”. Meanwhile, a Foreign Office statement correctly pointed out that “this region cannot afford war”, adding that Pakistan opposes “the use of force … against Iran” as well as interference in Iran’s internal affairs.
Pakistan’s stance is in line with the regional consensus, as previously both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have stated that their soil and facilities will not be used against the Islamic Republic. Turkiye is similarly ramping up diplomatic efforts; the Turkish foreign minister hosted his Iranian counterpart on Friday in an effort to prevent the march towards a new, devastating regional war.

 

Pakistan has a long border with Iran, and any instability in the region will directly affect this country. While there have been ups and downs, the Pakistan-Iran relationship has been largely cordial. Along with a joint frontier, both nations share historical, cultural and spiritual ties. Moreover, Pakistan has displayed moral clarity by opposing foreign intervention against a sovereign state. The Gulf monarchies are similarly wary of the fallouts of an American attack, mainly because senior Iranian officials have said US bases in the region will be targeted if Iran is attacked.
However, there are media reports that suggest the Americans are trying to pressure Riyadh into quietly acquiescing to a US attack. The Saudi defence minister is currently in Washington. The US should abandon its threatening posture against Iran and come to the table while respecting Iran’s sovereignty. The Iranians say they have drawn lessons from last year’s US-Israeli aggression, and will hit back harder.
Hence, the American presumption that this will be a short, clean campaign is erroneous; any war will be bloody and incredibly destructive for the global economy. Yet Iran must also make efforts to address the legitimate grievances of its people and improve the rights situation, though any change must be internal, and not orchestrated from abroad.

In a conversation with Dawn, Ms Bokhari said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had enforced strict adherence to professional standards, ensuring lawmakers from the ruling party had no influence over transfer and posting decisions.
“Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has fully ensured that all postings and transfers in Punjab are made purely on merit, thus ending Sifarish [nepotism] culture,” Ms Bokhari said.
“She ensured during her two-year tenure that not a single appointment, even that of an SHO, is made on someone’s reference. This thing was hardly witnessed in the past.”
The “strict policy” has reportedly caused friction within the party. According to Ms Bokhari, some PML-N lawmakers, frustrated that the bureaucracy no longer obliged their requests, conveyed concerns to party head Nawaz Sharif.

Minister Azma Bokhari claims ‘Sifarish culture’ dismantled from province, merit system enforced

The party chief reportedly rebuffed them, maintaining that his daughter was following merit.
Ms Bokhari emphasised the neutrality of the new system, noting that bureaucrats associated with the opposition PTI party were retained if they met professional criteria.
“The chief minister’s direct engagement in evaluating senior officers underscores an emphasis on accountability and professional competence,” the minister said. “Officers demonstrating strong performance are formally recognised, reinforcing incentives for integrity and service delivery.”
Regarding development projects worth billions of rupees, Ms Bokhari said the chief minister had established a transparent spending mechanism that excluded lawmakers from handling funds directly.
“The lawmakers, however, can give proposals regarding the development works and have an oversight on them,” she said.
The minister outlined a governance model centred on technology and structural reform, designed to replace ad hoc initiatives with integrated digital systems.
This shift includes the implementation of e-FOAS (filing and office automation systems) and e-procurement to manage administrative functions ranging from pension cases to contract awards.
“Rather than relying on ad hoc initiatives, the focus has been on structural reform — particularly through the integration of digital systems across government departments,” Ms Bokhari said.
Shift towards e-governance
“This shift toward e-governance aims to modernise state institutions, reduce discretionary power, and align provincial administration with contemporary global practices.”
To bolster transparency, the government has mandated third-party validation for development schemes and digitised the entire procurement cycle, from advertisement to bid submission.
“The system enforces compliance with procurement rules, safeguards data integrity, and minimises human intervention,” Ms Bokhari said. “Open access to tender information and digital bidding has promoted competition and transparency, resulting in notable savings for the public exchequer.”
The administration has trained 14,216 officials from 6,641 offices across the province in these e-procurement procedures to support the transition. Additionally, the launch of an e-Biz Portal has streamlined the acquisition of no-objection certificates, reducing opportunities for corruption.
“Public welfare, transparent development, and institutional efficiency remain the true benchmarks of leadership, and it is against these standards that the Punjab government’s record is increasingly being judged,” she said.

ISLAMABAD: Counsel for PTI founder Imran Khan has written to the Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), seeking consolidation of all cases pending against him before the high court and requesting urgent hearings, particularly in the matters relating to the suspension of his sentence in £190 million corruption and Toshakhana cases.
In the letter, the counsel submitted that several petitions filed on behalf of Imran Khan are currently pending before different benches of the IHC, arising out of various FIRs and proceedings. He argued that the multiplicity of cases and their fixation before different benches has created serious legal and practical difficulties, not only for the petitioner but also for the court system.
The lawyer maintained that most of the cases involve common questions of law and fact, including allegations of political victimisation, misuse of criminal law, and denial of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. In this context, he requested that all matters pertaining to Imran Khan be clubbed and heard together by an appropriate bench to ensure consistent and effective adjudication.
Referring specifically to the petition seeking suspension of Imran Khan’s sentence, the lawyer stressed that the matter involves the liberty of a former prime minister and the leader of the country’s largest opposition party. He contended that continued incarceration, despite pending legal remedies, amounts to grave injustice and violates the right to due process.
The letter stated that the suspension plea has been pending for some time and that repeated adjournments or delayed fixation have caused serious prejudice to the petitioner. The counsel urged the chief justice to exercise administrative powers to fix the case for an urgent hearing, keeping in view its constitutional and legal significance.
The lawyer further argued that Imran Khan is facing an extraordinary number of cases across different forums, many of which, he claimed, stem from similar facts and alleged actions.

 

He submitted that such fragmentation of litigation not only prolongs proceedings but also burdens the judiciary and increases the risk of conflicting orders.
According to the letter, consolidation of the cases would serve the interests of justice, judicial economy, and transparency. The counsel maintained that hearing all related matters together would enable the court to comprehensively examine the legal issues involved and pass effective orders.
The letter also highlighted that Imran Khan, being in custody, faces serious difficulties in pursuing multiple proceedings simultaneously.
The counsel argued that access to legal remedies is a fundamental right and should not be rendered illusory by procedural hurdles or delays.

ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric emphasised that while recent prisoner exchanges allowed families to mourn or reunite, the civilian population remains in a desperate struggle for survival against harsh winter conditions and devastated infrastructure in the besieged territory.
“States must harness the momentum generated by the first phase of the agreement between Israel and Hamas to urgently improve the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza,” Spoljaric said.
For the past 15 weeks, the ICRC has worked with mediators to facilitate the return of prisoners and the remains of the deceased.

Israeli kills three more Palestinians in Gaza

However, Spoljaric stressed that humanitarian steps are irreplaceable on the path to peace. She explicitly called on Israel to ease its blockade on so-called “dual-use” materials — such as water pipes and generators — which remain essential for restoring basic services.
“Many people in Gaza are still living in the rubble without basic services, struggling to stay warm amid harsh winter conditions,” Spoljaric said.
Rafah partial reopening
Following months of pleading from humanitarian organisations and Palestinians, Israel announced on Friday that it would reopen the Rafah crossing on the southern border with Egypt this Sunday on Feb 1.
The crossing, a vital lifeline for aid, has been shuttered by Israeli forces since they seized control of the area.
Israel said the crossing would open for the “limited movement” under the supervision of a European Union mission. Earlier, Hamas demanded the reopening of Rafah and the entry of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza in the territory.
Israel kills again
The Israeli military on Friday killed three more Palestinians in Gaza. Without identifying the victims, the military stated that further strikes were launched and that soldiers continued to conduct searches in the area. Since the truce entered into force, Gaza’s health ministry reports that 492 people have been killed by Israeli fire or bombardment.

ISLAMABAD: Taking exception to archaic expressions common in Sindh, such as Bakhidmat Janaab SHO, the Supreme Court ordered on Friday that the term be discouraged, noting that it had no legal sanction and that a simple address as Janaab would suffice.
The court observed that applications addressed to police officials using Bakhidmat Janaab SHO incorrectly implied that the citizen was at the service of the station house officer.
In fact, the court explained, the SHO was at the service of the citizen.
The court added that such terminology reflected a colonial mindset, in which subjects of the state approached authorities as a matter of mercy rather than as a right.
Authored by Justice Salahuddin Panwhar, a member of the three-judge SC bench, the court had taken up an appeal against a July 2, 2021, order of the Sindh High Court’s Hyderabad bench, which had upheld the life sentence of a petitioner, Muhammad Bux alias Shahzaib, under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code for the murder of Muhammad Abbass in August 2017.
Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, the SC bench, however, rejected the appeal.
During the hearing, the court noted the use of expressions such as Bakhidmat Janaab SHO, as well as Faryaadi and Muddai, in police proceedings. It ordered that police practices be brought in line with Articles 4, 9, 10-A, and 14 of the Constitution.
Alternatives
The court stated that the use of the terms Faryaadi or Muddai in police proceedings should be discontinued. It added that appropriate and legally accurate alternatives should be used, including Itlaah Deendhar or Shikayat Kandhar in Sindhi, and Itlaah Dahinda in Urdu, to reflect the true legal status of the person furnishing the information.
The judgment explained that describing a citizen as a Faryaadi was legally misconceived and constitutionally impermissible, as it demeaned the individual by portraying them as a seeker of favour rather than a rights-bearing individual invoking the protection of the law.
It added that such terminology undermined the dignity of the citizen, which was inviolable under Article 14 of the Constitution, and weakened the concept of equal protection under the law.
Justice Panwhar observed that police officers were public servants entrusted with constitutional and statutory duties. “They are bound to protect life, liberty, and the security of person, values at the core of Article 9 of the Constitution,” the verdict read.
“Police officer are required to serve the citizens as they are remunerated from public funds. Citizens approach the police as a matter of right, not as a charity grace or indulgence. Any institutional practice that reverses this relationship erodes public confidence in the rule of law and weakens constitutional governance,” it added.
The SC noted that the continued use of Faryaadi reflected an outdated and unconstitutional mindset, in which public authorities were seen as rulers rather than servants of the people — a notion explicitly rejected by the Constitution.
It continued that expressions such as Faryaadi and formulaic salutations like Bakhidmat Janaab SHO were remnants of a colonial and pre-constitutional paradigm. “Despite the constitutional transformation brought about by the Constitution of 1973, vestiges of this mindset regrettably persist through institutional habit,” the judgement regretted.

PESHAWAR: The federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa authorities on Friday denied that they gave any permission for starting a military operation in the Tirah Valley of Khyber district.
The denial from both federal and provincial governments came before a bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) comprising Justice Wiqar Ahmad and Justice Mohammad Faheem Wali at the hearing of a petition filed by Barrister Saud Javed Dawar, a member of the National Democratic Movement (NDM).
KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel and Addi­tional Atto­rney General Sana­ullah apprised the high court that their respective governments had not given a nod to the military for launching any operation across the valley.
While directing the Provincial Disaster Manag­ement Authority (PDMA) to provide all possible reliefs to the people displaced from Tirah Valley, the bench summoned IDP representatives on Feb 12, the next date of hearing the matter, so as to verify the government’s claims that it had been extending both financial and material support to the displaced persons. It also sought a report from the PDMA within a week about the facilities provided to them.
Barrister Dawar who appeared along with his counsel Mohammad Yaseen Orakzai sought from the court multiple relief, including declaration that any ‘order and action’ of launching Tirah military operation was “unconstitutional, unlawful and violative of fundamental rights”.
The petitioner also urged the court to direct the respondents, including both federal and KP authorities, to place on record the mechanism, protocol and guidelines for the protection, safety, rehabilitation and repatriation of IDPs as well as financial policy and packages for them.
Without the passage of a resolution by the KP Assembly under Article 232 and approval of Parliament, the military operation couldn’t be launched, the petitioner reminded the PHC.

 

The AG stated that while the provincial government had not approved of any military operation, it had been adopting measures for providing relief to the people who left their homes in Tirah. He said that for that purpose the government had also approved Rs4 billion. However, he said, he would submit a detailed reply about constitutionality of starting any military operation without the approval of the provincial government.
Article 245
A single-page reply of the interior secretary was also submitted to the court, which provided that the deployment of the armed forces for internal security purposes was governed under Article 245, which empowered the federal government to employ the armed forces in aid of civil power.
As per the response, security operations in the Tirah area fall within the constitutional authority of the federal government and are conducted in accordance with the Constitution. “The Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control has not initiated, directed, commanded or operationally supervised any such operation, nor has it issued any formal order, directive or requisition in this regard,” the interior secretary added.
About the petitioner’s stance that a resolution of the provincial assembly was required for proclamation of emergency under Article 232, the ministry explained that the constitutional framework distinguishes clearly between emergency powers under Article 232 and deployment of forces under Article 245.
“Deployment under Article 245 does not require a proclamation of emergency, a resolution of the provincial assembly or approval of either House of the Parliament.
“Matters concerning the protection, rehabilitation, repatriation, financial assistance, health, education, shelter and welfare of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are primarily managed by the Provincial governments, NDMA, PDMA and other relevant civilian departments,” the reply said.
The petitioner contended that as Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had explicitly denied his and his government approval to Tirah operation, the action and order of launching the operation by the federal government was purely unconstitutional.

ISTANBUL: Turkiye intensified a diplomatic push to mediate between Tehran and Washington on Friday as US President Donald Trump appeared to cool his threats of a strike, though Iran warned that its missile capabilities would “never” be on the negotiating table.
Turkish President Re­cep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan led regional efforts to de-escalate tensions that have soared since the US moved military assets to the Middle East following a deadly crackdown on protests in Iran.
While the Pentagon said the military remained ready, Trump lowered the temperature late on Thursday, stating he hoped to avoid conflict and that talks were possible.
Speaking during a visit to Turkiye, Iranian For­eign Minister Abbas Araghchi welcomed the potential for dialogue but drew a hard line regarding national defence.
“I want to state firmly that Iran’s defensive and missile capabilities will never be subject to negotiation,” Araghchi said, adding that his country had no current plans to meet US officials.
Araghchi emphasised that Tehran was “ready to begin negotiations if they take place on an equal footing, based on mutual interests and mutual respect.”
Erdogan spoke by ph­one with Iranian President Masoud Pezes­hkian on Friday, telling his counterpart that Turkiye was “ready to assume a facilitating role between Iran and the United States to de-escalate the tensions”.
Standing alongside Araghchi at a press conference in Istanbul, Fidan said restarting talks over Iran’s nuclear program was “vital for reducing regional tensions”.
He urged Washington to “act with common sense” and resist pressure from Israel, which he said was pushing for a US attack. Fidan also noted he had held discussions with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and would keep lines open to prevent Iran’s isolation.
Despite the diplomatic overtures, significant hurdles remain. The Axios reported on Monday that US officials said any deal must include a cap on Tehran’s long-range missile stockpile, the removal of enriched uranium, and a ban on independent enrichment. Meanwhile, international pressure on Tehran continues to mount. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the BBC on Friday that preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons was “hugely important.”
While stopping short of explicitly supporting a US strike, Starmer condemned the “grotesque” repression of demonstrators.
The European Union also urged against military action but condemned the crackdown by designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a “terrorist organisation”.
Tehran quickly criticised the move. Iran’s judiciary chief called the designation “hostile”, warning that Europe “will suffer the consequences of their foolish act”. Araghchi echoed the sentiment in Istanbul, labelling the designation a mistake and describing Europe as a “continent in decline”.
While diplomatic channels remain active, military readiness continues. Israel’s Ynet news website reported Friday that a US Navy destroyer had docked at the Israeli port of Eilat.
Araghchi told reporters that while Iran has “never sought war,” it remains prepared for any scenario.
“Iran has no problem with negotiations, but negotiations cannot take place under the shadow of threats,” Araghchi said. “They must certainly set aside their threats and change their approach toward a fair and equitable negotiation, as Mr Trump himself said in his post.”
Pezeshkian, in a call with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, reinforced that success depended on the “abandonment of belligerent and threatening actions,” warning that any aggression against Iran would “receive an immediate and firm response”.
Tensions initially spiked following protests that erupted in late December over economic grievances. The demonstrations faced a severe crackdown that peaked on Jan 8 and Jan 9. Iran has accused the United States and Israel of fuelling a “terrorist operation” that transformed peaceful rallies into “riots”.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) confirmed 6,479 people were killed in the demonstrations, including 6,092 protesters and 118 children. Internet restrictions imposed in early January continue to hinder information access.
While rights groups estimate the toll is in the tens of thousands, Iranian authorities have acknowledged more than 3,000 deaths, claiming the majority were security forces or bystanders killed by rioters.

The 10-gram and one-tola silver (24kt) also fell to Rs9,489 and Rs11,069, showing a drop of Rs949 and Rs1,106.
As per rates announced by All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), world gold rates recorded a massive single day record fall in world price to $5,150 per ounce, down by a record $355 per ounce.
APSGJA President Mr Skikarpuri said “this is the biggest ever plunge in my entire career in the gold trade spanning over over five decades. In 1974, the per tola gold rate was Rs240.”
He recalled that the world gold rate had fallen slowly to $245 per ounce from $852 in the entire 1980 period but it cannot match the abrupt single day drop of $355 per ounce on Friday.

Spot gold and silver record worst single-day drop of 8.9pc and 21.92pc to $4,915.17 and $90.66 an ounce

“The gold price is still unaffordable for many jewellery buyers despite falling by Rs35,500 per tola,” he said, adding that jewellery buyers’ footfall at the shops is still very low. However, investors had definitely suffered owing to steep drop in prices.
According to Reuters, gold fell and was poised for its biggest daily loss since 1983, as the dollar strengthened after US President Donald Trump announced his choice for Fed chair, while silver was heading for its worst day on record.
Spot gold dropped 8.9pc to $4,915.17 per ounce at 12:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT), after retreating to an intraday low of $4,898.89 earlier. US gold futures for February delivery slipped 7.7pc to $4,940.70.
The selloff, described by analysts as profit-taking, also pressured other precious metals.
The triggers behind the sell-off could be a combination of factors, ranging from the Fed Chair announcement to broader macro flows, said Suki Cooper, global head, commodities research at Standard Chartered Bank.
Whether we look at the dollar or expectations for real yields, a combination of these drivers has helped trigger profit-taking, she added.
Trump named former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as his choice to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair in May, placing a frequent critic of the central bank in a key leadership role. Gold hit a record peak of $5,594.82 on Thursday and remains on track for a nearly 12pc rise this month.
The US dollar index gained 0.7pc, rebounding from a four-year low earlier this week and making greenback-priced gold more expensive for overseas buyers.
Meanwhile, Joe Cavatoni, Senior Market Strategist, Americas, and Head of Public Policy, US, World Gold Council said, “in an environment shaped by policy uncertainty, rising debt burdens and geopolitical risk, gold is increasingly being viewed as a strategic portfolio allocation rather than a short-term trade.” Gold premiums in India hit decade-highs on investment demand, while China saw gains on jewellery and investment interest.
Among other precious metals, spot silver was down 21.92pc at $90.66 an ounce after dropping as low as $89.93. Prices were on track for their biggest daily drop on record, based on LSEG data available through 1982.
The white metal hit a record high of $121.64 on Thursday and has surged more than 23pc this month.
Spot platinum lost 18pc to $2,155.73 an ounce and palladium plunged 13.7pc to $1,741.36.

Justice Afghan was sp­­eaking at a certificate-aw­arding ceremony for the Leadership and Mana­ge­ment Training Course (Batch-V) for District and Sessions Judges and Sen­ior Civil judges, held at the Federal Judicial Acad­emy (FJA), Islamabad. Jus­­tice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb also attended the ceremony.
In his concluding remarks, Justice Afghan said that a heavy responsibility rests on all district judges, adding that they should always strive to write professional judgements based on facts, law and principles.
Advising the district judiciary judges, Justice Afghan described continuous learning as the “key for judges” to ensure ef­­fective administration of justice. He urged them to never stop learning, avoid prejudice and personal biases, refraining from liking or disliking the parties involved and ensure merit-based recruitment. 

Justice Afghan urges judges to write verdicts based on facts, law and principles

“Honesty is a norm, and impartiality is foundational to ensuring a fair trial and maintaining public confidence in the judicial system,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, Justice Miangul Has­san Aurangzeb “termed the Federal Judicial Academy a “robust institution”, dedicated to the professional development of justice-sector stakeholders and the pursuit of judicial excellence.
He said the Academy welcomes suggestions, feedback and advice aimed at improving course content and structure, refining training, fostering a better learning environment, and ensuring strategic growth. 
“As new statutes are being enacted and laws are being amended, it is the judges who have to interpret them,” Justice Aurangzeb remarked.
He further emphasised that the “rotten system” requires immediate reform at all levels, calling for amendments to antiquated laws. He urged district judiciary judges to work with dedication and honesty, and strictly in accordance with facts and the law, to help create a balanced society.
In his remarks, Director General of the Academy Hayat Ali Shah said that the district judiciary is the central focus of the reform agenda of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, aimed at making the justice system more citizen-centric.

PTI’s Salman Akram Raja made the remarks while speaking to the media outside the SC building, where the party, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, staged a day-long sit-in in an effort to facilitate a meeting between Imran and his personal physicians.
The development comes a day after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed that Imran underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment last week at a hospital in Islamabad. According to the minister, the former premier was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
Speaking outside the SC premises on Friday evening, Raja said, “As you know, we have been outside the SC building all day.”
Afridi and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas were also present alongside Raja.
He said PTI lawmakers were also present at the sit-in, adding that a similar sit-in was staged outside Adiala jail on Thursday night that lasted till 3am on Friday.
“There is nothing more important for us than Imran Khan sahib’s health,” he said. He added that the reports that had emerged about the ex-premier’s health were “unsatisfactory”.
He said that Imran was taken to a hospital, without the family’s knowledge. “And then lies are told. For five days, they say that no such incident has happened,” he said.
Raja said that he had held conversations with the chief justice of Pakistan, his staff and the attorney general for Pakistan all day. However, he said that whatever was “achieved” after their day-long efforts was “unsatisfactory”.
“It has been said that Imran Khan sahib’s medical reports — what happened in Pims hospital, the diagnosis in jail before that — that report will be given to Imran Khan sahib in a sealed envelope. And a copy of that report will be given to family, meaning his sisters, today,” he said.
He said that this would now show what the doctors had diagnosed Imran with and what medical procedure was carried out. “When this report comes in front of us, then the family will decide whether the medical treatment being provided is satisfactory or not,” he said.
He said that the decisions about further treatment would also be made by the family. However, he said that the “real matter” was that Imran was wrongly arrested, calling for him to be released. He said that the party would continue to protest for Imran’s visitation rights.
He said that to decide the future course of strategy, the party’s political committee would meet later in the day. He said that the political party would also speak to the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai, respectively.
“So with their consultation, the PTI’s political party will decide the future course of action. We do not accept this current situation. Reciving the medical report is necessary,” he said.
However, no future course of action as such emerged after the PTI’s political party met with the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leadership.
In a video statement released after the meeting, Achakzai said that the opposition considered reports about Imran’s health a “diversion” from the nationwide protest announced for Feb 8.
“I can say for certain that Imran Khan’s health is not as bad as it is being portrayed. Propaganda is being carried out,” he said. He called on the TTAP parties and the PTI to not back away from their “mission”, calling on the nation to participate in the Feb 8 protest.







PTI camps outside SC
Earlier in the day, PTI workers and lawmakers had camped outside the apex court. The KP chief minister had reached the SC in the morning, after a sit-in outside Adiala jail, which had continued into the early hours of Friday.
He had left for a short period of time to offer Friday prayer at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, before returning to the SC premises. Later, Senate opposition leader Abbas also joined the sit-in.
Speaking to the media during the day, Afridi said, “The whole nation is concerned about the health of the country’s most popular leader, Imran Khan.”
He had stated that he would try to arrange a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians with the help of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP).







The KP chief executive said the party would announce its future course of action if its attempts to arrange a meeting with Imran did not bear fruit. He had also lamented that while the courts were issuing decisions on petitions, “we are not getting justice”.
“Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi’s cases have not been listed for one year. If the cases are listed today and we are provided justice, Khan sahib and Bushra Bibi, along with other leaders, will be released from prison within half an hour,” he claimed.
“We were left with no option, so we opted for the only one available,” he added.
In response to a question on concluding the protest outside Adiala jail, where the KP chief minister, along with other lawmakers and party workers, had camped, he said, “I have come here.”
PTI leaders meet AGP
Following their arrival at the SC, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and party leader and lawmaker Sardar Latif Khosa had met the registrar of the apex court and the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP).
During the meeting, Raja and Khosa had expressed the party’s concern regarding Imran’s eye ailment and requested that the medical report of the doctor who treated the former premier be provided.
Addressing the media outside, Khosa said he reminded the registrar and the attorney general of Pakistan that the CJP should promote good practices before he retired as “this (Imran’s case) is not only a human rights issue, but he (Imran) is also being deprived of his basic rights.”
“He (CJP) has taken an oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of the basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said.
Khosa claimed that the procedure of retina rupture did not last “20-minutes” as shared by the information minister, but “it is 2.5 hours”.
He said Imran’s health was PTI’s “red line” and any matter related to his health “will not be tolerated at any cost”.







“This is his legal and constitutional right,” added Khosa. “I told the registrar to share our concerns with the CJP,” he said.
Khosa also said that Imran was being deprived of his basic rights.







“He (CJP) has taken oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said.
‘Secrecy is cancer to democracy’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan and party leader Babar Awan also addressed the media on Friday at KP House, saying that the “one-point agenda” for the press conference was Imran’s health.
Referring to the former prime minister’s brief stay at Islamabad’s Pims hospital, he said, “Secrecy is cancer to democracy. His (Imran Khan’s) family is worried due to his health.”
Gohar demanded that doctors from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be allowed to examine the former prime minister. “Dr Faisal and Dr Asim should be allowed to meet Khan sahib.”
The party chairman added that neither the party nor Imran’s family was informed about his health or treatment.
Awan, addressing the media, said if the report regarding Imran’s health is not made public, “it will have grave consequences” and added that the party and its supporters were anxious regarding the former premier’s health.

The development came hours after Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Tehran is prepared to resume talks with Washington, but they should be fair and not include Iran’s defence capabilities.
Trump made these remarks while addressing reporters in the Oval Office of the White House.
“We have a large armada, flotilla, you can call it whatever you want, heading to Iran right now. Even larger than what we had in Venezuela,” the president stated.
“Hopefully, we’ll make a deal. If we do make a deal, that’s good; if we don’t make a deal, we’ll see what happens,” Trump added.



Asked if Iran had been given any deadline for a deal on its nuclear programme, ballistic missiles and other issues, Trump replied, “Only they know for sure.” He added that he had communicated that directly.
“We’ll see how it all works out. They have to float someplace, so they might as well float near Iran,” Trump said, replying to a question about pulling back the US presence.
However, he cited what he said was Iran’s decision to halt executions of protesters as evidence to show Tehran was ready to comply.
“I can say this, they do want to make a deal,” Trump said.
Trump declined to say whether, if Iran did not reach a deal, he planned a repeat of the dramatic operation in Venezuela, in which US forces captured President Nicolas Maduro.
“I don’t want to talk about anything having to do with what I’m doing militarily,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-30 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648135-intending-pilgrims-urged-to-complete-biometric-for-hajj-visa-endorsement' target='_blank'><strong>Intending pilgrims urged to complete biometric for Hajj visa endorsement</strong></a><br><p>

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said all images of women were redacted from the documents being released, aside from those of Ghislaine Maxwell, the accomplice of the convicted sex offender.
The latest release is expected to contain previously unseen material from the investigation into Epstein, a wealthy US financier who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking underage girls.
Previous releases have shed light on Epstein’s ties to leading business executives, celebrities, academics and politicians, including Trump and former president Bill Clinton.
Perhaps the most significant documents published so far are two FBI emails from July 2019, which mention 10 “co-conspirators” of Epstein.
Only one person — Epstein’s former girlfriend Maxwell — has ever been charged in connection with his crimes, and the names of the alleged “co-conspirators” are redacted from the emails.
Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Epstein, whose death was ruled a suicide.
According to Axios, major documents which have not been released yet include a draft 60-count federal indictment of Epstein that was inexplicably quashed, and an 82-page prosecution memo from 2007.
Trump, a one-time close friend of Epstein, and Clinton both figure prominently in the records published so far, but neither has been accused by officials of any wrongdoing.
A Republican-led House panel has voted to launch contempt of Congress proceedings against Bill and Hillary Clinton over their refusal to testify before its probe into Epstein.
Trump, 79, fought for months to prevent the release of the vast trove of documents about Epstein.
But a rebellion inside his Republican Party forced him to sign off on a law mandating release of all the documents.
The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) called for all of the documents held by the Justice Department to be released by December 19.
‘Sensationalist’
The department missed that deadline. Blanche has blamed the delay on the need to painstakingly redact the identities of Epstein’s more than 1,000 victims from the files.
The sweeping redactions across many of the documents — combined with tight control over the release by the Trump administration — have stoked scepticism that conspiracy theories of a high-level cover-up will be silenced.
As soon as the president’s name began surfacing in the released files, the Justice Department issued a statement saying that some documents “contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump”.
But the documents already released confirm that Trump was once close to Epstein.
They moved in the same social circles in New York and Florida, and documents confirm that Trump flew multiple times on Epstein’s private jet.
A January 2020 note from New York federal prosecutors who were investigating Maxwell had Trump making eight trips on Epstein’s plane between 1993 and 1996.
Trump has given varying accounts of why he eventually fell out with Epstein. He has criticised the file dumps, expressing concern that people who “innocently met” Epstein over the years risked having their reputations smeared.
A spokesman for Clinton has urged the Justice Department to release all materials in the files related to the former president, saying he had nothing to hide.
“Someone or something is being protected. We do not know who, what or why.
“But we do know this: We need no such protection,” Angel Urena said.</p><small>2026-01-30 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/302108099ba8ee3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969920/shahid-afridis-all-round-excellence-against-south-africa-makes-it-on-iccs-list-of-iconic-t20-world-cup-performances' target='_blank'><strong>Shahid Afridi’s ‘all-round excellence’ against South Africa makes it on ICC’s list of ‘iconic’ T20 World Cup performances</strong></a><br><p>Cricket’s governing body on Friday released a list of “iconic performances” at the T20 World Cup, with Shahid Afridi’s 2009 performance in the semi-final against South Africa included among the feats.
“Between India winning both the inaugural ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in 2007 and the most recent offering two years ago, there have been many iconic performances that have left their mark on T20’s biggest stage,” the International Cricket Council (ICC) said in its press release.
On Afridi, the ICC noted that after being named the player of the tournament in 2007, he had come back “with the bit firmly between his teeth”.
“In the semi-finals against South Africa, Afridi came to the fore in devastating fashion, starring with a crucial all-round performance that took Pakistan into a second successive final,” the ICC said.
It added that Afridi scored 51 off 34 with the bat, before claiming the key wickets of Herschelle Gibbs and AB de Villiers, finishing with 2-16.

 

It is worth mentioning that Pakistan had won the tournament that year.
Meanwhile, it said that India’s Yuvraj Singh “etched his name into cricketing history” by smashing six sixes off just one Stuart Broad over at the tournament’s first edition in South Africa.
According to the ICC, the left-handed all-rounder became just the fourth player — after Garry Sobers, Ravi Shastri and Herschelle Gibbs — to complete the feat, and the first to do so in T20 cricket.
“Yuvraj’s exploits not only ensured an imposing India total but also took the then 25-year-old to a 12-ball half-century and a record fastest 50 in T20Is, one which would hold firm until 2023,” it said.
It said that in the 2010 tournament, played in West Indies, Australia’s Michael Hussey “played one of the greatest short-form innings of all time by blasting an unbeaten 60 from just 24 balls”.
Coming in at seven in the semi-final, and with Australia requiring 87 from 45 balls to beat Pakistan, “Hussey reinvigorated his side’s chase with a startling display of hitting,” the ICC said.
When his team needed 18 runs in the final over, Hussey smashed Saeed Ajmal for three sixes and a four to win the game, it added.
West Indian spinner Sunil Narine also made the list, with the ICC highlighting his spell which led West Indies to their first ICC T20 World Cup crown in 2012.
“The mystery spinner walked away with figures of 3-9 as Sri Lanka were left stunned in their pursuit of 138 for victory.”
Sri Lanka’s Rangana Herath registered his name in the list for his “superb five wickets for just three runs helped Sri Lanka to the all-important victory” in 2014.
The ICC said that having been bowled out for 119 by New Zealand in the first innings, Herath “proceeded to rip through the Black Caps’ batting order, taking crucial wickets throughout the innings while also aiding two run-outs”.
New Zealand were dismissed for just 60 runs, as Sri Lanka lifted their maiden title.
Further, West Indian Carlos Brathwaite’s four consecutive sixes in the 2016 final also made the list, with the ICC calling it the “stuff of legend”.
“Needing 19 runs from the last over, West Indies were seemingly heading towards defeat at the hands of England,” the ICC said.
However, Brathwaite stepped up to deposit Ben Stokes’ first four balls into the stands and ensure the trophy was heading back to the Caribbean, the ICC said.
Australian Mitchell Marsh’s 2021 performance in the final also made the list, with the player scoring an unbeaten 77 as his team chased down their 173-run target set by New Zealand.
ICC said that alongside David Warner, Marsh helped steady the ship after Aaron Finch’s early dismissal before “demonstrating his power-hitting abilities”.
Marsh duly earned the Player of the Match award as Australia won by eight wickets, it said.
Calling 2022 the “redemption” of England’s Ben Stokes, the ICC said England’s second World Cup win not only saw them become the first country to hold both white-ball world champion titles at the same time, but also allowed Stokes to “banish the ghosts of 2016”.
Lastly, the ICC also included India’s Virat Kohli, saying: “Like Stokes in 2022, another behemoth of the modern game combined composure with guile to steal the show in the 2024 final, as Virat Kohli anchored India’s innings with a sumptuous 76.”
It said that as his team fell to 34-3, Kohli went on to earn player of the match award by “steering India towards a highly-competitive 176-7”.
South Africa fell seven runs short while chasing.</p><small>2026-01-30 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/30220343fd2d141.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969926/public-private-schools-in-sindh-to-remain-closed-on-feb-4-on-account-of-shab-i-barat' target='_blank'><strong>Public, private schools in Sindh to remain closed on Feb 4 on account of Shab-i-Barat</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government on Friday announced that all schools and colleges in the province would be closed on February 4 on account of Shab-i-Barat.

The statement came as the party camped outside Adiala jai, where he is imprisoned, and the Supreme Court after the government confirmed Imran underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment last week at a hospital in Islamabad.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the state minister replied to a question about the secrecy of Imran’s treatment, stating that there was nothing secret about it.
“Their (the PTI) problem is that the glass is always half-empty to them; they cannot be realistic or positive,” Chaudhry said.
“They previously said that there were no health facilities and nobody was paying attention,” he explained. “If there has been a health issue, then he (Imran) was immediately taken to the best hospital nearest to the prison. He was taken, examined and then left after everything was fine.”
Chaudhry noted that upholding the rights of all inmates and ensuring their care was the government’s responsibility. At this point, the host asked why the government did not comment on the issue earlier.
“Do you know how many prisoners avail these facilities or how many decisions are made by the jail administration? There isn’t a press release or press conference about those,” he replied.
Pressed on why Imran’s family was not informed about the procedure, Chaudhry said that this was the “prime responsibility” of jail authorities, who had fulfilled their role.
“I’ll confirm, once again, that he (Imran) is absolutely healthy,” he said, calling Imran “privileged”. “Not every prisoner has a personal physician, or cook or an exercise machine.”
Chaudhry reiterated that “there cannot be a press release or press conference for everything”, stating that matters were confirmed publicly when the need arose.
At this point, Iqbal recounted the state minister’s comments on the matter on Wednesday, when he had neither confirmed nor denied reports about Imran undergoing treatment.
When asked if he knew of the treatment, Chaudhry replied that there were standard operating procedures (SOPs) for everything.
“State ministers, ministers and prime ministers are not told everything, which is why there are SOPs and rules in place among the various institutions,” he responded. “It happened according to those and it was very smooth.”
Questioned again about why the family was not informed, Chaudhry replied, “They don’t care; they only care about their politics. What do they do? They use meetings [with Imran] for political point-scoring.
“They come out [after meeting Imran] and use whatever is said inside to control the party and build their narrative,” he said. Chaudhry added that the PTI could not dictate prison meetings by staging sit-ins.
“You cannot get a meeting by dictating. They do not even consider the law and order situation in that area, where there are thousands of people and prisoners,” he added.
Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information, Shafiullah Jan, also a guest on the programme, responded to Chaudhry’s claims by stating that the party had requested that Imran be allowed to meet his personal physician.
“We only have one request, which we made before the Supreme Court today; please allow him to meet his personal physician,” Jan said.
Jan said that Imran was “not an ordinary prisoner” and said that his health was paramount for the PTI. “We cannot compromise on his health; it is the most important thing for us,” the adviser said.
Jan then stated, “He was taken to Pims, but his family wasn’t informed. Tallal sahib is not talking about it. Why did you hide it for five days? Tallal sahib is not talking about it. Your own minister confirmed the matter but Tallal sahib is not talking about it.”
‘He needs to see a retinal specialist’
Separately, Dr Aasim Yusuf — Chief Medical Officer at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital and Imran’s longtime personal physician — said in a video statement that he had been denied access to examine the PTI founder, adding that he needed to see a retinal specialist.
He noted that he has no confirmation about the nature of his condition or what kind of treatment has been provided.
“We have every confidence in the abilities and professionalism of the physicians at the hospital in Islamabad, where Khan sahib was taken for treatment, but nevertheless, this is a serious condition and requires expert medical care,” Dr Yusuf said.
“This is ideally provided by an ophthalmologist with sub-specialty experience and training in diseases of the retina,” he added. “To the best of our knowledge, there are no retinal specialists at this hospital in Islamabad. If there are and it was a retinal specialist who saw Khan sahib, then that’s all well and good. But that remains a serious concern from our point of view.”



Dr Yusuf noted that Imran could have underlying medical issues, which may have caused the condition. He noted that alongside an ophthalmologist, a general physician would need to examine the PTI founder.
“Yesterday evening I received a phone call from Khan sahib’s legal team, in particular Salman Akram Raja, suggesting that it might be possible that it might be possible that we would get permission to see Khan sahib late last night,” Dr Yusuf said.
He added that he asked an ophthalmologist to accompany him to Adiala Jail.
“We got there just before 11pm. Unfortunately, permission could not obtained and we were not able to see Khan sahib on this occasion,” the physician recounted.
“It goes without saying that we are happy to go again as many times as necessary and whenever the legal team feels permission might be forthcoming or when, in fact, permission is obtained.”</p><small>2026-01-30 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/301856024aaf694.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969913/probe-initiated-into-alleged-torture-of-man-whose-wife-daughter-died-after-falling-into-sewer-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Probe initiated into alleged torture of man whose wife, daughter died after falling into sewer in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A “high-powered committee” of police officials launched a fact-finding inquiry on Friday into the alleged torture of the husband of a woman, who, along with her 10-month-old daughter, died earlier this week after falling into an open sewer in Lahore, a source told Dawn.
The two had fallen into the sewer at the site of under-construction Data Darbar expansion project near Bhati Gate on Wednesday. While the woman’s body was found late night the same day, the 10-month-old child’s body was recovered on Thursday.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident has been registered on the complaint of the woman’s father at the Bhatti Gate police station under Section 322 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code. Three suspects have been nominated in the FIR and all three of them were arrested a day ago.
Meanwhile, the victims’ family alleged police had tortured the woman’s husband, accusing him of committing his wife’s murder. They also arrested him and released him after around six hours.
A police official told Dawn that the fact-finding committee probing the allegation was headed by the Internal Accountability Branch (AIB) additional inspector general (IG) and included Lahore Deputy Inspector General (Administration) Imran Kishwar. The Punjab police chief constituted it on Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s directives, he said.
According to the official, the committee has been asked to finalise a report on the matter in 24 hours.
“The inquiry was initiated following complaints that police misused their authority and handled the matter unprofessionally by allegedly torturing the deceased woman’s husband,” he said, adding that committee members had also visited and inspected the Data Barbar project site.
He further said that the committee had also recorded the statements of the victims’ family, witnesses and other relevant people, checked where Safe City cameras were installed at the site and had also visited spots where the victims’ bodies were found.
According to the official, the inquiry committee has question a station house officer, a deputy superintendent of police and divisional superintended on why was the woman’s husband taken into custody.
The woman’s husband had called Rescue 1122 as soon as his wife and daughter had fallen into the manhole at about 7:30pm, but the rescue operation was stopped after it was suspected that the man was lying.
“Rescue 1122 personnel had slowed down the search operation, saying that the wastewater was just two feet deep and suspecting that the call may be a “fake” one,” the police official told Dawn.
Subsequently, the victim’s husband was taken into custody along with two other members of the family. The family alleged that the police tortured him, accusing him of committing his wife’s murder. And he was released around six hours later.
The police official who spoke to Dawn alleged that following Rescue personnel’s claims, “provincial and district officials wrongly briefed selective media persons to build a narrative that the incident related to a domestic dispute, and so that the woman’s husband be questioned for making a ‘fake call’.”
He said that the inquiry committee would finalise and submit its report to the Punjab police chief “for a final consideration by the CM”.
Separately, Lahore DIG (Investigation) Zeeshan Raza told Dawn that police had arrested the chief executive officers (CEOs) of the company that had been awarded the contract for the Data Darbar expansion project.
“We have arrested the two CEOs of the company, Salman and Usman”, Raza said, adding that they had been taken to a police station.
The move comes hours after a police source told Dawn that the contractor of the under-construction project as well as CEOs of  M/S Design and Engineering Pvt Limited would be questioned in connection with the case.
He said the action was being taken on government’s directives.
“A team of senior officers will question them to determine why the company failed to ensure safety protocols and cover the loopholes that led to the incident,” the official said.
This the one of the latest measures in a string of steps that have been taken by the authorities following the incident.
Yesterday, the government suspended from service the entire team of the Data Darbar revamp project, which also includes Bhati Chowk remodelling, after the preliminary inquiry proved their negligence.
Meanwhile, the project consultant, Nespak, was issued a show-cause notice with a recommendation to suspend the resident engineer.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also took aim at senior officials, including the Lahore commissioner, assistant commissioner and the head of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) for the “negligence” which led to the incident.
Addressing a high-level meeting, she grilled the top bureaucracy in front of the camera and ordered the removal and arrest of four officers.</p><small>2026-01-30 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648123-cdf-munir-turkiyes-top-commander-vow-to-boost-bilateral-military-ties' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Munir, Turkiye's top commander vow to boost bilateral military ties</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said General Bayraktaroglu called on CDF Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi.
“Upon his arrival at the General Headquarters, he was presented with the guard of honour by a smartly turned contingent of the Pakistan armed forces,” the statement said.
“During the meeting, besides dilating upon matters of mutual interest, prevailing regional and global security landscape, and prospects for strengthening bilateral defence and military cooperation were also discussed,” the statement said.
It added that the two also expressed satisfaction with the current trajectory of Pakistan-Turkiye relations, while underscoring the need for maintaining close coordination and enhancing defence collaboration.
The statement said that CDF Munir highlighted the longstanding brotherly relationship between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, mutual trust, and strong people-to-people ties.
“He appreciated the support and cooperation extended by the Turkish armed forces and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening bilateral military-to-military relations,” it added.
The statement said that General Bayraktaroglu expressed gratitude for the warm reception and appreciated the professionalism of the Pakistan armed forces.
“He reaffirmed Turkiye’s resolve to deepen defence cooperation, including training, joint exercises, and capacity-building initiatives,” it said.
“The visit reflects the enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Turkiye and their shared commitment to regional peace, stability, and security,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2026-01-30 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648118-gul-plaza-tragedy-pir-muhammad-shah-shown-the-door-as-karachi-dig-traffic' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza tragedy: Pir Muhammad Shah shown the door as Karachi DIG Traffic</strong></a><br><p>

The alleged development was reported by journalist Muhammad Malick in his programme on ARY News, ‘Khabar Muhammad Malick Kay Saath’ on Thursday.
In the programme, Malick alleged “one or two important meetings” were held a few days ago, following which it had been decided at the “high-level” that a “final and firm offer” would be made to the PTI.

 

According to him, the government had decided to ask the PTI to “return to Parliament, rejoin [parliamentary] committees and participate in the parliamentary process”.
“In return, two things will happen: the entire ECP will be reconstituted and the law will be amended so that the next elections are free and fair. And more importantly, the government is ready to hold elections a year earlier than scheduled,” he said.
Malick further claimed that if this “package deal” was agreed upon, “you will see Imran’s and his associates’ legal problems easing in the coming days”.
“This is a package deal, take it or leave it,” he further said, apparently referring to the government’s stance regarding its supposed proposal to the PTI.
Malick said that according to the information he had, the offer should have been made by yesterday or the day before, but he had no confirmation of it yet.
However, Information Minister Tarar rejected these reports in a post on the social media platform X early on Friday.
“Absolutely false. I don’t know how these stories are cooked up every few days. Strongly rebutted,” his post said.







Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik also termed the reports “absolutely fake news”.
“No such offer has been made whatsoever! I would urge to check again with whatever ‘sources’ you might claim to have gotten this false information from. The only offer made thus far has been of ‘talks’ between political parties and nothing else with no conditions and/or pre-conditions, hence we must refrain from stating things that are not correct!” he posted on X, also sharing a clip from Malick’s show.







However, the state minister was present in the show when this matter was discussed between Malick and PTI leader Shaukat Yousafzai, who also negated the reports. But, neither was he asked nor did he himself comment on the matter on that occasion.
For, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan also appeared to dismiss the reports during a press conference at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad today.
“Let me dismiss one thing before you all. It was said yesterday that the government has made an offer to us to hold elections after two years […] This is completely false […] These are all rumours,” he said without referring to any reports in particular.
He further stated that some issues related to his party, PTI founder Imran Khan and democracy were “very serious” and shouldn’t be reported on on the basis of sources.
“Kindly approach our information secretary, Sheikh Waqas, and you can surely quote him [on such matters],” he said.</p><small>2026-01-30 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/30170352f8ca024.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969906/trump-brands-minneapolis-nurse-killed-by-federal-agents-an-agitator' target='_blank'><strong>Trump brands Minneapolis nurse killed by federal agents an ‘agitator’</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump walked back his conciliatory tone on Friday after outrage over the killings of two American citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents, branding one of them, Alex Pretti, an “agitator.”
Footage shared online this week reportedly showed intensive care nurse Pretti in a scuffle with federal agents 11 days before he was shot dead on Saturday by officers enforcing an immigration crackdown.
The White House has scrambled to stem widespread outrage over Pretti’s killing, which came weeks after Renee Good, another US citizen and mother of three, was fatally shot by agents in the same city.
Trump claimed he wanted to “de-escalate a little bit” in the fallout of the killings and appointed a new point man in Minneapolis, border chief Tom Homan, who said on Thursday that some federal agents could be withdrawn from the city after weeks of protests against immigration raids.
On Friday, the US president said Pretti, 37, was an “agitator and, perhaps, insurrectionist,” on his Truth Social platform.







“Alex Pretti’s stock has gone way down with the just released video of him screaming and spitting in the face of a very calm and under control ICE Officer,” Trump wrote, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.
The video reportedly shows Pretti kicking the taillight of the federal agents’ car, before they emerge and tackle him to the ground.
AFP could not immediately verify the footage.
Government shutdown
Backlash over the deaths of Pretti and Good has landed in Congress, with the Senate edging closer to a vote on Friday on a funding deal to avert a government shutdown over the crisis.
Democrats have drawn a red line around funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), demanding it be stripped out and renegotiated to impose new constraints on immigration enforcement agencies.

 

Meanwhile, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman urged more tech figures to “speak out” on Thursday against the Trump administration’s “excesses” after the killings, which have had a global impact.
“We in Silicon Valley can’t bend the knee to Trump. We can’t shrink away and just hope the crisis will fade,” Hoffman wrote in an opinion piece Thursday in The San Francisco Standard.







Trump held a cabinet meeting that same day, but the Minnesota unrest did not come up while reporters were in the room, and he did not call on Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem when asking some officials to give remarks.
Trump sent Homan to Minnesota to take control of immigration operations with orders to report directly to him, effectively sidelining Noem.
Improvements needed
Homan said at his first news conference in the Minnesota city on Thursday that “certain improvements could and should be made,” a marked difference from his predecessor Greg Bovino, who was removed.
He urged Minnesotans to avoid “hateful rhetoric” against federal immigration officers.
He said his staff was “working on a drawdown plan” for some of the more than 3,000 federal agents who have been taking part in “Operation Metro Surge.”
One such measure, for example, would be notifying ICE agents about the release dates of incarcerated migrants considered “criminal public safety risks” so they could be detained by the agency, he said.
“This is commonsense cooperation that allows us to draw down on the number of people we have here,” Homan said.
Steven Gagner, a 41-year-old jewelry designer and “citizen observer” in Minneapolis, was skeptical about the drawdown.
“This administration has proven time and time again that they just lie to us and they do not really hold themselves or anyone else accountable,” he told AFP.
The two agents involved in Pretti’s shooting have been placed on leave, and Homan said any federal agents who breach standards of conduct “will be dealt with”.</p><small>2026-01-30 12:16</small></div><hr>
