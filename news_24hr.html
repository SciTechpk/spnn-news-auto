Hosts India posted 298-7 and then bowled out South Africa for 246, with spinner Deepti Sharma taking five wickets in the final in front of a sell-out crowd at the DY Patil Stadium.
Half-centuries by Shafali Verma and Deepti Sharma helped India post a competitive total.
Put into bat in a rain-delayed match, India rode on an opening stand of 104 between Smriti Mandhana (45) and Verma, who top-scored with 87, to stay in the hunt for their first title in front of a sell-out home crowd.
Sharma hit 58 off 58 balls at the 45,000-capacity DY Patil Stadium - a venue that has produced big runs, including India’s record chase of 339 in the semi-final against Australia.
The ODI World Cup is awaiting a new champion with South Africa also eyeing their first crown.
Rain held up the start of the match by two hours before South Africa skipper Laura Wolvaardt won the toss in her team’s first final in the tournament.
Hosts India soon took charge with the left-handed Mandhana and Verma hitting regular boundaries to take the attack to the opposition bowlers.
South Africa introduced spin in the 17th over and Chloe Tyron struck in the next over with her left-arm orthodox bowling to send back in-form Mandhana, caught behind.
Swashbuckling opener Verma, who came in as replacement for injured Pratika Rawal in the semi-final, reached her fifty.
Verma survived a reprieve on 56 when Anneke Bosch dropped a simple catch at deep mid-wicket off spinner Sune Luus, to the delight of the Indian fans.
Medium-pace bowler Ayabonga Khaka dismissed Verma when she got the batter holed out at mid-off . In the next over took down semi-final hero Jemimah Rodrigues, for 24, to check India’s surge.
Sharma and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur got down to the grind to rebuild the innings, in the face of tidy South African bowling.
Harmanpreet and then Amanjot Kaur departed as India seemed to fall behind on a high-scoring pitch but Sharma was joined by Richa Ghosh, who hit 34, and the two took on the bowling.
India, runners-up in 2005 and 2017, are playing their in third final.
Earlier, rain and a wet outfield delayed the toss by 30 minutes to 3pm (2:30pm PKT) with the start revised to 3:30pm.
India have been runners-up twice, in 2005 and 2017, and reached their third final after beating seven-time champions Australia in a thriller.
South Africa’s women are in their first ODI World Cup final after they beat four-time winners England in the other semi-final.
Speaking ahead of the decider, Harmanpreet Kaur said winning the World Cup could be a turning point for the women’s game in the cricket-crazy country.
 
 

“Last time when we reached the final and came back to India we saw a big change,” Kaur told reporters on Saturday.
“Women’s cricket moved ahead and we saw many girls on the ground.
“So I am sure that if we win this final, we will see many more changes and we will see more cricket, not only on the international level but also on the domestic level.”
“So I think we are really looking forward to that moment when we will see women’s cricket in a more serious manner and we will see more girls (playing),” she said.

Indian players like Kaur and Smriti Mandhana have become household names in the world’s most populous nation since the Women’s Premier League T20 tournament began in 2023.
Jemimah Rodrigues played a champion’s knock with an unbeaten 127 to help India chase down a record 339 against holders Australia in the semi-finals.
“I think it’s a proud moment for me and the entire team,” Kaur said.
“I am sure the entire country must be also very proud of the way we have played the last two games and, yeah, it’s a big day.”
Wolvaardt said the pressure on the home team could work in South Africa’s favour at DY Patil Stadium, which has a capacity of 45,000.
“I think with the whole crowd behind India, probably a sold-out stadium, it’s going to be a very exciting opportunity,” Wolvaardt said.
“But at the same time, I think it puts a lot of pressure on them as well. So yeah, I think it sort of plays in our favour, hopefully.”
Only Australia, England and New Zealand have ever won the tournament since it began in 1973.
Kaur said a new champion will be good for the sport.
“Because of that we are seeing more excitement,” she said. “And for us to reach the final is also very special, not only for us but for the Indian fans who have been a big support for us.”</p><small>2025-11-02 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02211452a03c8c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952749/onus-on-kabul-to-act-against-terrorists-using-afghan-soil-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>Onus on Kabul to act against terrorists using Afghan soil: Tarar</strong></a><br><p>Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Sunday said that with the establishment of a joint monitoring and verification mechanism, the onus would be on Kabul to take action against terrorists using Afghan soil.
A second round of discussions between Pakistani and Afghan Taliban delegations had began in Istanbul on October 25, following days of border hostilities, but Islamabad’s long-standing concern over terror attacks emanating from Kabul remained a major point of contention, resulting in a stalemate. A breakthrough came after Turkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week, following Pakistan’s announcement on Oct 29 that the talks had “failed” and that its negotiators were preparing to return home.
The talks produced a three-point understanding — the continuation of the ceasefire, the establishment of a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace, and penalties for violations. The operational details of that mechanism are expected to be finalised when the “principals”, senior representatives from both sides, meet again in Istanbul on November 6.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the information minister responded to a question about the monitoring mechanism discussed in Istanbul, stating that a review would be taken of activities during the past few days and modalities on a joint mechanism would be discussed.
“The onus is on the Afghan regime because their soil is being used for terrorism in Pakistan by Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan,” he explained. “For Pakistan, this will be an additional forum to provide evidence and the Afghan Taliban regime has to take action. If they do not take action, they will receive punishment.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, while Balochistan-based groups have been designated Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
When asked if Pakistan would respond to terrorist attacks by striking targets in Afghanistan after the mechanism is in place, Tarar said it would depend on the situation.
“If the situation is very serious and if Pakistan has the right to respond within international law and the UN Charter, then it depends on the situation that arises,” he responded.
“Once the mechanism is established, there is joint verification and evidence is produced, then any party violating the agreement will be punished. But it depends on the situation,” he added. “Now the Afghan Taliban have no room to make excuses like they used to do. Now that third parties are involved, they will have to take action.”
In response to a question about Afghanistan’s offer to hand over terror suspects to Pakistan, Tarar explained that Pakistan’s government had declined the offer and questioned why the Afghan Taliban administration was issuing such statements following the talks.
“The matter is clear: Pakistan has previously demanded that any terrorists who pose a threat to Pakistan be controlled or arrested,” he said. “However, the Afghan side says they are Pakistani nationals and they will be handed over … I believe these new claims are twisting facts. We immediately proposed a handover through a border post; it is a long-standing position.
“I don’t understand why they have to give these statements and complicate the situation.”
Tarar also called the Afghan Taliban government a “fractured regime” which does not have complete control of Afghanistan.
“There are fragments and not every faction is under control. There is unity of thought between the civilian and military leadership [in Pakistan] and they (the Afghan Taliban) should stop levelling allegations at us. This is propaganda, to which we gave a befitting response.”
Border skirmishes and talks
Pakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.
The hostilities began earlier this month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
Türkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces.</p><small>2025-11-02 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02225229dcfa17e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952753/anp-backed-lawyers-bag-most-seats-in-kp-bar-council-elections-provisional-results' target='_blank'><strong>ANP-backed lawyers bag most seats in KP Bar Council elections: provisional results</strong></a><br><p>Lawyers backed by the Awami National Party (ANP) have won at least 12 of the 28 seats of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council, outperforming other groups in polls held across the province on Saturday, according to provisional results.
The unofficial results released on Sunday revealed that three candidates of Malgari Wakilan (MW), which is affiliated with the ANP, two of the PTI’s lawyers wing and an independent candidate were elected on six of the seven seats of Peshawar.
Meanwhile, there were conflicting reports about the results for the seventh seat until the last updates were received.
Those who were declared successful in Peshawar included Khizar Hayat Khazana, Fazal-i-Wahid and Babar Khan Yousafzai of MW, Ali Zaman and Sophia Noreen of the Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF) and an independent candidate, Muhammad Saeed.
As for the winner for the seventh seat, initially Rafiq Mohmand of MW was reported as successful, but later reports also emerged about the victory of a female candidate, Khushnood Zakirullah.
The official result of the elections will be announced on November 4.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, who is also chairman of the KP Bar Council, was the returning officer for the polls.
According to unofficial results for other cities, independent candidate Fida Afridi bagged the bar council seat in Nowshera, Zarbadshah of MW and Asfandyar of Islamic Lawyers Forum won in Mardan and Syed Mubashir Shah of MW emerged victorious in Swabi.

Fawad is one of the three ex-PTI leaders who say they have been engaging with the party’s incarcerated leadership to put an end to the politics of confrontation as part of their political outreach initiative. They also visited PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a hospital in Lahore on Thursday to convince him to join their campaign, but Qureshi is said to have rebuffed their move.
However, Fawad claimed on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ today that Qureshi, Ejaz Chaudhry, Yasmin Rashid and Mehmoodur Rasheed — all of whom were jailed following action by authorities over May 9, 2023 riots — had written a letter around three months a ago and shared their stance.
He also claimed that he had been meeting Qureshi, Ejaz and Rasheed on multiple occasions. And those who did not visit any of the PTI members in jails were finding this development strange, he added.
“Primarily, we agree with the [contents] of the letter written by Shah sahib himself, the letter written by Ejaz Chaudhry sahib,” he said.
He further questioned that if the government would not engage in dialogue with the PTI, what option would the party have other than to stage sit-ins or carry out a protest march. “And the government will stop them.”
Fawad also stressed only Qureshi, Rashid, Ejaz, Rasheed, and another PTI leader Omar Cheema, could talk to Imran as they have a “stature”. He said other leaders in the party were also fairly good, but “there is distance between them and Imran”.
He said first, political temperatures had to be brought down, for which the “government may take a step forward and the PTI a step backward”.
“Let [incarcerated PTI leaders] be out on bail. Give A-class facilities to Imran Khan […] and Bushra Bibi in jail, so that the temperatures come down.”
He further claimed that when he met Imran in jail, he told him that people were making money in his name on YouTube and funds were being collected in the name of paying lawyers. He also said he conveyed to Imran that “even these people will not let him come out of jail”.
Fawad emphasised that until the PTI and the government would show flexibility in their stances, hostilities between the two would remain.
To a question about allegations that Fawad and other leaders part of the political outreach initiative wanted to stay relevant in politics by associating themselves with Imran, he said: “It is true that we want to keep ourselves relevant with Imran Khan. Because whatever the PTI is today, it is because of us. […] All the difficulties and pain was borne by the PTI prior to May 9. I myself stayed in jail for seven months.”
On the other hand, he said, neither Sheikh Waqas Akram nor Salman Akram Raja — who are part of the PTI’s current leadership — went to jail even for a day.
“They don’t fear minus Imran Khan. What they fear is that our formula is about Imran Khan plus and excludes them,” Fawad alleged.
He also claimed that Imran had chosen Usman Buzdar and Mehmood Khan as chief ministers because the ex-premier wanted “nobodies” in positions of authority and wanted to run the provinces himself. Similarly, he said, Imran had appointed “nobodies” in leadership positions in the party so that he could run the PTI himself.
Fawad also said that “we have been requesting the [National Assembly] speakers, Senate chairperson and two to four senior ministers. […] We will request them to make the first move. [We will tell them] that when you will give [the PTI’s incarcerated leadership relief], the political temperature will come down then.”
He said the best people in the PTI’s leadership were those in jail. “They and the PTI’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leadership together can talk to Imran.”
“And even I can talk to Imran Khan. But I will not be allowed [to meet him],” he added.
To a question about Qureshi’s lawyer, Rana Mudassar, denying that two other ex-PTI leaders had had no political discussion with the former foreign minister during their visit to the hospital on Thursday, Fawad claimed he had spoken to Mudassar himself and he told him he had given no such statement.
Imran Ismail claim
Earlier today, Imran Ismail — who was among the three ex-PTI leaders who visited Qureshi on Thursday — insisted that the former foreign minister had agreed that the stalemate in Pakistan’s politics must end.
Ismail’s claim has come even when Qureshi’s lawyer Rana Mudassar maintained that no political discussion had taken place between his client and the three former PTI leaders during the “surprise” visit.
However, Ismail posted on X today that some had begun to “portray our recent political outreach as a ‘minus formula’ designed to weaken Imran Khan or hijack [the] PTI. Let me be clear: there is no PTI without Imran Khan. He is its founder, face, and force.
“Our initiative — undertaken by Mehmood Moulvi, Fawad Chaudhry, and myself — is not a conspiracy. It is a conscious effort to move Pakistan’s politics away from confrontation and back toward reconciliation. The politics of defiance and endless agitation has brought PTI only shrinking space, arrests, and exhaustion. It’s time to pause, reflect, and rebuild.”
 






He claimed that the three of them — who were among several party members left the PTI following a crackdown on the party in the aftermath of May 9 protests — had “privately consulted a number of PTI stalwarts. Almost all admitted that confrontation has failed and that reconciliation is the only way forward.”
“When we met Chaudhry Ijaz in Kot Lakhpat Jail and Shah Mehmood Qureshi at PKLI (Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute), both — while firmly standing with Khan — agreed that the stalemate must end. They sought normal political breathing space, not surrender,” Ismail maintained.
Qureshi has been indicted in multiple cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots and has remained behind bars since August 2023. He has been hospitalised at PKLI for gallbladder stone complications, his daughter said on Friday.
Ismail further stated in the post: “Unfortunately, communication gaps, fear, and the constant social-media heat have blocked any honest conversation within PTI. Meanwhile, self-proclaimed anchors sitting abroad have made a business out of fuelling hostility and confusion, keeping divisions alive for personal gain.”
He went on to say that internationally, “Field Marshal Asim Muneer’s growing diplomatic stature has reshaped perceptions of Pakistan. The expectation that foreign powers would automatically align behind Imran Khan did not materialise. The world sees a strong, stable Pakistan — and that strength comes only through political stability at home.”
“Let it also be said: if any PTI leader believes that continuing agitation and confrontation is the right path, he should come forward and convince the rest of us who think otherwise. Debate is welcome — but blind confrontation cannot be a permanent political strategy.
“Our effort is independent, sincere, and driven purely by conscience. We want normal politics to return, institutions to function, and the temperature to come down.
If reconciliation is considered betrayal, so be it. We are thinking from the heart — for PTI’s survival and Pakistan’s stability,“ he added.
Later, Fawad also posted on X that “our formula” included Imran and excluded “snakes” in the PTI. “It is moving towards implementation,” he added.
 






Political outreach efforts
Ismail, Moulvi and Fawad visited Qureshi at the hospital, ostensibly to convince the incarcerated party vice chairman to join their ‘release Imran Khan campaign’.
According to his lawyer Mudassar, the three ex-PTI leaders managed to gain access to Qureshi on Thursday when he was alone in his room.
“Shah Mahmood Qureshi was surprised to see them and immediately asked the police on duty to call his lawyer, who had left just a minute ago, and tell him some ‘guests’ had arrived,” Mudassar earlier said, adding by the time he got back, the ex-PTI leaders had already gone. He said the visitors stayed only a little over 10 minutes and left without any political discussion with Qureshi.
A Dawn report quoted sources as saying that the three former PTI leaders also attempted to give the impression that another ex-party leader, Asad Umar, was also on board with their decision to launch an outreach campaign for Imran’s release. Umar, however, said he was not part of this group. He said he advised the trio against the hospital visit, as it would create friction in the party, while Qureshi’s family would also be disturbed.
Similarly, another former PTI leader, Ali Haider Zaidi, has also refuted reports of him “planning a political relaunch”, saying that he had no plans of doing so anytime soon.
His clarification came after Daily Ausaf and The Express Tribune reported, citing sources, that senior politicians who were part of the PTI’s “old leadership” were planning to relaunch a political movement calling for Imran’s release.
On the other hand, Fawad, in a video message, said the trio of former PTI leaders were trying to bring the political temperature down in the country and make the release of Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, possible, besides getting the right of bail for political prisoners acknowledged in the country.
He said they were trying to create an environment in which a dialogue could take place. “The political temperature can come down in the country only if the PTI takes one step back and the government takes a step forward.”
He claimed that he had also met Ejaz Chaudhry and other leaders and was happy that they too agreed that the political temperature should come down in the country. He said his group members would meet PML-N senior ministers as well as Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
Qureshi’s lawyer, however, termed the remarks by Fawad “deception” and said the former PTI leader did not even visit the incarcerated PTI leadership in the Kot Lakhpat jail, either on Thursday or Friday.
He said PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and Omer Sarfraz Cheema were united and standing by Imran Khan, who had repeatedly announced that he would not make any deals with the establishment or the government and would fight his cases on legal grounds.
Besides Qureshi, who is expected to undergo a surgical procedure for gallbladder stones next week, Omer Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed are also hospitalised.</p><small>2025-11-02 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02223342c9cf961.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952754/kp-govt-to-form-commission-for-probe-into-vandalism-of-radio-pakistan-building-in-peshawar-minister' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt to form commission for probe into vandalism of Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar: minister</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Local government, Elections and Rural Development Meena Khan Afridi on Sunday announced that the provincial government would set up an inquiry commission to probe the vandalism of the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar during the riots on May 9, 2023.
Following the arrest of former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan on May 9, 2023 from the Islamabad High Court’s premises, riots erupted across the country that went on for at least 24 hours. Public properties and military installations were also vadalised during the riots, including the Radio Pakistan building in KP’s provincial capital.
The announcement that the KP government would be forming a commission to probe the vandalism of the building was made by Meena Khan during a press conference alongside Adviser to the KP chief minister Shafiullah Jan in Peshawar today.
“Since it is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in our jurisdiction, our first cabinet will form an inquiry commission to probe what happened at the Radio Pakistan building in Peshawar,” Meena Khan said.
“This commission will probe who was behind what happened to [the] Radio Pakistan [building] and the CCTV footage will be analysed. We will see who opened the doors and also why that footage has not emerged yet.”
 






The provincial minister also spoke about a video showing KP CM Sohail Afridi, allegedly outside the Corps Commander House in Lahore during the riots, clarifying that the chief minister was in Peshawar at the time.
He said Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan spoke about the video during a press conference yesterday.
“They claimed he was in front of the building […], but they must understand that Sohail Afridi sahib was in Peshawar at the time,” he stated. “They cannot find any evidence [to back up their allegations] so they are resorting to lying.
“May 9 is a trap to pressure the PTI and Imran Khan. They are using it as an excuse against KP CM Sohail Afridi sahib; we condemn this.”
 


Jan also criticised Wali for showing the video during a press conference in Nowshera a day prior. He claimed the video was “edited”.
Fielding questions, Meena Khan said that the video was recorded during the Zaman Park standoff in March 2023, when police attempted to enter the Lahore compound to arrest the PTI founder.
“The video shown is not from May 9,” he emphasised, adding that the video had been edited and distorted. “The video is on Sohail Afridi sahib’s social media pages; anyone can check and see that the video is from two months before May 9. You can see the use of water cannons against our workers.”
Jan said that the PTI would respond to the “lies” spread by Wali, adding that “anyone who uses a false video will be given a befitting response”.</p><small>2025-11-02 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02232109827ef23.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952755/only-two-weeks-of-water-left-in-tehrans-main-reservoir-official' target='_blank'><strong>Only two weeks of water left in Tehran’s main reservoir: official</strong></a><br><p>Tehran’s main source of drinking water is at risk of running dry within two weeks, state media warned on Sunday, owing to a historic drought.
The Amir Kabir dam, one of five which provide drinking water for the capital, “holds just 14 million cubic metres of water, which is 8 per cent of its capacity,” the director of the capital’s water company, Behzad Parsa, was quoted as saying by the IRNA news agency.
At that level, it can only continue to supply Tehran with water “for two weeks”, he said.
The megacity of more than 10 million people is nestled against the southern slopes of the often snow-capped Alborz mountains, which soar as high as 5,600 metres and whose rivers feed multiple reservoirs.
But the country is in the midst of its worst drought in decades. The level of rainfall in Tehran province was “nearly without precedent for a century,” a local official declared last month.
A year ago, the Amir Kabir dam held back 86 million cubic metres of water, Parsa said, but there had been a “100pc drop in precipitation” in the Tehran region.
Parsa did not provide details on the status of the other reservoirs in the system.
According to Iranian media, the population of Tehran consumes around three million cubic metres of water each day.
As a water-saving measure, supplies have reportedly been cut off to several neighbourhoods in recent days, while outages were frequent this summer. In July and August, two public holidays were declared to save water and energy, with power cuts an almost daily occurrence amid a heatwave.
“The water crisis is more serious than what is being discussed today,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned at the time.</p><small>2025-11-02 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/021901187c4e2b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952746/policy-expert-mosharraf-zaidi-appointed-pm-shehbazs-spokesperson-for-foreign-media' target='_blank'><strong>Policy expert Mosharraf Zaidi appointed PM Shehbaz’s spokesperson for foreign media</strong></a><br><p>Journalist and policy expert Mosharraf Zaidi has been appointed as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s spokesperson for foreign media, it emerged on Sunday.
The notification, shared by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on X, said that the appointment was made in “supersession of his (PM Shehbaz’s) earlier orders of even number dated [June 4] and Cabinet Division’s Circular No. 3-2/2024-Min-I, dated [June 10]”.
“The prime minister is pleased to appoint Mr Mosharraf Ali Zaidi as Prime Minister’s Spokesperson for Foreign Media, with immediate effect and until further orders,” the notification read. “[The] Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Cabinet Division are requested to take further action accordingly.”
 






In his post, Tarar wrote: “Welcome on board, brother. A great addition to our team. It’s been great working with you these past few months, looking forward to continue this teamwork.”
Speaking to Dawn, Zaidi said the appointment is “a privilege to serve the Pakistani people—the best people on the planet. And at a time of tremendous potential for this country!
“[I] will try my best to keep pace with the work ethic, resolve and intensity of the prime minister in pursuing transformational change for our country,” he added.
Zaidi, who has been serving as the PM’s coordinator on government performance and innovation, graduated from Lahore University of Management Sciences with a BSc (Honours) in Economics and earned a Master of Public Administration in Policy Analysis and Non-Profit Management from Baruch College in New York, according to his LinkedIn profile.
He has also worked as a policy adviser at the foreign ministry from 2011-2013, before serving as the campaign director and CEO at Alif Ailaan from 2013-2018.
Zaidi founded Islamabad-based policy think tank Tabadlab in 2018, where he served as the CEO until June this year, when he worked as a senior fellow until August.

Karachi Grammar School retains the championship title; records are shattered as teammates and mothers cheer on the swimmers till their throats go hoarse; top-level swimmers wow the crowd with speedy races duplicated in international arenas for team Pakistan. The only thing that does change is the sense of camaraderie, sportsmanship and drive the young women have — it only grows stronger every year.
There were, however, a handful of anomalies at the 31st Sindh Women’s Swimming Championship this weekend. A record 377 participants from nearly 20 institutions across Karachi competed at the two-day age-group championship, compared to figures of 250 or less in previous years. For the first time, lengthier and more strenuous races like the 800m freestyle, 400m IM and 200m breaststroke were scratched from the event list due to a lack of participants, according to the organisers.
 
 

For the third straight year, Hareem Malik was crowned double group champion as she bagged the most points in the Under-16 and Open Age categories. The KGS vice-captain took home eight gold medals and set five new records — the most by any swimmer at the meet.
With already one national record to her name, Hareem said her main focus is breaking a couple more when she represents Pakistan for the fifth time at the Islamic Solidarity Games in Riyadh next week.
Some of the “older” swimmers like Hareem — those completing their O and A levels — have to balance a robust academic workload with intense training and a packed competition schedule.
The weekend after she returns from Riyadh, Hareem will head to Islamabad for the women’s age group national championships, followed by the National Games in Karachi in December that comes in the thick of mid-term examinations for most school-going athletes.
“I have to allocate time for swimming and my studies, which always comes first, but I do have to compromise at times,” 16-year-old Hareem told Dawn at the Sindh Open.
KGS team captain Haya Bari, who begins university applications in a few weeks, hopes younger swimmers find ways to hold on to their love for swimming while balancing the rigorous demands of elite academia.
Barely 24 hours before the Sindh Open began, Haya’s younger sister Shanzay flew back from the 3rd Asian Youth Games in Bahrain, where she bettered several of her own times.
“It was a great experience and a great platform to represent Pakistan,” said Shanzay, who won six gold, one silver and one bronze medal at the Sindh Open.
“It’s tough having to juggle early morning training, getting home at 9pm, trying to sleep early, and keeping up with your nutrition,” the younger Bari sister said. “Most days you’re eating in the car to save on time.
“But you balance it all by keeping track of time for everything you do, and that’s what this sport teaches us,” she said.
Another standout swimmer this year who tore through the record books was 12-year-old Zoya Omair Hafiz. She retained her U12 group champion title with three golds and as many records, in addition to a handful of silver and bronze medals in both the U12 and open age category. She missed out on the 200m butterfly open age record by just 0.25 seconds.
“I’m happy with my time but if I had gone just a bit faster, I could have broken the record and got my team a few more points,” she said.
“Overall I’m really happy with my performance this weekend. I have junior nationals and then National Games coming up; I’m excited to see how the girls from Punjab and other units perform.”
Several mothers quietly beamed with pride as they watched their daughters give interviews to various tv channels in between taking photos with their teammates and coaches. Just moments earlier, chief guest Nimrah Khan struck a chord with the audience when she spoke about her parents’ unwavering support after meeting with an accident that left her wheelchair bound for over three years.
“Having your parents’ support the way I did is a blessing that so many don’t have,” the actress said in her speech as she choked back tears.
While addressing the parents in the audience, Nimrah asked: “Why are women called the ‘son of the family’ when they achieve something? You need to tell them  you’re proud of them for being their daughter.”
Her parting message to the swimmers was met with roaring applause from an enthralled audience riveted by her journey from athlete to being comatose and now being an actress.
“You all are unstoppable, unreachable, and untouchable. I know there’s several barriers and societal pressures standing in your way, but you’re not answerable to anyone. Keep doing what you do, and you will be unstoppable.”
Overall results: KGS 533 points; CAS 176.5 pts; Karachi Club 129 pts; Haque Academy 110.5 pts; Bayview Academy 109 pts; Beaconhouse Defence Campus 24 pts; Khi United Swim Association and DHA Sports Club (Moin Khan) 2 pts each.

Breakout Democratic Party candidate Mamdani, a naturalised Muslim American who represents Queens in the state legislature, leads former governor and sex assault-accused Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing his party’s primary contest to Mamdani.
The Republican party candidate polling in third place is Curtis Sliwa, 71, who has a colourful past as the founder of the Guardian Angels vigilante group, a prolific broadcaster and cat lover.
The latest Quinnipiac University poll, conducted from October 23 to 27, gives Mamdani 43 per cent of the vote, followed by Cuomo on 33pc and Sliwa on 14 pc.
The race has centred on the cost of living, crime and how each candidate would handle Trump, who has threatened to withhold federal funds from the city.
“Mamdani is an unusual political figure and really captures the spirit of the moment. This is a moment where a loud anti-Trump voice in America’s biggest city is going to get news,” Lincoln Mitchell, a politics professor at Columbia University, told AFP. “Frankly, a Muslim candidate for mayor of New York is an enormous story.”
 
 

Mamdani, 34, has attacked his opponents for Islamophobic rhetoric and smears, calling out both Republicans and Democrats for “anti-Muslim sentiment that has grown so endemic in our city”.
New York City Board of Elections data showed 275,006 registered Democrats had cast ballots, as had 46,115 Republicans, along with 42,383 voters unaffiliated with any party in the first five days of early voting, which ends on November 2.
Mamdani’s ascent has highlighted the gulf between the left and centre-right of the Democratic Party. New York’s state governor, centrist Kathy Hochul, appeared at a Mamdani rally on October 26 but was drowned out by “tax the rich” chants, an AFP correspondent saw.
Hochul has been critical of Mamdani’s proposals to impose a 2pc income tax on New Yorkers making more than $1 million.
Mamdani’s rise
Mamdani’s unlikely ascent has been fueled by young New Yorkers canvassing for him, with his campaign claiming 90,000 people have volunteered.
“It really comes back to people speaking to other New Yorkers about the city that we all love,” Mamdani told ‘The Daily Show’.
Teenager Abid Mahdi, a Queens native who leads canvases for Mamdani, told AFP that “when I think of Zohran, I think of what Bernie Sanders was to many Americans in 2016 and 2020. He is my Bernie Sanders in a lot of ways.”
Mamdani appeared with leftist standard-bearer Senator Bernie Sanders at a Queens rally on October 26.
“I’m 15 right now, I’ll be an adult and paying taxes at 18, right? The majority of laws will apply to me in about three years. So, why should I start caring then?” added Mahdi.
Underscoring the importance of older voters who typically turn out in greater numbers than youngsters, Mamdani attended a “paint and pour” session at an elder care home in Brooklyn on Thursday.
Torrential rain at the end of the week slowed canvassing, with the three leading candidates touring TV studios in a final push to woo wavering voters.
Ahead of the vote, Sliwa appeared in a surreal conservative rap video wearing a suit and his signature red beret.
Cuomo, 67, sought on Thursday to court Black and Muslim voters, campaigning in Harlem with current mayor Eric Adams, a corruption-accused Democrat who bowed out, eventually endorsing his former foe Cuomo.
There was a stir in the week when a British newspaper published what claimed to be an interview with former mayor and Mamdani backer Bill de Blasio in which he appeared to question the affordability of the Democratic socialist’s spending plans. The article was removed after the former mayor denied speaking to the journalist.
A day prior, former Democrat president Barack Obama called Mamdani and offered to be a sounding board if the frontrunner wins the election. He also praised Mamdani’s campaign.
The call, first reported by The New York Times, was confirmed by Mamdani’s spokesperson.
“Zohran Mamdani appreciated President Obama’s words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city, said Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec.

The statement issued on Sunday said that the president would attend the Second World Summit for Social Development in Qatari capital Doha from November 4–6, being held under the auspices of the United Nations General Assembly.
On the summit’s sidelines, the statement added, the “president will hold important meetings with global and regional leaders, including the leadership of Qatar, as well as heads of major multilateral forums such as the United Nations and other international organisations”.
Meanwhile, the summit “will bring together world leaders and policymakers to discuss ways of advancing social development, promoting decent work and employment opportunities as well as strengthening inclusive safety nets”.
“President Zardari will underscore Pakistan’s commitment to inclusive growth and social protection, with the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) at the centre of efforts to reduce poverty and build resilience among vulnerable groups,” the statement said.
It added that “Pakistan’s readiness to pilot a Doha-aligned Social Protection and Jobs Compact (2026–28) aimed at expanding coverage to informal workers, persons with disabilities, and children, while promoting decent work and green employment, will also be highlighted”.
The initiative aligns national plans with the Doha Political Declaration and global commitments on social protection and financing for development, it further stated.
It said the president would underline Pakistan’s intent to work closely with development partners and multilateral institutions to mobilise financing for social protection and green employment through mechanisms such as the Social Development Goals Stimulus, debt-for-social or climate swaps, and South–South cooperation under China’s Global Development Initiative.
President Zardari would also reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to translating the outcomes of the Doha Summit into concrete actions that strengthen social protection systems and support sustainable, inclusive economic growth, the statement added.</p><small>2025-11-02 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02191220a01c67c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952747/india-space-agency-launches-its-heaviest-satellite' target='_blank'><strong>India space agency launches its heaviest satellite</strong></a><br><p>India launched its heaviest ever communication satellite on Sunday, the latest step in the country’s ambitious space programme.
The CMS-03 satellite blasted off from Sriharikota in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh at 5:26 pm local time (1156 GMT).
“Our space sector continues to make us proud!” said Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wants to send an Indian astronaut to the Moon by 2040.
Weighing about 4,410 kilogrammes, it is “the heaviest communication satellite” launched in the country, the Indian Space Research Organisation said on Thursday.
 






The Indian Navy said the satellite would help “secure communication links between ships, aircraft, submarines”.
The CMS-03 satellite was sent into orbit from the towering 43.5 metre tall LVM3-M5 launch vehicle.
It is an upgraded version of the rocket that launched India’s unmanned craft that landed on the Moon in August 2023.
Only Russia, the United States and China have previously achieved a controlled landing on the lunar surface.
The country has flexed its spacefaring ambitions in the last decade, with its space programme growing considerably in size and momentum.
Shubhanshu Shukla, a test pilot with the Indian Air Force, this year became the second Indian to travel to space and the first to reach the International Space Station — a key step towards India’s own crewed mission planned for 2027.</p><small>2025-11-02 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631755-ied-attack-on-hangu-police-convoy-injures-sho-two-other-officers' target='_blank'><strong>IED attack on Hangu police convoy injures SHO, two other officers</strong></a><br><p>

Abbas Majeed, the regional police officer in Kohat division, confirmed these details to Dawn, further stating that a police convoy was targeted in the IED attack.
He added that SHO Imranuddin was among the three injured policemen.
Separately, a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Office said the provincial chief executive, Sohail Afridi, had taken notice of the incident and sought a
detailed report from the KP inspector general of police.
He directed that the injured policemen be provided immediate medical treatment, the statement said, adding that the CM paid tribute to the police personnel’s “courage and sense of duty”.
The CM further directed that security in the province be tightened and strictly monitor suspicious elements.
“Elements involved in [such] cowardly attacks will be taken to task,” the statement quoted him as saying.
Today’s incident has taken place as Pakistan continues to grapple with terrorism.
A rise in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan, was particularly witnessed after banned terror outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022. Ending the agreement, the TTP had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
In one such incident, three cops, including a superintendent of police (SP), were martyred when back-to-back blasts rocked Hangu on October 24. According to the police, the TTP was behind those blasts as well.
Previously, on Oct 19, law enforcers had foiled an attack by terrorists at a police station in KP’s Bannu district. According to police, the failed attack was carried out by the TTP and targeted the Baka Khel police station, and three terrorists were killed as cops opened fire on them.
A day prior to that, on Oct 18, unkn­own assailants had launched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan. According to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the Frontier Corps personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident.
On the night of Oct 17, police had also intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.</p><small>2025-11-02 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631750-president-zardari-to-attend-second-world-summit-for-social-development-in-doha' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari to attend Second World Summit for Social Development in Doha</strong></a><br><p>

Counterterrorism police had helped with the initial investigation after the mass stabbing of passengers on a train in eastern England on Saturday.
“At this stage, there is nothing to suggest that this is a terrorist incident,” Superintendent John Loveless from British Transport Police told the media on Sunday.
The two men arrested on suspicion of attempted murder were a 32-year-old male, a Black British national, and a 35-year-old British national of Caribbean descent, Loveless said. Both were born in the UK, he added.
“We continue to work to establish the full circumstances and motivation for this incident,” he said.
“It would not be appropriate to speculate on the cause.”
Armed police board train
The arrests were made by armed police after the train made an emergency stop at Huntingdon, around 80 miles (130 km) north of London.
Of the 11 people hospitalised, four have since been discharged, and two patients remain in a life-threatening condition, police said.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it an “appalling incident” which was “deeply concerning”, while King Charles said he was “truly appalled and shocked”.
Knife crime in England and Wales has risen 87 per cent over the past decade, with 54,587 offences last year alone, a two per cent rise from 2023 and among the highest rates in Europe, according to figures from Britain’s interior ministry show.
In her statement, Interior Minister Shabana Mahmood said she was “deeply saddened”, while urging people to avoid speculation about the incident.
The government is keen to stop rumours spreading on social media following an incident in Southport in northwest England in 2024, when internet claims over the murder of three young girls sparked days of rioting across the country.
Blood on all the chairs
Witness Olly Foster told the BBC that he was on the train which was heading towards London on Saturday evening when someone ran past him saying a man was stabbing “everyone, everything”.
“I put my hand on this chair…and then I look at my hand, and it’s covered in blood. And then I look at the chair, and there’s blood all over the chair. And then I look ahead and there’s blood on all the chairs,” he said.
Another witness told Sky News that a suspect was seen waving a large knife before being tasered by police.
Britain’s current threat level from terrorism is rated as “substantial” by security services, meaning an attack is considered “likely”.
After a number of serious attacks in 2017, Britain has had some quieter years in the 2020s, although last month three people were killed when a synagogue was attacked in Manchester.</p><small>2025-11-02 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/021645491dc4387.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952742/dar-to-attend-meeting-of-arab-islamic-foreign-ministers-in-turkiye-tomorrow-to-discuss-gaza-ceasefire-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Dar to attend meeting of Arab-Islamic foreign ministers in Turkiye tomorrow to discuss Gaza ceasefire: FO</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar will depart for Istanbul tomorrow to attend the Coordination Meeting of Arab-Islamic Foreign Ministers, where the Gaza ceasefire deal will be discussed, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Sunday.
“At the invitation of the Turkish foreign minister, the Deputy Prime Minister/ Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar will undertake a one-day visit to Istanbul on November 3, 2025 to attend the Coordination Meeting of Arab-Islamic Foreign Ministers,” the FO statement said.
 






“It may be recalled that Pakistan, along with seven other Arab-Islamic countries, has remained engaged with the peace initiative that led to the signing of the Gaza Peace Agreement in Sharm El-Sheikh,” the statement added.
Hamas and Israel signed a ceasefire agreement on October 9, agreeing to free the Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of United States President Donald Trump’s initiative to end the Israeli onslaught in Gaza.
Pakistan was one of the eight Muslim countries, along with Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt, that worked with Trump’s administration on the plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza.
Despite signing the deal, Tel Aviv has resumed its attacks on Gaza. On Friday, the Israeli military attacked the Gaza Strip for a fourth consecutive day, killing three people.
During the Istanbul meeting, Pakistan will emphasise the need for the full implementation of the ceasefire agreement and complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Palestinian territory, especially Gaza, as well as the provision of unfettered humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians and the reconstruction of Gaza, the FO statement said.
“Pakistan will also reiterate the need for collective efforts aimed at achieving an independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, based on pre-1967 borders, in accordance with relevant UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative,” it added.
Pakistan has been, and will continue to be, committed to efforts to restore peace, justice, and dignity to the Palestinian people, as well as to ensure the realisation of their right to self-determination, the statement further stated.</p><small>2025-11-02 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/021725596e3237e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952740/officials-foil-attempt-at-migrant-smuggling-in-balochistans-turbat-detain-29-foreign-nationals' target='_blank'><strong>Officials foil attempt at migrant smuggling in Balochistan’s Turbat, detain 29 foreign nationals</strong></a><br><p>Police and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Sunday foiled a migrant smuggling attempt in Balochistan’s Turbat district in a joint operation, while detaining 29 foreign nationals for attempting to cross the border illegally, officials said.
Migrant smuggling, which has grown more frequent and dangerous in Pakistan in the last few years, assists a person to enter or stay in a country without having the legal permission to do so. The trend impacts both the country’s reputation and the lives of those caught in it.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kech Captain Zohaib Mohsin told Dawn that the operation was carried out in the outskirts of Turbat, where a Land Cruiser was intercepted with dozens of people on board.
“The arrested persons include 12 men, 13 children and 4 women,” the SSP said. “Two drivers have also been arrested who were allegedly involved in taking these people to Iran through illegal routes.”
SSP Mohsin said initial investigations have revealed that the Afghan nationals were planning to enter Iran via Balochistan and reach Europe.
“All the arrested persons have been handed over to the FIA ​​for further investigation, while a probe has been launched against the network involved in the smuggling”, he said.
The official added that more arrests were expected after the initial investigation, and the scope of the probe had been expanded.
In September, the United Nations launched a network on migration in Pakistan in a bid to improve migration governance and tackle human trafficking in the country.
Every year, many young Pakistanis leave the country via illegal routes in hopes of better employment opportunities. A 2023 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the European Union found that 24,000 Pakistanis entered EU countries illegally over the past three years.

Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period.
“In view of security threats, public processions and sit-ins can be soft targets for terrorists,” the home department said in its statement. “Malignant elements can take advantage of public protests and carry out anti-state activities to fulfil their nefarious intentions.”
It added that a complete ban has been imposed on the display of all types of weapons across Punjab. “There is also a complete ban on the use of loudspeakers under Section 144,” it said.
Furthermore, as per the statement, there is a complete ban on the publication and distribution of inflammatory, hateful or sectarian material. The department detailed that the decision to extend the implementation of Section 144 was taken to maintain law and order as well as to protect human lives and property.
“The Punjab government issued orders in view of the concerns of terrorism and public order,” it said, clarifying that the ban does not apply to wedding ceremonies, funerals, and burials.
Moreover, officers and officials present on official duties and courts are also exempted from the ban, while loudspeakers can be used only for Azan and Friday sermons, the statement added.
The ban was initially imposed on October 8 for 10 days and then for further seven days on October 18. The decision to extend the ban for another seven days was taken by the Cabinet Committee for Law and Order in its 39th meeting held at the home department due to security threats amid continuing tensions with the banned religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
Later on October 25, the Punjab government extended the imposition of Section 144 for another week.</p><small>2025-11-02 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0215380940e0887.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952738/pm-vows-to-take-steps-for-effective-probe-prosecution-of-crimes-against-journalists' target='_blank'><strong>PM vows to take steps for effective probe, prosecution of crimes against journalists</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday said the government would take steps to ensure effective investigation, justice, and prosecution in cases of crimes against journalists.
His remarks came on the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes Against Journalists. The day, observed on November 2, highlights the need for justice in cases where journalists are attacked or killed. This year’s observance draws attention to the online threats faced by women journalists and the broader chilling impact these have on freedom of expression.
“Today reminds us that a free, informed, and responsible press is the foundation of any democratic society,” the prime minister said in a statement.
“Journalists enable public access to facts and are torchbearers of truth. Violence, threats, or reprisals against them while performing their duties are attacks on freedom of expression.
“I pay tribute to journalists who faced hardships for truth and solidarity with families of media workers who lost loved ones in the line of duty.”
He added that the Government of Pakistan was committed to protecting press freedom and providing a safe environment for journalists.
“We will take measures to ensure effective investigation, justice, and prosecution of crimes against journalists.
“I appeal to the international community, media organisations, and civil society to play their role in protecting journalists and promoting freedom of expression. A free press guarantees a strong, transparent, and democratic Pakistan.”
Pakistan is consistently ranked as one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists due to frequent threats, physical attacks, and a pervasive culture of impunity for perpetrators. In the 2025 World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Pakistan was ranked 158th out of 180 countries.
A day prior, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) condemned the worsening situation for media professionals in Pakistan.
A delegation from the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) held talks with IFJ President Dominique Pradalié and Secretary General Anthony Bellanger at the Syndicat National des Journalistes (SNJ) headquarters in Paris, according to a statement issued from Islamabad on Saturday.
“The IFJ leaders expressed deep concern over targeted killings of journalists, misuse of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) to file cases against media workers, undeclared censorship, harassment by state and non-state actors, forced layoffs, and non-payment of salaries,” the statement said.
“They urged Pakistan’s president, prime minister, and top judge to take immediate notice, warning that inaction could prompt an appeal to the United Nations for intervention.”
During the meeting, the PFUJ delegation, including Secretary General Shakeel Ahmed, Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists President Tariq Usmani, and Foreign Committee Head Waseem Shahzad Qadri, briefed the IFJ leaders on ground realities.</p><small>2025-11-02 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/021130548ba91e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952729/peshawar-ctd-official-dead-2-injured-as-explosives-detonate-at-police-station' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar CTD official dead, 2 injured as explosives detonate at police station</strong></a><br><p>A Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) official was martyred in Peshawar on Sunday morning, while two others were injured when explosives stored in a police station went off.
Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad confirmed the casualties of the incident at the CTD police station in a statement.
“Preliminary assessment shows that an explosion occurred due to the detonation of old explosive material stored in the police station’s ammunition room. Fire has also spread to other ammunition, causing further explosions,” the statement read.
Police and security forces cordoned off the area, as “clearance [was] going on”, the CCPO said.
He added that the Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU), along with rescue and fire brigade services, were working accordingly.
Citing a preliminary assessment, the statement said, “Police sources confirm that this incident does not appear to be a terrorist attack”.
In another statement, the CCPO’s office said a special investigation team of the CTD reached the police station following the incident to collect evidence. It was reviewing the CCTV footage of nearby areas.
Furthermore, statements of the cops present at the police station when the explosion occurred were also being recorded. Besides the investigation team, the CTD and the BDU also collected evidence from the site.
A part of the building, including the basement, collapsed due to the explosion, police said.
KP CM seeks report from IG
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi took notice of the incident and sought an urgent initial report on it from Inspector General (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed.
He directed that the cause of the explosion be determined and that safety measures be made more effective, according to a statement from his office.
CM Afridi expressed his condolences over the martyred policeman and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
 






KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also conveyed his deep sorrow over the explosion and paid tribute to the official’s sacrifice in the line of duty, APP reported.
He also conveyed his best wishes for the speedy recovery of the injured police personnel, emphasising the province’s gratitude for the bravery and commitment of law enforcement agencies.
 






IG Hameed has also sought a detailed report from the CTD Additional IG Jawwad Qamar within five days, according to a separate statement by the CCPO.
The cop who lost his life was later identified as Bilal Khan, whose funeral prayers were offered with honours at Malik Saad Shaheed Police Lines.
Kundi, IG Hameed, AIG Qamar, CCPO Ahmad, other police officers and security personnel attended the prayers.
Past fire incidents
The stated cause of today’s incident is similar to how the city police station in KP’s Swabi district was destroyed last year.
On Sept 26, 2024, an explosion ripped through the second floor of the city police station in Swabi, resulting in three deaths and injuries to around two dozen people.
The building of the district’s largest and central police station was completely destroyed and still awaited reconstruction a year later.
Officials said that 600 kilogrammes of explosives were kept in the police station, which caught fire, but it was not known as of last month how those explosives caught fire.
Fire incidents usually occur due to a combination of human negligence, faulty infrastructure, poor safety standards, and environmental factors. Peshawar has faced frequent residential and commercial fires, as well as periodic industrial infernos.
 
 

In July, four people were killed and two others were injured after a fire broke out in a house located in Peshawar’s Kochi Bazaar, rescue officials said.
In October 2024, a blaze at a tissue paper factory in the city’s Hayatabad area was doused after more than 26 hours in an operation involving 130 fighters and 31 fire tenders.
In June 2024, a fire broke out in the Nauthia Phattak area of Peshawar, destroying at least 80 shops mostly selling used goods and injuring three people.</p><small>2025-11-02 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631721-ji-chief-vows-to-free-karachi-from-corruption-land-grabbing-system' target='_blank'><strong>JI chief vows to free Karachi from 'corruption, land-grabbing system'</strong></a><br><p>

Growing numbers are finding work in the business of death as South Korea undergoes massive demographic change, with birth rates among the lowest in the world and almost half the population aged 50 or older.
Students at the Busan Institute of Science and Technology carefully draped a mannequin in traditional Korean funeral cloth, smoothing the fabric as if over real skin, before gently lowering it into a coffin.
“With our society ageing, I thought the demand for this kind of work would only grow,” said Jang Jin-yeong, 27, a funeral administration student.
Another student, 23-year-old Im Sae-jin, decided to enter the field after his grandmother died.
“At her funeral, I saw how beautifully the directors had prepared her for the final farewell,” he said.
“I felt deeply grateful.”
‘Like portraits’
More and more South Koreans are also living — and dying — alone.
Single-person households now account for around 42 per cent of all homes in Asia’s fourth-largest economy.
A new profession has emerged reflecting that statistic: cleaners who are called in to tidy up homes after their occupants, most of whom lived alone, have died.
Former classical musician Cho Eun-seok has cleaned many homes where people were found dead, sometimes months after their passing.
Their homes are “like their portraits”, Cho, 47, told AFP.
He described heartbreaking traces: hundreds of neatly capped soju bottles and dusty boxes of gifts that were never opened.
South Korea has the highest suicide rate among developed nations, and these “lonely deaths” include those who died alone by their own hand.
Cho recently began receiving calls from used-car leasing companies to clean vehicles later found to be where clients ended their lives.
He is also developing a device to detect signs of unattended deaths that he said can harm the environment, causing pest infestations and forcing the disposal of belongings from entire households.
In summer, the smell spreads fast: “within three days it seeps into everything — the fridge, the TV — and nothing can be saved.”
The home of a woman who had died recently in her late eighties was still filled with traces of her life when AFP visited — an old air conditioner, bottles of cosmetics and a portable toilet, while several walking sticks stood by the door.
‘Everything must be cleared away’
The work sometimes requires more than just cleaning.
Kim Seok-jung once cleared the home of a late lyricist and found a set of songs she had not shared with her relatives. He turned them into a song for the bereaved family.
And Cho remembered a high school girl who lived alone in a gosiwon — a cramped room typically less than five square metres — after she escaped domestic violence.
He visited once a month to clean. The teenager, suffering from depression, had been unable to tidy up herself.
Piles of belongings and rotting food covered the bed, and the air was thick with flies.
But she carefully looked after a small box, insisting Cho never throw it away.
She took her own life in that small room a year later.
When Cho returned to clean, he found that a hamster had been living in the box all along.
Beside it sat her guitar — she had dreamed of becoming a musician.
“The moment I saw the hamster, all I could think was that I had to save it and keep it alive,” Cho said.
Kim Doo-nyeon, a veteran in the funeral business, said he has a growing number of recruits in their twenties.
“When people live together, they share things… even if one person dies, those items remain,” he said.
“But when someone dies alone, everything must be cleared away.”
Back at class in Busan, I’m admitted to some trepidation about his chosen career path.
“I am scared,” he said.
“No matter how much you prepare, facing a deceased person is frightening.”</p><small>2025-11-02 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/021500566c7e4f7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952734/ji-chief-criticises-sindh-govts-e-challan-system-calls-for-improving-karachis-infrastructure' target='_blank'><strong>JI chief criticises Sindh govt’s e-challan system, calls for improving Karachi’s infrastructure</strong></a><br><p>Jamaat-i-Islami emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman on Sunday criticised the Sindh government’s e-challan initiative, calling it a “drama” meant to burden citizens instead of improving the city’s transport and road infrastructure.
In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred. Last month, the system was officially inaugurated, drawing a mix of praise and criticism from the public.
Speaking at an event in Karachi today, the JI chief said, “While the government was issuing challans worth Rs5,000, Rs10,000, and even Rs25,000 to Karachi’s commuters, it had failed to provide the city with a viable transport system.”
“When the same challan is Rs200 in Lahore, and Rs5,000 in Karachi, isn’t the criticism on the Pakistan People’s Party valid?” he questioned.
Citing World Bank reports, he said Karachi required around 15,000 buses, but the Sindh government had brought in only 400. According to the 2023 census, Karachi’s official population stood at 20.36 million.
“The entire city has been forced onto motorcycles and Qingqi [rickshaws] because no large-scale transport system exists,” he said, adding that the number of motorbikes in Karachi had now exceeded five million.
The JI leader accused the PPP of “qabza siyasat” (politics of grabbing). “The party has wasted 30 to 40 years of our city and ruined generations,” he said, adding that the PPP had done nothing meaningful for Karachi in the last 15 years.
Naeem also criticised the stalled and poorly executed mega projects launched in the city, including the S-III project, Karachi Circular Railway, Green Line, Red Line, and Orange Line bus services.
 
 

“The KCR has been inaugurated six to eight times by different governments, but still isn’t being made,” he pointed out. “The Green Line stopped midway, and the Red Line has destroyed University Road.”
Praising the efforts of JI’s local town leadership, Hafiz Naeem said the party’s leadership had started a “new journey” in nine towns despite limited resources.
“We said earlier that we will work beyond our means. But the problems of sewerage, sanitation, and garbage management, which are the responsibility of the [Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation] and Mayor Murtaza Wahab, are also being handled by JI’s town chairman and people of the union council (UC),” he said.
He highlighted that JI’s local leadership had resolved long-running sewerage issues in areas such as North Nazimabad by connecting drainage lines to Gujjar Nullah.</p><small>2025-11-02 09:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/02132300806088a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952735/shahid-khaqans-health-has-improved-says-awaam-pakistan-after-cardiac-issue' target='_blank'><strong>Shahid Khaqan’s health has improved, says Awaam Pakistan after cardiac issue</strong></a><br><p>Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi’s health has improved after a cardiac issue yesterday, his Awaam Pakistan party said on Sunday.
Abbasi complained of pain in his shoulder yesterday morning and was “immediately taken to a nearby hospital, where doctors diagnosed a cardiac issue during examination”, Awaam Pakistan spokesperson Dr Zafar Mirza said in a statement.
“The doctors provided him with timely treatment, after which his health has improved significantly, and he is resting at the hospital,” the statement added.
It prayed for the speedy recovery of the Awaam Pakistan chief and urged the media to be considerate of his “private life and privacy”.
 






Awaam Pakistan co-founder Miftah Ismail also said on X that Abbasi’s “health condition continues to improve, and he is now resting comfortably”.
“We expect and pray for his quick and full recovery. I thank friends who have been calling to ask about his health,” the former finance minister added.
 






Anchorperson Nadia Mirza and journalist Asad Toor expressed their wishes on X for the ex-premier’s swift recovery.
 






 






Abbasi and Ismail were previously part of the PML-N but parted ways and launched their Awaam Pakistan party in July 2024 — the idea of which had been floated over a year prior.
Abbasi had tested positive for the coronavirus in June 2020, when numerous other politicians were also contracting the pandemic disease.
In 2019, when imprisoned in an accountability case, Abbasi said a medical board had recommended he undergo surgery. According to his medical report, he had been suffering from hernia pain, gallbladder pain and hypertension.</p><small>2025-11-02 09:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631714-ex-pm-shahid-khaqan-abbasi-hospitalised-after-chest-pain' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi hospitalised after chest pain</strong></a><br><p>

Consumers who have invested up to Rs1 million or more are being told to purchase the AMR meters for Rs52,000, while their existing green meters, which they had earlier bought, will be taken away by the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco).
A number of consumers have approached the Prime Minister’s Portal, seeking relief and requesting the government to stop Iesco from forcing them to purchase new meters.
However, an Iesco official said that although it was principally decided to replace the meters, the implementation has been temporarily put on hold, and a policy will soon be announced in this regard.

Consumers approach PM Portal against demand to replace meters worth Rs52,000 each

It is worth mentioning that a green meter is a bi-directional smart meter that tracks both the electricity a solar-powered home uses and the surplus energy it sends back to the national grid through net metering.
After every three months, the consumption and production are calculated, and the amount is either debited or credited accordingly.
 
 

Solar consumer Muhammad Naeem told Dawn that he was shocked to see the bill, which mentioned that he must replace his green meter with an AMR meter.
“I visited the Iesco office and was told that a demand notice worth Rs52,000 would be issued to me and that I would have to pay the amount. I installed the solar system less than a year ago, investing a little under a million rupees. I have a number of questions: is it mandatory for all green meter holders to get the meter replaced with an AMR meter?” he said.
Another consumer, Maqbood Ahmed, said that when he visited the Iesco office, he was informed that the replacement would make it easier for Iesco staff, as they would no longer need to visit for meter reading or calculations.
When this scribe visited the Iesco office in Sector I-10, an official who introduced himself as Mr Amir said that a large number of solar consumers were visiting the office after seeing the instructions on their bills.
“However, we don’t have a clear policy yet. What I can tell you is that demand notices will be issued, and consumers will have to pay Rs52,000 for the new meter. We don’t know if the meter charges can be deducted from the bills. Consumers should wait for the final policy,” he said in response to queries.
When contacted, an official at Iesco’s Monitoring and Complaint Cell, identified as Mr Imran, said that although some SDOs had issued demand notices, the process had been put on hold as many consumers claimed their meters were still under warranty and questioned why they should bear the cost.
“Several people have also approached the PM Portal, and their applications have been forwarded to Iesco. Therefore, it has been decided to formulate a policy on the matter,” he explained.
Iesco spokesperson Raja Asim, while talking to Dawn, said that the decision to replace green meters with AMR meters was taken for implementation across the country, not by Iesco alone.
He assured that a policy would be framed keeping in view the consumers’ concerns and that all necessary steps would be taken to provide relief.

The island’s confirmed deaths remain at 19 as of Saturday, though Health Minister Christopher Tufton told a briefing, “I would imagine it’s more… because there are still places that we have had difficulties reaching.”
Haiti’s Civil Protection department, meanwhile, said at least 31 people have been killed there as a result of the storm.
Melissa tore across Jamaica as a ferocious top-level Category 5 hurricane, the most powerful storm ever recorded on the island, with sustained winds peaking at 185 miles (nearly 300 kilometers) per hour while drenching the country with torrential rain.
Hospitals in western Jamaica were particularly hard-hit, prompting officials to deploy several field hospitals in the coming days to shore up health responses.
 


The first such field hospital — in Black River, the capital of the hardest hit province — “is expected to be delivered sometime tomorrow and immediately we’ll begin to deploy and to set up that facility,” Tufton said.
“That facility will come fully equipped, which will include an operating theatre and other critical diagnostic equipment, and some team members to support the local team,” he said, adding officials expect the hospital to be up and running in the coming week.
Additional hospitals are expected to pop up with aid from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and several countries, including Spain, Canada and India, Tufton said.</p><small>2025-11-02 07:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631707-islamabad-man-who-assaulted-traffic-policemen-arrested' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad man who assaulted traffic policemen arrested</strong></a><br><p>

Justice Raheel Kamran issued a detailed judgment on a petition filed by one Azhar Ijaz Khawaja who had challenged the orders of a family court of Model Town-Lahore and an additional district & sessions judge, directing him to pay monthly maintenance to his mother, Riffatun Nissa.
The family court had ordered Khawaja and his other three brothers to pay Rs5,000 per month as interim maintenance to their mother by the 14th day of each month. When the payments were not made, the family court struck off their defence and decreed the suit under Section 17-A of the Family Courts Act.
The appellate court/sessions court also upheld that order, prompting the petitioner to approach the LHC.

Accepts a son’s plea against lower court verdict over ‘irrelevant’ section, ‘premature action’

The petitioner’s counsel argued that family courts have no jurisdiction over parental maintenance claims and that Section 17-A, which provides for striking off the defence in case of non-payment, applies only to maintenance for wives and children.He contended that the lower court had acted hastily by passing a decree even before the due date for payment had expired.
 
 

Opposing the plea, the mother’s counsel maintained that under Islamic law and moral obligations, sons are bound to maintain their parents if they are in need and have no independent means of income.
Justice Kamran also sought assistance from amicus curiae Advocate Muhammad Saad Khan, who opined that the Family Courts Act’s term “maintenance” is broad enough to include claims by parents.
The judge, after examining the law and Islamic principles, held that parents can legally file maintenance suits against their children in family courts.
Referring to paragraph 371 of D.F. Mulla’s Principles of Muhammadan Law, the judge noted that Islam obligates children “in easy circumstances” to maintain their poor parents.
However, the judge clarified that Section 17-A applies exclusively to maintenance cases filed by wives or children. Thus, its penal consequences — including the striking off of defence for non-payment — cannot be applied in suits filed by parents against their sons.
Justice Kamran, nevertheless, maintained that family courts can still grant interim maintenance orders for parents under their general powers to prevent destitution.
The judge observed that the family court in the case in hand acted prematurely by invoking coercive measures before the 14-day payment deadline, terming it a “misapprehension of jurisdiction” and a “denial of due process.”
Allowing the petition, the judge set aside the orders of the family court and the sessions court, remanding the case for fresh proceedings in accordance with law.
The judge has clarified an important legal question, ensuring that the elderly and dependent parents have an accessible legal remedy for maintenance while protecting the due process rights of defendants in such cases.
Justice Kamran directed the family court to decide the case afresh expeditiously and forwarded a copy of the judgment for compliance.

“Sadly, a number of the victims we’ve found were minors,” Alfonso Durazo, governor of Sonora state, said in a video message as he announced the toll of 23 dead and another 11 injured.
Durazo said the survivors were being treated at hospitals in the city of Hermosillo, where the explosion took place.
“I have ordered an extensive and transparent investigation to determine the causes of the incident and figure out those responsible,” he said.
 






The prosecutor’s office said in a statement that “the working assumption is that the incident was accidental, and the investigation is looking into a transformer located inside the store“.
“Once the firefighters allow access into the building … it will be possible to precisely determine the cause of the incident,” it added.
The explosion happened at a Waldo’s store in the city centre.
“Nobody will face this pain alone. From the very first moments, emergency, security and health services responded with great professionalism and commitment, controlling the situation and saving lives,” the governor said.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed her condolences on X “to the families and loved ones of those who died.”
“I have been in contact with the Sonora governor, Alfonso Durazo, to provide support where needed. I’ve instructed Interior Secretary Rosa Icela Rodriguez to send a support team in order to assist the families and the injured,” she continued.
 


Mexican media reports said customers sought refuge inside the store after the explosion, only to become trapped by the flames. Images in local media showed the building’s facade blackened from the fire, with windows shattered.
Newspaper El Universal said the explosion occurred around 2pm (1am PKT) and that nearby businesses opted to close their doors in order to prevent the fire from spreading there.
Local authorities urged members of the public to avoid the area of the explosion, and cancelled celebrations scheduled to be held that day in honour of the Day of the Dead holiday.</p><small>2025-11-02 05:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0208470007e8353.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952571/shaheen-babar-star-as-pakistan-clinch-series-with-4-wicket-win-over-south-africa' target='_blank'><strong>Shaheen, Babar star as Pakistan clinch series with 4-wicket win over South Africa</strong></a><br><p>Babar Azam showed his mastery with the bat after Shaheen Shah Afridi led a sparkling bowling performance from Pakistan as the hosts cruised to a four-wicket victory over South Africa in the series-deciding third T20 International at the Gaddafi Stadium on Saturday.
Shaheen picked up 3-26, being the standout of Pakistan’s bowling attack, in which Faheem Ashraf and debutant Usman Tariq picked up two wickets each, as South Africa were restricted to 139-9 after being put into bat.
Babar then provided an anchor in the chase with a brilliant 68, featuring nine fours, as Pakistan eased to victory with six balls to spare.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated the team on X, saying, “Very well-played boys in Green!”
He also commended Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and his team for their “great efforts”.
 






In a statement, Naqvi hailed Babar’s batting and Shaheen’s bowling skills for playing an “important role” in the win.
Conveying his congratulations to Captain Salman Agha, Head Coach Mike Hesson and other players, Naqvi said “teamwork, hard work and professional approach” led to the victory.
 






Shaheen got Pakistan off to a flyer with two wickets halfway through the first over and almost bagged a third victim two balls later.
Opener Quinton de Kock’s stumps were undone on the second ball of the innings with a delivery that jagged back, found an edge and clattered into the woodwork.
On the very next ball, Lhuan-dre Pretorious then spooned a catch to Usman Tariq at short fine-leg.
Pakistan were in dreamland when the umpire adjudged Dewald Brevis lbw on the first ball of a spectacular opening over, only for the decision review system to show that the ball was going to rise over the stumps.
South Africa were rocking and their first boundary only came on the penultimate ball of the third over when opener Reeza Hendricks punched Shaheen away to the extra cover fence.
Things were otherwise kept tight by Shaheen’s new ball partner, Salman Mirza, who came off a sparkling performance in the second match of the series a day earlier, where Pakistan had shot down South Africa for 110 to level the series, giving little away.
Faheem, player-of-the-match on Friday, gave away just two runs in the fifth over with Salman bowling a tidy sixth as South Africa crawled to 22-2 at the end of the powerplay.
 






Brevis, though, broke the shackles with two sixes off spinner Mohammad Nazwaz in the seventh over — the first straight down the ground and the second over deep midwicket.
Brevis (21), though, was gone soon after with debutant spinner Usman Tariq getting his maiden T20I wicket with the second ball of his career; the South African batter finding Babar Azam at long-on as he tried to go big once again.
The incoming Matthew Breetzke didn’t last long, seeing his stumps shattered by Nawaz with a ball that straightened after pitching in the following over as South Africa slipped from 38-2 to 42-4.
Skipper Donovan Ferreira breathed fresh impetus with a six off Usman, as South Africa reached 56-4 halfway through their innings, and then upped the ante with two sixes and a four in the 11th over bowled by Nawaz.
But Ferreira’s big-hitting spree didn’t last long as, after making 29 off 13, he holed out to his counterpart Salman Ali Agha at mid-off in the following over by Faheem.
South Africa were six down on the next ball with George Linde finding Hasan Nawaz at midwicket with Pakistan firmly on top.
Hendricks’ long, patient stay at the crease ended in the 15th over when he top-edged Usman to Hasan at deep backward square to depart for 34 off 36 with two fours.
 






The incoming Andile Simelane then hoisted Shaheen for the fourth six of the innings to set South Africa’s total beyond Friday’s below-par effort, but departed after making 13 when Salman Mirza had him caught at midwicket in the 18th over.
Shaheen bagged his third wicket when he sent back Lizaad Williams in the penultimate over, but Corbin Bosch (30 not out) ensured South Africa reached a respectable total.
Sahibzada Farhan got Pakistan’s first runs in the chase with a six over long-off on the third ball of their innings, but lost his opening partner Saim Ayub in the second over — the left-hander miscuing to Ferreira of Bosch.
Babar, arriving to adoring cheers from the crowd, got his first four on the ninth ball he faced with a sumptuous pull off Williams and then cut him away for another two deliveries later.
Babar was in the mood and swept Linde for a one-bounce four in the following over as Pakistan reached the end of the powerplay at 36-1.
Sahibzada then got his second boundary, driving Ferreira down the ground for four, but departed soon after when the South African skipper had him caught at deep midwicket for 19 on the last ball of the seventh over.
In the face of spin from both ends, Babar and captain Salman Ali Agha sought to steady the chase with just one boundary coming in overs eighth to 10th, by the end of which Pakistan were 64-2.
Boundaries, however, came thick and fast in the 12th over by Ottneil Baartman — Agha’s edge flying to the third man fence after a misfield before Babar got three in a row to raise his half-century off 36 balls.
 






Babar, who returned to the side for the series, was putting on a show and got another two boundaries in the 14th over of Bosch as Pakistan closed in on the target.
Babar and Salman, who was providing able support at the other end, however, couldn’t take Pakistan to the end.
Salman had just got his second boundary but perished on the next ball, having made 33 off 26, when he chipped Williams to Simelane in the 16th over.
Babar fell in the next over, when he pulled Bosch to Hendricks at deep backward square to bring an end to his 47-ball knock.
Two more wickets followed Babar’s fall as Hasan was caught off Williams and Silemane cleaned up Nawaz, but Pakistan eventually wrapped it up with an over to spare.</p><small>2025-11-02 04:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0209474718d2763.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952653/tax-net-expands-with-892000-new-filers' target='_blank'><strong>Tax net expands with 892,000 new filers</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has linked the filing of 892,419 new tax returns for the tax year 2025 to rising public confidence in the government’s reform agenda.
The premier’s remarks followed the Federal Board of Revenue’s announcement that the tax department received 5.912 million tax returns for tax year 2025, up from 5.025m returns in tax year 2024, marking a 17.65 per cent increase. The last date for filing the tax returns was Oct 31.
An official announcement issued by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat has commended the FBR for achieving a historic milestone. He expressed deep gratitude to the public for demonstrating civic responsibility and trust in the government’s economic policies.
Highlighting the inclusion of new filers into the tax net, Prime Minister Shehbaz said this surge reflects growing public confidence in the government’s reform agenda. “We are sincerely thankful to the people for their support,” he stated.

PM Shehbaz links surge in new returns to FBR digitisation drive

Mr Shehbaz attributed the positive outcomes to ongoing tax system reforms, calling them a blessing and a sign of progress.
He emphasised merit as the cornerstone of FBR’s institutional culture, noting that capable and hardworking officers are being encouraged while underperformance is being actively discouraged.
Individual tax filings surge in FY25, with a sharp rise in returns accompanied by payments. The FBR recorded a significant uptick in individual tax filings for the year 2025, with the total number of returns reaching 5.805 million — an 18.18pc increase from the 4.912m filed in the previous year.
Of these, 3.599m returns were submitted along with tax payments, marking a 19pc rise compared to 3.024m paid filings in 2024.
The total tax revenue collected through these returns climbed to Rs69.02bn in FY25, up from Rs60.15bn the year before — reflecting a year-on-year growth of 10pc.
According to the announcement, the prime minister underscored his personal oversight of FBR’s digitisation efforts, chairing weekly meetings to ensure transparency and efficiency.
He noted that tax filing procedures have been simplified, and automated clearance systems at ports have helped curb corruption and improve performance.
The government has launched a simplified tax return form in Urdu for salaried individuals to make tax filing easier.
To combat the informal economy, the government has expanded the use of point-of-sale systems, effectively reducing sales tax evasion.
The prime minister also pointed to a Rs9bn increase in tax revenue along with the filing of tax returns compared to the previous year as clear evidence of the success of FBR’s reforms.
He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to further reforming the FBR and pledged continued efforts to eliminate corruption and the shadow economy. “We are working day and night to ensure a fair and transparent fiscal system,” he concluded.
