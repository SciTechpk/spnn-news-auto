<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68f2eedb7ec05.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949689/departing-mncs' target='_blank'><strong>Departing MNCs</strong></a><br><p>THE recent exit of the American multinational company Procter & Gamble (P&G) from Pakistan has created a stir in the market — unlike the relatively quiet departure of other MNCs over the past three years.
Since 2022, at least 13 companies have exited the country. Among them are four from the pharmaceutical sector, two each from energy and ride-hailing, and one each from technology and telecom. P&G’s departure is particularly significant as it produced a wide range of consumer goods; Gillette was a subsidiary of P&G, and Gul Ahmed Textile had an export garments division associated with it.
People may attribute different reasons to such exits — Pakistan’s challenging economic climate, security concerns, political uncertainty, delays in price approvals, unethical promotional practices by some local pharmaceutical firms, rampant corruption, and inconsistent utilities.
 
 

However, analysts cite different causes. In many cases, these exits are less about Pakistan and more about global restructuring. Several MNCs are relocating as part of a strategic shift towards operating from regional hubs rather than maintaining facilities in every country, allowing them to benefit from economies of scale. Shell’s departure, for example, was part of its global reorganisation.
Growing competition from local firms, the dominance of the informal sector, and shrinking profit margins have also eroded group performance. Combined with high taxation and a weakening rupee, these factors have contributed to the exodus.

MNCs strove to comply fully with applicable laws.

That said, an exit does not always mean the withdrawal of products or brands. Many companies retain their presence thr­ough a distributor model and continue relying on third-party market research and adv­ertising agencies to promote their brands.
MNCs have played a significant role in shaping and developing the ‘corporate culture’ in Pakistan, particularly in Karachi. Corporate culture can be defined as “the personality of a company” which entails its “shared values, beliefs, and behaviours that shape how employees interact with each other and the outside world”.
The golden period for MNCs in Pakistan was spread over the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s. Unlike local employers, MNCs placed top priority on maintaining emp­l­o­yee relations. Higher employee satisfaction translated into greater productivity and better business outcomes. Customer care was another area of emphasis: companies ensured that clients anywhere in Pakistan had easy access to their representatives for queries and assistance with transactions.
MNCs introduced professional management systems that were largely absent in local enterprises. These included structured training and development, job des­criptions, performance evaluations, career progression, and policy frameworks for human resources and other departments. Expenditure on employee development was considered an investment — based on the belief that improved knowledge and skills would enhance productivity.
MNCs also strove to comply fully with applicable laws, including labour regulations. They generally supported workers’ right to form and operate trade unions, fostering mutual respect. Because of fair dealings by management, unions would often reciprocate, ensuring a peaceful work environment. Even during the early 1970s — a period of industrial unrest — MNCs largely remained unaffected due to their ethical and transparent practices. The relative stability of the 1960s further encouraged entrepreneurs to invest not only in trade but also in manufacturing.
A notable example is Esso, which established its fertiliser plant in Daharki, Sindh, in 1968. Inc­o­r­porated as Esso Fer­ti­liser Pakistan Ltd in 1965, the plant — then the largest forei­gn in­­vestment in Pakistan — began producing urea in 1968. Later renamed Exxon Che­m­ical Pakistan Ltd (ECPL), it was sold to employees in 1991 through an employee-led buyout. It was regarded as a model company with exemplary management practices and performance.
Another corporate giant, Imperial Chemical Industries, a British firm, had established a soda ash plant in Khewra in 1944, which became Khewra Soda Ash Company Ltd in 1952. The company was renamed ICI Pakistan Ltd in 1966. It maintained a head office and a specialty chemicals unit in Karachi, produced pharmaceuticals and agrochemical products, and operated a paints plant in Lahore and a polyester fibre plant in Sheikhupura. Later, it set up a Pure Terephthalic Acid plant at Port Qasim, Karachi.
As ICI wound up operations globally, its Pakistan operations were sold in July 2012 to an established industrial group through a consortium led by a dominant cement company. It is heartening that the successors of both ECPL and ICI continue to follow the management systems they inherited from these global corporate giants.

The PTI, the opposition and the governor of KP interpreted the Constitution in their own self-serving ways.
At issue was the legal point raised by the opposition and the governor that the election of the new CM was not possible till the resignation of the then outgoing provincial chief executive became effective after the governor’s ‘verification’ and formal ‘acceptance’.
It is not clear what the opposition thought it would gain by delaying the election when none of the three major opposition parties could agree on a joint candidate to contest the vote against PTI nominees. Nor was any effort, unlike in the past, made to pressure or entice pro-PTI MPAs to defect.
 
 

Defection, in fact, had been made easier by the Election Commission when it declared the pro-PTI MPAs of the Sunni Ittehad Council independent, thus free from any obligation to follow any party’s direction. The opposition, it seems, was misled into playing a game without a plan, probably encouraged by some powerful voices that had publicly ‘rejected’ PTI leader Imran Khan’s choice of Sohail Afridi as the new CM.
There are no constitutional provisions to support the position taken by the opposition and the governor on the issue of the CM’s resignation, and the resignation becomes automatically effective upon being tendered to the governor.
Had there been any doubt about the ‘genuineness’ of the resignation, it was wiped out when the then outgoing CM, Ali Amin Gandapur, publicly announced in the provincial assembly that he had resigned and the ‘joke’ about delaying the election of his successor should come to a stop.

It is unclear how far the new CM’s conduct will be different from that of his predecessor.

The CM’s election in the legislature further sealed the opposition’s fate when the new provincial chief executive was elected by a thumping majority, securing 90 votes in a House of 145. This was an overwhelming mandate as a candidate for CM needed only 73 votes to prove his or her numerical majority.
 
 

In this case, the new CM actually secured 17 extra votes, reflecting that not even a single pro-PTI ‘independent’ MPA wavered by defecting as the practice has sadly been in the past. As another new normal in Pakistani politics, the matter landed in the Peshawar High Court where the chief justice promptly accepted the PTI’s point of view and directed the governor to administer the oath to the chief minister-elect by a fixed time, and nominated, under Article 255(2), the KP Assembly Speaker to conduct the oath in case the governor was unwilling or unable to comply with the court’s direction.
It is ironical that Article 255(2) was amended under the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which gave the power to the provincial high court to nominate someone else to administer the oath if the governor was not available to do so. Earlier, this power to nominate someone else was available with the governor. Had this article not been amended, the opposition and the governor might have delayed the oath-taking by a few more days.
A division bench of the Peshawar High Court also rejected the plea filed by one of the opposition candidates seeking to declare the CM’s election unconstitutional. Understandably, the PTI leadership was profuse in its praise for the judiciary for delivering justice to their party and candidate.
 
 

Fortunately, the governor eventually administered the oath to the CM-elect in the stately Governor’s House though surrounded by a messy crowd which constantly pushed and jostled to get close to the CM. This is how the first phase of the new saga came to an end.
It remains to be seen how far the policy and conduct of the new CM will be different from that of Mr Gandapur, who constantly tried to navigate a balancing act. On the one hand, there were clear instructions from Imran Khan to leave no stone unturned to secure his and his wife’s release, along with that of scores of other incarcerated party leaders, even if it meant violent confrontation with the federal government and its law enforcers.
The former CM had led quite a few rallies to Islamabad — some of them violent; he sounded aggressive most of the time and even threatened to respond, bullet for bullet, if his rally was stopped again. Despite this confrontational posture, he did not cross certain red lines and that might have been his undoing.
For example, he was asked not to let the annual provincial budget 2025-26 pass in the assembly but he justifiably didn’t comply. He also held meetings with the federal interior minister and shook his hand, too, which was criticised in the strongest, even obscene, terms in pro-PTI social media.
 
 

He had practically abandoned the idea of leading assault rallies from KP to the national capital after the violent end of the Oct 24, 2024, rally in Islamabad. He also failed to comply with the wishes of Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan and wife Bushra Bibi. His public criticism of Aleema Khan might have proven to be the proverbial last straw. In short, he was not aggressive enough for the likes of Imran Khan and his family.
The new CM has declared in his post-election maiden speech in the assembly that he is the ‘champion of agitational politics’. Instead of focusing on education, health, development and governance, he said that his top priority was to secure the release of Imran Khan and his wife. This must have gone down well with the PTI leader and his family. He also said in his first speech that he was Pakistani first and Pakhtun later.
One is not sure how much this will calm the nerves of his detractors; we must wait and see if his ‘balancing act’ works better than that of his predecessor.

On Monday, members of the far-right party and LEAs clashed in Muridke, as the state aborted the group’s attempt to march on Islamabad, apparently to protest in front of the US embassy in ‘solidarity’ with Gaza.
From then onwards, the TLP’s leaders have reportedly gone underground, thousands of supporters have been rounded up, while the group’s mosques and madressahs are being seized by the state. Unlike previous clashes between the TLP and the government, this time it appears that the rulers aim to dismantle the religiously inspired party permanently. On Friday, the Punjab information minister said the summary to ban the TLP had been sent to the centre. Earlier, several federal ministers said that the crackdown would not relent. This would be the second ban in the TLP’s turbulent decade-old history.
However, simply publishing a notification in the official gazette may not be enough to deal effectively with the TLP phenomenon. In Pakistan’s history of far-right religious activism, most sectarian and jihadi groups have belonged to the Deobandi or Ahle Hadith schools, while there have also been a few prominent Shia militant groups.
 
 

The TLP, meanwhile, represents the Barelvi school, and has used emotive topics such as blasphemy and other sensitive religious issues to mobilise the public. Its history is certainly problematic. It has on numerous occasions clashed with the law, while its role in organising mobs has also been troubling.
Moreover, it has supported violent campaigns against minority groups, including Christians and Ahmadis, particularly in Punjab, targeting the places of worship of these communities. The TLP is also a major political force, getting millions of votes in the last general elections. Therefore, while an official clampdown may provide temporary relief, it might not produce long-term results.
Banning groups in Pakistan has not proved effective in countering extremist violence. For example, the first major bans were put in place during the Musharraf regime. Many of the groups remain active more than two decades after they were ‘banned’, changing their names several times.
 
 

If the state really wants to address the issue of the TLP and other violent groups, instead of bans, it should focus on prosecuting the leaders and activists who promote and participate in violence and who actively engage in hate speech. Because the state has been weak thus far in enforcing the law, powerful violent groups have gained the confidence to continue with their disruptive activities. Groups must be free to organise, but no one can be allowed to advocate violence against any community, or endorse hate speech.
Moreover, protests must remain peaceful. If the state ‘bans’ groups, then loses interest and starts looking away, these outfits will re-emerge, and the cycle of violence and confrontation will continue in perpetuity.

The National Assembly Standing Committee’s decision came following a briefing given by Pakistan Rail­ways’ officials to the committee about the October 7 attack on the Jaffer Express.
The officials said that Jaffer Exp­ress was targeted with an improvised explosives device on October 7 near Sultan Kot Railways Station in Sindh.
The blast derailed five bogies and damaged the track. Seven passengers, including Pakistan Railw­ays employees, suffered injuries.
The standing committee, chaired by Ramesh Lal in the absence of the chairman, heard updates on the Jaffer Express train blast, encroachments of railways lands and Kara­chi-Pipri freight corridor project.
 
 

Briefing the committee on the freight corridor project, the secretary of Pakistan Railways said the project would start from Keamari, linking Karachi Port to Pipri. On this route, he said, two new railway lines will be laid to connect it with Motorway M-9.
The committee also discussed various aspects of the project. The panel was informed that the terminal will initially operate on a small scale, and the first pha­­se is expected to be co­­m­­pleted within six months.
The committee was further informed that 17 freight trains will operate on a daily basis and the project will cost $400 million.
Divisional Superinten­d­ent of Pakistan Railways in Sukkur brie­fed the commit­tee about encroachments on PR land in Sukkur.
He said that 16,458 acres of land were under operational use, 3,253.233 acres under encroachment, and 457 acres occupied by land grabbers.

According to police, the case was lodged on the written complaint of Khuda Bakhsh, a resident of Sarbandan in the Dasht area, who alleged that Mr Baloch accused the FC of being responsible for killings in various areas.
The complainant further stated that Mufti Shah Mir and Maulana Ghulam Sarwar were killed by unidentified assailants, but Mr Baloch blamed the FC for their deaths without any evidence.
Police have registered the FIR against the JI leader under sections 124, 506, 505, and 504 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), as well as sections 26, 20, and 11 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016.

The interior minister’s remarks came during a meeting with Jamiat Ule­ma-i-Pakistan Secre­tary General Allama Shah Owais Noorani, in which detailed discussions were held on religious harmony, tolerance, and national unit, according to a press release by the Interior Ministry.
Both leaders agreed that “no action would be taken against any innocent person, and all of the innocent will be released,” the ministry said. They also agreed that no madressah [seminary] will be closed down.
 






Mr Naqvi reiterated that those bearing arms against the government will face the law.
“Holding arms against the state can never be allowed,” Mr Naqvi was quoted as saying, adding that the leaders also agre­­ed that “the miscreants will be dealt with strictly.”
Mr Naqvi emphasised that no one will be permitted to take the law into their own hands.
“There is no place for miscreants and extremists in the Pakistan of Quaid-i-Azam,” Naqvi said, adding that elements spreading “unrest, chaos, and extremism will be dealt with with an iron hand.”
 
 

The minister acknowledged the valuable role religious scholars play in promoting interfaith harmony and patience.
He stressed that the promotion of religious education is a collective responsibility and called on all segments of society to ensure lasting peace, tolerance, and harmony.
Allama Noorani, in turn, assured the government of his party’s “full cooperation” in promoting sustainable peace, tolerance, and brotherhood across the country.

However, his father, Assistant Commissioner Ziarat Muhammad Afzal Baqi, is still missing, and authorities are making all-out efforts for his safe recovery.
Police officials said that after his recovery, Mustansar Bilal, the son of assistant commissioner, reached the Zardalo area of Harnai, from where he was taken into protective custody and handed over to the Deputy Commissioner Harnai.
It may be recalled that the assistant commissioner and his son were abducted about two months ago by unidentified armed men while returning to Ziarat after a picnic along with their family. The kidnappers allowed the family members, security guard and driver to go home after setting the official vehicle on fire.
 
 

On Sept 21, reports circulated that the kidnappers had killed AC Ziarat and dumped his body in a mountainous area of Harnai district. An official of Ziarat administration also confirmed that Afzal Baqi had been killed by the kidnappers and even released a photograph purported to be his body.
However, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti later informed the provincial assembly that the killing of the assistant commissioner was not confirmed, assuring that the government was making all-out efforts for his safe recovery.
Officials said that Mustansar Bilal reached the Zardalo area of Harnai district and informed local authorities about his presence in the area. “Mustansar is safe and sound in the custody of Deputy Commissioner Harnai,” police officials said.
Authorities, however, said that AC Ziarat remains missing and efforts were underway for his safe recovery. They did not disclose how Mustansar Bilal managed to reach Harnai.

• Preliminary damage of this year’s floods put at $2.9bn across sectors
• 1,039 dead, 1,067 injured; surveys to conclude in two weeks
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan suffered more than $30 billion in damages and losses in the 2022 floods but received only $600 million in foreign assistance, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Friday.
Apart from that, all international commitments were loans, most of them repurposed from previous facilities, he said while releasing preliminary estimates for flood-related damages at Rs822bn (about $2.9bn).
“This is an irony,” he said, adding that the global community had pledged a $100bn climate-finance fund but “did not provide even $1bn”.
Therefore, after consultations, the government decided to meet the latest losses through domestic resources rather than “external crutches” despite the around $3bn damages to agriculture and infrastructure on top of human lives following the recent “apocalyptic floods”.
The minister said the surveys for flood losses, including those in the economic field, were currently in progress and would be finalised in about two weeks. He said the preliminary report entailed human losses of more than 1,039 lives and 1067 injuries, besides about Rs822bn damage to infrastructure and agriculture.
 
 

This included Rs430bn damages in the agriculture sector, Rs307bn in infrastructure, besides damage to more than 229,763 houses, including 213,000 in Punjab alone.
Besides, 6,370 houses were damaged or destroyed in Balochistan, 3,677 in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, 3,332 in Sindh and 3,222 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“At least 6.5m people across 70 districts have felt the brunt, including around 4m temporarily displaced as waters receded and families assessed the wreckage”, he said.
More than 2,811 kilometres of roads were damaged, over 2,200 head of livestock lost, around 2,200 educational institutions affected, more than 250 health facilities impacted and roughly 866 water-infrastructure assets hit, he added.
Crop losses included up to 3.4m bales of cotton, more than 1m tonnes of rice and an estimated 1.3m to 3.3m tonnes of sugarcane, subject to ground verification.
Punjab suffered the most, with Rs632bn of the nationwide Rs822bn tally, the minister said, adding that the provincial chief minister had briefed a meeting chaired by the prime minister on a support package for farmers and families.
On development expenditure, Mr Iqbal said that about Rs40bn had been disbursed under the Public Sector Development Programme in the first quarter, almost 16 per cent higher than last year’s Rs34.8bn.
Addressing progress under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, he said minutes of the recent Joint Cooperation Committee would be finalised by the end of the month and dispelled the impression that tangible progress on the second phase of bilateral economic cooperation was missing in the JCC.
At Pakistan’s request, China had agreed to finance 85 per cent of the Karakoram Highway works linked to the Diamer-Bhasha Dam, with bidding expected to start in about two months, he said.
 
 

The government has designated 2026 as the “year of reform” to modernise the economy, society and politics, the minister announced, aiming to convert recent diplomatic and macroeconomic gains into faster growth through “bold and quick” structural changes.
A three-year reform window would prioritise social, economic and political measures to encourage wealth creation and investment, remove “anti-business bias” and cut red tape and bureaucratic inertia. The prime minister has constituted a high-level forum to present an action plan this year for implementation in 2026.
The minister said that while the National  Institute of Public Administration was being converted into a university to train bureaucracy in line with global standards for economic development and business promotion, many of the social sector reforms were not possible without the full involvement of provinces.

Speaking at the Rome Water Dialogue convened by the Food and Agric­ulture Organisation, he warned that any nation attempting to control transboundary water flows violates international law.
“Any attempt to unilaterally alter transboundary water flows or weaponise water access is not only dangerous but contrary to international norms and sustainable development goals,” Mr Shah said.
Representing Pakistan at the global forum, Mr Shah raised serious concerns about India’s conduct regarding the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), long seen as a successful example of bilateral cooperation.
 
 

“The Indus Waters Treaty has long been considered a model of cooperation, even during times of conflict between Pakistan and India,” he said. “However, India’s recent unilateral actions to suspend treaty-level engagements risk undermining this crucial framework.”
Mr Shah described the IWT as one of the world’s most resilient water-sharing agreements and urged the international community to take note of what he called a threat to transboundary water governance. He called on global stakeholders to ensure that such treaties remain “sacrosanct”.
“The international community (must) act as stewards of peace and justice,” Shah forcefully urged, stressing the importance of the treaty for the well-being of Pakistan’s population.

In addition, security forces claimed to have foiled a terror bid in Bajaur after a large cache of explosives, loaded into a non-Customs paid vehicle, was destroyed in Lowi Mamund tehsil.
In Lakki Marwat, officials said an operation was launched on reports about the presence of militants in the rural area located on the border with Punjab, near Mianwali.
Security forces spotted the terrorist hideout in the forest between Kaichi Kamar and Sultankhel, which was reportedly targeted through a unmanned drone.

Forces foil major terror bid in Bajaur by disabling explosive-laden vehicle

During the operation, eight militants were eliminated and their hideouts were destroyed, while security forces seized a large quantity of arms, ammunition and explosives and launched a sanitisation operation to neutralise any other threats in the area.
 
 

Separately, TTP ‘commander’ Tariq Kochi, who hails from Toi Khula tehsil of Lower South Waziristan, was reportedly killed near the border with Balochistan by unidentified gunmen.
Sources said the incident occurred near the Tesh mountain range, where Kochi and other militants were ambushed by unidentified individuals.
Police said that Kochi had been involved for the past year in multiple incidents of attacks, shootings, and target killings targeting security forces, police personnel, and civilians in the area.
Security forces also claimed to have foiled a terrorism bid by destroying a huge cache of explosives loaded in a car in Bajaur.
A senior police official said that the sabotage bid was foiled in Thangai area at around 11:15 am, when the security personnel targeted a suspected vehicle laden with explosives.
DPO Waqas Rafique said the explosives-laden vehicle was disabled by firing at it, adding that no loss of life was reported.
The official, however, said that an investigation was underway to ascertain who was behind the failed sabotage bid.

Speaking at a signing ceremony, the prime minister described the transaction as “the first drop of rain” in a broader effort to deepen economic collaboration with the United Arab Emirates.
 






The event marked the official transfer of a majority stake in FWBL to IHC under a government-to-government (G2G) framework. The UAE delegation was led by Sheikh Zayed bin Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chairman of 2PointZero.
The federal cabinet had earlier approved the divestment of the government’s entire stake in FWBL, reportedly valued at $14.6 million (approximately Rs4.1 billion), a figure yet to be formally disclosed.

Buyer to inject Rs6.8bn more to meet capital requirements

In addition to acquiring the bank, IHC will meet the total minimum capital requirement of Rs10bn over five years. As of December 2024, FWBL’s equity stood at Rs3.2bn, with the new investor set to inject Rs6.8bn to bridge the gap.

PM Shehbaz attributed the successful closure of the deal to the “determined and focused” leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Adviser on Privatisation Muhammad Ali. He reaffirmed his government’s commitment to restructuring state-owned enterprises and enabling private sector-led economic growth.
He added that FWBL’s founding mission — to support women entrepreneurs — would not only be preserved but also strengthened through professional management and targeted investments in sectors such as agriculture and industry.
IHC sees long-term growth
IHC Chief Executive Syed Basar Shueb said the investment signals confidence in Pakistan’s financial sector and reflects a shared vision for long-term development.
“We see strong potential in the country’s financial sector and look forward to supporting the bank’s modernisation journey by leveraging technology, automating banking processes, and advancing the use of AI in financial decision-making,” he said.
According to an official statement, this marks the first bank privatisation conducted under the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act 2022. FWBL, established in 1989, currently operates 42 branches across Pakistan, serving retail, SME, and corporate clients.

• Strikes come despite extension of ceasefire; security officials say ‘truce with Afghan govt, not terror outfits’
• Khawaja Asif accuses Afghan Taliban of ‘sitting in India’s lap’; says terrorists will be made to pay heavy price, wherever they are
• Questions remain over Qatar-mediated talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in absence of clarity over who will attend
ISLAMABAD: With representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, a telling statement from the country’s defence minister indicated that the gloves were off, as Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack, targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day ceasefire.
Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters.
“If someone attacks Afgha­nistan, our forces are ready to respond,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Ariana News. However, Pakistani security sources pointed out that the ceasefire agreement bet­ween the Afghan government and Pakistan did not preclude stri­kes on terror outfits and their hideouts.
 
 

There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day.
Although there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on losses suffered, security sources claimed to have foiled the attack by eliminating all attackers.
The attack began on Friday morning, with local sources describing a massive explosion, followed by heavy gunfire as terrorists attempted to enter the military camp. Sources said that “all four” attackers were killed.
Heavy price to pay
In a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past. “There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote.
Mr Asif accused Afghanistan of “sitting in India’s lap and plotting conspiracies against Pakis­tan”, saying that Islamabad “can no longer afford to have relations with Kabul like in the past”.
“All Afghans on Pakistani soil will have to go back to their homeland,” he wrote. “Now they have their own government [or] caliphate in Kabul. It has been five years since the Islamic revolution… they must live with Pakistan as neighbours.”
 






In the post, the defence minister elaborated on the visits by Pakistani delegations to Kabul and provided figures for acts of terrorism by groups operating out of Afghanistan and the total number of casualties.
Since the Taliban took power in 2021, Pakistani foreign ministers visited Kabul four times; defence ministers and the ISI chiefs visited twice; the special representative and foreign secretaries carried out five visits each; the national security adviser visited once, and the Joint Coordination Committee had eight meetings in the Afghan capital.
He added that there were 225 border flag meetings, 836 protest notes and 13 demarches.
“From 2021 to date: 3,844 mar­tyred (civilians, military, and law enforcement agencies combined). Terrorist incidents: 10,347,” the defence minister listed.
Truce talks?
The fresh exchanges on Fri­day night cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks.
“The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday.
The two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period.
 
 

Earlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.”
He warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action. This fire will spread. This has to be stopped.”
 


No bilateral initiative for talks emerged during the first phase of the truce. How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.
Reports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would include Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub Mujahid and intelligence chief Mullah Wasiq.  Pakistan’s Foreign Office stayed silent on the matter, but a late-evening meeting between National Security Adviser and ISI chief Lt. Gen. Asim Malik and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar suggested that Gen Malik may travel to Doha.
Return of victims’ remains
Earlier on Friday, Afghan authorities handed over the bodies of seven Pakistani citizens — including two security personnel — to Pakistani officials at the border following the deadly Taliban attack in the Chaman sector on Tuesday.
“The Taliban authorities handed over all the seven bodies to Pakistan through Hilal-e-Ahmar Pakistan (Red Cres­cent),” Abdul Wali Khan Ghabizai of the Balochistan chapter of the organization confirmed. He said Taliban officials announced at the Vesh Mandi border post that they were returning the remains of Pakistanis who had died “in the armed clash between two countries.”
The bodies were taken to the District Hospital in Chaman for identification and medicolegal formalities.
“Five bodies were brought to the district hospital Chaman,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, the hospital’s medical superintendent. “Four out of five martyrs have been identified as residents of the border town, while the fifth could not be identified so far.”
Two of the deceased were identified as security personnel — Naik Suleman and Sepoy Sabir — whose remains were later transferred to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta. Officials said that four of the five civilians were killed by mortar shell splinters, while one was hit in the forehead. The victims — identified as Syed Ali Adozai, Muhammad Asghar Ashaizai, Rozi Khan Salehzai, and Nasibullah Salehzai — were local daily-wage workers. They were buried in their native villages Friday evening.
Local residents in Chaman claimed that at least 12 Pakistani civ­ilians were killed earlier in Taliban attacks in Spin Boldak, the first Afghan district across the border.
Responding to reports that bodies of some Pakistani soldiers had been mutilated, the Foreign Office spokesman at the weekly media briefing said, “This kind of savagery, bestiality, is condemnable, and it needs to be condemned in the strongest words possible. This is beyond the pale. It is beyond humanity, and this has deeply offended us and deeply hurt the Pakistani people.” “It is not something to be forgi­ven and forgotten easily,” Mr Khan added.

“Hopefully, they won’t need it. Hopefully we’ll be able to get the war over with without thinking about Tomahawks,” Trump told journalists, including an AFP reporter, as the two leaders met at the White House.
Trump added that he was confident of getting Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion he launched in 2022, following a phone call with the Kremlin chief a day earlier.
The US and Russian presidents agreed on Thursday to a new summit in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, which would be their first since an August meeting in Alaska that failed to produce any kind of peace deal.
“I think that President Putin wants to end the war,” Trump said.
But Zelensky, who wore a dark suit for his third meeting with Trump in Washington since the US president’s return to power, demurred, saying that Putin was “not ready” for peace.
Ukraine has been lobbying Washington for Tomahawks for weeks, arguing that the missiles could help put pressure on Russia to end its brutal three-and-a-half-year invasion. But on the eve of Zelensky’s visit, Putin warned Trump in a call against delivering the weapons, saying it could escalate the war and jeopardise peace talks.
Trump said the United States had to be careful not to “deplete” its own supplies of Tomahawks, which have a range of over 1,600 kilometres.
‘Many questions’
Diplomatic talks on ending Russia’s invasion have stalled since the Alaska summit. But Trump, who once said he could end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, appears set on pursuing a breakthrough to follow the Gaza ceasefire deal that he brokered last week.
The Kremlin said Friday that “many questions” needed resolving before Putin and Trump could meet, including who would be on each negotiating team.
But it brushed off suggestions Putin would have difficulty flying over European airspace.
Hungary said it would ensure Putin could enter and “hold successful talks” with the US despite an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes.
“Budapest is the only suitable place in Europe for a USA-Russia peace summit,” Hungarian President Viktor Orban said on X on Friday.
 






Trump frustration
Zelensky’s visit to Washington, Ukraine’s main military backer, will be his third since Trump returned to office. During this time, Trump’s position on the Ukraine war has shifted dramatically back and forth.
At the start of his term, Trump and Putin reached out to each other as the US leader derided Zelensky as a “dictator without elections.”

Tensions came to a head in February, when Trump accused his Ukrainian counterpart of “not having the cards” in a rancorous televised meeting at the Oval Office. Relations between the two have since warmed as Trump has expressed growing frustration with Putin.
But Trump has kept a channel of dialogue open with Putin, saying that they “get along.” The US leader has repeatedly changed his position on sanctions and other steps against Russia following calls with the Russian president.
Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, describing it as a “special military operation” to demilitarise the country and prevent the expansion of Nato.
Kyiv and its European allies say the war is an illegal land grab that has resulted in tens of thousands of civilian and military casualties and widespread destruction.
Russia now occupies around a fifth of Ukrainian territory — much of it ravaged by fighting. On Friday, the Russian defence ministry announced it had captured three villages in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv regions.</p><small>2025-10-17 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629128-adviser-warns-against-weaponising-water-as-threat-to-global-norms' target='_blank'><strong>Adviser warns against weaponising water as threat to global norms</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier this week, AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed announced that he had resigned from his position, citing “some unavoidable reasons”. However, a senior official at the AJK prime minister’s office told Dawn.com that the resignation had been “received but not yet accepted”.
AJK Finance Minister Abdul Majid Khan and Food Minister Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim announced today they would step down at a joint press conference at the Muzaffarabad Press Club, while Sports, Youth and Culture Minister Asim Sharif Butt sent his resignation directly to the prime minister, opting to stay away from media interaction.
All three were elected on PTI tickets in the 2021 general elections from LA-45 (Valley-VI), LA-38 (Jammu-V) and LA-42 (Valley-III) — constituencies reserved for Kashmiri refugees who migrated to Pakistan after 1947. However, the trio had later joined the faction of PTI defectors led by PM Haq in 2023.
Their resignations came in protest against the agreement recently signed by a seven-member federal government committee and the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC), which, among other matters, addressed the contentious issue of the 12 legislative assembly seats reserved for Kashmiri refugees settled across Pakistan.
Calling the JAAC an “unelected, baton-wielding group”, Khan and Ibrahim said the accord had effectively legitimised an “unconstitutional and morally indefensible demand, reached under pressure and without wider consultation”.
They alleged that the deal violated the fundamental rights of thousands of Kashmiri refugees and struck at the heart of AJK’s constitutional and political framework.
They maintained that the campaign against the refugee seats was a malicious move by a small group of traders and self-styled representatives pursuing narrow interests “under the guise of reforms”.
The real target, they asserted, was not the government but the identity, representation and political recognition of the refugee community that had made immense sacrifices for Pakistan and the cause of Kashmir’s accession.
Both ministers argued that these seats were not a privilege but a historic and conscious constitutional decision, which was part of AJK’s political setup since 1947. The reserved seats, they said, symbolised the constitutional acknowledgment of the sacrifices and long displacement endured by those who lost everything for the cause of Pakistan.
They termed the JAAC’s questioning of these seats’ existence a denial of the pain, identity and political significance of an entire generation exiled for its struggle for accession to Pakistan.
They said they had brought this issue to the notice of the president and prime minister of Pakistan in black and white, and added that they would “knock on all doors to frustrate the designs of the elements hellbent upon creating a wedge between local and migrant Kashmiris and thus damaging the Kashmir cause”.
Khan also shared his two-page resignation letter, in which he reaffirmed his belief in the ideology of the State of Jammu and Kashmir’s lawful accession and integration with Pakistan, in accordance with the wishes of its entire population, including the 2.5 million Pakistan-based refugees.
He said it had become “utterly impossible to continue to serve under the present government, which has failed to effectively defend and protect the constitutional rights of Kashmiri refugees, nor shown the will to assume responsibility or challenge this serious constitutional violation”.
Declaring that he had no moral choice but to resign from the AJK cabinet, effective today, Khan vowed to continue defending the rights of Jammu and Kashmir refugees and to raise his voice for their rightful place in the political and constitutional structures of both AJK and Pakistan.
In his resignation letter, Ibrahim echoed similar views, stating that Prime Minister Haq had failed to stop the “unlawful demand” raised by the JAAC and to protect the rights of around three million Pakistan-based refugees from occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
Both Khan and Ibrahim charged PM Haq of conspiring against the refugee members of the legislative assembly and called upon him to resign from office.
Butt, in his letter, expressed his and his constituents’ loss of confidence in the AJK government in the wake of the agreement, saying he could no longer remain part of it.
Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down at the end of September.
Since then, rival groups staged protests and strikes, trading blame for the violence which marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory.
On October 2, a delegation from the federal government travelled to Muzaffarabad for talks with the JAAC in a bid to put an end to the ongoing unrest in the territory. The agreement was signed after two rounds of talks.</p><small>2025-10-17 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/172028031ea7938.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949562/fact-check-viral-visuals-do-not-show-afghanistan-missile-test-amid-pakistan-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral visuals do not show Afghanistan missile test amid Pakistan tensions</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple Afghan and Indian accounts on social media platform X on October 16, 2025, shared visuals claiming to show the Afghanistan defence forces successfully testing a missile with a 400-kilometre range amid the recent fighting with Pakistan. However, the visuals do not show any Afghan missile test.
On Sunday, fierce border clashes between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban resulted in the martyrdom of 23 troops and left over 200 Taliban fighters dead, including a number of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan terrorists. Both nations claimed to have destroyed the border posts of the other side.
On Tuesday, fighting flared up again between the neighbours in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The next day, the third major skirmish also took place, with the Pakistani security forces saying an attack by the Afghan Taliban was repulsed in Spin Boldak, killing about 15-20 Taliban fighters.
Meanwhile, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said in a social media post that the Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. Mujahid claimed that more than 12 civilians were killed and over 100 were injured in the attacks carried out by Pakistani forces with the use of “light and heavy weapons”.
On October 16, a pro-Afghan account shared an image on X of a missile being fired. The caption of the post, which gained 83,000 views, said: “Breaking news: Afghanistan’s defence forces have successfully tested a missile capable of hitting a target up to 400 kilometres away. Our own missile … congratulations, from our hands to yours.”
The same image with a similar claim was shared by another Afghan user with the caption: “Reliable security sources say that Afghanistan’s defence forces have successfully tested a missile capable of striking targets at a range of 400 kilometres.” The post gained over 93,000 views.
Other Afghan users on X also shared the video and claim, as can be seen here, here, here and here; collectively gaining more than 76,000 views.
The image with the same claim was also shared by the Afghan government’s Urdu account on X, but was later deleted.
 


Some Indian accounts shared a video of the missile launch as well, gaining over 11,000 views.
Meanwhile, some users, Afghan and Indian, shared a different and longer video with the same claim, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, gaining over 35,500 views collectively.
Russian news outlet RT International also shared the video with a similar claim, but later deleted the post.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter.
A keyword search conducted to corroborate whether any such missile tests were conducted in Afghanistan yielded no news or video reports from any mainstream and credible Afghan or international media outlets.
The search also did not yield any news reports in general about the current Afghan regime having any such missile capabilities.
A reverse image search for the first image and video yielded a news report dated February 24, 2023, from South Korean media outlet YTN titled: ‘North Korea: Yesterday, we launched four strategic cruise missiles into the East Sea … a show of nuclear warfare readiness’.
Sharing the same visuals, YTN reported North Korea’s launch of four Arrow-2 strategic cruise missiles into the East Sea on February 23 to test its nuclear warfare readiness.
The missile test was also covered in a news report by international wire news agency Reuters on February 24, 2023, titled: ‘North Korea test-fires cruise missiles to demonstrate nuclear counterattack’.
Meanwhile, a reverse image search for the second and longer video yielded a May 10, 2025, YouTube video by Pakistani financial news outlet Business Recorder titled: “‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’: Pakistan’s Fatah-1 missile fired at Indian airbase”.
The video showed a missile launched by the Pakistan Army at an Indian airbase during the fighting between the two countries in May 2025.
The claim that viral visuals show the Afghanistan military conducting a missile test amid the recent hostilities with Pakistan is false. The videos are from older unrelated events and there is no evidence for Afghanistan conducting any such test.</p><small>2025-10-17 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1718303634da4b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949553/trump-says-he-expects-expansion-of-abraham-accords-soon' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says he expects expansion of Abraham accords soon</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said he expected an expansion of the Abraham Accords soon and hopes Saudi Arabia will join the pact that normalised diplomatic relations between Israel and some Arab states.
“I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in. I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in,” Trump said in an interview broadcast on Friday on Fox Business Network.
Trump said he had “some very good conversations” as recently as Wednesday with states that have indicated their willingness to join the accords.
“I think that they’re going to all go in very soon,” Trump said in the interview, which was recorded on Thursday.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed the accords in 2020 during Trump’s first term in the White House, breaking a longstanding taboo to become the first Arab states to recognise Israel in a quarter century. Morocco and Sudan followed suit.
Trump, who convened Muslim and European leaders in Egypt to discuss the future of the Gaza Strip on Monday, has presented his plan to end the onslaught in Gaza as the catalyst for a wider regional peace settlement.
He said then that more countries would join the Abraham Accords initiative and even floated the idea of a peace deal between arch Middle East enemies Iran and Israel, telling the Israeli parliament he thought Iran wanted one: “Wouldn’t it be nice?”
Earlier in June, Foreign Mini­ster Ishaq Dar ruled out the possibility of Pakistan joining the Abraham Accords, stating that such a move would effectively mean abandoning the country’s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict and recognising Israel.
“We are not ready to recognise Israel until the two-state solution to the Palestine conflict is accepted,” Dar said. “There is no change in our stated policy on the Palestine issue.”</p><small>2025-10-17 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17181302fcdf95a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949545/at-least-71-new-dengue-cases-confirmed-in-kp-experts-link-rise-to-climate-change' target='_blank'><strong>At least 71 new dengue cases confirmed in KP; experts link rise to climate change</strong></a><br><p>At least 71 new dengue cases were confirmed across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the last 24 hours, according to a situation report issued on Friday by the Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response System (IDSRS) at the Directorate-General Health Services (DGHS).
The report stated that 27 of the new patients were hospitalised, bringing the total number of currently hospitalised dengue cases in the province to 48. So far this year, KP has recorded a total of 3,582 laboratory-confirmed cases, 1,474 hospitalisations, 3,314 recoveries, and two deaths.
Provincial Medical Entomologist at the DGHS Dengue Control Programme, Salahuddin Khan Marwat, told Dawn.com, “Climate change is a key factor in the spread of the disease to new areas.”
Marwat said the current weather conditions, persistent humidity, monsoon rains, and temperatures between 18 to 25 degrees Celsius, have created an ideal environment for mosquito breeding.
“This is why we see a spike in cases in October. The mosquitoes breed rapidly in these conditions,” he said, adding that both very high and very low temperatures slow down their reproduction.
He explained that previously, dengue was confined to districts like Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Haripur, and Abbottabad. “But now, cases have been reported in Chitral. Global warming and increased travel contribute to this spread,” he said.
According to the entomologist, the provincial government has prepared for potential outbreaks by designating 1,500 to 1,600 beds for dengue patients across all districts. “Around 400,000 test kits have also been procured and distributed to district health offices based on need,” he said.
He cautioned, however, against the indiscriminate use of insecticide sprays. “Sprays can kill beneficial insects like honeybees, butterflies, and fireflies and also lead to resistance. Globally, environmental cleaning and prevention of mosquito breeding are prioritised over spraying,” he noted.
Marwat stressed the need for public cooperation to curb dengue spread. “There are about 200,000 houses in Peshawar. If each household spends 20 minutes cleaning water containers and surroundings, we can clean the entire city in a day,” Marwat said.
He added that awareness campaigns, school programmes, and the government’s Dengue Action Plan are already in motion, but community engagement remains the biggest challenge.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral infection transmitted primarily by the Aedes aegypti mosquito. Caused by the dengue virus, it leads to high fever, severe headache, joint and muscle pain, rash, and in severe cases, internal bleeding or organ failure, according to the World Health Organisation.
With no specific treatment available, prevention focuses on mosquito control and protection from bites. The disease spreads rapidly in tropical and subtropical regions, often overwhelming health systems during seasonal outbreaks.</p><small>2025-10-17 15:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/171932293a8186b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949557/kremlin-envoy-proposes-putin-trump-tunnel-to-link-russia-and-us' target='_blank'><strong>Kremlin envoy proposes ‘Putin-Trump tunnel’ to link Russia and US</strong></a><br><p>Russia and the United States should build a “Putin-Trump” rail tunnel under the Bering Strait to link their countries, unlock joint exploration of natural resources and “symbolise unity”, a Kremlin envoy has suggested.
The proposal by Kirill Dmitriev, President Vladimir Putin’s investment envoy and head of Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, envisages a construction project costing $8 billion, funded by Moscow and “international partners”, to build a 70-mile (112-km) rail and cargo link in under eight years.
Dmitriev, who has helped spearhead a Russian charm offensive designed to revive US-Russia ties, floated the idea late on Thursday after Putin spoke to US President Donald Trump by phone and agreed to meet in Budapest to seek a way to stop the war in Ukraine.
Musk’s ‘boring company’ proposed as contractor
“The dream of a US-Russia link via the Bering Strait reflects an enduring vision from the 1904 Siberia-Alaska railway to Russia’s 2007 plan. RDIF has studied existing proposals, including the US-Canada-Russia-China railroad, and will support the most viable,” Dmitriev wrote on X.
The Bering Strait, 51 miles (82 km) wide at its narrowest point, separates Russia’s vast and sparsely populated Chukotka region from Alaska. Ideas to link them have been around for at least 150 years. The small Diomede islands, one Russian and one belonging to the US, sit in the middle of the strait, only 2.4 miles (4 km) apart.
Dmitriev, who has struck up a relationship with Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, and suggested US energy majors could join Russian projects in the Arctic, proposed that the tunnel be built by The Boring Company, a US tunnel construction company owned by US billionaire and sometime Trump ally Elon Musk.
“Imagine connecting the US and Russia, the Americas and the Afro-Eurasia with the Putin-Trump Tunnel - a 70-mile link symbolising unity. Traditional costs are $65B+, but @boringcompany’s tech could reduce it to <$8B. Let’s build a future together,” Dmitriev wrote to Musk on X.
 






There was no immediate public response from Musk or Trump.
Beyond the tunnel itself, it would cost a huge sum to build and upgrade infrastructure on both sides of the strait. Chukotka’s existing roads and railways are sparse, at best.
Dmitriev said a plan for a “Kennedy-Khrushchev World Peace Bridge” over the strait had been floated during the Cold War. He posted a sketch from that era of the route it might have taken, with a graphic showing the route the new tunnel could take.

The slain civil rights leader’s estate and OpenAI announced the decision in a joint statement late Thursday, saying the company would pause generations depicting King while it “strengthens guardrails for historical figures.”
The move comes as families of deceased celebrities and leaders have expressed outrage over OpenAI’s Sora 2 video tool, which allows users to create realistic-looking clips of historical figures without family consent.
Some users had generated videos showing King making monkey noises during his “I Have a Dream” speech and other demeaning content, according to The Washington Post.
Videos reanimating other dead figures, including Malcolm X, Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and Amy Winehouse, have flooded social media since Sora 2’s launch on September 30.
“While there are strong free speech interests in depicting historical figures, OpenAI believes public figures and their families should ultimately have control over how their likeness is used,” the joint statement said.
The company said authorised representatives or estate owners can now request that their likenesses not be used in the AI-generated videos, known as “Sora cameos.”
OpenAI thanked Bernice King, King’s daughter, who serves on behalf of the estate, “for reaching out” as well as businessman John Hope Bryant and the AI Ethics Council “for creating space for conversations like this.”
The text-to-video tool has rocketed to the top of download charts since its launch, but sparked immediate controversy.
Actor Robin Williams’s daughter Zelda Williams pleaded with people on Instagram to “stop sending me AI videos of dad,” calling the content “maddening.”
Ilyasah Shabazz, daughter of Malcolm X, told The Washington Post it was “deeply disrespectful” to see her father’s image used in crude and insensitive AI videos.
Malcolm X was assassinated in front of Shabazz in 1965 when she was two years old.
OpenAI had initially exempted “historical figures” from consent requirements when it launched Sora 2 last month, allowing anyone to create fake videos resurrecting public figures.
Sora 2 has already raised opposition from Hollywood, with the creative industry furious at OpenAI’s opt-out policy when it came to the use of its copyrighted characters and content in generated videos.
Disney sent a sharply worded letter to OpenAI in late September stating it “is not required to ‘opt out’ of inclusion of its works” to preserve its copyright rights.
Amid the pushback, OpenAI promised that it would give more “granular control” to rights holders.
After the launch of the Sora 2 app, the tool usually refused requests for videos featuring Disney or Marvel characters, some users said.
However, clips showing characters from other US franchises, as well as Japanese characters from popular games and anime series, were widely shared.</p><small>2025-10-17 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1722372941c76a4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949549/pakistan-still-looking-forward-to-semi-final-chance-says-omaima-ahead-of-new-zealand-world-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan still looking forward to semi-final chance, says Omaima ahead of New Zealand World Cup clash</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan opener Omaima Sohail said on Friday that the team was still looking forward to a chance to make the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s World Cup , ahead of their clash with New Zealand on Saturday.
On Wednesday, Pakistan’s hopes of a first victory at the World Cup were hit by rain, with their crucial fixture against England being abandoned after a second downpour in Colombo.
Chasing a revised target of 113 to win after earlier rains had reduced the match to 31 overs per side, Pakistan were well on their way at 34-0 in 6.4 overs when rains returned to end any chance of the match being completed — saving England from their first ever loss against the Green Shirts.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference at the R. Pramedasa Stadium in Colombo, Omaima said: “We are not relaxed at all. We have a chance to go [to the] semis if we win the matches, like three matches.
“So maybe the scenario is open, so maybe we will win the three matches, so we have a chance in the semis.”
 
 

Omaima showed glimpses of form in the England encounter, hitting a couple of sublime drives through the covers on her way to an unbeaten run-a-ball 18.
She, along with fellow opener Muneeba Ali, will be pivotal to providing stability at the top for a batting line-up that has failed to cross the 200-run mark in the tournament so far.
“I think the main challenge is to open — play the new ball. If you saw the matches, they are seaming and the pitch is [helping] seam. I’m trying to play the new ball and working on it,” the right-handed batter said of the challenges of opening.
Pakistan’s bowling, however, has been the real positive for the Green Shirts so far — having strong sides like England and Australia 78-7 and 76-7 in back-to-back matches.
New Zealand head coach Ben Sawyer was also wary about the danger posed by the Pakistani bowling at the presser.
“From Pakistan, Yeah. Look, they’ve put some teams in some real tough spots, so I think they had Australia 6 for 60. And then obviously the other night England was 7 for 70. So, their bowling attack is one that we’ve got to be really wary of.
Sawyer also spoke about the improvements seen in the Pakistani top-order in the previous outing against England, saying: “Their top order is, they made a little bit — look like light work of maybe chasing down that total the other night. So, they’ve been impressive.”
The Kiwis also go into the encounter with a washout of their own against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. The match got called off after Sri Lanka scored a daunting 258-6 batting first.
Last week‘s defeat against Australia had left the Green Shirts’ knockout hopes hanging by a thread as Pakistan registered three losses on the trot.
Pakistan will be hoping to register their first win and get on the board on Saturday, and then hope the permutations and other teams’ results go in their favour to make it into the semis somehow — a quintessentially Pakistani World Cup experience.</p><small>2025-10-17 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17174732e866a0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949548/more-than-14m-afghans-repatriated-no-further-extension-by-govt' target='_blank'><strong>More than 1.4m Afghans repatriated, no further extension by govt</strong></a><br><p>A high-level meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, was informed on Friday that as of October 16, a total of 1,477,592 Afghan nationals have been repatriated and the government will grant no further extension.
A drive to expel more than 1.3 million Afghan nationals with Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders, the last category of refugees legally living in the country without visas, has been underway since Sept 1 this year.
According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the meeting’s attendees were told that only those Afghans who possess a valid Pakistani visa would be allowed to stay in Pakistan and the number of exit points on the Afghan side are being increased to make the repatriation process smoother and faster.
“Officials informed the meeting that harboring Afghan nationals residing illegally in Pakistan or allowing them to stay in guesthouses is a criminal offense, and efforts are underway to identify such individuals. The public will be involved in the repatriation process, and no one will be allowed to violate government policy by providing shelter to Afghan nationals,” stated the statement from the PMO.
PM Shehbaz emphasised that during the repatriation of illegal Afghan refugees, elderly persons, women, children, and minorities must be treated with dignity.
The meeting was attended by Chief of the Staff Army Field Marshall Asim Munir, chief ministers of all provinces except KP, premier of Azad Kashmir, federal ministers and other officials.
Referring to Afghanistan, the prime minister said that senior Pakistani officials, including the deputy prime minister, had visited Kabul multiple times to hold discussions with the Afghan interim government, urging them to prevent Afghan soil from being used for terrorism against Pakistan.
“Pakistan has made serious diplomatic and political efforts to stop the infiltration of militants from Afghanistan,” said the prime minister during the meeting.
“The brave people of Pakistan, who have lost loved ones in the war against terrorism, now ask: how long will the government continue to bear the burden of Afghan refugees?”
The prime minister maintained that the recent attack on the border areas of Pakistan from Afghanistan and support for terrorist infiltration is a “matter of serious concern”.
“The brave armed forces of Pakistan gave a strong and decisive response to this attack. Under the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir, the Pakistan Armed Forces repelled the Afghan attacks. The entire nation joins me in paying tribute to them,“ added Shehbaz.
Concluding the meeting, the premier urged all provinces to extend full cooperation regarding the repatriation of Afghan refugees. The forum also decided that all recommendations presented would be “strictly implemented”.
The UN’s refugee agency had reported that more than 3.5 million Afghans had been living in Pakistan, including around 700,000 people who came after the Taliban takeover in 2021. The UN estimated that half of them were undocumented.
Though Pakistan had taken care of Afghans during the past decades of war, the government is now compelled to say that the high number of refugees is eventually posing risks to national security and causing pressure on public services.</p><small>2025-10-17 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17173342102ddbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949546/56-magnitude-quake-jostles-kp-twin-cities-and-other-regions-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.6-magnitude quake jostles KP, twin cities and other regions: PMD</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and other northern areas were jolted by tremors on Friday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
The PMD’s data showed that the quake was registered with a magnitude of 5.6 at a depth of 120 kilometres at 5:15pm. Tremors were felt in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Peshawar, Swat and Chitral.
The PMD stated that the quake’s epicentre was in the Hindu Kush mountains in Afghanistan. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) registered a 4.7 magnitude quake less than 30km from the western Pak-Afghan border, at a depth of 10km at 4:53pm.
However, USGS also registered a 5.5 magnitude earthquake less than 10km Pakistan’s northern border with Afghanistan. This one was registered at 5:15pm at a depth of 10km.

Last week, a magnitude 5 earthquake struck close to Punjab’s Layyah on Saturday night, according to the PMD. The department said the quake occurred 50km east of Layyah at 7:54pm at a depth of 20km.

Birmingham-based Villa said the club had been informed by the Safety Advisory Group (SAG), responsible for issuing certificates for matches, that no away fans would be permitted at the Europa League match on November 6.
“Shameful decision! I call on the UK authorities to reverse this coward decision,” the foreign minister of Israel, Gideon Saar, posted on X.
 






A UK police commissioner asked local officials to review the decision as criticism of the ban mounted, including from Starmer and European governing body UEFA.
Starmer, a keen football fan, called the move “wrong”.
“We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets. The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation,” Starmer wrote on X.
 






A spokesman for the prime minister said on Friday that conversations were “happening at pace across government and with all the relevant groups to find a way to resolve this”.
Britain’s Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy, whose brief includes sport, was set to meet interior ministry officials and other stakeholders.
UEFA, which runs the Europa League, called on the clubs and authorities to
“agree on the implementation of appropriate measures necessary to allow” Maccabi fans to be able to attend.
Simon Foster, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands area, which covers Villa Park, called on SAG and the police to “conduct an immediate review” to determine whether the ban is “appropriate” and
“necessary”.
But a number of left-wing independent and Green politicians in Britain backed the ban, with some calling for the wider exclusion of Israeli teams from international competitions over the war in Gaza, similar to the sporting boycott of apartheid South Africa.
Public safety concerns
Villa issued a statement on Thursday saying West Midlands Police had advised the SAG they had “public safety concerns outside the stadium bowl and the ability to deal with any potential protests on the night”.
Police said they had classified the fixture as “high risk” following a “thorough assessment”.
“This decision is based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offences that occurred during the 2024 UEFA Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam,” a spokesperson for the West Midlands force said.
Last November’s match between Dutch side Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv resulted in two days of violent clashes between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli fans.
Supporters of the Israeli team were assaulted in Amsterdam in hit-and-run attacks.
The attacks were the culmination of skirmishes in which Maccabi fans chanted anti-Arab songs, vandalised a taxi and pulled down a Palestinian flag.
Emily Damari, a British-Israeli who was captured during Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 and held captive for more than a year, said the ban would prevent her from going to watch Maccabi, the team she supports.
“Football is a way of bringing people together irrespective of their faith, colour or religion, and this disgusting decision does the exact opposite,” she said in a statement.
Maccabi fan Tamir Nahson, 37, a wine importer in Israel, told AFP it was a “missed opportunity”.
“It’s very painful that the (country) has become the UK for anti-Semitism.
It’s very painful, it’s very unpleasant for us and I guess it’s also disappointing for Aston Villa fans.”
Maccabi Tel Aviv chief executive Jack Angelides told BBC radio the team had travelled to other countries where he said the sentiment is “not so kind towards Israeli teams” but the police “were out in force” and there were no incidents.
Villa are third in the Europa League standings while Maccabi Tel Aviv are 30th after two rounds.
Global soccer body FIFA has faced repeated calls to act over the war in Gaza, with Palestinian officials pressing for Israel to be suspended from international football.
The issue has been under review by FIFA for months, but no decision has yet been taken, with FIFA president Gianni Infantino consistently saying such matters require consensus with the confederations and must be handled with caution.
Earlier this month, FIFA vice president Victor Montagliani said Israel’s continued participation in international football has to be dealt with first and foremost by UEFA.
UEFA appeared poised for an emergency vote on suspending Israel from European competition last month but reportedly held off on a proposed vote following the announcement of US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the war in the region.</p><small>2025-10-17 12:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1714344259d28b6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949500/summary-for-banning-tlp-forwarded-to-centre-says-punjab-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Summary for banning TLP forwarded to Centre, says Punjab minister</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said on Friday that the provincial government had forwarded the summary for banning the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) to the Centre.
“The Punjab cabinet has given its approval for banning the TLP, and this has been forwarded to the Centre. So the legal requirement with regard to the provinces has been fulfilled. The provincial government, after giving its approval, has forwarded the summary to the Centre,” she said at a press conference in Lahore.
Her statement comes a day after the Punjab government decided to ask the Centre to ban the TLP, which had conducted a protest march “in solidarity with Gaza”, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy.
However, on Monday, the authorities launched a pre-dawn operation in Muridke, where the TLP had set up its protest camp on its way to its planned destination. The move by law enforcement agencies had triggered violent clashes, chaos dozens of arrests, resulting in the protest’s premature end.
There have been reports of authorities going down hard on the TLP since.
At the outset of her press conference today, Bokhari, without naming the TLP, also referred to “a protest called in the name of Gaza”, noting that the demonstration was “illogically” held even after a truce to end the Israeli onslaught in the strip went into effect.
She added that the protest had turned “bloody as always”.
“This is not the first time that this party — or I would rather call it a group — has resorted to such acts. Be it 2017, 2019, 2021 or 2022, there have been repeated attempts to paralyse the lives of people and shut the country down,” Bokhari added, apparently referring to the TLP’s previous protests that had turned violent.
“We saw a continuity of those instances this time as well,” the minister added. “The only difference this time was that the state and government together decided that this could not continue anymore. Pakistan cannot afford this anymore.”
The minister emphasised that everybody needed to think about how attempts were made to create chaos in the name of religion.
She further asserted that when the protesters had taken to the streets recently, multiple attempts were made to “engage them”, rejecting the accusations that the relevant authorities had not tried to resolve the issue through dialogue.
“They were engaged repeatedly, and requests were made to them. They were told that people are celebrating in Gaza,” she said, accusing the protesters of setting vehicles on fire and inflicting violence on policemen. “Were they (police personnel and vehicles) a hurdle in the way of resolving the issue of Gaza?” Bokhari raised the question.
Referring to a protest call for today after Friday prayers, she thanked the trader community, transporters and the public for “rejecting the call”.
Earlier this week, a statement by TLP Balochistan president Wazir Ahmad Rizvi had called on protesters to converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar today. Meanwhile, intelligence reports suggested that TLP activists may engage in violent clashes and widespread chaos after Friday prayer.
Separately, a group named Tanzeemat-i-Ahle Sunnat — which is not linked to the TLP — had also given a protest call for today, demanding a judicial inquiry into the Muridke operation.
Meanwhile, a Dawn report said police had planned a crackdown to round up the TLP leadership to scuttle its plans for protests today.
Speaking of the protest call for today, Bokhari had two videos played during the press conference, which she said were from Lahore and Rawalpindi today. In those videos, she said, life could be seen continuing as usual.
“So now, everybody should understand once and for all that they cannot be allowed to paralyse or shut the country down on the pretext of any excuse.”
Bokhari then shared that 1,648 policemen had been injured during last week’s protest, of whom she said 202 personnel were severely injured. “Was it a peaceful protest then?” she questioned.
Before outlining a set of decisions taken by the Punjab government following the protest, she clarified that these measures were not against any “religious party, group or faith”.
“They are against only that extremist group, which has a history of creating a law and order situation in this country. The group that has been involved in inciting people […] and killings.”
Detailing the decisions, she said the Punjab government had forwarded the summary to the federal government for banning the TLP.
It may be mentioned here that the federal government had banned the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government under the ATA.
The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march towards Islamabad.
In a meeting chaired by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab government also decided to seek a ban on the party again and move to place the TLP leadership in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
The Fourth Schedule is a list of proscribed individuals who are suspected of terrorism and/or sectarianism under the 1997 Anti-Terrorism Act.
Mentioning other measures taken yesterday, Bokhari said there would be “zero-tolerance” concerning the use of loudspeakers to “spread hatred or incite others”.
Bokhari further said that cases would be registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) for “uploading hateful content on social media, glorifying the protest and presenting it as a national cause”.
“Some arrests have been made [in this connection],” she said, adding that the “information department will also send a request for action under Peca over a post on [incarcerated PTI founder] Imran Khan’s X account that said 400-600 people had died”.
Again making an apparent reference to the TLP, she said, “All social media and bank accounts of the extremist party will be sealed. A lot of work on this has already been done”.
Moreover, she said, there was a complete ban on the display of weapons and from now on, weapons’ licences would not be issued in Punjab.
“Anyone in possession of illegal weapons is requested to submit them [to the relevant authorities] within a month; otherwise, cases would be registered against them under the terrorism law.
“And those in possession of legal weapons will have to get them registered at Khidmat centres, otherwise legal action will also be taken against them,” she elaborated.
Citing figures of cases of attempts to create anarchy, she said 108 such first information reports had been registered in Punjab in 2025 so far. Of those, she added, 71 were registered under the terrorism law.
“This trend shows that in 2025, a plan was hatched to worsen the situation in Punjab,” she alleged. Apparently referring to the PTI, she said that another party had tried to join today’s protest, the call for which was rejected by the people. “This is a slap for the two extremist groups that called the protest,” she said.
Separately, Pakistan Ulema Council chairman Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi also addressed a press conference where he apparently made a reference to the TLP and its protest last week.
Without naming anyone, he said, “The dialogue was underway till the last moment. The talks were very positive […] but unfortunately, there was no implementation, resulting in the loss of policemen, Rangers personnel, security institutions and the common man.”
He stressed the need to put an end to the trend of violence and thanked all religious scholars who had contributed to attempts of “making peace”.
Punjab IG’s warning
Earlier today, Punjab Inspector General (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar had also warned that no individual or group would be allowed to take the law into their hands.
A post on Punjab police’s account on social media platform X quoted IGP Anwar as saying that his department was actively ensuring the safety of people’s lives and properties, supremacy of law and maintenance of peace across the province.
“Punjab police is standing with civil society and the trader community, who have rejected the call for the protest and strike and expressed their resolve for [maintaining] peace and stability,” the statement quoted the police chief as saying.
It said he “strongly condemned violent protests, arson and illegal activities”, warning that no individual or group would be allowed to take the law into their hands. He also warned that “indiscriminate” action would be taken against those violating the law.
The IGP also assured the full implementation of Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure — a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period — to ensure the safety of private and public properties.
The Punjab government had imposed Section 144 across the province yesterday for two days.
 






A subsequent post by the police said security was on high alert across the province on the directive of the IGP.
“Punjab police has further tightened foolproof security arrangements in the province, including Lahore. On the directive of Punjab IGP, instructions have been issued to all field officers to remain on high alert and take immediate measures to ensure the protection of the lives and property of the public,” the statement said.
It added that district police officers, special branch personnel and the counter-terrorism department had been directed “to keep a close eye on suspicious activities”.
 






In another statement posted around noon, police said that the situation was normal in cities across Punjab.
 






In an earlier post specifically mentioning Multan and Bhakkar, a statement quoted IGP Anwar as saying that “under no circumstances will anybody be allowed to take the law into their hands under the guise of protests or strikes”.
 






The IGP had issued similar warnings yesterday as well, saying, “We have decided to treat the violators under anti-terrorism and other heinous charges to take them to the court of law for punishment up to 10 and 14 years.”
Later, a police handout said Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran had reviewed security arrangements in different areas of the city while all divisional superintendents, sub-divisional police officers and station house officers were in the field.
The handout quoted the DIG as saying that security had been increased at all commercial and public spots in the city and that police would not let miscreants “destroy the peace of the city at any cost”.
He said “special security duties” had been assigned to police personnel to ensure peace in the city, while anybody who took the law into their hands would be dealt with strictly.
The handout said he instructed that strict legal action should be taken against those creating a law and order situation under the guise of protests.
On Thursday, four cabinet members also said that the crackdown on TLP office-bearers would continue. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Fed­e­r­­al Information Minister Ataullah Tarar, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf and Min­is­ter of State for Interior Talal Chaud­h­ry described the TLP as a group of anarchists and arsonists that had no political agenda except to challenge the authority of the state.
“The TLP leadership has been deceiving the nation from the very beginning. We were holding talks with them even before the protest march commenced, but they never stood firm on any commitment,“ Naqvi said.
LHC seeks replies from Punjab govt, police
Earlier today, the Lahore High Court (LHC) sought replies from the Punjab government and police on October 23 on pleas filed by the TLP. The pleas seek return of bodies of the TLP’s workers allegedly killed during the law-enforcement operation in Muridke and medical treatment for those injured.
Justice Shehram Sarwar Chaudhry presided over the hearing during which Advocate Naseem Usman represented the TLP.
The petitions, which were accepted for hearing yesterday, contend that the government carried out an operation against the party’s workers who were staging a peaceful march in Muridke. The party claimed that over 600 of its workers had been killed in the operation, while its chief Saad Rizvi and his younger brother also sustained bullet injuries.
It alleged that both Saad and his brother Anas Rizvi, among others, have been abducted by the law-enforcement agencies.
The party further alleges that the authorities refused to hand over the bodies of the victims to their families. It has asked the court to direct the government and police authorities to return the deceased workers’ bodies and ensure that the injured are provided medical treatment at government hospitals.
The pleas also seek directions for the authorities to produce Saad Rizvi and other detained leaders before the relevant court. The TLP further seeks possession of its headquarters on Lahore’s Multan Road, allegedly taken over by the law-enforcement authorities.

On Thursday, Afridi, who was elected as the provincial chief minister on Monday, was denied a meeting with Imran during a visit to the prison. The PTI founder, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests.
Afridi said he waited outside the prison for around two hours yesterday bef­ore departing. Speaking to reporters, he said he would announce his cabinet after consulting Imran and seeking his input. He claimed he had officially notified the Punjab government and the federal government of his plan to visit Adiala, but received no response, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not reply to his subsequent request, made during a phone call, to facilitate a meeting with Imran.
Per Afridi’s writ petition seen by Dawn.com, as a chief minister, he was  constitutionally responsible for governance of the province, and was “under both legal and moral obligation” to consult Imran for “guidance and instructions of urgent and sensitive provincial matters” concerning the governance and formation of the provincial cabinet.
The petition was filed against the federal secretary of the Interior Ministry, the secretary of the Punjab Home Department, the inspector general of Punjab prisons, and the superintendent of Central Prison Adiala, Rawalpindi.
Filed through counsel Syed Ali Bukhari, the petition stated that Afridi had approached the Interior Ministry and Punjab Home Department on October 15, 2025, seeking a meeting with Imran through an official letter that was “duly received” by both offices.
Aside from approaching the IHC, CM Afridi also wrote a letter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, requesting the arrangement of a meeting with Imran.
According to the letter, seen by Dawn.com, it was “necessary in the public interest that a periodical meeting” of the KP CM be permitted under the supervision of the competent authorities at Central Prison Adiala, Rawalpindi.
Per the letter, Afridi has been elected CM of KP on the ticket of PTI, a province with a population of 45 million, for the governance and securing/safeguarding the fundamental rights and matters relating to law and order situation, formation of provincial cabinet, critical economic challenges being faced by the province’s people and important policy matters.
“There is a pressing need to seek direction from [Imran] regarding [these] matters and others, including relations regarding certain important matters with the federation and other provinces,” said the letter.
“The seeking of direction is extremely essential, even presently the province of Punjab has stopped the inter-provincial trade, i.e., of wheat, etc,” the letter said.
Separately, in a post on X, Afridi apologised for not attending the meeting regarding agriculture and Afghan refugees with the federal government today, saying that he was unable to do so without consulting Imran first.
“Until I meet [Imran Khan] and receive policy guidelines, participating in such a meeting would be an insult to the mandate of the province’s people,” he said.
 






“I hope that the federal government will resolve this issue as soon as possible and issue directions to the relevant authorities so that arrangements can be made for my regular meetings with my leader and the representative of the mandate of the people of KP.”
Pre-election controversy
Afridi was elected the new KP chief executive on Monday during an assembly session marred by the opposition’s walkout and amid the prevailing uncertainty regarding the resignation of outgoing CM Ali Amin Gandapur.
Declaring Afridi’s election constitutional, Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah had orderered KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Tuesday to administer the oath by 4pm the next day or else the provincial assembly speaker would perform the ceremony the same day under Article 255(2) of the Constitution.</p><small>2025-10-17 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629074-pakistan-afghanistan-engaged-in-constructive-dialogue-for-peaceful-resolution-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan engaged in constructive dialogue for peaceful resolution: FO</strong></a><br><p>

The case of Rano, a female Himalayan brown bear who stirred public outcry over her ailing health in the zoo, has brought into sharp focus the neglect of animals kept in captivity in Karachi. Rano’s relocation was finally ordered on Tuesday by the SHC after a petition was submitted to recognise her deteriorating condition.
During the continuation of the hearing of the case today, the SHC called for a further report on all animals kept in captivity at the zoo.
The report is to include details on animals’ “physical and psychological health, living conditions, qualifications and training of zoo staff”, as well as alternative plans for animals if they are shifted from the zoo, according to lawyer Jibran Nasir, who was representing Rano’s case on behalf of the petitioner Jude Allen Pereira.
According to Nasir, details of the staff and their qualifications have been summoned from the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), while the report on the zoo has been summoned from a committee already notified by the Sindh government to ensure Rano’s transfer, with the addition of some more members by the court.
The Sindh government has also been directed to visit the zoo and review the facilities provided to animals.
 
 

Nasir termed the decision a “massive achievement”, saying it was made possible by the combined efforts of animal rights activists, experts, and the media that raised awareness of the issue.
“We are deeply indebted to the empathy, understanding and judicial will of the honourable bench to make a difference in not just the lives of these animals, but for the education and sensitisation of the society at large with regards to animals and their rights,” he told Dawn.com.
Relocation of brown bear
Regarding Rano’s relocation, KMC advocate Barrister Asad Ahmed said, “The progress report states that first Rano will be transferred to Islamabad, and then to Gilgit.”
He added that training would be given in preparation for the relocation.
Nasir also said that the proposal of Wildlife Conservative Javed Mehar could be implemented.
Mehar suggested that Rano could be transported to Islamabad via road as well as by airplane.
“We have all the arrangements made in this regard and have transported animals before,” he told the court, adding that training was administered prior to the transfer of animals.
Justice calls for abolition of zoos
Justice Iqbal Kalhoro, who heard the case, pointed out in today’s hearing that Rano’s case was not a solitary one.
“It is not a problem of any one animal, but many animals are being affected by it,” he said.
Kalhoro slammed the current treatment of the animals by zoos, saying, “Zoos should be abolished and animals should be in natural habitats.”
He noted that it seemed “very difficult” to maintain the zoos here.
Advocate Nasir pointed out to the court that the zoos built in the city fell under the KMC, while bringing to the court’s attention the state of facilities.
“We do not even have administration people here to tell us whether people can give food to the animals or not,” he said.
He also pointed out that the Karachi Zoo only employed one veterinarian, to which the KMC advocate responded that no new appointments had been made due to a ban on them.
Justice Kalhoro noted, “I also saw zoos in my childhood — they were kept in a very bad condition; many animals were injured.
“You people earn money from the zoo but do not spend it on animals.”
He lamented that Pakistan had “no concept of a national park” as an alternative to zoos.
“The zoos outside (the country) are not in such condition; there are no cages there,” he said. “We want to abolish these cages.”
Nasir noted that one of the oldest zoos in Islamabad had also previously been closed.
Kalhoro told the bench, “You file a petition about whether there should be a zoo or not — then we will look into the law on it.”
The SHC adjourned the hearing for two weeks, seeking a progress report for the next hearing.
The neglect of Rano
Rano was reportedly brought to the Karachi Zoo in 2017, along with an Asiatic black bear who died in 2020.
Forced to live in solitary confinement in a barren cell, her “unusual behaviour” was remarked on in February in a report by a committee investigating her condition, which suggested she was “under stress”. The committee recommended her relocation to a sanctuary in Punjab, as well as a DNA test to determine her species.
Animal rights activists say that Rano is a Himalayan brown bear — a critically endangered species — and not a Syrian species as claimed by zoo officials.
While the committee expressed satisfaction over the bear’s diet, physical health, and found no wounds/injuries on her body, it noticed “heavy noise” during the visit. The report stated that the noise seemed to be “beyond the permissible decibels”.
Although the KMC had directed the committee to issue the report, it later emerged that it was not implementing its recommendations, as Rano continued to languish in Karachi Zoo.
Earlier this month, it emerged that the bear had suffered a head injury, and the wound was infested with maggots due to a lack of care.
When contacted, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation spokesperson Daniyal Sial admitted that the bear was under treatment, adding that the injury had been self-administered by Rano, hitting her head on the bars of her cage.
A case was finally heard on Rano’s condition this month after animal rights activist Pereira petitioned the SHC for recognition of animal cruelty towards the bear.
During the hearing of the case on Tuesday, Justice Kalhoro expressed his anger at the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), saying, “How could the bear be kept in such conditions?“
He ordered the handover of the bear to the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board, a move termed a “big win for Rano” by Pereira.</p><small>2025-10-17 10:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/17140728d982f42.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949525/naval-chief-reaffirms-pakistans-commitment-to-maritime-cooperation-with-us' target='_blank'><strong>Naval chief reaffirms Pakistan’s commitment to maritime cooperation with US</strong></a><br><p>The Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment towards cooperation with the United States over matters of maritime security during a visit to the country, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
The Pakistani and US Navy share a long-standing relationship. In September, the US Navy ship USS Wayne E. Meyer departed from Karachi on a two-day port call, strengthening the enduring maritime cooperation between the Pakistan Navy and the US Navy.
According to the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement,  “Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, visited [the] United States of America as part of ongoing efforts to further strengthen bilateral maritime cooperation and defence engagements.”
Over the course of the visit — which concluded last Friday — Admiral Ashraf met with the US Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, Vice Admiral Yvette Davids, and Acting Vice Commandant of the US Coast Guard, Vice Admiral Thomas G. Allan Jr.
“Matters of professional interest, regional security dynamics, and avenues for professional training and maritime cooperation were discussed during these meetings,” the statement said.
In a visit to the National Defence University (NDU) at Fort Lesley J. McNair, the naval chief met with the university’s president, Vice Admiral Peter A. Garvin.
The meeting “encompassed deliberations on politico-military cooperation, maritime security, capacity-building initiatives, and shared maritime interests,” ISPR said.
Admiral Ashraf also met the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs, Stanley L. Brown, the statement added.
The naval chief addressed a gathering of US scholars and think-tank experts, the statement said, highlighting “regional maritime security challenges and Pakistan Navy’s contributions towards collaborative maritime efforts.”
As per ISPR, the visit “reflects the enduring defence ties between Pakistan and the United States, reaffirming the mutual commitment to promoting maritime security in the region and beyond.”
The development comes amid improving ties between Pakistan and the US.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with US President Donald Trump, along with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. In June, the COAS became the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president after his lunch with Trump.</p><small>2025-10-17 09:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629051-section-144-imposed-punjab-police-on-high-alert-amid-fresh-protest-call-by-tlp' target='_blank'><strong>TLP ban summary sent to Centre as Punjab on high alert amid fresh protest call today</strong></a><br><p>

“According to sources, a khawarij attempted to carry out a suicide attack against security forces in Mir Ali. One kharji rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the wall of the security forces’ camp after which three more khawarij tried to enter the camp,” the report said.
 






“As a result of security forces’ timely and courageous action, the three khawarij were killed outside the camp. Security forces did not suffer any losses in the incident. In the last two days alone, 88 terrorists supported by the Afghan Taliban have been killed,” the report said.
Khawarij is a term that the state uses to refer to terrorists.
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to security forces for foiling the attack and praised their professionalism.
“Salute to the brave soldiers who thwarted the evil intentions of Khawarij,” Naqvi said, according to a statement issued by the ministry.
“Security forces took timely action and brought the khawarij to an exemplary end,” he said, adding that the nation was “proud of the brave soldiers”.
The development comes a day after the ISPR’s said that 34 “India-backed” terrorists had been killed in multiple operations in KP’s North Waziristan, South Waziristan, and Bannu districts over the previous three days.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Last week, a lieutenant colonel and a major were among 11 military personnel martyred during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Orakzai, in which 19 terrorists were reported killed. The same week, the ISPR reported that 30 terrorists who were involved in the incident had been killed in a “retribution operation”.
A day after the Orakzai operation, another officer was martyred in an operation in Dera Ismail Khan, in which seven terrorists were also killed, according to the ISPR.
In July, the government designated the TTP as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks, even before the most recent deadly border clashes between the two countries this past week. However, Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations.
Pakistan has also accused India of sponsoring cross-border terrorism. In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan — a phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy.
The development also comes tensions have flared between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the past few days after the two countries engaged in border clashes over the weekend. Tensions escalated to the point where both sides agreed to a temporary ceasefire 48-hour ceasefire after Islamabad carried out strikes in Kabul and Kandahar.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made it clear that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.</p><small>2025-10-17 07:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629032-abducted-son-of-ziarat-ac-muhammad-afzal-recovered-in-harnai-police' target='_blank'><strong>Abducted son of Ziarat AC Muhammad Afzal recovered: police</strong></a><br><p>
