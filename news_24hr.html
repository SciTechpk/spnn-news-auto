<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1916552305940c7.jpg?r=165806' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925221/byc-protesters-in-islamabad-fear-police-crackdown-on-sit-in' target='_blank'><strong>BYC protesters in Islamabad fear police crackdown on sit-in</strong></a><br><p>The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) on Saturday continued its ongoing sit-in on the road leading to the National Press Club in Islamabad, as the route had been blocked by police with barbed wire, preventing its activists from returning to their original protest site.
An anti-terrorism court in Quetta on Friday remanded BYC chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group into police custody for 15 days, in the case of her and other BYC members “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence” in March.
The Islamabad sit-in began on June 16, with BYC leaders and members demanding the release of its activists. Political leaders, journalists and activists have joined the sit-in over the past few days.
A Dawn.com correspondent at the scene reported that the demonstrators were not allowed to set up their protest camp outside the press club, so they would leave in the evenings and return to demonstrate in the afternoon. When they arrived today, they found the route to the press club blocked.
“We started our camp in the morning and finished in the evening as the authorities did not allow us to erect tents,” a woman protester told Dawn.com. “When we came back today, they didn’t allow us to proceed and we were told that we didn’t have an NOC (no-objection certificate).”
She continued that “everyone had the right to protest except for the Baloch”.
“We have been sitting on the main road peacefully for the fourth day, but the police have called in buses to take us away and increased their numbers,” she added.
When asked about the possibility of a crackdown, the protester said, “They’re prepared to drag us into buses and take us back to Balochistan.”
According to the BYC, elderly people, women and children are among the protesters today and facing extreme heat.
“Whether under pouring rain or in scorching heat, they have continued their peaceful demonstration on the bare footpaths, without tents or shade,” the group wrote on X.
 






Lawyer Nadia Baloch, Mahrang’s sister, expressed fears of a crackdown by police in a post on X.
“Riot police have surrounded the National Press Club in Islamabad and its surrounding areas with barbed wire,” she wrote.
“We are peaceful protesters, including older women and young children, who have travelled thousands of kilometres from Balochistan to this city of power and authority, only to now face the threat of arrest, violence, and intimidation.”
 






Former PPP senator Farhatullah Babar told Dawn.com that there are “hardly 20 women” at the demonstration and that protesting is their fundamental right.
He highlighted two main issues in Balochistan, which are causing discontent among the people and contributing to protests like this one.
“There are two fundamental issues in Balochistan: number one, people want their representative assembly and government,” Babar explained.
“People in Balochistan feel that neither the assembly nor the government are their genuine representative. When you don’t have trust in your government … there is resentment.”
Babar highlighted that the second issue is enforced disappearances, stating, “My suggestion to the state would be to come out of the mode of denial, admit that there is an issue of enforced disappearances and sit together.”
Babar emphasised that all stakeholders should sit together and find a solution.
“A solution can be found — there have been recommendations made by parliament and there are observations made by the courts. “Let us all sit together and find a way.”
Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmed, who is present at the protest, told Dawn.com that 25-30 people are protesting.
“They are demonstrating for their right to live and right to fair trial under Article 10A of the Constitution,” Ahmed said. “The roads have been closed and there is a heavy police deployment. There’s an atmosphere of fear here.”
The former senator said that he condemned this because the demonstrators have not blocked roads themselves. “This will not resolve the issue and the people behind this are playing with fire.”
Former senator Afrasiab Khattak condemned the police’s blocking the route to the press club in a post on X.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) issued a statement on X expressing concern about the treatment of Baloch activists who have travelled from Balochistan to the federal capital.
“HRCP stands by their right to peaceful assembly and protest and demands that the authorities differentiate between advocacy for legitimate rights and militancy,” the statement read. “Women and children from Balochistan deserve as much dignity and respect as people from other parts of the country.”

At least seven people were in critical condition and six others were seriously injured, the fire department said in an online statement.
Reuters was not immediately able to contact the city’s police department.
The incident occurred just before 2am local time (2pm PKT), the fire department said.
Captain Adam VanGerpen, a fire department spokesman, was quoted by ABC News as saying that a paramedic assessing one of the injured found a gunshot wound. He said he was unable to confirm reports that it was the driver of the car that hit the crowd.
 


The car, he said, apparently first careened into a taco truck outside the venue and then ploughed through a valet stand and into a large group of people.
Videos posted on X showed roads being sealed off and patients being taken away in ambulances.
Authorities gave no immediate details on the cause of the incident or the identity of the driver.</p><small>2025-07-19 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/191905587e69e4a.jpg?r=192150' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925231/undefeated-pakistan-beat-iran-to-win-asian-mens-u-16-volleyball-championship' target='_blank'><strong>Undefeated Pakistan beat Iran to win Asian Men’s U-16 Volleyball Championship</strong></a><br><p>An undefeated Pakistan team on Saturday beat Iran 3-2 in the Asian Men’s U-16 Volleyball Championship final to win the tournament that was being held in Nakhon Phanom, Thailand.
After being 0-2 down earlier in the match, Pakistan made an incredible comeback by winning three straight sets to win the final 3-2.
The scores across the five sets were 22-25, 21-25, 30-28, 25-21, 15-10.
Junaid was the top scorer for Pakistan with 28 points joined by Faizan in second place with 22 points.
 






Talha and Muhammad Irfan chipped in with nine and eight points each.
Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi hailed the victory and commended the team on their win.
“Proud moment for us all as U-16 volleyball team has won the Asian Championship, defeating defending champions Iran in the final. A moment of pride and inspiration for the entire nation. Well done, champs!”, the interior minister said in a post on X.
 






On Friday, Pakistan beat India 3-0 in the semi-final of the tournament to qualify for the final.
The Green Shirts beat India with a clean sweep by winning three straight sets (25-16, 25-19, 25-12).
“Stellar performances from Junaid, Faizan, Irfan, and Talha powered the Green Shirts into the Final and one step closer to glory,” the Pakistan Volleyball Association had said.
The victory also confirmed Pakistan’s qualification for the World U-17 Volleyball Championship, which was secured upon their entry into the semi-finals of the ongoing tournament.
“Pakistan’s superior blocking and fast counter-attacks left the Indian team struggling to gain momentum,” the PVF had said in a press release, adding that the result underscored the country’s growing stature in youth volleyball across Asia.
Head coach Kafait Ullah had hailed the performance, describing it as a “statement win” against a traditional rival.
On Wednesday, Pakistan secured a place in the semi-finals of the Asian U-16 Volleyball Championship and booked their berth in next year’s FIVB U-17 World Championship after defeating Indonesia in straight sets in the quarter-final.
The national side had registered another 3-0 victory with set scores of 25-23, 25-20, 25-20. Key contributions came from Junaid, Faizan, Talha, and Saran, who were instrumental in maintaining Pakistan’s unbeaten run in the tournament.</p><small>2025-07-19 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/19105400c1b2c26.jpg?r=105445' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193/trump-says-5-jets-were-shot-down-in-india-pakistan-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says 5 jets were shot down in India-Pakistan conflict</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that five jets were shot down during the recent India-Pakistan conflict that began after a deadly attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, with the situation calming after a ceasefire in May.
Trump, who made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, did not specify which side’s jets he was referring to.
Pakistan had said it downed six Indian planes after the latter carried out deadly attacks in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, while New Delhi had claimed it had downed “a few planes”.
“Something I’m very proud of [is that] we stopped a lot of wars. A lot of wars. And these were serious, serious wars; would have been going on,” Trump said.
“You had India-Pakistan that was going, and in fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,” Trump said while talking about the India-Pakistan hostilities, without elaborating or providing further detail.
“It was getting worse and worse, wasn’t it? […] These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other. It seems like a new form of warfare; you saw it recently, when you looked at what we did in Iran when we knocked out their nuclear capability, totally knocked out,” he said, referring to the US strikes on Iran’s three nuclear sites.
 


Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later stating that figure as six. India’s highest-ranking general said in late May that India switched tactics after suffering losses in the air on the first day of hostilities and established an advantage before a ceasefire was announced three days later.
As New Delhi launched deadly air strikes on Pakistan in early May over allegations about the Pahalgam attack, which Islamabad denied, the Pakistan Air Force downed five Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
While India claimed downing jets, Islamabad has denied any losses of planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets were hit after its three air bases were targeted.
Trump has repeatedly said he prevented a “nuclear war” between Pakistan and India after Washington held talks with both sides, even crediting Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for helping in it. India has differed with Trump’s claims that it resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
 
 

Most recently, on July 7, the Trump administration doubled down on its narrative of Trump playing a central role in defusing tensions, despite India claiming otherwise.
Asked about Indian officials’ repeated denials of Trump’s role, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce avoided taking a position. “So many comments speak for themselves,” she said.
Pressed further, Bruce added, half in jest: “Everyone will have an opinion. That’s an opinion. Some opinions are wrong. Mine rarely are, but other people’s opinions can be wrong.”
Trump’s statements stand in contrast to India’s official position, which maintains that New Delhi acted independently during the May crisis and that Washington did not mediate. Trump’s remarks support Pakistan’s view that quiet US diplomacy — and direct intervention from the White House — helped calm tensions.
India’s position has been that New Delhi and Islamabad must resolve their problems directly and with no outside involvement.
 
 

India is an increasingly important US partner in Washington’s effort to counter China’s influence in Asia, while Pakistan is a strong partner in counterterrorism.
The April attack in Pahalgam killed 26 men and sparked heavy fighting between the nuclear-armed Asian neighbours in the latest escalation of a decades-old rivalry.
New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation. Washington condemned the attack but did not directly blame Islamabad.</p><small>2025-07-19 15:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/191442323472b6e.jpg?r=155553' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925209/9-terrorists-killed-3-officers-injured-in-joint-operation-in-kps-hangu-police' target='_blank'><strong>9 terrorists killed, 3 officers injured in joint operation in KP’s Hangu: police</strong></a><br><p>Nine terrorists were killed and three security officers injured in an exchange of fire during an operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Hangu district, police said on Saturday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Earlier, a statement by KP Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed said that security forces and police carried out a joint operation in Hangu’s Zargari Shinawari area.
“Nine terrorists killed in Hangu operation, District Police Officer (DPO) Khalid Khan is undergoing treatment at the Kohat Combined Military Hospital,” a statement issued later by Kohat Regional Police Officer DIG Abbas Majeed read.
“The operation is continuing successfully and full action is being taken against the terrorists,” the statement added.
It further read that DPO Khan was out of danger now.
Federal Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi telephoned the Hangu DPO and appreciated his bravery and determination.
“The interior minister said that the nation will never forget the sacrifices of its brave sons and is determined to achieve final victory in the war against terrorism,” the statement added.
 






“During the operation, there was a heavy exchange of fire between the terrorists and the law enforcement personnel,” the earlier statement by the KP IGP read.
“Security forces fought bravely and killed five terrorists. However, Hangu DPO Khalid Khan, the Doaba station house officer (SHO), and an officer of the security forces were injured in the exchange of fire,” it added.
The statement said that DPO Khan “was hit by three bullets”.
IG Hameed spoke to the injured officers and enquired about their well-being, according to the police statement.
“Law enforcement agencies are determined to continue their fight against terrorism,” the statement added.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.
 
 

On June 21, KP police killed a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.
In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide attack in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
Earlier this week, three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu district.
On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a joint operation by the CTD.

Last month, Pakistan had whitewashed Bangladesh in a home three-match T20I series at the Gaddafi Stadium. Litton Das-led Bangladesh will take the field on the back of an away 2-1 T20I series triumph over Sri Lanka last week.
Pakistan are visiting Bangladesh for the first time since December 2021 as they arrived in the country on Wednesday, after taking part in an extensive training camp in Karachi, the PCB said.
“Pakistan and Bangladesh will lock horns in a three-match T20I series beginning on Sunday, May 20,” the press release issued on Saturday said.
“Salman Ali Agha, who has so far led Pakistan in 12 T20Is, will marshal the side in fourth T20I series,” it added.
 






The pace duo of Ahmed Daniyal and Mohammad Salman Mirza are the two uncapped players in Pakistan’s squad and will be in line to make their international debuts during the series.
“The overall T20I record between Pakistan and Bangladesh depicts the former’s domination as they have won 19 out of 22 T20Is since the first clash between both sides in September 2007 in Nairobi,” the PCB said.
“We have changed the way we want to play but knowing the conditions is going to be the key,” skipper Salman said at a pre-match presser.
 


He added that if the conditions allow them to play aggressively then they would surely play that way and in case the conditions were different then the team would go about it accordingly.
“In our training we have tried to make sure that we experience match-like situations in order to get game ready,” he added.
“Bangladesh are a tough opposition especially in their home conditions. We know what the challenges are going to be thrown at us and we are very excited to play here,” Salman said.
Earlier in the month, the PCB anno­unced a 15-member squad for the series, with five frontline players including former captains Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afr­idi omitted for a second series in a row.
Vice-captain Shadab Khan and fast bowler Haris Rauf were also ruled out due to fitness issues. Shadab is recovering from shoulder surgery in England, while Haris sustained a hamstring injury during a T20 league match in the United States last week.
Babar, Rizwan, and Shaheen were left out again as the selectors continue to experiment with new faces ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup, scheduled for February-March next year in India and Sri Lanka.
Squads:
Pakistan: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Ahmed Daniyal, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Nawaz, Sahibzada Farhan (wicket-keeper), Saim Ayub, Salman Mirza and Sufyan Moqim.
Bangladesh: Litton Das (captain/wicket-keeper), Jaker Ali Anik, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Mohammad Naim Sheikh, Mohammad Saifuddin, Mustafizur Rahman, Nasum Ahmed, Parvez Hossain Emon, Rishad Hossain, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Shamim Hossain Patwari, Shoriful Islam, Tanzid Hasan Tamim, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Taskin Ahmed and Towhid Hridoy.</p><small>2025-07-19 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/19185715519eb63.png?r=190437' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925232/malaysia-border-control-glitch-hits-travellers' target='_blank'><strong>Malaysia border control glitch hits travellers</strong></a><br><p>A glitch in Malaysia’s self-service border control machines hit tens of thousands of travellers, the immigration department estimated on Saturday, causing delays at the capital’s airport and land crossings.
Among major gateways affected since Friday afternoon are Kuala Lumpur International Airport’s two main terminals, as well as southern land crossings with Singapore.
“It should be more than tens of thousands of travellers who have to wait longer at the manual counters to clear immigration,” estimated Zakaria Shaaban, the director-general of Malaysia’s Immigration Department.
Zakaria was unable to give a precise number of people affected when asked by AFP.
“We don’t have many manual counters over in Johor because we have converted most of them into autogates,” Zakaria said, referring to the southern state that neighbours Singapore.
Malaysian daily The Star said that the breakdown has been described as the “worst ever”, involving over 200 machines and affecting only foreign passport holders.
Singapore’s Immigration and Checkpoints Authority warned people intending to travel to Malaysia to expect delays.
“Those who are already at the land checkpoints and need to U-turn can approach officers for assistance,” it said in a Facebook post.
Since June 2024, travellers from 63 countries, as well as accredited diplomats and their families, have been allowed to use Malaysia’s self-service machines for immigration clearance.
The Malaysian Border Control and Protection Agency said initial investigations found that the “technical disruption” was due to a data integration issue.
“This caused the delays in the cross-checking process within the MyIMMS (immigration) system,” it said in a statement.
“All manual counters have been fully activated and additional personnel have been deployed to manage the flow of visitors and control the queues at the best capacity,” the agency added.</p><small>2025-07-19 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614795-disgruntled-pti-leaders-vow-to-contest-senate-elections-reject-withdrawal-calls' target='_blank'><strong>Disgruntled PTI leaders vow to contest Senate elections, reject withdrawal calls</strong></a><br><p>

The government aims to develop the maritime sector and tap the economic potential of the country’s over 1000-kilometre-long coastline. Under the recently launched “Maritime at 100“ Vision, the country aims to grow the sector into a $100 billion economic force by 2047.
Chaudhry announced the establishment of a “state-of-the-art” aquaculture park at the Korangi harbour at an estimated cost of Rs3bn, according to a press release issued by the ministry.
The development came as Chaudhry chaired a high-level meeting on the development of a blue economy. The meeting was attended by Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) Chairman Noorul Haq Baloch, as well as representatives from the Korangi Fisheries Harbour Authority (KoFHA), the Marine Fisheries Department (MFD), and the Balochistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The estimated annual production of a 120-acre aquaculture park ranges from 360 to 1,200 tonnes, depending on the species cultivated and the farming system employed, according to the statement. Its annual revenue potential is projected to be between $720,000 to $7.2 million, influenced by “species selection, market prices, and production intensity”.
 
 

The maritime affairs minister directed KoFHA to submit a comprehensive execution report within 10 days.
He said that the project should be developed under a public-private partnership framework to boost the country’s blue economy through sustainable aquaculture.
The land cost for the park has been set according to an extensive farming model, offering an “affordable and efficient foundation” for private investors, the press release noted.
It said experts informed the meeting that Pakistan’s coastal waters possess highly conducive conditions for aquaculture, providing an ideal environment for farming a variety of marine species.
Emphasising the replication of success, Chaudhry proposed extending the aquaculture model to Balochistan, leveraging its vast coastal belt for sustainable marine farming.
To enhance coordination, the minister ordered the relocation of the MFD sub-office to the premises of the GPA. The press release noted that the administrative shift was expected to “streamline inter-agency collaboration and expedite decision-making in blue economy initiatives”.
In a separate meeting, Chaudhry also reviewed the progress on the land allotment and lease policy of the Port Qasim Authority (PQA), according to the press release.
He was informed that the Survey of Pakistan has been engaged to identify and demarcate PQA-owned land. It was also conveyed that the revision of the PQA’s master plan was being aligned with a broader feasibility study for the National Ports Master Plan, which is currently underway.
Chaudhry reiterated the government’s commitment to promoting sustainable marine development. He asserted that investments in aquaculture and port infrastructure were “essential for ensuring food security, increasing exports, and generating employment across coastal regions”.
 
 

“The series of meetings held by the maritime minister mark a significant step in the government’s broader maritime development strategy, focused on harnessing the full potential of Pakistan’s coastal resources through innovation, institutional cooperation, and private sector engagement,” the press release said.
In June, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared the “blue economy” as Pakistan’s new economic frontier, calling for a unified national effort to develop the maritime sector.
“Even tapping a fraction of this economy could be a real game-changer,” he said, noting that Pakistan’s coastal trade already brings in nearly $7 billion a year. “Just imagine the potential if we fully develop this sector.”
Stakeholders have also welcomed a new idea floated by Chaudhry to set up a “maritime chamber of commerce and industry” so that all players in this sector could be brought on a single platform.</p><small>2025-07-19 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614792-pafs-jf-17c-c-130-clinch-top-awards-at-uk-airshow' target='_blank'><strong>PAF's JF-17C, C-130 clinch top awards at UK airshow</strong></a><br><p>

RIAT, which runs from July 18 to 20, is one of the world’s largest military airshows, has been running for over 50 years and powers the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, according to its website.
On Thursday, a PAF contingent comprising “state-of-the-art JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter aircraft and the C-130 Hercules transport aircraft, landed at the Royal Air Force Base Fairford in the UK to participate in the prestigious” RIAT 2025, a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
 






The JF-17 Block-III was awarded the “Spirit of the Meet Trophy” for its “striking livery and the incredible journey from Pakistan with non-stop air-to-air refuelling,” PTV reported.
According to ISPR’s press release earlier this week, the JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighters executed successful Air-to-Air Refuelling operations en route to the UK with the support of a PAF IL-78 aerial refuelling tanker.
 






Meanwhile, the C-130H Hercules was awarded the “Concours d’Elegance Trophy”.
 






“These awards were given in recognition of the aircrafts’ excellent flying and technical skills,” PTV said. It added that the JF-17C Block III represents Pakistan’s “advanced defence technology”.
“This success has honoured Pakistan’s aviation sector on an international level.”
PTV called the success at RIAT a “testament to the recognition of the capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force”.
 






In May, when Pakistan downed Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the Pakistan-India conflict, the PAF formally acknowledged a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down them down.
The event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.
“There is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III,” the statement said.
“The aircraft’s combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.”</p><small>2025-07-19 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/19160015f575740.jpg?r=170947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925212/dar-to-visit-us-next-week-for-high-level-unsc-events-certain-washington-engagements' target='_blank'><strong>Dar to visit US next week for high-level UNSC events, ‘certain’ Washington engagements</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will visit the United States next week to attend high-level events of the UN Security Council (UNSC) and “certain” other engagements in Washington, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday.
Earlier this month, Pakistan assumed presidency of the UNSC, marking the country’s eighth term on the 15-member body and its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.
Dar will visit the US to “attend the high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency in New York, as well as for certain engagements in Washington”, the FO said in a statement.
The statement, which did not specify the dates of Dar’s visit, mentioned at least four UNSC-affiliated events that he will attend. His expected engagements in Washington, the hub of the White House, come amid ongoing trade talks between the countries.
 






To express Pakistan’s “strong commitment and unwavering support” for the right to self-determination of Palestinians, Dar will also attend a high-level conference on the “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the implementation of Two-State Solution”.
The conference was originally planned for June but was postponed due to the Iran-Israel war, which also led to the rescheduling of Dar’s visit. According to The Guardian, the moot will now be held on July 28 and 29.
While in New York, Dar will chair a high-level open debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”. The debate will aim at exploring ways to strengthen multilateralism and enhance diplomacy and mediation for the peaceful settlement of disputes, the FO said.
In addition, the deputy premier will preside over the UNSC’s Quarterly Open Debate on the “Situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question”.
Pakistan’s high-level participation in UNSC’s Quarterly Debate on the Middle East, as well as the global conference on the Palestine question, “is a testimony to Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to and support for the Palestinian cause”, the FO stressed.
 
 

Dar will also chair a high-level UNSC briefing that will focus on enhancing cooperation between the UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The meeting will be held as part of Pakistan’s efforts to “strengthen collaboration between the OIC and the UN for the maintenance of international peace and security”, according to the FO.
During his stay in New York, Dar is also expected to have several bilateral engagements with his counterparts, as well as senior UN officials.
“Dar’s visit to New York and Washington exemplifies Pakistan’s growing role and importance in the multilateral arena as well as its expanding multifaceted relations with the US,” the FO highlighted.
On Friday, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and United States Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer as part of another round of trade negotiations to avoid a 29 per cent tariff.
US-Pakistan relations saw a major boost when Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House last month in an unprecedented meeting.
Earlier in the week, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, once again called for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Speaking at the UNSC’s Briefing on the Humanitarian Situation in Gaza, he called on the international community to act without delay.
Earlier this month, Pakistan had urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in conflict-battered Gaza, where Israeli military operations continue to claim civilian lives and take a devastating toll on infrastructure.</p><small>2025-07-19 12:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/191643194c1a0b0.jpg?r=170351' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925217/karachis-business-community-partially-heeds-strike-call-against-new-fbr-powers' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi’s business community partially heeds strike call against new FBR powers</strong></a><br><p>The business community in Karachi observed a partial strike on Saturday against the tax measures and arrest powers of the federal tax authority under the Finance Act FY26.
The call for a countrywide strike was issued last week by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), backed by trade bodies, industrial area associations, petroleum dealers, transporters, and chain store operators. The KCCI protested against what they described as anti-business measures and proposed provincial labour policies.
“A partial strike was observed in Karachi on the call of industrialists and supported by traders of markets against enhancing  FBR’s powers to conduct raids and arrests of businessmen,” All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn.com.
All Karachi Tajir Ittehad is an association of markets and shopkeepers in the metropolis.
Mir said that the markets at Gul Plaza, Teen Talwar in Clifton and Nursery remained open. However, the majority of traders have supported the strike, though some of the traders have reservations over the nature of demands, he said.
“The demands of small traders were not included, particularly regarding the raids on shops and closure of shops on the pretext of being in poor condition,” he added.
A leader of the markets in the Old City areas, Sharjeel Goplani, told Dawn.com, “A partial strike was observed as Lea Market, Urdu Bazaar as well as Timber and Furniture markets remained open.”
 
 

The expanded enforcement powers for the FBR include the authority to block high-value financial transactions by non-filers — such as vehicle and property purchases, investment in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain prestigious bank accounts — along with powers to seal unregistered business premises, confiscate goods and recover taxes from firms, including those in the public sector. The move has generated criticism from many quarters.
The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry had also announced its participation in the strike, condemning the enhanced powers granted to FBR officials and the lack of consultation with the private sector.
A day earlier, the business community appeared divided over the strike with Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon claiming that chambers and trade associations had agreed to defer the strike following a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries Haroon Akhtar Khan.</p><small>2025-07-19 12:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/191220223dda95c.jpg?r=131135' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925200/local-mountaineer-iftikhar-hussain-dies-as-4-caught-in-k2-avalanche' target='_blank'><strong>Local mountaineer Iftikhar Hussain dies as 4 caught in K2 avalanche</strong></a><br><p>The body of local mountaineer Iftikhar Hussain who lost his life when his four-member international expedition team was caught in an avalanche on the K2 peak was brought to his hometown of Gilgit-Baltistan’s Skardu on Saturday, officials said.
K2, standing at 8,611 metres above sea level, is the second-highest peak in the world, attracting a host of local and foreign tourists. Last summer, GB authorities issued a total of 175 permits to climbers aspiring to conquer the mountain, despite the treacherous climb and harsh weather conditions.
The senior vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP), Karrar Haidri, told Dawn.com that at approximately 12:30pm on Friday, an avalanche struck Camp 1 on K2, located about 500m above the base camp. Four climbers were caught in the avalanche.
“A foreign climber sustained minor injuries, while two others successfully returned to the Advance Base Camp,” Haidri said in a statement. However, high-altitude porter Iftikhar Hussain from Sadpara in Skardu lost his life in the incident.
The other climbers were Dawa Finjo Sherpa and Dawa Geljen Sherpa from Nepal, and high-altitude porter Niaz Ali from Skardu. The international team was returning from Camp 2 during their rotation for the summit at the time of the incident.
Tour operator Syed Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that the deceased mountaineer’s body and Finjo, the injured Nepali climber, were brought from the K2 base camp to Skardu by Army Aviation helicopters on Saturday.
Hussain’s body was handed over to his family for burial, he added. Finjo was in stable condition and undergoing treatment at a government hospital in Skardu.
Two helicopters of the Pakistan Army Aviation Corps took part in the operation, Anwar said.
 
 

The expedition outfitter submitted a formal request to ACP President Major General Irfan Arshad and Askari Aviation for a helicopter operation to repatriate the deceased following the incident.
The request was approved by the army’s General Headquarters on humanitarian grounds.
Earlier this month, a tourist from the Czech Republic, Klára Kolouchová, died after falling into a ravine at the Nanga Parbat base camp in GB.
Kolouchová, 46, was part of a multinational expedition atte­m­pting to summit the mountain. Her health reportedly deteriorated at Camp 4, forcing her to abort the climb and begin her de­­s­­­cent with Nepali Sherpa Tara­man Tamang.</p><small>2025-07-19 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614785-dpm-dar-to-visit-us-next-week-to-attend-high-level-events' target='_blank'><strong>DPM Dar to visit US next week to attend 'high-level events'</strong></a><br><p>

Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, in a separate speech, said that “Arab and American” mediation had helped bring calm, and criticised Israel for airstrikes against Syrian government forces in the south and Damascus during the week.
Sweida province has been engulfed by nearly a week of violence, which began with clashes between Bedouin fighters and Druze factions, before Damascus sent in government security forces.
Israel has carried out airstrikes in southern Syria and on the defence ministry in Damascus, saying it is protecting the Druze minority, of whom there are a significant number in Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
In a statement on Saturday, the Syrian presidency announced an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and urged all parties to end hostilities immediately.
 
 

The interior ministry said internal security forces had begun deploying in Sweida.
The death toll from violence in Sweida province, heartland of Syria’s Druze minority, has risen to 940 since last weekend, a war monitor said, despite the announcement of a ceasefire.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that the dead included 326 Druze fighters and 262 Druze civilians, 182 of whom were “summarily executed by defence and interior ministry personnel”.
They also included 312 government security personnel and 21 Sunni Bedouin, three of them civilians who were “summarily executed by Druze fighters”.
Another 15 government troops were killed in Israeli strikes, the observatory said.
Sharaa called for calm and said Syria would not be a “testing ground for partition, secession, or sectarian incitement”.
“The Israeli intervention pushed the country into a dangerous phase that threatened its stability,” he said in a televised speech.
US envoy Tom Barrack announced on Friday that Syria and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire supported by Turkiye, Jordan and neighbours.
Barrack, who is both US ambassador to Turkiye and Washington’s Syria envoy, urged Druze, Bedouins and Sunnis to put down their weapons “and, together with other minorities, build a new and united Syrian identity”.
Israel has attacked Syrian military facilities and weaponry in the seven months since Sharaa’s forces toppled President Bashar al-Assad, and says it wants areas of southern Syria near its border to remain demilitarised.
On Friday, an Israeli official said Israel had agreed to allow Syrian forces limited access to the Sweida area for the next two days.

He made the remarks after meeting with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer on Friday as part of a critical round of trade talks aimed at securing tariff relief and expanding bilateral economic cooperation.
“One thing we discussed was that we have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative, which is obviously very critical, but besides that, for the Pakistan-US relationship to be brought to the next level and bring in a real step change, [there is] an investment imperative that will hopefully emerge,” Aurangzeb said in a video statement.
“Areas [for investment] have already been identified,” the minister said, mentioning minerals and mining, artificial intelligence, digital infrastructure and cryptocurrency.
“We feel this will be a real game-changer, God-willing, in terms of the economic relationship between Pakistan and the United States.”
 






Aurangzeb added that both sides committed to begin their talks with trade and follow them through “very quickly with investment discussions between the two countries and real execution of the investment upside that is available, so that it becomes a win-win” for Pakistan and the US.
The minister termed his dialogue with Lutnick and Greer “very constructive”. Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, who were present during the meeting, accompanied Aurangzeb in the video statement.
“Positive progress over the last few weeks and months was reviewed. Equally importantly, we focused on the slightly outstanding aspects,” the finance czar said, adding there was a clear commitment from both sides to “get closure” on those items.
The minister highlighted that as the US was Pakistan’s largest trading partner, it was quite critical to move forward in the “same spirit” in which the recent discussions had taken place.
“In the next few days, we hope that the coming leadership-level announcements will reflect all the hard work and efforts that have been put in both by Pakistan and the US side,” Aurangzeb said.
Pakistan aims to finalise a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a 29 per cent tariff on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products. While Trump has announced tariffs for some countries, talks with others are ongoing ahead of his extended August 1 deadline.
Earlier this month, the countries reached an initial understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country’s key export sectors. A formal announcement on any deal is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.
A source close to the US administration has mentioned a further deadline: “The president wants concrete deliverables before the August 15 deadline. Countries that stall may find themselves on the wrong end of a tariff wall.”
A senior Pakistani official involved in the negotiations said: “We’re not here for aid. We’re here for serious negotiations and a possible deal. It’s about mutual benefit now — trade, not dependence.”
 
 

Behind the scenes, influential US-based businessmen with stakes in cryptocurrency and rare earth mineral ventures have quietly supported Pakistan’s efforts to gain greater access to American markets.
In April, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) partnered with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump. Earlier that month, a US delegation expressed Washington’s strategic interest in the country’s mineral sector.</p><small>2025-07-19 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1913290655652e2.png?r=135108' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925204/trump-sues-media-magnate-rupert-murdoch-wsj-over-epstein-sex-bombshell' target='_blank'><strong>Trump sues media magnate Rupert Murdoch, WSJ over Epstein sex bombshell</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump sued media magnate Rupert Murdoch and The Wall Street Journal for at least $10 billion on Friday over the publication of a bombshell article on his friendship with the infamous alleged sex trafficker of underage girls, Jeffrey Epstein.
The defamation lawsuit, filed in federal court in Miami, saw the 79-year-old Republican hitting back at a scandal threatening to cause serious political damage.
“We have just filed a powerhouse lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, fake news ‘article’ in the useless ‘rag’ that is The Wall Street Journal,” Trump posted on Truth Social late on Friday.
 






The Journal reported on Thursday that in 2003, the then-real estate magnate wrote a suggestive birthday letter to Epstein, illustrated with a naked woman and alluding to a shared “secret”.
The lawsuit, which also names two reporters, the Dow Jones corporation and Murdoch’s parent company News Corp as defendants, claims that no such letter exists and that the paper intended to malign Trump with a story that has now been viewed by hundreds of millions of people.
“And given the timing of the defendants’ article, which shows their malicious intent behind it, the overwhelming financial and reputational harm suffered by President Trump will continue to multiply,” it said.
Dow Jones, the Journal‘s longtime publisher, responded to Trump’s libel suit on Friday, saying that it is standing by the story.
“We have full confidence in the rigour and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit,” a Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement.
Alleged cover-up
In another bid to dampen outrage among his own supporters about an alleged government cover-up of Epstein’s activities and 2019 death, Trump ordered US Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony from the prosecution against the disgraced financier.
In a filing in New York, Bondi cited “extensive public interest” for the unusual request to release what is typically secret testimony.
 






Epstein, a longtime friend of Trump and multiple high-profile men, was found hanging dead in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial on charges that he sexually exploited dozens of underage girls at his homes in New York and Florida.
The case sparked conspiracy theories, especially among Trump’s far-right voters, about an alleged international cabal of wealthy pedophiles. Epstein’s death — declared a suicide — before he could face trial supercharged the narrative.
When Trump returned to power for a second term this January, his supporters clamoured for revelations about Epstein’s supposed list of clients. But Bondi issued an official memo this month declaring there was no such list.
The discontent in Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base poses a rare challenge to the Republican’s control of the political narrative in the United States.
It remained unclear whether a court would authorise the unsealing of the grand jury testimony.
But even if such material were made public, there is no assurance that it would shed much, if any, light on the main questions raised in the conspiracy theories — particularly the existence and possible contents of an Epstein client list.
Asked on Friday by reporters if he would pursue the broader release of information related to the case, Trump did not answer.
Naked woman and signature
Trump was close with Epstein for years, and the two were photographed and videotaped together at parties, although there has never been evidence of wrongdoing.
The Wall Street Journal article published late on Thursday was damaging because it indicated a shared interest in sex.
The Journal reported that Trump had wished Epstein a happy 50th birthday in 2003 with a “bawdy” letter, part of an album of messages from rich and well-known figures.
According to the Journal, the Trump letter contained the outline of a naked woman, apparently drawn with a marker, and had the future president’s signature “Donald” mimicking pubic hair. It ends, according to the newspaper, with “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret”.
Trump reacted in a series of furious social media posts, saying, “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”
 






“I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said.
US media has published multiple drawings done by Trump in the past, with several dating to the early 2000s when he used his celebrity status to donate sketches for charity.</p><small>2025-07-19 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614756-nab-arrests-eight-key-accused-in-rs40bn-kohistan-case' target='_blank'><strong>NAB arrests eight accused in Kohistan corruption scandal</strong></a><br><p>

The IHC has constituted a new administrative committee, comprising four judges, in the light of amendments to the High Court Rules that have significantly reshaped the court’s internal power structure.
According to a notification issued by the registrar’s office with the approval of the chief justice, the newly-formed committee will be headed by Justice Dogar himself, while Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Azam Khan will serve as members.
The formation of the new committee follows a major administrative reshuffle at the IHC which has notably curtailed the powers of senior puisne judge Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani. Previously considered one of the most influential judges in the court, Justice Kayani has been excluded from the administrative committee and the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC), and has also lost his role as the inspection judge.

Previously considered one of most influential judges in court, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani loses role as inspection judge

Sources said the new DPC would comprise Justice Soomro and Justice Azam Khan.
These developments come in the wake of amendments to Rule 237 and Rule 239 of Chapter 10 of the High Court Rules, which now grant the chief justice discretionary powers to appoint members of the administrative committee and define the duties of each administration judge.
It may be mentioned that Justice Babar Sattar along with four other judges has reportedly expressed serious concerns over the amendments in the rule, arguing that it undermines judicial seniority and due process.
Five judges initially challenged the transfer and subsequent change in the senior list of the IHC before the then chief justice Aamer Farooq.
Following dismissal of their representation, they approached the Supreme Court. However, the apex court also declined their request to reverse the seniority.
The Judicial Commission of Pakistan then approved the appointment of Justice Dogar as the chief justice of IHC.
 
 

The five judges, on the other hand, have filed an intra-court appeal against the SC’s constitutional bench decision of upholding the seniority of the IHC that raised Justice Dogar to the top.
The five judges have requested the Supreme Court not to consider justices Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Asif as judges of IHC until they take fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194.
The appeal contended that Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010 only provides for the appointment of judges to the IHC from other provinces but makes no reference to transfers.
The appeal contended that the June 19 order impermissibly reads in “permanent” in Article 200(1) and (2) of the Constitution when no such language was contained in the provision.
The appeal pleaded that the constitutional bench had misunderstood the provisions of Article 200 by reading sub-article (1) in isolation from other provisions of the article by not holding that transfers envisioned in Article 200(1) were only for a temporary and time-specified period.

Sabri qawwal Ahmed Sabri, his young son, Raza Sabri ,and their fellow musician, Mohammed Asif, were shot dead while several others, including four other musicians, were wounded in an indiscriminate shooting carried out by terrorists on a bus that was on its way to Quetta from Karachi. The victims were going to perform at an event planned for Wednesday in Quetta.
Their funeral prayers were held at the KMC park in PIB Colony after  Juma, which was attended by a large number of people, including  political leaders, city dignitaries and the musicians’ fans.
Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, Mayor of Karachi Murtaza Wahab, local government minister and Pakistan Peoples Party leader Saeed Ghani, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan leader Dr Farooq Sattar, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Haleem Adil Shaikh, Jamaat-i-Islami’s Monem Zafar and others attended the funerals.
Later, the victims were laid to rest at a local graveyard.
Governor blames RAW for terrorism wave
Talking to the media, the governor said that there was ‘evidence’ that Indian intelligence agency Research Analysis Wing (RAW) was involved in the recent wave of terrorism in Pakistan.
He said the motive of the hostile neighbour was to spread chaos in the country, but the Pakistani nation was united to foil such nefarious designs.
He said the nation along with the armed forces of Pakistan had given a befitting reply to the enemy on May 10. The governor vowed to give an active response to RAW and its facilitators.
Talking to reporters, MQM-P leader Dr Sattar said that the situation in Balochistan had deteriorated to an extent that innocent passengers from other parts of the country were being targeted.
He said that his party would not sit idle until “RAW and Indian proxies are eliminated from Pakistani soil”.

He said that one after another tragedy raised serious questions over the performance of the government and the law enforcement agencies.
He demanded the state institutions to take strict, effective and comprehensive action against terrorists in Balochistan.

“The United States did not support recent Israeli strikes,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters.
“We are engaging diplomatically with Israel and Syria at the highest levels, both to address the present crisis and reach a lasting agreement between the two sovereign states,” she said.
She declined to say if the United States had expressed its displeasure with Israel or whether it would oppose future strikes on Syria.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio voiced concern when asked about the Israeli strikes, which included attacking the defence ministry in Damascus.

Fresh clashes rock Druze heartland

He later issued a statement that did not directly address the Israeli strikes, but voiced broader concern about the violence.
Israel said it was intervening on behalf of the Druze community after communal clashes.
Fresh clashes
Meanwhile, Bedouin tribes and Druze fighters clashed again in the latter’s Sweida heartland on Friday, a day after the Syrian army withdrew under Israeli bombardment and diplomatic pressure.

“The MPAs whose districts have experienced devastation [due to rains and flooding] should identify those areas, and the government will compensate farmers for their losses there,” the minister stated in response to a demand by the treasury MPA, Mehwish Sultana, seeking that the flood-affected areas be declared calamity-hit.
Acknowledging the unprecedented nature of the ongoing monsoon, the minister said: “We have received more rainfall than expected during the season,” confirming that the government has decided to provide financial assistance to compensate for the damages caused by the rains. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would soon announce financial aid for the bereaved families of those who died in the calamities, while those who have suffered financial losses will also be compensated,“ he added.
 
 

The session also saw a heated debate regarding alleged corruption within the Auqaf and Religious Affairs Department. Treasury member Ahsan Raza directly accused the shrines’ custodians (matawallis) of corruption and demanded accountability for the funds donated to various shrines. “Where has the money from philanthropists gone? We are facing corruption,” the MPA said.
Admitting corruption within the department, Parliamentary Secretary for Auqaf, Malik Waheed, said: “Which department doesn’t have corruption, but we are trying to run the system in a better way.” He, however, urged the members to provide evidence of corruption. “If corruption has occurred anywhere in the department, point it out, and I will conduct an audit and present it to the house.”
During the session, three new legislative drafts were introduced by Punjab Law Minister Sohaib Bharath – The Punjab Agricultural Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2025, The Punjab Horticulture Authority Bill 2025, and The Punjab Senior Citizens Welfare Bill 2025.
Acting Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar referred all the bills to the relevant committees for review for a period of two months.
Upon completing the agenda, the chair adjourned the assembly proceedings until 2pm on Tuesday. Before adjourning, he announced that the Senate election for a general seat in Punjab would be held in the assembly on Monday. Voting will take place from 9am to 4pm. Special cards have been issued to MPAs for the polls and no one will be allowed to cast a vote without the card, he said.
Earlier, the session began over two hours behind its schedule. Prayers (Fateha) were offered for those who lost their lives in the recent floods, rains and storms across the province.
Opposition’s ‘public assembly’
In a show of solidarity with their suspended colleagues, the opposition PTI lawmakers staged a “public assembly” outside the provincial house. This unconventional session served as a platform for the opposition to voice their strong criticism of the government on various fronts, including the handling of recent floods, rising commodity prices and alleged political victimisation.
Ejaz Shafi, acting as the speaker for this “outdoor” assembly, allowed the opposition members to speak on points of order.
MPA Imtiaz Sheikh fiercely criticised the government, stating that the development projects being showcased by the administration have been “washed away in floodwaters.” Retired Col Shoaib Awan and Tayyab Rashid also joined in, accusing the chief minister of engaging in political theatrics and suppressing the opposition. They highlighted the dire situation in Punjab, asserting that the province is “drowning,” crops are submerged and houses are destroyed, yet the government remains “indifferent.”
Opposition Leader in the Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar declared, “Until our suspended members are reinstated, we will not enter the assembly.” He painted a grim picture of Punjab’s current state, saying that the situation has become “quite critical.”
Bhachar criticised the government’s response to the floods, saying the calamity has exposed the weaknesses of its development projects. He pointed out the massive human cost, with “63 people dead and 290 injured” due to rains and floods, asking, “Who is responsible for this?”
He also attacked the government on economic issues, highlighting the drastic increase in petrol prices from Rs134 to Rs272 in a coupleof years, asking, “Who is the thief?” He further alleged that the sugar mafia has taken over the province.
Bhachar highlighted the alleged restrictions on incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan in meeting the party leaders and workers in jail. He accused the government of “doing everything to suppress the PTI.”
He also presented a resolution against the devastation caused by floods and the soaring prices of sugar and petrol, that was passed by the “public assembly.” Following the completion of the agenda, Shafi adjourned the “session” indefinitely.

Shocked and frustrated at the unexpected resistance, the dacoits’ associates standing outside vented their anger at the walls and fired indiscriminately at all houses in the locality, wounding a passer-by, said local sources.
The sources said that over 15 members of notorious Rajab alias Rajjo Jatoi gang barged into the houses of Mohammad Ali Sheikh and his brothers and tried to rob the inmates when the men were at work.
However, to their utter surprise, the unarmed women bravely resisted them by using sticks, bricks and anything they could lay their hands on. Finally, they succeeded to push back the intruders and lock themselves up in their houses, they said.
During the ensuing commotion, the other dacoits standing outside fired indiscriminately at all the houses in the locality, creating fear and forcing inmates to lock their doors, said eyewitnesses, adding a young man from Jamali community sustained gunshot wound to his arm during the fierce firing.
The sources said that the gang managed to escape from the area before men of the Sheikh community rushed back to their homes. 
The area police, who were posted at a short distance from the scene, allegedly arrived an hour late and merely asked residents of the locality if anyone was dead and injured in the firing, said the sources.
A video clip went viral on social media following the incident, which purportedly showed Rajab Jatoi, ring leader of the Jatoi gang, threatening the Sheikh community of dire consequences.

The tariff is based on an average five per cent unrecoverable bills and is indexed to inflation and exchange rate variations for a six-year period ending in FY30.
The newly approved multi-year tariff (FY24-FY30) for KE is over Rs8 per unit higher than the national average tariff of Rs31.59 per unit notified for the current year. This means taxpayers will bear the additional cost through the federal budget in order to maintain uniform electricity rates across the country.
“Notwithstanding the notification of the attached decision of the Authority, the consumers of K-Electric shall not be charged the tariff outlined therein; rather, they shall be charged the uniform tariff as applicable to the consumers of ex-Wapda Discos as determined by Nepra and notified under the Act from time to time, in accordance with paragraph 5.6.3 of the National Electricity Policy, 2021”, Nepra said in gazette notification issued on Friday.
Last month, the Power Division announced that it had challenged Nepra’s May 27 determination on KE’s multi-year tariff, alleging that it had extended nearly Rs750 billion in undue financial favour to the private utility over seven years — at the cost of the national exchequer, consumers across the country, and taxpayers.
In a statement issued on June 2, the Power Division said that six separate tariff interventions approved by the regulator would result in a financial impact of about Rs453bn over seven years. Additionally, the higher fuel cost benchmark for FY25 alone would result in an extra Rs41bn burden, which, even if held flat, could amount to Rs287bn over the full control period.
Despite the formal challenge, Nepra did not acknowledge the Power Division’s review petition in its gazette notification.
The Power Division further alleged that Nepra had allowed KE to include losses in its tariff that were not actually incurred, with an estimated seven-year financial impact of over Rs200bn. It maintained that only actual losses, following a proper write-off process, should be permitted.

Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Senior Vice-President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon claimed that chambers and trade associations had agreed to defer the strike following a meeting with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Industries Haroon Akhtar Khan, attended by various chambers via Zoom.
The strike call was initially issued by the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), backed by trade bodies, industrial area associations, petroleum dealers, transporters, and chain store operators.
“We have not supported the KCCI strike as it was announced by one chamber alone,” Mr Magoon said. He maintained that the FPCCI, representing chambers from across the country — including Faisalabad, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Sialkot, Multan, Khanewal, Sheikhupura, Sargodha, Quetta, and Peshawar — had unanimously decided to postpone the strike after the government agreed to address major concerns related to the Finance Act 2025.
“Only the KCCI and the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) are not on the same page,” he added, dismissing the possibility of a decisive nationwide strike.

FPCCI ‘postpones’ strike; Karachi Chamber sticks to shutdown in absence of written commitment

However, KCCI President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani insisted that a peaceful strike would be observed on Saturday, having secured backing from numerous trade and industrial organisations. “If the government fails to provide written assurances following our meeting with SAPM Haroon Akhtar, we will be compelled to extend the strike. We are not satisfied with verbal commitments,” Mr Bilwani said, warning that further shutdowns could extend to multiple days or even the full week.
 
 

Criticising the bureaucracy, he noted, “Businessmen work seven days a week, while government officials work only five.”
He warned that unresolved issues may force industries to relocate abroad, particularly to Dubai.
KCCI has expressed serious objections to Sections 37A and 37B of the Sales Tax Act, which it says grant sweeping and arbitrary powers to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Mr Bilwani said the decision to go ahead with the strike was reaffirmed after an unfruitful meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on July 16, during which demands to suspend five key anti-business measures remained unmet.
These include the immediate withdrawal of Sections 37A and 37B, repeal of Section 21(S) which penalises cash transactions above Rs200,000, scrapping of Section 40C mandating the e-Bilty system, revocation of SRO 709 introducing a disputed digital invoicing system, and restoration of the Final Tax Regime (FTR) for exporters.
LCCI President Mian Abu Zar Shaad stated that the chamber had decided to join the strike in solidarity with the broader business community. “The problems persist despite meetings with the government. We now demand implementation rather than assurances,” he said.
Meanwhile, FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh told the media that a charter of demands had been presented to Mr Haroon, who agreed to withdraw the contentious measures. “There will be no strike on Saturday,” Mr Sheikh claimed, adding that the SAPM’s recommendations would be forwarded to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

During an interaction with a select group of reporters on Friday, Mr Naqvi said the plan was meant for the smooth coordination of the civil armed forces, which fall under the interior ministry, with the military and other stakeholders for effective counterterrorism operations.
One of the proposals was to ap­­point a retired or serving two-star general to head this wing, he added.
The minister noted that paramilitary and civil armed forces including the Frontier Corps, Rangers, Pakistan Coast Guard, Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts and newly established Federal Constabulary that fall under the administrative control of his ministry were involved in counterterrorism and counter-insurgency operations across Pakistan.
 
 

“There is a need for smooth coordination of the civil armed forces department with all stakeholders to improve delivery, efficiency, and end the pendency,” he said, explaining that several options were being considered including the appointment of a retired or serving major general to head this department.
He made it clear that such an appointee would work under the interior secretary and would have nothing to do with the working of other departments of the ministry, which deal with internal security, immigration and anti-corruption.
He said that the necessity of a federal force had arisen, which paved the way for the conversion of the Frontier Constabulary into a nationwide ‘Federal Constabu­lary’. He assured that the decision would have no impact on the personnel already serving in the force.

Death toll
Friday’s death toll includes three casualties each in Lahore and Chiniot, two in Okara and one each in Chakwal and Sargodha, according to data released by Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad.
In Chakwal, bodies of two persons who were swept away in torrents were recovered on Friday, while another died after being crushed under a roof which caved due to intense downpour, according to Rescue 1122.
The district was one of the worst-affected areas as it received record rainfall over the last three days. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif is expected to visit the district today.
According to Rescue 1122, the body of Tassaduque Hussain, who was swept away on Wednesday night in Saruli torrent near Pinwal village, was recovered near Chak Malook village on Friday noon.
The body of Abdul Rasheed, 42, who was also swept away by gushing water, was also recovered on Friday evening.
Separately, Muhamad Zubair, 36, was sleeping in a room near Aara village when a falling rock hit the roof, causing it to cave. Zubair died at the spot while the two other persons were injured.
Meanwhile, scores of villages in Chakwal were still plunged into darkness as the power supply could not be restored even after three days.
According to Iesco, 99 high tension and 48 low tension poles and 65 transformers were damaged due to intense rainfall.
Iesco Superintendent Engineer Waheed Ahmed Abbasi told Dawn it would take at least 48 hours to fully restore the power supply.

• Law introduced to meet EU’s GSP+ conditions requiring limitation of death penalty to the ‘most serious crimes’
• PTI leader slams govt over ‘poor’ disaster response
ISLAMABAD: A bill seeking to abolish the death penalty for harbouring hijackers and for publicly stripping a woman of her clothes was among the four bills passed by the Senate amidst voices of dissent from both sides of the aisle.
The Criminal Laws Amendment Bill, aimed at aligning Pakistan’s laws with its international obligations under the GSP+ trade agreement with the European Union (EU), which requires limiting capital punishment to the most serious crimes, was moved in the House by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry.
The bill proposes the replacement of the death penalty under Sections 354-A and 402-C of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) with life imprisonment.
Currently, Section 354-A states: “Whoever assaults or uses criminal force against any woman, strips her of her clothes, and exposes her in public shall be punished with death or life imprisonment, along with a fine.”
PTI’s parliamentary leader in the Senate Barrister Syed Ali Zafar remarked that the crime of stripping a woman in public is as serious as murder and stressed that death penalty for this offence should remain unchanged.
Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir questioned whether the death penalty for terrorism would be abolished.
Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) lawmaker Samina Mumtaz Zehri observed that the laws concerning crimes against women should be made stricter, not lenient. She warned that easing punishments would embolden criminals. She pointed out that the conviction rate in such cases is already low due to weak prosecution, and emphasised the need for reforms in the police and judicial systems.
“This is not right. This is not going to help the country or its people,” she said, opposing the amendment.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, however, argued that harsh sentences did not necessarily deter crime. He cited the example of European countries where death penalty did not exist, yet the crime rate ws just 2pc.
He added that in Pakistan, the death penalty currently applied to over a hundred offences. He noted the punishment for stripping a woman in public was originally seven-year imprisonment, and was converted to capital punishment during the regime of Gen Zia in 1982.
The Senate also passed the Extra­dition (Amendment) Bill to address procedural delays in extradition requests, and the Pakistan Citizen­ship Act (Amendment) Bill, enabling Pakistani diaspora members to resume their Pakistani citizenship.
Poor disaster response
Meanwhile, the government came under fire in the Senate over what was described as a lack of preparedness that led to loss of lives and immense suffering during the recent rains.
Speaking on a point of public importance, PTI’s Barrister Ali Zafar said: “The loss of precious lives and the severe hardships faced by the people due to the recent rains are a clear indication of the government’s unacceptable negligence and incompetence.”
He stressed that this was not the first instance. Despite early warnings from the meteorological department about the monsoon’s arrival, government institutions were not prepared.
He noted: “Roads and neighbourhoods were flooded, people were forced to spend nights on rooftops, and the state machinery remained a silent spectator. This wasn’t just a natural disaster — it was a failure of governance.”
He raised critical question is there any effective system in place at the government level to deal with emergencies or not? The people go through the same ordeal every year, and the government makes the same old promises and explanations every year.
He urged the chair that the House should be told: “Where were the NDMA and the provincial institutions? where was the emergency plan? what steps were taken to improve the electricity, water and sanitation systems? Why was immediate assistance not provided to the victims?
Mr Zafar demanded a comprehensive report on the government’s response to the rains and called for the formation of a special parliamentary committee to investigate the matter and suggest reforms to prevent such negligence in the future.
He concluded: “It is not only the right of those who lost their lives, but the constitutional and moral responsibility of the state to protect the life, property, and dignity of every citizen. For God’s sake, don’t wait for the next disaster. Reform now so that no mother is forced to search for her child in floodwaters again.”
In response, the Deputy Chairman, who was presiding over the session, said a detailed discussion on the matter would be held on Monday, as several motions were scheduled.
However, Ali Zafar pressed again: “Deputy Chairman Sahib, the time for debate is over. Don’t wait — act now. Decide on the proposed committee.”
The chair stated that it was not only the responsibility of the federal government but also of the four provincial governments to act during such emergencies. As other members stood to speak, the chair concluded the session, citing the approaching time for Friday prayers.

An FIR registered with the Dunga Bunga police on Thursday alleged that a local cleric of Maharwali village invited a 15-year-old of the same area to the mosque on July 16 through a text message. There, the FIR alleged, the cleric started lewd acts with him and incited the boy to commit sexual acts.  
Afterwards, the cleric allegedly grabbed the victim by the arm and took him to a room next to the mosque and started sexually harassing him. However, he fled when some passersby reached the scene after hearing the hue and cry of the boy, it added. 
In another incident, the B Division police claimed to have arrested two men who allegedly gang-raped a tailor after inviting him to their outhouse on the pretext of giving him measurements in Chishtian. 
The police said the two men from Purani Chishtian invited an 18-year-old tailor to their residence on Thursday and took him to an empty place near the house. There, the police alleged, the men repeatedly raped the victim and also snatched his mobile phone during the act. 
Police said all three men had been arrested on Friday while they were trying to flee from the area. They had confessed to their crimes during the investigation, the police said.
