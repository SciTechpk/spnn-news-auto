First, the burden on compliant taxpayers is spiralling higher and higher every year, with a marked acceleration in the preceding three years. Second, dollar-buying by the State Bank is continuing with unchecked ferocity, leaving behind little for the rest and starving private markets.
Both these phenomena are symptoms of a single problem: a state apparatus that can no longer generate the resources required for its own upkeep. In short, this relentless tightening of conditions in the economy, despite the much-vaunted stabilisation that has taken place, reflects the erosion of the underlying financial and economic viability of the state, and by extension, of Pakistan’s economy. As presently constituted.
These last three words are key, because it is equally important to remind ourselves that it does not have to be like this. But for the time being it is. And the problem is going to aggravate with time.
Just consider two stories from the week thus far. On Tuesday, a well-connected group of business leaders from Lahore and Karachi met with the army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, to convey their concerns about the ramped-up powers being given to the FBR, particular the powers of arrest.
 
 

“The delegation presented a comprehensive overview of the challenges faced by the industrial sector” their press release said following the meeting, “with particular emphasis on the recently enacted expansions of the Federal Board of Revenue’s powers”.
The expansion in powers refers to the powers of arrest that the FBR enjoys, which have been strengthened in the latest budget. Other things came under discussion too, but the press release suggests this was the primary reason for the visit, while the opportunity was used to also convey other concerns regarding interest rates and power tariffs.

The relentless tightening of conditions in the economy reflects the erosion of the underlying financial and economic viability of the state.

The second story, published in this paper, points to an enduring dollar shortage that has gripped financial markets in Pakistan for a number of months now and refuses to go away. And on Wednesday, a statement was released by Malik Bostan, the head of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan, announcing that on Tuesday he met with the ISI in which they were asked to explain why the rate of the dollar has been rising in the open market in recent days.
In his response, Bostan blamed the black market operators, saying their hand is strengthened the more the state clamps down on exchange company operations in the formal sector. Meanwhile, the shortages in the banking system persist despite rising inflows into the country in the last fiscal year.
Initially, a few months ago, we were told this shortage exists because of delays in the rollover of some Chinese debt obligation. But those rollovers were secured by the end of June, and another $1.5 billion secured through loans from two Middle Eastern commercial banks, and government sources confirmed to news reporters that their IMF-mandated target for foreign exchange reserves by end June 2025 had been met.
Then came news that remittances posted a record high (they post a record high almost every year so not a big deal really), but more importantly, the current account posted a surplus of $2.1bn whereas the IMF programme had projected a deficit of $200 million. Foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank were projected by the Fund to be around $13.9bn by end FY25. They came in at $14.5bn instead, higher by $600m.
So, if the external sector of the economy has performed better than expected, and foreign currency reserves are even higher than what they were projected to be, why is there still a shortage of dollars in the financial markets? Why are black markets springing up, and pressures mounting in the open market to the point? One answer is that all the dollars flowing into the country from high remittances and ‘resilient exports’ are being bought up by the State Bank, leaving behind little for private players. And the open market, which is also fed by remittances and foreign currency brought in by travellers from abroad (as per their own telling anyway), is finding black market customers for foreign currency at higher price points and therefore preferring to keep a growing share of their transactions there as opposed to the regulated market, where they are compelled to sell dollars at a rate agreeable to their friends in Pindi. As a result, reserves are outperforming their projections while private market players wonder aloud where all the dollars are going. “I am surprised why the State Bank has tightened the market so severely when it has already met the IMF target,” a story published in this paper quotes a market analyst as saying.
Why indeed? The government over-performed on fiscal and external sector metrics in FY25, and they waste no opportunity to remind the rest of us of what a great achievement this is, to have stabilised the economy following the epic upheavals that wracked it post-2021. But yet here we are. The hunger for dollars continues, the hunger for revenues leaves the state famished despite having not just met but blown past some key targets in the Fund programme, and this hunger drives them to press harder and harder on financial markets and compliant taxpayers to extract more and more from them.
This is not going to end by itself. It will continue like this because the pressure for resources — fiscal and FX in this case — is not coming only from the need to meet IMF programme targets. It is in significant measure also coming from the need to rearm following the recent war with India. But in very large measure, the pressure is mounting because the failure to reform the system over the preceding years has yielded a rigid economy that cannot meet the emerging requirements of a growing economy. Until those reforms or an external bailout come, these pressures will only keep mounting.

The FC was therefore tasked with protecting the settled area against incursions from the tribal area; it did so remarkably well and created a barrier between chaos and order — not of stone or iron but of blood and bone. The British, wise to the ways of empire, only recruited from among these sons of the soil to harness the strength of tradition. Thus, the FC was designed as a shield, a tribal force on the threshold of settled territory. It was not merely a force of containment, it was also a bridge between statecraft and tradition.
After Partition, the FC’s role underwent a quiet transformation. No longer merely the guardian of the frontier, it was summoned to the heart of the republic to restore order amid unrest; to aid the people in times of flood and fire, and to serve as the federal arm of protection and restore order.
In August 2022, I wrote a column in this newspaper about redefining the role of the FC. With time, the FC’s role had practically converted it into a federal law-enforcement force that was deployed all over Pakistan. Since it was commanded by police officers, its deployment side by side with local police posed no problem and it blended perfectly with the civilian police instead of working as a parallel force under a different command.

FC restructuring strikes a careful balance between tradition and modernity.

Every civilian government has valued the need for a federal force to deal with internal security threats. But due to the unfortunate experience with the Federal Security Force, created in 1972 and disbanded by the military government that followed, no one was prepared to initiate any proposal. In 2018, the then interior minister Ahsan Iqbal floated the idea of converting the FC into a federal force. However, no action was taken.
It is now that the government, realising the need for such a force, has decided to convert the Frontier Constabulary into the Federal Constabulary. The responsibility of preparing a proposal for restructuring the force was assigned to the present team of officers who have a profound respect for the Pakhtun tribal code of conduct. Their understanding of Pashtunwali enables them to preserve the tribal strength and spirit that have long defined the force, while shaping it into a modern security institution — one that draws its resilience from age-old customs but adapts to contemporary needs.
Their discipline is not imposed, it is inherited. Their loyalty is not bought, it is sworn. Where others rely on uniform and oath, the FC is strengthened by the enduring vows of ghairat (honour), nang (dignity), and badal (revenge) — concepts misunderstood by the foreign mind but recognised in the Pakhtun heart.
In response to today’s security challenges, while preserving the legacy of the Frontier Cons­tabulary, an imaginative and pragmatic restructuring plan has been proposed. The proposal carefully protects the unique architecture of the FC by ensuring its continued role as a distinct and vital component of the new federal force.
To enhance operational efficiency, improve command and control and streamline deployment, two new supervisory tiers have been introduced: the Company, comprising three platoons, and the Wing, consisting of five companies. This structural refinement will strengthen coordination and field effectiveness. Initially, six new wings are being raised against reallocated vacancies of the existing strength, with additional ones to be raised as and when required in the future. Substantial financial resources will be provided to upgrade infrastructure and weapons to deal with emerging challenges.
The new organogram envisions two divisions within the federal force: the Security Division, which will include the existing FC and focus on security and counterterrorism operations; and the Federal Reserve Division, which will undertake riot control and special protection duties. This division will be recruited on a nationwide basis according to a defined provincial quota system. The headquarters of the overarching federal force will remain in Peshawar, upholding historical continuity. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Division will have its headquarters in Islamabad, under the command of a deputy inspector general of police.
This restructuring strikes a careful balance between tradition and modernity. It ensures the preservation of the FC’s proud heritage of tribal valour and sacrifice, while creating a national-level federal force equipped to respond to emerging security demands. Furthermore, the decision to retain police command over the entire structure through legislation reinforces civilian ethos and oversight of this unique force.
By grounding the new federal force in both tradition and professionalism, this visionary reform not only dispels misconceptions surrounding its creation but also enhances the federation’s ability to uphold law and order within federally administered territories while providing support to the provinces upon request. Importantly, the powers granted to the federal force under the law are applicable strictly during active deployment. The legislation does not authorise the force to engage in parallel policing or exercise powers outside the scope of its assigned duties.
Yet, for this vision to be fulfilled, the FC must be given what it has earned — formal recognition as a civilian federal force, free from politicisation, with operational autonomy and fixed tenures for its senior leadership. It must not be swallowed up by larger formations, nor reduced to a mere auxiliary force. It must stand on its own — as a proud symbol of a federation that understands and honours its limitations.
On a personal note, I take the liberty of sharing my long and cherished association with the Frontier Constabulary — a force that I have had the distinct honour to serve in some of the most challenging moments of our national history. In 1995, I had the greatest privilege of all — to lead this remarkable force as its commander. What I witnessed throughout was a spirit that defies defeat: men always ready to stand their ground, to fight to the last man, and to execute orders without hesitation — even at the cost of their own lives. The FC is not just a law-enforcement unit; it is a symbol of courage, discipline and unflinching loyalty.

Two separate ATCs on Tuesday handed down wholesale convictions and lengthy jail sentences to several political leaders and party workers for delivering ‘provocative’ speeches, engaging in rioting, and acts of vandalism seen on May 9, 2023.
Instead of providing closure, however, these verdicts will add more fuel to the ongoing political instability. Critics say the cases were prosecuted without believable testimony or tangible evidence tying the individuals to their crime, and will fall apart when taken to higher courts. This would be nothing new. Pakistan has a long and chequered history of political leaders being tried on serious charges like murder, treason, sedition and anti-state activities, only to be absolved by the passage of time. Politicians who have languished for years, even decades, in jail cells have later returned to lead governments and shape policy. Many are in the ruling coalition today.
Political matters are rarely settled in courtrooms. More often, they are judged not by jurists but by ordinary people, who scrutinise not just the accused but also those who bring the accusations. This is why the May 9 cases should have been handled with more care. There was no need, for example, for cases involving political speeches and political violence to be sent to anti-terrorism courts. Prosecuting them under standard criminal laws would have sufficed.
Instead, the state preferred the optics of treating political dissent as terrorism. It also decided that the trials would be held in camera, giving the public more reason to doubt their fairness. If it had ‘irrefutable evidence’ and ‘undeniable testimonies’ against the accused, as it claimed, it should have shared these with the public. Instead, justice was never ‘seen’ to be done because of how the trials were conducted, and suspicions will continue to linger regarding how these convictions were secured.
For two years, the suspects held in connection with various May 9 cases have remained in custody, repeatedly denied bail, awaiting the outcome of the cases against them. Even the verdicts delivered by the Lahore and Sargodha ATCs might have been further delayed had the Supreme Court not set a deadline for concluding all such cases. It can only be hoped that subsequent proceedings will be open to the public, allowing observers to form an independent opinion on them.
Meanwhile, it appears that Pakistan has been dragged back into a political maelstrom from which it has been struggling to escape. Those at the helm must come to terms with the one lesson that has remained unchanged through the decades: they may silence their critics momentarily with court judgements, but it is the people who ultimately deliver political verdicts. The sooner they realise this, the better it will be for the country.

According to the Henley Passport Index for 2025, Pakistan currently ranks 96th on the list — ahead of the war-torn nations of Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.
Although still quite low, the country’s ranking has improved slightly; in 2024, the Pakistani passport was tied with Yemen as the fourth-worst in the world for the fourth consecutive year.
The Henley Passport Index compares the visa-free access of 199 different passports to 227 travel destinations, and ranks all the world’s passports based on the number of destinations their holders can enter without a prior visa.

Singapore, Japan and South Korea top the list; Afghanistan placed at the bottom

If no visa is required, then that passport is given a score value of 1. The same applies if you can obtain a visa on arrival (VOA), a visitor’s permit, or an electronic travel authority (ETA) when entering the destination.
Where a visa is required, or where a passport holder has to obtain a government-approved electronic visa (e-Visa) before departure, a score with value of 0 is assigned. This also applies if you need pre-departure government approval for a visa on arrival.
The total score for each passport is equal to the number of destinations for which no visa is required.
Singapore occupies the top spot, with Japan and South Korea sharing second place on the index. Seven EU passports share 3rd place — Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Spain.
Another seven-nation Euro­pean cohort are joint 4th — Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, Neth­erlands, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. Meanwhile, New Zealand is tied for 5th place with Greece and Switzerland.
The UK and US have each dropped a place in the global passport rankings since January, continuing a long-term downward trend. Once the most powerful passports in the world — the UK in 2015 and the US in 2014 — they now rank 6th and 10th, respectively.
India has recorded the largest jump in ranking over the past six months, climbing eight places from 85th to 77th. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has made the biggest gain in visa-free access.
The UAE continues to be a standout among the top risers, shooting up 34 places over the last 10 years from 42nd to 8th place, making it the only big riser to break into the Top 10 in the ranking.
Another notable country is China, also rising 34 places from 94th to 60th since 2015 — particularly impressive considering that it has not yet gained visa-free access to Europe’s Schengen Area.

• Journalist, family among 100 more killed in strikes
• Over 100 aid, rights groups say mass starvation is spreading in Gaza
GAZA: Israel’s President Isaac Herzog visited the Gaza Strip on Wednesday and told soldiers that there were “intensive negotiations about returning” the Israeli prisoners in Gaza, adding that he hopes that they will soon “hear good news”, a statement from the Israeli president’s spokesperson reported.
In a related development, the Palestinian group Hamas submitted its response to an Israeli proposal for a 60-day Gaza ceasefire on Wednesday, according to two Palestinian sources familiar with ongoing talks in Doha.
The response included proposed amendments to clauses on the entry of aid, maps of areas from which the Israeli army should withdraw, and guarantees on securing a permanent end to the war.
Negotiators from both sides have been holding indirect talks in Qatar with mediators in an attempt to reach an agreement on a truce deal.
But the talks have dragged on for more than two weeks without a breakthrough, with each side blaming the other for refusing to budge on their key demands.
For Israel, dismantling Hamas’s military and governing capabilities is non-negotiable, while Hamas demands firm guarantees on a lasting truce, a full withdrawal of Israeli troops and the free flow of aid into Gaza.
The United States said special envoy Steve Witkoff would head to Europe this week for talks on Gaza, and might visit the Middle East afterwards.
Witkoff was departing with the “strong hope that we will come forward with another ceasefire as well as a humanitarian corridor for aid to flow, that both sides have in fact agreed to”, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce said.
Journalist among 100 killed
Meanwhile, freelance journalist Wala al-Jaabari, her husband and their five children, were among more than 100 people killed in 24 hours of Israeli strikes or gunfire. The journalist’s family went to bed hungry at their home in Gaza City. Their corpses lay in white shrouds outside their bombed home on Wednesday with their names scribbled in pen. Blood seeped through the shrouds as they lay there, staining them red.
“This is my cousin. He was 10. We dug them out of the rubble,” said Amr al-Shaer, holding one of the bodies after retrieving it.
Iman al-Shaer, another relative who lives nearby, said the family had not eaten anything before the bombs came down. “The children slept without food,” he said.
Relatives said some neighbours were spared only because they had been out searching for food at the time of the strike.
More die of starvation
Ten more Palestinians died overnight from starvation, the Gaza health ministry said, bringing the total number of people who have starved to death to 111, most of them in recent weeks as a wave of hunger crashes on the Palestinian enclave.
In a statement on Wednesday, 111 organ­isations, including Mercy Corps, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Refugees International, said mass starvation was spreading even as tons of food, clean water and medical supplies sit untouched just outside Gaza, where aid groups are blocked from accessing them.
Israel has cut off all supplies to Gaza from the start of March and reopened it with new restrictions in May.
The United Nations and aid groups trying to deliver food to Gaza say Israel, which controls everything that comes in and out, is choking delivery, and Israeli troops have shot hundreds of Palestinians dead seeking aid at aid collection points since May.
“We have a minimum set of requirements to be able to operate inside Gaza,” Ross Smith, the director of emergencies at the UN World Food Programme.

• Proposes six-point plan, including immediate ceasefire, aid access, reconstruction, and two-state solution
• Palestinian envoy highlights starvation deaths of children, mass destruction across occupied territory
• US envoy urges Hamas to accept ceasefire deal; Israeli envoy says no more visas for UN officials
WASHINGTON: Presi­d­ing over a charged debate at the UN Security Council on the worsening situation in Gaza, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar warned that the world is witnessing “a genocide in Gaza, in full view of the international community — one that the UN seems unable or unwilling to stop.”
The Security Council session on the Middle East saw urgent calls from many representatives to end the violence and protect civilians trapped in Gaza. The crisis is deepening with growing displacement, food shortages, and widespread destruction.
Senator Dar told the Council that the systematic targeting of hospitals, schools, UN facilities, aid convoys, and refugee camps in Gaza were not accidents but “deliberate acts of collective punishment.”
“The Palestinian question is a litmus test for the credibility of the United Nations, the Security Council and the integrity of the international law,” he said. “Failure to uphold the rights of the Palestinian people will embolden impunity and undermine the legitimacy of the very international order we all claim to uphold.”
 






Six-point plan
The foreign minister proposed a six-point plan to end the crisis, including: (1) an immediate and unconditional ceasefire; (2) sustained and secure humanitarian access and protection for aid workers; (3) renewed international support for UNRWA; (4) an end to forced displacement and illegal settlements; (5) implementation of an Arab-Islamic-led plan for Gaza’s reconstruction; and (6) a revived political process for a two-state solution based on pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.
He welcomed the International Conference on the two-state solution, scheduled for July 28 in Paris and to be co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, as a crucial step toward peace.
“Gaza has become graveyards for innocent lives,” he warned, adding: “The Palestinian question is a litmus test for the credibility of the United Nations, the Security Council and the integrity of the international law.”
He emphasised that “failure to uphold the rights of the Palestinian people will embolden impunity and undermine the legitimacy of the very international order we all claim to defend and uphold”.
‘Unimaginable suffering’
Palestinian Permanent Observer Riyad Mansour delivered a searing statement, describing the unimaginable suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. He began by saying: “I speak with a broken heart and a wounded soul.”
He recounted the recent deaths of a four-year-old girl, Razan, and a six-week-old baby, Yousef, who died from starvation, alongside fifteen others, within the past 24 hours. “Children in Gaza are not starving, they are being starved,” he said.
Mr Mansour accused Israel of destroying everything: homes, schools, mosques, churches, hospitals, water networks, roads, infrastructure, cemeteries, and even aid convoys. He said 80 per cent of Gaza’s population has been forcibly displaced and warned that Israel’s end goal was “the destruction of the two million Palestinians remaining in Gaza.” He urged the Security Council to act, warning that “every day you delay action, you sign more death warrants.” He concluded by asking the world: “What would you do if this was your child dying of hunger?”
Israel to turn away UN workers
Israel’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Danny Danon, defended his government’s actions, anno­uncing that Israel will no longer renew the visas of certain UN humanitarian staff in Gaza. He claimed that hundreds of United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) employees are being vetted for alleged links to Hamas, and that “key personnel” will be denied visa renewals.
Danon said Israel had informed the UN that the head of OCHA’s office in the occupied Palestinian territory must leave by July 29.  “Enough with the hypocrisy, enough with the bias, enough with the endless defamation campaign against the State of Israel,” he said.
He dismissed UN casualty figures and statistics on aid delivery as distortions. “Israel is making the Middle East safer for everyone who values peace and calm,” he claimed, adding that “we are doing the work of the United Nations” by dismantling terror networks.
Khaled Khiari, Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific, updated the Council on the scale of destruction, reporting nearly 1,900 Palestinians killed since June 30, including nearly 300 while collecting aid. He said Israeli bombardments have damaged or destroyed UN facilities and displaced tens of thousands of civilians. He called Gaza “a nightmare of historic proportions.”
Denmark’s Permanent Representative, Christina Markus Lassen, condemned the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, noting that the population has been squeezed into “less than 14 per cent of the territory.” She warned that for many civilians, “their reality is one of imminent death by hostilities, starvation or disease.”
Russia’s delegate accused the United States of “cowboy diplomacy” and warned that unconditional US support for Israel was blocking peace. He said lasting stability would never be achieved unless Israel accepted the two-state solution and learned to live peacefully with its neighbors.
‘Accept deal on the table’
Meanwhile, Acting US Ambassador to the United Nations Dorothy Shea appealed to the UN Security Council today, insisting that “Hamas must accept the deal on the table”—a ceasefire proposal already agreed upon by Israel. She asserted that any delay risks further suffering for hostages, their families, and civilians in Gaza living under Hamas’s control.
During the session, Shea urged global leaders to apply pressure on Hamas to release the 50 prisoners still held after more than 650 days and to withdraw and disarm from Gaza. “Shielding Hamas from accountability undermines Israel’s security, rewards terrorism, and does nothing to improve the lives of Palestinians,” she declared.
Shea also firmly rejected accusations that Israel’s military actions constitute genocide. “The loss of civilian life in Gaza is tragic, but the responsibility for this rests with Hamas,” she stated. On the subject of Palestinian displacement, she clarified that the US does not support any forced removal of Gazans from their land.

• Rules that infertility, even if present, is no ground to deny woman dower or  maintenance
ISLAMABAD: The Supr­e­me Court on Wednesday denounced the distressing and sorrowful social practice of ‘weaponising’ infertility, or even the mere suspicion of it, against women.
“This social prejudice routinely results in courts of law becoming venues for humiliating a woman under the guise of litigation,” regretted Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi.
The CJP, who was part of a two-judge bench alongside Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, was remarking on a case filed by one Saleh Muhammad against a March 3, 2025, judgement of the Peshawar High Court (PHC), regarding a dispute over dower claims, dowry articles and maintenance of the respondent, Mehnaz Begum.
“This court cannot but record in the strongest possible terms its disapproval of the manner in which the respondent — a woman already abandoned, denied maintenance and left to the mercy of litigation — was subjected to repeated, invasive and demeaning scrutiny of her very personhood at the behest of a frivolous and cruel defence,” Justice Afridi bemoaned.
Saleh Muhammad and Mehnaz Begum married in 2006, but in 2007, the woman was left at her parental home after allegedly enduring physical abuse at the hands of the petitioner.
The husband then went abroad, severed all communication, refused to provide maintenance and effectively abandoned her within a year of their marriage. Three years later, he remarried and has two children from that union.
Left with no other recourse, Mehnaz Begum initiated legal proceedings in 2015 for the recovery of her dower, dowry articles and maintenance.
No ground to challenge ‘womanhood’
Rather than contesting the claim on any credible grounds, the petitioner pursued a defence alleging the respondent was medically unfit for conjugal duties or to bear children, thus questioning her status as a “female” under the law. This claim was rejected by subsequent medical tests, but the petitioner continued to deny her dower and maintenance on this basis.
“While it is possible that the petitioner viewed this as a genuine grievance or felt wronged in some manner, the manner in which this allegation, targeting the very identity of the respondent, was pursued remains troubling,” the Supreme Court noted.
“It was pressed persistently and aggressively through three tiers of judicial scrutiny, unnecessarily so given that all forums rendered findings effectively refuting it, thereby subjecting the respondent to what this Court recognises as profound personal humiliation,” it added.
In the seven-page order, the CJP emphasised that it must be acknowledged without equivocation that infertility, even if present, was no ground to deny a woman her dower or maintenance and it was certainly no ground to challenge her womanhood.
“To convert such personal pain into a legal weapon is not only an abuse of the process, but an affront to human dignity that should not be enabled,” he said.
“It also bears emphasis that our religion and culture treat the marital bond as a sacred covenant. The Holy Quran has described the spouse as a garment; the relationship between a husband and wife is likened to that of libaas in our religion,” the CJP said, stressing that the ideals of protection, mutual respect and dignity in marriage must not be compromised in any event.
“Lest we forget: women in our society constitute a vulnerable group, whose dignity requires vigilant protection and care,” he observed.
Fine to be paid to ‘wronged’ woman
The courts could not, and would not, be passive venues for the perpetuation of social prejudices that harm women and subject them to one trauma after another, CJP Yahya said.
“It is not a matter of judicial discretion but of constitutional and moral obligation that the personal dignity of all who appear before the courts be duly safeguarded, particularly where the power imbalance between the parties is so manifest,” he added.
The CJP said that in the present case, the petitioner has not merely wasted judicial time, he has caused a woman already in a position of vulnerability to suffer degradation and trauma over the course of protracted litigation in three forums spread over a decade. “This court would be remiss in its duty were it to allow such conduct to pass without sanction,” he said.
The court dismissed the petition and imposed a Rs500,000 fine, payable to the respondent, as a show of strong disapproval for the petitioner’s conduct.
“It is hoped this order serves as a reminder to all litigants and counsel that the dignity of every individual, particularly women, must be respected in all judicial proceedings,” the CJP noted, adding that frivolous allegations attacking the dignity of a woman would not be countenanced in any court of law.

• Secretary claims production declined despite increase in cultivation area; no buffer stock exists
• Minister warns mills, says hoarding won’t be tolerated; crackdown underway
ISLAMABAD: As a nationwide crackdown on sugar hoarders is underway, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has raised serious concerns over mismanagement in the sugar sector, loan defaults by mills, and large-scale irregularities involving public institutions.
During its sitting on Wedn­esday, National Food Security Secretary Amir Mohyuddin revealed that although the area under sugarcane cultivation increased this year, overall production had declined compared to the previous year.
Out of 82 registered sugar mills, only 79 participated in the crushing season, which typically begins in November. The secretary admitted that Pakistan currently has no buffer stock of sugar, and a summary has been sent to import 500,000 tons, of which 300,000 tons are already planned.
Committee members, particularly Riaz Fatyana and Junaid Akbar, criticised what they descr­ibed as a “massive sugar cartel” that manipulates supply and prices.
Mr Fatyana asked why 7.5 million metric tons of sugar were allowed to be exported, alleging it was done to artificially inflate local prices.
He also questioned the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for issuing a Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) that reduced the sales tax on sugar imports. “This export was designed for profiteering,” he claimed.
PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan condemned the influence of sugar barons, stating, “These mill owners are part of every government. Why is the International Monetary Fund (IMF) silent on their profiteering?”
He questioned why tax exemptions were given to sugar importers while the general public was denied relief. FBR officials responded that the tax exemption was a cabinet decision and the board acted on official instructions.
MNA Naveed Qamar argued that the government should refrain from intervening in the sugar market. “Every time the government steps in, things get worse. Bureaucracy cannot run markets,” he said, adding that two main cartels — sugar and fertiliser — continue to operate without oversight.
MNA Shazia Marri demanded a report detailing how much subsidy was granted to sugar mills over the past five years and identifying the top beneficiaries. The committee also expressed dissatisfaction with the composition and transparency of the Sugar Advisory Board and directed the Ministry of Industries to attend the next meeting and clarify decisions related to sugar export and import, as the Ministry of Food Security claimed it had no access to that data.
But despite the government’s best efforts, the sugar crisis persists. In this backdrop, Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain warned all sugar mills that are not releasing their existing stocks and hoarding them, will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
In a meeting with representatives of the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and other key stakeholders, he directed provincial governments to ensure the timely lifting of sugar from mills and to facilitate its smooth transportation to markets.
He stated that a nationwide crackdown is currently underway against those disrupting the sugar supply chain. Expressing serious concern over the artificial increase in sugar prices, the minister warned of strict action against hoarders.
Meanwhile, a press release from the Ministry of National Food Security noted that sugar prices have started to decline significantly—from Rs200 per kilogram to Rs175 per kilogram—as a result of the government’s crackdown.

GILGIT: Thousands of people, including foreign tourists, remai­ned stranded at multiple locations in Gilgit-Baltistan due to blocked roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), due to landslides. Mobile and internet services across the region were also disrupted after fibre optic cables were damaged in several areas.
Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq confirmed that KKH is blocked at Achar Nallah in the Kohistan district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Thousands of passengers, including tourists, travelling to and from GB are stranded on both sides of the highway.
He said that while KKH has been reopened for traffic within GB, restoration work is underway in Kohistan. The Babusar Pass Road is also blocked at several locations.
Mr Faraq assured that all tourists stranded on the Babusar route have been safely evacuated and search operations for missing individuals are underway. Those rescued from Babusar Pass have been brought to Chilas, where local hoteliers and government authorities have arranged complimentary accommodation.
The mobile and internet communication systems in the region were severely damaged, leaving the majority of residents without service for up to six hours on Wednesday. The region’s communication system relies on an optical fibre cable connecting GB with Rawalpindi.
According to the Special Commu­nications Organisation (SCO), recent flash floods in Babusar Valley caused significant damage to the main optical fibre cable. Emergency alternative satellite arrangements were made, but consumers faced slow mobile and internet connectivity. Mr Faraq said that work has begun to restore the communication system.
Meanwhile, Deputy Speaker of the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly Sadia Danish expressed concern over the safety of 40 individuals stranded in Danyore’s Manogah Nallah in Gilgit. In a statement, she urged the government to initiate a helicopter rescue operation immediately.
Ms Danish emphasised tha protecting human lives should remain the top priority and recognised the efforts of the provincial government, the Pakistan Army, volunteers and residents in the rescue operations during the flood emergency.
She also commended the generosity of residents, who opened their homes, mosques, imambargahs and hotels to shelter stranded tourists.
Moreover, river erosion caused the collapse of the Hotu suspension bridge in Shigar, cutting off the only access to the K2 base camp. A large number of foreign expedition members and trekkers were stranded, while eight villages were also disconnected.
Officials from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said that a C130 sortie will be arranged from Gilgit to Islamabad to airlift stranded travellers.
Stranded tourists are expected to receive airlifts free of charge on Thursday (today) in an operation overseen by Gilgit’s additional deputy commissioner.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has assured that the rescue operations will continue until all stranded people in Babusar are rescued.
He also declared the flood-affected areas of Thaki, Niyat, Khunra and Thor in Diamer as disaster zones. He also announced that the families of those who died in the floods at Babusar will receive death compensation under the government policy.
The chief minister ordered urgent measures to restore drinking water, electricity, irrigation channels and road communications in the flood-affected areas of Thor. He also visited the flood-affected areas to oversee the recovery efforts along with Adviser on Forests Haji Shah Baig and GB Minister for Agriculture Engineer Anwar.

Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.
The monsoon death toll since the end of June surged to 234, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA). Heavy rains triggered flash floods in several districts of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, damaging homes and increasing water levels in rivers and streams.
Over the last 48 hours, Swat has recorded the highest toll as six children and one woman died owing to flash floods and a house collapsing, while a woman and child were injured, the KP PDMA report said.
Three people died in Buner, which experienced heavy rain with thunder and lightning. A woman and her child died in a thunder strike, while an eight-year-old boy was swept away. “The dead body has been recovered by the locals,” the PDMA said.
Incidents caused by heavy rains in Bajaur claimed the lives of a man and a child. The victims were brothers, aged 21 and five.
“Their mother was successfully rescued while the bodies of both brothers were recovered,” the PDMA quoted the Bajaur Deputy Commissioner’s Office as saying.
Per the report, a woman also died in Upper Kohistan, while a child was injured in Torghar as heavy rains caused a roof to collapse. A total of 19 houses had been damaged due to the heavy downpour, out of which two were completely destroyed and 17 sustained partial damage.
“The current spell of heavy rains is likely to continue intermittently until July 25,” the report said.
“The PDMA has already sent a letter to all district administrations to take precautionary measures in view of the weather situation, and has directed that relief activities be intensified in affected districts to provide immediate relief to all victims,” it said.
The authority directed that all tourists be apprised of the weather and to take precautionary measures.
“The public should contact the free helpline 1700 for any untoward incident, weather situation updates and information,” the report added.
On Monday, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur directed the district administration to remain on high alert after forecasts indicated more monsoon rains in the province.
He instructed all relevant departments to take precautionary measures to deal with potential risks such as floods and landslides.
A day earlier, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.
All tourists stranded on Babusar Highway rescued
All tourists who were stranded on the Babusar Highway have been rescued and are currently in Chilas city, according to Gilgit-Baltistan spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.
He said the search operation for those who were missing is still ongoing.
“The Karakoram Highway has been closed again at one or two points, which has left thousands of travellers stranded at various places across the highway,” Faraq said.
He noted that local private hotel owners, as well as the government, have arranged for free accommodation for tourists.“
Work is underway to restore the Silk Road up to Bisham, Faraq said.
He added that GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan would visit the affected area of ​​Babusar Highway today to personally review the damage caused by flooding and see the problems faced by tourists.
The spokesperson also said that the chief minister will issue important orders regarding flood disasters and rehabilitation of the victims.
Road link between Jhelum and Pind Dadan Khan being restored
Meanwhile, Jhelum Deputy Commissioner (DC) Syed Meisam Abbas told Dawn.com that the suspended road link between Jhelum and Pind Dadan Khan tehsils was being restored on an urgent basis due to the collapse of the bridge between Darapur and Bhumbar towns.
The newly constructed bridge was swept away during last week’s flash floods in Jhelum district.
DC Abbas said that a steel bridge at Banaahn Nullah was nearing completion, with engineers working day and night to restore the road link on the Lillah-Jhelum road.
The officer said that during the recent flash floods, the Banaahn Nullah had sprawled to the width of eight kilometres, while at normal flooding, its breadth was recorded as hardly 1km. The officer said that the change in its course also inundated the residential areas of Chotala, Bhumbar, Shahpur and Darapur, while scattered farmhouses and localities were also affected, and the residents were evacuated safely.
The deputy commissioner said that the recently constructed bridge was also swept away and and the direct road link for all sorts of traffic was suspended.
He further said that the Punjab highways department and the district administration decided to put in place a steel bridge for light transport to restore linkage for the public. The DC said the bridge would be opened soon for crossing the nullah only for light vehicles.</p><small>2025-07-23 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2400000667342b6.jpg?r=000609' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926082/worlds-top-court-paves-way-for-climate-reparations' target='_blank'><strong>World’s top court paves way for climate reparations</strong></a><br><p>The world’s highest court on Wednesday declared that states are obligated under international law to tackle climate change and warned that failing to do so could open the door to reparations.
In a historic ruling, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said climate change was an “urgent and existential threat” and states had a legal duty to prevent harm from their planet-warming pollution.
Countries breaching their climate obligations were committing a “wrongful act”, the court said in its advisory opinion, which is not legally binding but carries significant moral, political and legal weight.
“The legal consequences resulting from the commission of an internationally wrongful act may include … full reparations to injured states in the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction,” said ICJ President Yuji Iwasawa on behalf of the 15-judge panel.
This would be on a case-by-case basis where a “sufficient direct and certain causal nexus” had been shown “between the wrongful act and the injury”, the court added.
Historically, rich, industrialised countries have been responsible for the majority of emissions. Iwasawa said these countries had to take the lead in addressing the problem.
Campaigners and countries on the climate frontlines hailed a milestone moment in the fight for accountability from big polluters most responsible for global warming.
Ralph Regenvanu, the climate change minister for Vanuatu, the small Pacific island nation which spearheaded the case at the Hague, was jubilant.
Speaking to AFP outside the court, Regenvanu said it was “a very strong opinion at the end” and better than hoped.
“We can use these arguments when we talk with our partners, some of the high-emitting states. We can say you have a legal obligation to help us,” he said.
“This helps us in our arguments. It’s going to give us a lot more leverage … in all negotiations.”
Catalyst for change
This was the biggest case in ICJ history, and seen as the most consequential in a recent string of landmark climate rulings.
The United Nations had tasked the 15 judges at the ICJ, a UN court in the Hague that adjudicates disputes between nations, to answer two fundamental questions.
First: What must states do under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions for the future?
Second: What are the consequences for states whose emissions have caused environmental harm, especially to vulnerable low-lying island states?
In a detailed summary of the opinion, Iwasawa said the climate “must be protected for present and future generations”.
The adverse effect of a warming planet “may significantly impair the enjoyment of certain human rights, including the right to life”, he added.
 
 

Legal and climate experts said the opinion, while not legally binding, could have far-reaching consequences for national courts, legislation and public debate.
“The court’s clear and detailed articulation of state obligations will be a catalyst for accelerated climate action and unprecedented accountability,” David Boyd, a former UN special rapporteur on human rights and the environment, told AFP.
Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said the ruling bound all nations by international law to prevent harm from emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.
The court was “pointing the direction for the entire world and making clear that every nation is legally obliged to solve the climate crisis”, he told AFP.
Classroom to court
Courts have become a key battleground for climate action as frustration has grown over sluggish progress toward curbing planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels.
The Paris Agreement, struck through the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), has rallied a global response to the crisis, but not at the speed necessary to protect the world from dangerous overheating.
The journey to the Hague began six years ago with students from the climate-imperilled Pacific region fed up with the lack of accountability for the damage afflicting their homelands.
The fight pitted major wealthy economies against the smaller, less developed states, which are most at the mercy of a warming planet.
More than 100 nations and groups made submissions in the Hague, many from the Pacific who gave impassioned appeals in colourful traditional dress.
“It’s such a perfect ending to a campaign that started in a classroom,” said Vishal Prasad, director of the student-led campaign that kicked off the case.
“We have now a very, very strong tool to hold power accountable, and we must do that now. The ICJ has given everything possible,” he told AFP in the Hague.
John Kerry, the former US special envoy for climate change, told AFP, “It should not take the stamp of international law to motivate countries to do what is already profoundly in their economic interests.
“We shouldn’t need another reason to act and accelerate action.”
 
 

The ruling could also make it easier for states to hold other states to account over climate issues like pollution or emissions.
“The court can affirm that climate inaction, especially by major emitters, is not merely a policy failure but a breach of international law,” said Fijian Vishal Prasad, one of the law students who lobbied the government of Vanuatu in the South Pacific Ocean to bring the case to the ICJ.
Although it is theoretically possible to ignore an ICJ ruling, lawyers say countries are typically reluctant to do so.
“This opinion is applying binding international law, which countries have already committed to,” Chowdhury said.</p><small>2025-07-23 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23224035be8362d.jpg?r=224228' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926094/zubair-habib-reappointed-as-cplc-chief-for-3-year-term' target='_blank'><strong>Zubair Habib reappointed as CPLC chief for 3-year term</strong></a><br><p>The first meeting of the newly established Executive Council of Citizens-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) reappointed Zubair Habib as the head of the CPLC for the next three years, it emerged on Wednesday.
He previously served as CPLC chief as well, being appointed in October 2015 when its board accepted the resignation of former chief Ahmed Chinoy and appointed Habib in his place.
“The Sindh home minister in consultation with the executive council directed the CPLC chief Zubair Habib to continue his position,” said an official statement issued today.
Habib told Dawn.com that previously, the CPLC worked under the police rules. The Sindh Assembly had passed the Police Act in 2019 under which the CPLC was declared as a statutory body, under which its new configuration was required.
Previously, the Sindh governor was the head of the advisory council, but now the home minister would be its chairman. Similarly, the home minister would be the head of the executive council, whose members included the home secretary, law secretary, inspector general (IG) of police, public safety commission secretary and the CPLC chief.
The operational head of the CPLC would be its chief, who would be nominated by the Executive Council (EC). Habib said it was the first meeting of the EC, which appointed him as the CPLC head for the next three years.
The meeting also appointed five members from the private sector. They included former additional IG Saleem Vahidy, businessman Ziad Bashir, Advocate Qurban Ali Malano, Panjwani Foundation chairperson Nadira Panjwani and businessman Saqib Sheerazi. The participants of the meeting also established a “finance committee” and Shabbar Malik was appointed as deputy chief of the CPLC for operations.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar gave instructions to submit recommendations for increasing financial help to the CPLC for the financial year of 2025-26.
Lanjar said Sindh was the only province where the CPLC had been established and worked successfully. He termed it as an example of “public-private partnership for fighting against crimes and redressing grievances of the people”.
The minister directed the CPLC chief to expand its network in upper Sindh, saying that the provincial government would help in the provision of its office and resources.
In September last year, retired Justice Nazar Akbar tendered his resignation from the office of the CPLC EC chairman in protest over the “illegal” continuation of the CPLC chief for the past five years without any official notification from the home department.
The former judge of the Supreme Court and the Sindh High Court had sent his resignation letter, along with detailed reasons behind his decision, to the chief minister. According to the letter, Justice Akbar had informed the chief minister that Habib was continuing to “illegally” hold the office for the last nine years for the third consecutive term.</p><small>2025-07-23 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/232321227187d34.jpg?r=232212' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926087/lower-kurram-and-sadda-tribes-sign-year-long-peace-agreement' target='_blank'><strong>Lower Kurram and Sadda tribes sign year-long peace agreement</strong></a><br><p>The tribes of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower Kurram and Sadda regions signed a peace agreement on Wednesday for a year in a jirga held at the Sadda Frontier Corps Fort that was attended by many local notables.
In March, tribal leaders in Kurram district came to terms on an eight-month peace agreement ahead of Eidul Fitr. Violence stemming from decades-old land disputes had claimed at least 130 lives in the fragile district, with multiple efforts to establish peace between tribes. A ceasefire agreement was reached following months of conflict in January.
Kurram Deputy Commissioner (DC) Ashfaq Khan, who chaired the jirga, told Dawn.com that after a long law and order situation in the district, the efforts of the administration, security forces, police and tribal leaders brought positive results and “a peace agreement was signed between the local tribes of Lower Kurram and Sadda for a year.”
The jirga was held at Sadda FC Fort between prominent tribal chiefs of the Ahle Sunnat and Tori Bangash tribes, including the participation of the additional DC, officers of the Security Forces Police and assistant commissioners.
DC Khan said the tribal elders inked the agreement in the light of the Kohat agreement, and all conditions of that agreement were to be considered.
He said the tribal leaders declared the move a “milestone for regional stability” and hoped for progress and long-standing peace. They also applauded the security forces, police and administration’s role and acknowledged their efforts, he added.
The residents of Topki, Sameer, Gosar, Amal Kot, Gharbena, Sangena, Kandezar, Mengak, Tangay, Manda, Marokhel and the suburbs of Lower Kurram and from Sadda, Kochi, Sateen, Shasho, Darani, Per Qayum, Sakhi Ahmad Shah, Mala Kaly, Chakai Kaly, Jan Haji Kaly, Malak Mulajan Kaly, Arawaly, Marokhel, Lower Mandori and adjacent areas signed the agreement unanimously.
On the occasion, DC Khan said the establishment of peace in the Hussain and Jamil valleys of Kurram district was possible only with the cooperation of regional elders, and the immense sacrifices of the security forces for peace in the region were highly commendable. He added that more steps would be taken for peace.
At least 10,000 personnel of the army, police and other agencies performed security duty during Muharram in Kohat division, with the restive Kurram district handed over to the army due to a slew of sectarian killings in the past.</p><small>2025-07-23 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/231321025cbef82.png?r=142848' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926052/imrans-sons-meet-trump-aide-to-kick-off-us-campaign-to-free-father' target='_blank'><strong>Imran’s sons meet Trump aide to kick off US campaign to free father</strong></a><br><p>Incarcerated PTI Founder Imran Khan’s sons met with United States President Donald Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell on Tuesday as they kicked off a campaign calling for their father’s release from prison.
Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 — called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the US before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
Grenell, US special presidential envoy for special missions — known for publicly calling for Imran’s release — posted on X that he had met with Sulaiman and Kasim in California, urging them to “stay strong”.
“There are millions of people around the world who are sick of political prosecutions. You are not alone.”
 






Imran’s sons also met with Dr Asif Mahmood, a Pakistani American physician who has been playing a key role in the PTI’s campaign to win over Americans.
Dr Mahmood, vice chairman of the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), shared a picture showing he also met with Grenell, along with the ex-premier’s sons.
“Immense pride for [Kasim] and Sulaiman Khan for their bravery in fighting for their father, former prime minister Imran Khan’s freedom,” he said.
He also praised Grenell for “standing for justice and principle” and called for unity to free the PTI founder.
 






In December 2024, after Trump won the presidential elections, Grenell had made a series of statements and tweets over a few weeks, including a viral “Free Imran Khan!” post on X.
He sharply criticised the policies of ex-president Joe Biden’s administration toward Pakistan, particularly its handling of the country’s missile programme and Imran’s imprisonment. Subsequently, Pakistan’s political and diplomatic machinery in the US had also ramped up efforts to engage with the new Congress.
“Getting the ear and voice of Richard Grenell, a key Trump insider, was crucial,” Shuja Nawaz, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, had said in January.
 
 

Last week, during a congressional hearing on Pakistan, Republican Congressman Christopher H. Smith suggested that the US Congress may soon urge Trump’s administration to consider imposing sanctions on countries that suppress religious freedom and violate human rights.
Speakers at the hearing, also attended by PTI’s Zulfi Bukhari, discussed the rights situation in Pakistan. Democratic Congressman James McGovern stressed the need to engage and talk “about political prisoners, the future of Imran Khan … but also how you do it”.
Notably, there have been increased positive engagements between Washington and Islamabad, with an unprecedented meeting between Trump and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir in June and the US hailing the country as a “phenomenal partner” in counterterrorism.
 
 

Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s son, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said today while speaking on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ that the meeting would “practically have no result” even though it might net symbolic gains for the party.
He questioned what, if any, role Imran’s sons would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them and visas would be issued “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.
Previously, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had told Dawn.com that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Malik also said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
There were conflicting statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p><small>2025-07-23 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2318402460886dc.jpg?r=184032' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926067/pakistan-ready-for-meaningful-dialogue-with-india-pm-shehbaz-reiterates-in-talks-with-uk-envoy' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ready for ‘meaningful dialogue’ with India, PM Shehbaz reiterates in talks with UK envoy</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated Pakistan’s willingness for a “meaningful dialogue” with India on all outstanding issues, state media Radio Pakistan reported.
The April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, sparking a military confrontation between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
Pakistan previously invited India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution.
During a meeting with British High Commissioner Jane Marriott today, PM Shehbaz appreciated the UK’s role in de-escalating tensions during the Pakistan-India standoff and reiterated that Pakistan was ready for a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues.
He welcomed the British government’s decision to resume PIA flights to the UK. He said, “This [decision] would go a long way in alleviating the hardships faced by the British-Pakistani community as well as enhancing people-to-people exchanges,” while appreciating the role of the high commissioner.
Both sides discussed the “positive trajectory” of bilateral relations. The prime minister said that the recently held trade talks between the two countries would lead to mutually beneficial opportunities for both sides. “Pakistan is also cooperating closely with the UK at the UN Security Council, where Pakistan currently holds the monthly Presidency,” he said.
Marriott briefed PM Shehbaz about her recent visit to London, where she had extensive consultations on enhancing bilateral ties.
She lauded the Pakistani government’s recent economic performance which brought about a significant improvement in key macroeconomic indicators. She also discussed the UK’s perspective on regional developments in South Asia and the Middle East.
 






Last week, UK’s government launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
The announcement came just a day after the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
UN envoy hits back at India for cross-border terrorism claims
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s envoy to the UNSC, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, rejected Indian allegations of cross-border terrorism and asked India to change its behaviour, instead of resorting to its “tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting”, during the UNSC debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” on Tuesday.
The Indian envoy was reacting to Deputy PM Dar’s speech in New York during the reception hosted for Pakistan’s presidency of the UNSC, where the latter underscored the need for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.
“It is India which actively sponsors, aids and abets terrorism in my country and beyond,” Ambassador Jadoon, deputy permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the 15-member body on Tuesday evening, while responding to allegations made by India’s UN Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish.
“Rather than being blinded by hubris and a misplaced sense of impunity, and instead of resorting to its tired narrative of victimhood and blame-shifting, India must introspect seriously, change its behaviour and comply with its international legal obligations on all counts,” he said, in the debate convened by Pakistan to promote pacific settlement of disputes between nations.
Ambassador Jadoon said that it was especially regrettable that the Indian ambassador targeted Pakistan yesterday, when earlier in the day, the council “spoke with a unanimous voice to reaffirm the purposes and principles of the UN charter and the imperative of peaceful settlement of disputes, respect for international law and effective implementation of the resolution of the security council”.
The Pakistani envoy pointed out that firstly, India was in illegal occupation of the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
“While claiming to abide by the UN charter, and purportedly the principle of peaceful settlement of disputes, India has been in violation of security council resolutions on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, and has refused to implement those resolutions, thereby denying the Kashmiri people the exercise of their inalienable right to self-determination,” he said.
“India’s egregious violations of human rights which extend beyond the occupied territory of Jammu and Kashmir and encompass its appalling treatment of minorities has been widely reported by international human rights organisations,” Jadoon added.
He also said that India had “stooped to a new low” of unilaterally and illegally holding in abeyance the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, with the stated aim of depriving the people of Pakistan of water from the Indus river system.
“In gross violation of international law, India resorted to blatant aggression against my country between 7-10 May, targeting civilians, including women and children,” the ambassador said.
He highlighted Pakistan’s “befitting but measured response” in accordance with its right to self-defence, aimed exclusively at military targets, that resulted in the downing of six Indian aircraft that took part in the aggression, among other significant military losses.
“The hostilities came to an end owing to Pakistan’s position of strength and responsible approach, and facilitation of the US, as also highlighted in the statement of the US this morning, “ Jadoon told the delegates.
“It is ironic that India, which itself brought the Jammu and Kashmir dispute to the security council, refuses to implement the resolutions adopted by the council to peacefully resolve this dispute,” he added.
 






Obviously stung by the success of Pakistan’s signature event at the council, the Indian envoy had claimed that Pakistan was “steeped in fanaticism and terrorism”, and a “serial borrower from the International Monetary Fund”.
The debate will resume on July 24 to listen to the remaining speakers, after listening to scores of high-level representatives.</p><small>2025-07-23 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23200831a8b83f8.jpg?r=200851' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926084/british-families-receive-wrong-remains-of-air-india-plane-crash-victims-report' target='_blank'><strong>British families receive ‘wrong remains’ of Air India plane crash victims: report</strong></a><br><p>Families in the United Kingdom have received the “wrong remains” of victims of an Air India plane crash last month, which left 260 people dead, according to a media report on Wednesday.
The families are suffering “fresh heartache because the remains of their loved ones were wrongly identified before being flown home”, British publication The Daily Mail reported.
It said relatives of one of the victims had to abandon “funeral plans after being informed that their coffin contained the body of an unknown passenger rather than their family member”.
In another case, the “commingled” remains of more than one person killed in the crash were mistakenly placed in the same casket, it added.
A lawyer representing several families and UK media said relatives of a British victim received a casket that contained mixed remains. The family of a separate victim received the remains of another person, according to James Healy-Pratt, who is representing 20 British families who lost loved ones in the disaster.
Healy-Pratt told the Press Association news agency that the return of victims’ remains had been marred by serious errors, which had been identified following a probe by a British coroner.
“In the first two caskets that were repatriated, in one of the caskets, there was co-mingling of DNA which did not relate to the deceased in that casket or the casket that accompanied it,” he said.
The lawyer added the coroner was then “able to determine that one particular loved one was not at all who the family thought they were”.
Miten Patel, whose mother Shobhana Patel died along with her husband in the disaster, told the BBC that “other remains” were found in her casket after her body was returned to Britain.
“People were tired and there was a lot of pressure. But there has to be a level of responsibility that you’re sending the right bodies to the UK,” he told the broadcaster.
The Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said it has been “working closely with the UK side from the moment these concerns and issues were brought to our attention”.
MEA spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said in a post on X today: “In the wake of the tragic crash, the concerned authorities had carried out identification of victims as per established protocols and technical requirements. All mortal remains were handled with utmost professionalism and with due regard for the dignity of the deceased.”
He added: “We are continuing to work with the UK authorities on addressing any concerns related to this issue.”
 






The UK-bound plane slammed into several buildings on June 12 after crashing in western Gujarat state.
Among the passengers were 169 Indian nationals, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese and a Canadian.
One passenger survived the crash after he jumped out of the plane.</p><small>2025-07-23 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615443-pakistans-death-toll-from-monsoon-devastation-tops-250' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's death toll from monsoon devastation tops 250</strong></a><br><p>

The two countries were once one nation but split following a bloody civil war, which saw the territory previously referred to as ‘East Pakistan’ seceding to form the independent nation of Bangladesh. In the years since the split between Pakistan and Bangladesh, Dhaka’s leaders — especially the ousted regime of Sheikh Hasina — stayed firmly in the Indian camp, preferring to maintain close ties with New Delhi and keeping Islamabad at arm’s length.
However, ever since a popular uprising that saw Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year, with the deposed premier fleeing to her old ally India, there has been a thaw in ties between the two capitals, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
In May, Bangladesh High Commissioner to Pakistan Iqbal Hussain Khan said that the visa regime between Pakistan and Bangladesh was being eased for the business community to foster economic growth in the region.
Today’s development came during a visit of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Bangladesh, where he met Home Minister retired Lieutenant General Jahangir Alam Chowdhury in Dhaka.
Naqvi was presented with a guard of honour before the two sides began discussions.
During the meeting, the two ministers held wide-ranging talks on bilateral issues and matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on strengthening cooperation in internal security and law enforcement.
“Significant progress on visa-free entry for diplomatic and official passports during the meeting. Pakistan and Bangladesh make a principled decision to provide visa-free entry facility for diplomatic and official passports,” said a statement from the interior ministry.
 






Both sides expressed a strong desire to deepen collaboration in key areas, including counter-terrorism, combatting drug trafficking and preventing human smuggling.
The ministers also discussed plans to exchange training programmes between police academies, aiming to improve professional capacity and technical expertise.
Chowdhury thanked Naqvi for offering support in police training and described the visit as an “important milestone” in advancing ties between the two countries.
“I wholeheartedly welcome my brother upon his arrival in Dhaka. Your visit is of great importance for the promotion of Pakistan-Bangladesh relations,” he said.
To follow up on the decisions taken during the meeting, both sides agreed to form a joint committee with Interior Secretary Khurram Agha leading the Pakistani side in this coordination effort.
The committee will oversee implementation of the agreed initiatives and explore further avenues for cooperation.
As part of the growing partnership, a high-level delegation from Bangladesh is expected to visit Islamabad soon to study the Safe City Project and tour the National Police Academy.</p><small>2025-07-23 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/231834312e365a2.png?r=183628' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926068/fm-dar-urges-cooperative-diplomacy-over-confrontation-amid-growing-global-turbulence' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar urges cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing global turbulence</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called for an inclusive dialogue and cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing turbulence across the world during his United States visit on Wednesday.
Dar arrived in New York on Monday to attend “high-level signature events” of Pakistan’s United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency, including a conference on Palestine.
Addressing a reception today hosted by Pakistan’s Mission in New York on the occasion of Pakistan’s UNSC presidency, Dar stressed: “We believe that global peace and security can only be achieved through multilateralism, peaceful settlement of disputes, inclusive dialogue, and respect for international law.”
The deputy PM pointed out: “At the core of Pakistan’s foreign policy is our firm commitment to multilateralism and the United Nations.
“The purposes and principles enshrined in the UN Charter, especially peaceful settlement of disputes and non-use or threat of force are foundational to the UN. They are indispensable for a just international order,” he added.
 






The deputy PM asserted that Pakistan’s leadership has been guided by “these very principles in both deliberations and concrete actions taken during its tenure”.
“This is a time of growing turbulence in the world, where the costs of unresolved disputes, long-running conflicts, unilateral actions, and disregard for international law are being felt in every region of the world,” Dar noted.
Dar’s remarks came as Pakistan holds the presidency of the UNSC this month. Pakistan assumed the UNSC presidency for July, marking its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.
The UNSC unanimously adopted Pakistan-sponsored Resolution 2788 yesterday, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.
Dar also announced Pakistan was seeking a seat at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the 2026-2028 term, with the Asia-Pacific Group endorsing its candidacy. Pakistan last held the membership from 2020 to 2023.
“Our engagement with the Human Rights Council is guided by the values of truth, tolerance, mutual respect, consensus-building, and engagement,” he said, expressing the hope for broad international support.
 
 

Speaking to diplomats, UN officials and representatives of member states at the Pakistan Mission, Dar outlined three priorities that Pakistan will focus on during its UNSC presidency.
He described the peaceful settlement of disputes, a core principle of the UN Charter, as “too often sidelined” and highlighted the need to bring it back to the centre of the council’s work.
He stressed the importance of revitalising “We see multilateralism not as a slogan, but as a necessity,” Dar said.
“The Security Council must be seen not only as a chamber of reaction but as a forum of prevention, problem-solving, and principled leadership,” he asserted.
He then detailed Pakistan’s third priority — enhancing cooperation between the UN and regional organisations, particularly the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
Dar stated that a UNSC briefing with the OIC was scheduled for July 24, highlighting the 57-member body’s vital role in global peacebuilding.
 
 

Reaffirming Pakistan’s active diplomatic engagement, the deputy PM said the country remained committed to working with partners around the world to advance the shared goals of peace, development, and human rights.
“Pakistan is a leading voice in the global climate and development discourse — from the General Assembly to the UN Ecosoc (Economic and Social Council) and elsewhere,” he noted.
He highlighted Pakistan’s leadership in global climate and development discourse and reiterated its support for strengthening the UN’s three pillars: peace and security, development, and human rights.
Concluding his address, Dar urged the global community to rise above divisions. “In a world facing deepening divides and mounting challenges, we must choose cooperation over confrontation, and diplomacy over force.
“Pakistan stands ready to work with all of you to advance these common goals,” he affirmed.</p><small>2025-07-23 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2318300414a731a.png?r=192459' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926080/balochistan-couple-murder-quetta-atc-extends-tribal-leaders-physical-remand-by-10-days' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan couple murder: Quetta ATC extends tribal leader’s physical remand by 10 days</strong></a><br><p>A Quetta anti-terrorism court on Wednesday extended the physical remand of tribal leader Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai, one of the main suspects in the ‘honour’ killing of a man and a woman, for 10 more days.
The viral video of the murder showed a group of men leading a couple out of vehicles and into a desert before gunning them down with pistols and shooting the bodies. Political figures and activists said it was an ‘honour’ killing incident. Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said on Sunday that he had directed the provincial police to take immediate action, following which one suspect was apprehended.
Sardar Satakzai is one of the main suspects in the case and was presented before the Quetta ATC on Monday before being handed over to the Serious Crimes Investigation Wing  (SCIW) on a two-day physical remand on the judge’s order upon the police’s request.
He was presented in the ATC today before Judge Muhammad Mubeen, who accepted the police request and granted Satakzai’s physical remand for another 10 days, handing him over to the SCIW.
Separately, a video statement of the woman’s mother emerged today in which she defended the incident and said it occurred as per local custom and tradition. She said the decision was taken by a jurga and Satakzai had no role in it, calling for his release.
The Pakistan Ulema Council (PUC) strongly condemned the mother’s statement, declaring it contrary to Islamic teachings, as well as the Constitution and law.
The PUC said the remarks suggested that the murder was committed with the consent of the parents, a revelation it termed “deeply disturbing and unacceptable”.
The PUC declared that it was the responsibility of the state, law enforcement agencies, the Balochistan government and the provincial judiciary to take firm action against all those facilitating the perpetrators.
It categorically rejected the parents’ justification, stating that it violated Islamic principles and the Constitution.
Terming the incident both condemnable and tragic, the PUC called for a comprehensive investigation and stressed that justice must be served without delay or negligence. It urged the state to fulfil its constitutional and moral duty by ensuring that all those responsible were brought to justice.
 






PUC Chairman Tahir Ashrafi further said that the parents did not have the right to forgive the killers or kill their own children.
 






In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.</p><small>2025-07-23 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23141321e899e9a.jpg?r=141326' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926056/19-year-old-girl-dies-in-coma-after-alleged-marital-rape-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>19-year-old girl dies in coma after alleged marital rape: Karachi police</strong></a><br><p>A 19-year-old girl in Karachi’s Lyari succumbed to her injuries after an alleged marital rape at the hands of her husband, police said on Wednesday.
Earlier this month, the newlywed girl was admitted to Civil Hospital Karachi in critical condition after allegedly enduring “brutal sexual violence” from her husband, who was arrested by the police.
The victim was in a coma and her physical examination findings were “consistent with sexual violence”, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed had stated.
“The rape victim, 19, passed away at the trauma centre of the Civil Hospital Karachi at 10:45am today,” Syed said today.
She was admitted to the trauma centre in a “critical condition”, having undergone a surgical procedure at another hospital, she added.
“Her initial findings were positive for sexual violence,” she said.
The police surgeon told Dawn.com that the hospital informed police and family to conduct a post-mortem examination of the body and was waiting for their response.
Baghdadi police Station House Officer Majid Alvi also confirmed her death to Dawn.com.
He said that the girl got married on June 15. “Two days later, the husband subjected her to sodomy” and assaulted her with a metal pipe, leading to deterioration of her health condition.
The brother of the victim had registered a first information report (FIR) at the Baghdadi Police Station on July 5 under Sections 324 (attempt to commit murder) and 376-B (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“On the third day of her marriage, my sister was subjected to brutal sexual violence allegedly by her husband. She remained admitted at a private hospital in the city and was later taken to Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre of Civil Hospital Karachi in a critical condition the other day,” the FIR read.
In the FIR, the complainant said his 19-year-old sister married the suspect on June 15. Her health condition deteriorated on June 30, compelling the family to bring her back home. She informed the parents that on July 17, her husband subjected her to an “unnatural sexual act”.
He said that the husband also sexually assaulted her with a foreign object. Subsequently, the husband subjected her to sexual violence, leading to bleeding. As per the FIR, the suspect threatened his wife with “dire consequences” if she disclosed anything to anyone.
 
 

Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
In May, two sisters were subjected to a sexual assault in their home in North Karachi, police and doctors had said.
In April, in a rare verdict, an additional district and sessions judge in Gujranwala handed down 10-year rigorous imprisonment to a man for subjecting his wife to an unnatural sexual offence.</p><small>2025-07-23 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23175339da02829.jpg?r=181345' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926053/swat-student-death-case-authorities-seal-madressah-police-return-students-to-families' target='_blank'><strong>Swat student death case: Authorities seal madressah, police return students to families</strong></a><br><p>Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Omar on Wednesday said that authorities sealed the madressah in Swat, where a student was killed earlier this week, and returned its other students to their parents.
A young student was allegedly beaten to death by his madressah teachers on Monday evening in Swat’s Chaliyar village, according to the police. He was rushed to the nearest hospital by students and teachers, but doctors declared him dead upon arrival.
Addressing a press conference in his office accompanied by Superintendent of Police (Investigation) Badshah Hazrat Khan, DPO Omar said: “When we came to know of this incident, we also thought to check with the other students studying in the madressah if there was any other case such as this or not. We sent our team to this madressah and when statements were taken from the children, it was found out that some others had been subjected to violence as well.”
Omar said police detained all madressah staff upon receiving this information with nine more taken into custody and a case registered on the police’s complaint under the Child Protection Act.
“Around 160 to 170 students were retrieved and we returned them safely to their families after contacting them and the madressah was sealed.”
He said investigations into any possible sexual assault were under way with samples taken, adding that the relevant section would be added to the first information report (FIR) on any confirmation.
DPO Omar said there were four suspects nominated in the FIR and two were subsequently arrested, with teams formed to trace and arrest the others.
“They will not be able to escape the law. We will arrest them as soon as possible,” he said of the absconding suspects.
He said the police took action immediately upon being alerted of the incident and the case was registered.
Omar said the items used to allegedly beat and bind the student were also recovered.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Khateeb Maulana Tayyab Qureshi strongly condemned the incident in a statement, saying that “the death of a student at the hands of a madressah teacher is the height of brutality.
“The elements involved in the incident should be severely punished. Such so-called reciters and teachers are a stain on the name of madressahs. The public should avoid admitting children to unregistered madressahs.”
He said the condemnation of the incident by the Wifaq-ul-Madaris was a positive development
“We will never allow brutality under the guise of religious education. Islam does not allow us to beat children. A teacher is not allowed to beat, regardless of their field. The government should take retribution from the teacher involved in the beating.”
Talking to Dawn.com, he reiterated his strong condemnation, saying no amount would be enough.
He demanded exemplary punishments for the culprits who were becoming a basis to defame religion and madressahs so that no one ever dared to commit such crimes, especially in regards to students and children.
Qureshi said students were the responsibility of madressahs to be taken care of, adding that such violence and treatment harmed students’ psyche and health. He also hailed the sealing of the madressah and the return of the students to their families.
He also appealed to ulema to ensure that violence and physical beatings did not occur at seminaries, saying that the law and religion did not allow it.
Under the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act 2010 and its 2018 regulations, corporal punishment is a punishable offence, violation of which can result in up to six months of imprisonment or a Rs50,000 fine, or both.
In May this year, the KP Private Schools Regulatory Authority, through a notification, strictly prohibited corporal punishment in all private schools across the province after receiving complaints.
Violations, however, continue to prevail. According to a recent report by the KP Child Protection and Welfare Commission, children across the province were subjected to 33 different forms of abuses, including 14 incidents of corporal punishment.
In April, a seminary teacher in Kasur was arrested for allegedly beating a student with a hot iron for not memorising his lesson at Bangla Kambovan.</p><small>2025-07-23 14:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615417-pakistani-passport-ranked-fourth-least-powerful-in-the-world' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani passport ranked fourth least powerful in the world</strong></a><br><p>

Bannu Police spokesperson Aamir Khan told Dawn.com: “Terrorists attacked a Frontier Constabulary checkpoint situated in the border area of Takhti Khel Wazir in Bannu.
“As a result of the attack, six personnel of the FC were injured, but the immediate response of the constabulary forced the terrorists to flee.”
Over a week ago, President Asif Ali Zardari promulgated an ordinance empowering the federal government to transform the FC, a border security force, into the Federal Constabulary.
 
 

Aamir added that the injured constables have been taken to the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu for treatment.
“Police teams have been sent to the area and have begun a search operation to track down the terrorists,” he said.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.
Attacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu this month.
A day ago, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was martyred when terrorists attacked him in the district while he was returning home from duty.
On July 21, over a dozen terrorists attacked a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.
On July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were injured when terrorists carried out a quadcopter attack on Bannu’s Miryan police station.</p><small>2025-07-23 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615411-imran-khans-sons-meet-trump-aide-grenell-amid-plans-to-join-pti-protest' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's sons meet Trump aide Richard Grenell ahead of PTI protest</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X, the state minister said the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — designated as a terrorist organisation by the United Nations and the United States — was operating its WhatsApp channels and sending bulk messages to “proliferate its violent/hateful ideology, to spread its harmful narratives, and for glorification of its terror activities”.
The state minister requested the international community and WhatsApp to “cooperate to help us fight this menace”.
“These accounts must be blocked and necessary algorithms created to auto-detect and auto-suspend such handles/numbers,” he added.
 






On Sept 1, 2010, the US designated the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation, while the UN imposed sanctions on the entity on July 29, 2011 due to its affiliation with al-Qaeda. The sanctions include asset freezes, travel bans, and arms embargoes.
Founded in 2007, the TTP has staged a large number of attacks across Pakistan, leading to a ban on the group on August 24, 2008. It remains on the National Counter Terrorism Authority’s (Nacta) list of proscribed organisations.
According to data from the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), during the height of its insurgency in 2009, the group carried out 2,586 terrorist attacks and 3,021 fatalities.  A large-scale military offensive launched in 2014 dealt a massive blow to the command and control structure of the group, dramatically reducing insurgent violence throughout Pakistan. Sporadic attacks targeting security forces, however, continued.
After holding several rounds of talks with the group, former prime minister Imran Khan’s government announced on November 8, 2022, that the group had agreed to a complete ceasefire. In November that year, however, the TTP called off the ceasefire, vowing to increase attacks on police and security personnel.
 
 

With the resurgence of the group, the country has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, mainly conducted by the TTP.
In July last year, the government designated the group as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan. In Islamic history, the term refers to the period of conflict and discord caused by the Khawarij, an early Islamic sect known for their extreme interpretations of Islam and their rebellion against established authority.
Pakistan ranks second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
In December last year, the Pakistan Army said it conducted 59,775 operations against terrorists.</p><small>2025-07-23 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/23172903a6d746a.png?r=173050' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926063/trump-announces-massive-japan-trade-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Trump announces ‘massive’ Japan trade deal</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump has announced a “massive” trade deal with Japan, as China said it will send its vice premier to US trade talks next week to secure its own agreement ahead of a looming deadline.
In an attempt to slash his country’s colossal trade deficit, the US president has vowed to hit dozens of countries with punitive “reciprocal” tariffs if they do not hammer out a pact with Washington by August 1.
The Japan agreement, along with another pact with the Philippines also announced on Tuesday, means Trump has now secured five agreements since his administration promised in April “90 deals in 90 days”.
The others are with Britain, Vietnam and Indonesia, which the White House said Tuesday would ease critical mineral export restrictions.
Negotiations are still ongoing with much larger US trading partners China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union.
Representatives from China and the United States will meet next week in the Swedish capital Stockholm to try and hammer out a deal before an August 12 deadline agreed in May.
As the clock ticks down, China said today it will seek to “strengthen cooperation” with Washington at the talks, and confirmed vice premier He Lifeng would attend.
Japan deal
“We just completed a massive Deal with Japan, perhaps the largest Deal ever made,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday.
He said that under the deal, “Japan will invest, at my direction, $550 billion dollars into the United States, which will receive [90 per cent] of the Profits”.
He did not provide further details on the unusual investment plan, but said it “will create hundreds of thousands of jobs”.
Japanese exports to the United States were already subject to a 10 per cent tariff, which would have risen to 25pc on August 1 without a deal.
 
 

Duties of 25pc on Japanese autos — an industry accounting for eight per cent of Japanese jobs — were also already in place, plus 50pc on steel and aluminium.
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said that the autos levy had now been cut to 15pc, sending Japanese car stocks soaring, with Toyota and Mitsubishi up around 14pc each. The Nikkei rose 3.5pc.
“We are the first (country) in the world to reduce tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, with no limits on volume,” he told reporters.
“By protecting what needs to be protected, we continued the negotiations with an aim to reach an agreement that meets the national interest of both Japan and the United States,” Ishiba added.
Rice imports
However, Japan’s trade envoy Ryosei Akazawa, who secured the deal on his eighth visit to Washington, said the 50pc tariffs on steel and aluminium would remain.
Akazawa also said increased defence spending by Japan — something Trump has pressed for — was not part of the agreement.
Trump said on Tuesday Japan has also agreed to “open their country to trade, including cars and trucks, rice and certain other agricultural products, and other things”.
Rice imports are a sensitive issue in Japan, and Ishiba’s government — which lost its upper house majority in elections on Sunday — had previously ruled out any concessions.
Japan currently imports 770,000 tons of rice tariff-free under its World Trade Organisation commitments, and Ishiba said it would import more US grain within this.
Ishiba said on Wednesday that the deal does not “sacrifice” Japan’s agricultural sector.
 
 

Tatsuo Yasunaga, the chair of Japan Foreign Trade Council, welcomed the trade deal announcement but said the business community needed to see details to assess its impact.
“I highly commend the fact that this major milestone has been achieved and dispelled the uncertainty that private companies had been concerned about,” Yasunaga said.
Naomi Omura, an 80-year-old voter, said it was “disappointing that Japan cannot act more strongly” towards the US.
Tetsuo Momiyama, 81, said that Ishiba “is finished … It’s good timing for him to go”.
Reports claimed on Wednesday that he aims to step down soon following the election debacle.
Eyes on the prize
Other major US trading partners are watching closely as the end of the month approaches.
The Philippines’ deal also announced on Tuesday only saw levies cut by one percentage point, to 19pc, after Trump hosted President Ferdinand Marcos. China on Wednesday said it supported “equal dialogue” following the announcement of the Japan-US deal.
Beijing and Washington imposed escalating, tit-for-tat levies on each other’s exports earlier this year, reaching triple-digit levels.
But in talks in Geneva in May, they agreed to lower them temporarily until August 12.</p><small>2025-07-23 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/231359034a6e734.png?r=140539' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926057/india-to-resume-issuing-tourist-visas-to-chinese-citizens' target='_blank'><strong>India to resume issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens</strong></a><br><p>India will resume issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens from July 24 this year, its embassy in China said on Wednesday, the first time in five years as both countries move to repair their rocky relationship.
Tensions between the two countries escalated following a 2020 military clash along their disputed Himalayan border. In response, India imposed restrictions on Chinese investments, banned hundreds of popular Chinese apps and cut passenger routes.
China suspended visas to Indian citizens and other foreigners around the same time due to the Covid-19 pandemic but lifted those restrictions in 2022, when it resumed issuing visas for students and business travellers.
Tourist visas for Indian nationals remained restricted until March this year, when both countries agreed to resume direct air service.
 
 

Relations have gradually improved, with several high-level meetings taking place last year, including talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Russia in October.
China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said on Wednesday that Beijing had noted the positive move.
“China is ready to maintain communication and consultation with India and constantly improve the level of personal exchanges between the two countries,” he said.
India and China share a 3,800-kilometre border that has been disputed since the 1950s. The two countries fought a brief but brutal border war in 1962 and negotiations to settle the dispute have made slow progress.
In July, India’s foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart that both countries must resolve border friction, pull back troops and avoid “restrictive trade measures” to normalise their relationship.</p><small>2025-07-23 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615408-pakistan-committed-to-working-with-global-partners-for-shared-goals-of-peace-dpm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan committed to working with global partners for shared goals of peace: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured by him before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court had already been upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The 47-page review petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed by Advocate Khawaja Haris on behalf of Zahir under Article 188 of the Constitution (review of judgments or orders by SC). The state and Noor’s father, Shaukat Ali Muqadam, were made the respondents.
 
 

The petition contended that the issue of Zahir’s alleged “unsoundness of
mind or mental capacity” that was raised before the SC in an application had not been addressed and was “given short shrift”.
It further said that “hype created on social media […] constantly created hatred towards the petitioner throughout the investigation and the trial (and even at appeal stage)”, which breached Zahir’s right to fair trial and due process.
“In [the] process of hurry, mistakes were made in the investigation and during trial,” the petition quoted a verdict from another case.
On the rape charges, the review plea argued that it was “apparent from the record that there is no evidence on the record in proof of this allegation”.
The SC had commuted Zahir’s death sentence on the rape charge to life imprisonment, as decided by the trial court, but did not acquit him of it. While he was acquitted of the 10-year sentence for kidnapping, a one-year term was handed down for wrongful confinement under Section 342 of the Pakistan Penal Code, according to the SC verdict.
Zahir’s review plea argued that the video recordings based on which the SC upheld the death sentence had not been proved during the trial and were not provided to any of the accused.
It said the apex court ruling was extensively based on video recordings stored in a digital video recorder (DVR) and on clips that the prosecution said were transferred from the DVR to a hard disk, providing the “most essential link in the chain of circumstances” on which the SC gave its verdict.
“Portions of these so-called recordings, on the basis whereof the inference of ‘last seen’ has been drawn against the petitioner, were never played during the trial, rather, only hearsay evidence thereof was led by the prosecution,” the plea stated.
The SC, in its detailed verdict, had stressed the significance of digital evidence by declaring that footage can be admissible as primary evidence under the “silent witness theory” — a rule of evidence that allows for photog­r­a­­phic video or other recorded evidence to be admitted as substantive proof of what it depicts, without the need for an eyewitness’s testimony.
 
 

Justice Muhammad Hashim Kakar, who led the three-member bench, observed that the silent witness theory of authentication had developed in almost all jurisdictions over the last 25 years to allow photos to substantively “speak for themselves”.
The SC had also noted that Zahir neglected to provide any explanation for the victim’s presence at his residence and the ensuing recovery of her body from the premises.
Zahir is also contemplating filing a mercy petition before President Asif Ali Zardari, with a letter by jail authorities seeking the formation of a medical board so its opinion could be included in the plea. A presidential pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution could provide Zahir pardon or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.
SC verdict
A three-member bench, led by Justice Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi, heard Zahir’s appeal against his death sentence.
The bench upheld Zahir’s death sentence handed by two courts previously over the murder charges under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the PPC.
However, it converted the IHC’s decision of a second death penalty over rape charges into a life sentence. The high court had turned Zahir’s 25 years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 376 of the PPC into a death sentence.
 
 

While the 10-year jail term for kidnapping in order to murder under Section 364 of the PPC was overturned, Zahir was handed one year of imprisonment for wrongfully confining Noor.
The apex court maintained the earlier orders to Zahir to pay Rs0.5 million to Noor’s legal heir.
The appeals of two co-accused — watchman Mohammad Iftikhar and gardener Jan Mohammad — against their 10-year sentences were also taken up by the SC.
The watchman and gardener’s sentences were reduced, with the bench deciding their detention so far was sufficient and allowing them to be released.</p><small>2025-07-23 08:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615368-noor-mukadam-murder-zahir-jaffer-files-review-plea-in-sc-against-death-sentence' target='_blank'><strong>Noor Mukadam murder: Zahir Jaffer files review plea in SC against death sentence</strong></a><br><p>
