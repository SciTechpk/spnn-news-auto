For centuries, travellers, merchants, and colonial administrators produced narratives that constructed this Himalayan valley as a mythical ‘Paradise of the Indies’ — a land of extraordinary beauty whose inhabitants, strangely, were deemed unworthy of it.
This paradox, celebrating the land while denigrating its people, did not die with colonialism. It found new life in the ideological project of Hindu nationalism, which has weaponised these orientalist tropes to justify the ongoing colonisation of India-Kashmir and the systematic othering of its Muslim majority.
The question of who belongs in Kashmir, and who gets to define it, has never been merely academic. It is a question written in blood, displacement, and the language of competing nationalisms.
Annexed by India in 1947 through the contested Instrument of Accession, Jammu and Kashmir was granted ’special status’ under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, a status effectively dismantled in 2019 amid heavily militarised conditions.
Today, as New Delhi strips Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and Bollywood produces films that either sanitise or demonise Kashmiri Muslims, tracing the genealogy of these representations becomes an urgent political task.
The colonial gaze and the ‘paradise’ myth
European fascination with Kashmir began with travellers like François Bernier, a French physician who accompanied Aurangzeb’s entourage to the valley in the 17th century. Bernier likened Kashmir’s mountains to Mount Olympus and its meadows to European gardens, “enamelled with our European flowers and plants, and covered with our apple, pear, plum”. The language of possession — ‘our’ fruits in ‘their’ land — reveals the European impulse to claim Kashmir as a distant reflection of itself, a space of familiarity amid the strangeness of the Orient.
This fascination with places and people perceived as similar to Europe created a substantial readership for travel writing as a genre. The European identity was affirmed through encounters with distant lands that could be made familiar, comprehensible, and available for appropriation.

 

As scholar Kim Phillips has argued, travel writing operates through a “referential pact”, whereby readers trust that their craving for knowledge about exotic places will be satisfied. These narratives became canonised over time, each new account building on previous ones, generating an ever-increasing interest in Kashmir.
This construction of Kashmir as a mirror of European beauty was paired with a troubling ethnographic curiosity about its people. George Forster, an East India Company employee who disguised himself as a Turkish merchant to enter the valley in the 1780s, described Kashmiris as possessing “stout, well-formed, European likeness”.
Other travellers went further, comparing Kashmiris to Jews — Europe’s internal other — and tracing their origins to the lost tribes of Israel. Charles von Hugel, an Austrian explorer, wrote in 1845 that Kashmiris had “almost Jewish features,” with their “white skin” and “colourless complexion” marking them as somehow out of place in the Subcontinent.
This preoccupation with denying Kashmiris their indigeneity — locating them elsewhere, whether in ancient Israel or in some European prehistory — served a colonial purpose. If Kashmiris were never truly native, then the land could be claimed, administered, and imagined by others. The beauty of the valley was severed from the people who inhabited it and made available for appropriation. As author Rafiq Ahmad in his study notes, such representations sought to attribute the creation of Kashmiri “traditions and customs to cultures more familiar to Europeans”, providing the civilisational basis through which orientalism continually reinforced its power and authority.
Yet alongside claims of ethnic kinship came harsh moral judgments. Edward Knight, a British officer who travelled through Kashmir in 1891, initially found Kashmiris “clever, cheery and civil”, before dismissing them as “among the most despicable creatures on earth, incorrigible cheats and liars, and cowardly to an inconceivable degree”.
William Moorcroft and George Trebeck, writing earlier in the century, described them as “selfish, superstitious, ignorant, supple, intriguing, dishonest and false”. The valley’s beauty, in this logic, was God-given and majestic; its people deserved no credit for it. Indeed, their very presence disrupted the Orientalist fantasy of Kashmir as an earthly paradise waiting to be discovered and possessed by more worthy inhabitants.
This aesthetic approach within colonial travelogues consistently portrayed the inhabitants as incompatible with their own topography. All anxieties around encounters with the unfamiliar were resolved by defining the European self through confrontation with the ‘other’.
For Phillips, travel and its associated cultural practices must be located within larger formations in which “inscriptions of power and privilege are made clearly visible”. The presence of Kashmiris was represented as an “unregulated threat” waiting to spill over, to effectively ruin Kashmir’s beauty — a sentiment that has persisted well beyond the colonial period.
Rewriting history: from Firishta to Hindutva
The orientalist framework did not merely produce aesthetic judgments; it rewrote history. As historian Manan Ahmed has shown, colonial scholars drew selectively on Persianate sources such as Muhammad Qasim Firishta’s Tarikh-i-Firishta, to construct narratives of Muslim tyranny and Hindu victimhood.
Firishta himself, writing in the early 17th century, presented a nuanced picture of Kashmir’s rulers — praising Zainul ’Abidin, for instance, for recalling exiled Brahmins, abolishing discriminatory taxes, commissioning translations of the Mahabharata into Persian, and patronising both Sanskrit and Persian literature. But colonial readings flattened this complexity, extracting episodes of religious conflict and presenting them as evidence of inherent Muslim despotism and “foreignness to Hindustan”.
Kashmir’s complicated history of invasions and rulers — from the Buddhist chief Rinchana who converted to Islam under Sufi instruction, to Shah Mir who established the first Muslim dynasty, to the Mughal emperors who built lavish retreats there, to the brutal Dogra rulers of the 19th century — was reduced to a simple morality tale.
The region that had produced Habba Khatun, who gave Kashmiri its literary form and encouraged the synthesis of Persian and Indian music, was recast as a site of eternal religious conflict. The European imperialist instinct demanded “extended and extensive ethnographic descriptions of the inherent oppression of Hindus at the hands of Muslims,” as Ahmed notes, and these descriptions were duly provided.
This selective historiography has found eager inheritors in the Hindu nationalist movement. For the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ideological parent organisations, Kashmir represents both a territorial claim and a civilisational wound.
The region is viewed through an India/Hindu versus Pakistan/Muslim framework, and its Muslim majority population is seen as evidence of historical injury against the ‘rightful’ Hindu inheritors of the land. The departure of Kashmiri Pandits from the valley in the early 1990s — a genuine tragedy deserving serious engagement — has been instrumentalised as proof of Muslim barbarism, disconnected from the complex political history of the armed insurgency, Indian military occupation, and Pakistani intervention that produced it.

 

In 2019, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared that “Kashmir humara hai” (Kashmir is ours) and promised to transform it into “swarg” (heaven) once again, he was drawing on centuries of representation that imagined the valley as a paradise stolen, corrupted, or held hostage by Muslim inhabitants. The rhetoric of restoration implies that its current population has somehow desecrated it, that their removal or subjugation is necessary for the land’s redemption. This is presented not as partisan ideology but as the “iccha” (wish) of 130 crore Indians, reflecting the national stake every citizen is encouraged to have in ‘protecting’ Kashmir.
From romance to revenge
Hindi cinema has served as a powerful vehicle for these narratives, translating political ideology into emotional spectacle.
For decades, India-held Kashmir functioned as Bollywood’s scenic backdrop — a place of snow-capped romance, safely depoliticised, its conflicts invisible. But as academic Julia Szivak has highlighted, the 1990s insurgency transformed Kashmir into a site of nationalist melodrama, where the “fight for survival of the Indian nation” was dramatised against the valley’s picturesque landscape. Kashmiri insurgents were portrayed as Pakistan-supported religious zealots, while heroes served as instructive guides establishing appropriate patriotic norms for Indian citizens.
Kunal Kohli’s Fanaa (2006) offers a relatively moderate version of this formula. Its Kashmiri heroine, Zooni, embodies ideal Indian citizenship: she salutes the flag, delivers patriotic speeches comparing Kashmir’s beauty to all of India, and ultimately sacrifices her love for her country by killing her militant husband to prevent a terrorist attack. The film distinguishes between ‘good’ Muslims — loyal, self-sacrificing, aligned with the state — and ‘bad’ Muslims whose desire for azadi (freedom) marks them as threats. It offers a conditional belonging: Kashmiri Muslims may be accepted if they perform their allegiance enthusiastically enough.

 

Vivek Agnihotri’s The Kashmir Files (2022) dispenses with such niceties. Claiming to expose the ‘truth’ of the Pandit exodus, the film presents Kashmiri Muslims as uniformly bloodthirsty, deceitful, and sexually predatory. Characters are named after Hindu deities — Krishna, Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu — anchoring their indigeneity to ancient mythology, while Muslims are depicted as foreign invaders. The film’s protagonist delivers a speech tracing Kashmir’s glory to pre-Islamic sages like Rishi Kashyap and Shankaracharya, describing the valley as the ‘Silicon Valley of the first millennium,’ before presenting its corruption as beginning with Muslim arrival — a narrative that mirrors colonial historiography almost exactly.
What’s striking is how these films reproduce orientalist tropes almost unchanged. The beautiful land defiled by unworthy inhabitants; the ancient civilisation destroyed by foreign invaders; the need for civilisation, order, and redemption from outside. The British claimed this role for themselves; Hindu nationalism claims it for the Indian state. The target remains the same: the Kashmiri Muslim, constructed as eternally alien, perpetually threatening, fundamentally incompatible with the paradise they inhabit.
The politics of paradise
To trace these representations is not to deny the genuine suffering of Kashmiri Pandits, nor to minimise the violence that has marked the valley’s recent history. It is, rather, to insist that this violence cannot be understood outside the longer history of how Kashmir has been imagined, claimed, and fought over. The ‘paradise’ myth was never innocent. From colonial travelogues to contemporary cinema, it has served to separate the land from its people, to make the valley available for possession by others.
Jawaharlal Nehru, himself a Kashmiri Pandit, described the valley in 1940 as “some supremely beautiful woman, whose beauty is almost impersonal and above human desire”. The feminisation of landscape and the language of desire and possession are tropes that have structured Kashmir’s representation for centuries.

 

As Emmanuela Mangiarotti argues, the Indian state has worked to fix a specific historical narrative through Kashmir that anchors “specific imaginings of community and the nation to a recognisable cultural repository”. Today, as the Indian state imposes unprecedented levels of military control, as communication blackouts silence Kashmiri voices, as demographic changes threaten to transform the valley’s character, these representations take on urgent political significance.
The question is not merely how India-held Kashmir has been represented, but whose representations count, whose stories are told, whose belonging is recognised. Colonial officers, Hindu nationalists, and Bollywood filmmakers have all claimed the right to define Kashmir, to determine who belongs there and on what terms. Kashmiri Muslims, however, have not just been passive observers, but have actively written back: in protests met with pellet guns, in poems circulated despite censorship, and in testimonies recorded before each communication blackout.
The orientalist tropes of the past, therefore, have found a new home in modern state policy and popular cinema. While the tools of representation have changed, they still rely on the old conviction that Kashmir’s landscape is a national treasure and its inhabitants, specifically the Kashmiri Muslims, are a threat to its perfection. The colonial equation remains intact: the land is everything, its people an inconvenience.</p><small>2025-12-26 07:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2612063791009ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963365/tajikistan-says-5-killed-in-armed-clash-on-border-with-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Tajikistan says 5 killed in armed clash on border with Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Five people were killed in an armed clash on the border between Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Tajik state media said on Thursday.
Citing a statement by the Border Troops of the Tajik State Committee for National Security, state news agency Khovar reported that three people crossed into the country late on Tuesday in the Shamsiddin Shohin district of the country’s southwestern Khatlon region, and were later located on Wednesday.
“The terrorists refused to obey orders from Tajik border guards to surrender and offered armed resistance. They intended to carry out an armed attack on one of the border posts of the Border Troops of the State Committee for National Security of the Republic of Tajikistan,” the statement said.
“As a result of the combat operation, all three terrorists were neutralised,” the statement said, adding that two Tajik border officers were killed during the clashes.
According to the statement, this was the third “armed attack, terrorist act, and border crossing” from Afghanistan in the past month.

 

It also accused the Afghan government of “demonstrating serious and repeated irresponsibility and non-commitment in fulfilling its international obligations and consistent promises to ensure security and stability” on the Tajik-Afghan border.
The Tajik statement additionally expressed hope that the Afghan administration will “apologise to the people of Tajikistan and take additional effective measures to ensure security on the border with Tajikistan”.
Afghanistan did not immediately comment on the development.
Earlier this month, Tajikistan said five people were killed and five others injured in two previous cross-border attacks from Afghanistan.
On Wednesday, Tajik President Emomali Rahmon commissioned four new border outposts, as well as a training range for tanks at the Harb-Maidon training ground near the Tajik-Afghan border, as part of efforts to bolster border security amid growing concerns over cross-border attacks.</p><small>2025-12-26 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/261038206f1926a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963361/indias-water-crunch-brews-risks-for-beverage-giants' target='_blank'><strong>India’s water crunch brews risks for beverage giants</strong></a><br><p>Foreign companies operating in India have long grappled with complex regulations and confusing tax laws.
In the northwestern state of Rajasthan, some of the world’s biggest beverage firms face the additional challenge of securing and managing dwindling water supplies while navigating strict government rules and grievances of some local people who only get the resource piped-in once a week.
Nearly two-thirds of Rajasthan is covered by the Thar Desert, and its groundwater extraction ranks among the highest in India, adding to the economic pressures for the state in balancing the needs of its 85 million people, booming tourism business, industry and its big agricultural sector.
Laws in India, the world’s most populous nation, bar the movement of liquor across state borders without a special permit, effectively forcing companies to set up production in every state they want to sell in, despite the water scarcity.
So global giants like Diageo, Carlsberg and Heineken have to maintain factories in Rajasthan if they want to distribute their products in the state.
“[Water stress] is a growing issue in India,” said Sonia Thimmiah, senior director of global sustainability at Heineken, the market leader, adding that a few years ago, water demand in some cities had come close to exceeding supply.
Heineken, Carlsberg and Diageo said that they are increasing water efficiency in Rajasthan and other water-stressed regions, have worked to improve communities’ access to water and aimed to replenish 100 per cent of the water their factories use back to its source.
The challenges for the brewers in Rajasthan mirror a wider crisis across India, which holds 17pc of the world‘s population but just 4pc of its freshwater. As the world’s fastest-growing major economy, India’s thirst for growth means more production and more strain on its scarce water resources.
The strain is evident in Rajasthan’s industrial town of Alwar, about 150 km southwest of Delhi, where most of the beverage companies are centred. The wider Alwar district’s groundwater extraction, driven mainly by irrigation, runs at nearly twice the rate its aquifers can recharge, government data shows.
Industry users consume just about 2pc of Rajasthan’s water, but under Indian law, all industrial and commercial entities seeking groundwater extraction have to install on-site rainwater harvesting and aquifer recharge systems.
In areas such as Alwar that the government classifies as “over-exploited” for groundwater, industries are further required to adopt the “latest water efficient technologies so as to reduce dependence on groundwater resources”, a government order said in 2020, without specifying details.
“The water tables are declining, and rains are variable,” Diageo’s Alwar head Sumit Walia told Reuters.
“We have a vision to reduce water consumption by 40pc and to ensure that whatever water is withdrawn from the ground, 100pc replenishment is there. We are recycling 100pc of the wastewater and installing advanced technologies which consume less water”, like using air to rinse bottles instead of water, he said.
Tensions with villagers
Federal authorities have permitted brewers in Alwar to draw up to about 4.6m litres of groundwater daily under 2025 permits seen by Reuters, based on applications from the companies. The global firms account for around 65pc of that, with Heineken topping the list at 1.2m litres.
A typical Indian household uses 500-600 litres a day, but even getting that is difficult in Salpur village, next to the Alwar industrial cluster, where water is a luxury.
“The situation is very bad,” said Imran Khan, head of the village of nearly 4,500 residents, who grows wheat and onion on his ancestral land. “We have to give several days of notice to the borewell owner to pump water for us - there’s a queue.” He says he had to spend about 150,000 Indian rupees ($1,700) to lay a 3-km pipeline from the borewell to his fields, and needs to pay 150 Indian rupees for every hour of water supplied by its owner, a resident of another village.
Some locals blame the scarcity on the brewers.
“They are making alcohol there, but locals do not have enough water to drink”, said Alwar resident Haider Ali, who took several global and local alcohol companies to India’s environmental court last year, alleging they were extracting water without permission.
A court-appointed inspection team later found that all factories complied with regulations. But the same court directed authorities in March to actively monitor groundwater abstraction and strictly enforce a 2020 government order prohibiting the issuance of new water permits to large industries in over-exploited areas.
Heineken and Carlsberg said there was no sign of community tension in Alwar beyond this court case, in part thanks to their work with locals on water. Diageo’s Walia said he was not aware of the court case, but industries making paper, automobiles and other products consumed more water than the liquor companies.
The water problems are not limited to Rajasthan.
Reuters has reported how, in the past decade, India has lost several days of coal-power supply because water shortages forced plants to suspend generation.
In Coca-Cola’s water security plan for 2023, reviewed by Reuters, the company says it operates nine factories in India in areas of “high or extremely high-water stress” and estimates that its annual costs of procuring water could rise by $180,000 to $2.7m.
The company, which shut a factory in 2005 in the southern state of Kerala after protests over groundwater depletion, declined to comment.
Always scope for more
Drinks makers say they are a small part of the problem in Rajasthan, and their water initiatives have significant positive impact.
Carlsberg Vice President for Sustainability Simon Boas Hoffmeyer said its goals, including replenishing all water used, go beyond regulatory requirements. “If everybody did that, the industry’s share of the issue would be very, very small, he said.
Diageo Global Head of Environment Michael Alexander said that in Salpur, the company has built small dams and planted 10,000 trees, while across Alwar it has desilted ponds, installed rooftop rainwater harvesting and funded boreholes and pipelines for communities.
Similar projects by Heineken had a positive impact in Rajasthan, said Subhransu Kumar Bebarta, partnerships lead at S M Sehgal Foundation, a non-profit that implements the company’s water projects.
But big companies can go further, he said, adding that larger infrastructure projects are needed in a state where some people struggle to find water to drink.
“They have improved the groundwater table. But still, there is always scope for more.”</p><small>2025-12-26 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2611054852b4ef4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963362/hope-we-can-avoid-unnecessary-politicisation-ahsan-iqbal-on-speculation-about-disruption-of-his-ary-news-interview' target='_blank'><strong>Hope we can avoid unnecessary politicisation: Ahsan Iqbal on speculation about disruption of his ARY News interview</strong></a><br><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal reacted to the speculation surrounding the brief disruption of his interview with ARY News’ Waseem Badami the previous night, saying, “I hope we can avoid unnecessary politicisation of this”.







On Thursday night, the minister joined ARY News programme ‘11th Hour’, which was being broadcast live, via a video link.
As the minister discussed the matter of talks between the government and the opposition, the conversation was disrupted when a person — not seen in the video — yelled in an aggressive tone, “Shut this”.
Following that, Iqbal’s call was disconnected.
It prompted the host to wonder aloud if Iqbal was alright.
“I hope everything is well. I don’t know what just happened,” he said.
Later, the minister rejoined the programme, confirming that “all was well”.
The incident sparked widespread speculation across social media, with many people suggesting that it was political in nature.
The planning minister, however, clarified on X early today morning that “a brief disruption occurred during a live broadcast when someone nearby, having an argument, was unaware that I was live on air.“
“I rejoined the interview shortly afterward,” he added, calling on people to “avoid unnecessary politicisation of this.”
The minister said this in a reply to a post made by journalist Ajmal Jami, who confirmed that he had spoken to Iqbal after watching the clip of the incident.
“He (Iqbal) said there was a family gathering at his Islamabad residence when children unexpectedly entered his study. He rejoined the show shortly after,” Jami’s post said.







Information Minister Ataullah Tarar also confirmed that he had spoken to Iqbal, stating that “kids came into the study running unexpectedly. All is well, and he has rejoined the show”.

A joint statement issued by PFUJ President Afzal Butt, and Secretary General Arshad Ansari on Friday said, “Silencing the press through physical intimidation is a direct violation of the constitutional right to freedom of expression and the rule of law.”
The statement comes days after Bangladesh saw violent protests following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka on December 16 while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He died  in Singapore on December 18.
Following his death, violent protests broke out and several buildings, including those housing leading newspapers Prothom Alo and The Daily Star, were set on fire and vandalised.
Protesters accused the newspapers of enabling Hadi’s killing, calling them “Delhi’s lapdog” and “Sheikh Hasina’s enabler,” claims the newspapers denied.
The PFUJ statement denounced these “targeted attacks”,  as well as the “deplorable physical assault“ on Nurul Kabir, the veteran editor of New Age newspaper and president of  Editors’ Council of Bangladesh.
The PFUJ also expressed deep concern over reports that more than 100 journalists in Bangladesh remain detained without trial, demanding their immediate and unconditional release.
Moreover, the statement highlighted a “disturbing regional trend”, pointing to similar violence in Nepal.

 

“Just months ago, mob attacks targeted the Kantipur Group, Annapurna Post, and Image TV,” the statement said, adding that the PFUJ leadership also paid tribute to photojournalist Suresh Rajak of Avenews TV, who tragically died in an arson attack on March 28, 2025, in Kathmandu.
The PFUJ noted with “regret that perpetrators of these crimes remain unaccountable”.
It called upon the governments concerned to conduct fair, impartial, and speedy investigations into all incidents of arson and violence; identify and bring the perpetrators to justice to end the culture of impunity; and ensure the safety of journalists as they perform their professional duties.
“Violence and harassment aimed at silencing the media are unacceptable in any democratic society,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2025-12-26 06:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191632266110623.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962035/game-review-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-an-incoherent-mess-of-bad-ideas' target='_blank'><strong>Game review: Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is an incoherent mess of bad ideas</strong></a><br><p>TL;DR

If someone were to mention the words “call of duty”, chances are you wouldn’t think about a metaphorical summons to be part of something bigger, but the iconic shooter franchise that has gripped players for almost two decades with an addictive, fast-paced and accessible gameplay loop.
However, corporate greed has alienated longtime players due to poor map design, predatory monetisation and an annual release schedule, among other problems. Franchise fatigue and a lack of innovation and creativity are what the series is mostly known for now.
Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 (BO7) is another example of this: creatively bankrupt and made to be a money-printing machine, not a fun experience to engage with.

Multiplayer
I’m going to try to be positive for a bit. BO7 has a serviceable multiplayer component. It’s accessible enough that you can casually rack up high kills and the gunplay, refined over the years, feels solid and responsive as ever. It’s fun, if in small doses.
Character and weapon models are highly detailed, while the maps are visually striking. Fate and Utopia stood out to me, with an otherworldly and unique look that I appreciated.

There’s only one problem: last year’s game, Black Ops 6 (BO6) also had solid gunplay, detailed characters and environments and a gameplay loop which you can pick up and enjoy. So why fork over Rs18,000?
Repetition is apparent throughout the game’s design. Immediately upon starting multiplayer, I was met with the same user interface as last year.
Depending on your perspective, this is both a good and a bad thing: you’ll see either laziness or a familiar, easily navigable menu system.


A screenshot of the main menu in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. — Screengrab by author

To its credit, BO7 allows you to import your settings from BO6, so I didn’t spend ages tweaking my controller settings so they’re just right.
Omnimovement — being able to sprint and slide in any direction — makes a return here, but in-game, I couldn’t sense any appreciable change in movement speed. It feels like last year’s game with a slightly different coat of paint.
There’s a “new” feature where pressing the jump button when approaching a wall allows you to bounce off it. Performing a wall-bounce and killing an enemy player in midair is admittedly very satisfying, but again, there are problems.
The system is clunky to use and, depending on the angle you hit the wall, it can take several attempts to chain jumps together, leaving you exposed. It’s also a neutered version of a better-executed system from 2015’s Black Ops 3.



The boring and repetitive map design also rears its ugly head. Maps are extremely limited in scope, featuring a (mostly) rectangular level with three lanes and one or two little passageways connecting them. Access to buildings remains limited to only one storey. Your movement is limited and that, in turn, restricts gameplay.
Being constrained in how you can move limits the frequency and nature of encounters by forcing players down only three paths. There’s less room for flanking and other complex tactics since everyone is forced down a set route, making gunplay monotonous over time.

BO7’s multiplayer is not bad, it’s just last year’s game with a futuristic paint job. I see no reason to buy this year’s new release, because I could just boot up an older title in the series for the same gameplay loop. Same schtick, different disc.
Campaign
I can confidently say that BO7 has the worst campaign in the entire Call of Duty franchise: a poorly-designed hodgepodge of bad ideas so awful I could write an entire separate review about the campaign alone.
To start, you need a constant internet connection, even to play solo, since it’s a cooperative mode you can play with friends. Why you’d subject them to it is another discussion entirely.
There is also lag — the delay between inputting a command and seeing it executed on your screen. Bullets will miss their targets, while movement and animations get choppy. I’ve played Call of Duty campaigns for at least 15 years and never encountered anything like this.



Lag, coupled with enemies that take entire magazines of bullets to kill, makes the campaign an absolute chore to play through. Bullets seldom connect and when they do, they do as much damage as a BB gun.
It gets worse. Since the campaign is cooperative, gunfights are populated with enough enemies for four players. But this is not balanced for solo play, so I faced groups of between 10 and 15 enemies at any given time.
Oh, I nearly forgot: because of the constant internet connection, you cannot pause the game.



This is pure incompetence and carelessness on the part of the developers. I doubt anybody tested this before it came out, because every single aspect of the campaign’s core design is flawed and neither fun nor worth playing at all.
The story follows Black Ops 2 (2012) protagonist David Mason and his team, Spectre One, investigating a tech corporation called The Guild. Upon raiding the company’s lab in the fictional location Avalon, Spectre is accidentally exposed to a bioweapon that makes people see their worst fears and past trauma come to life. They whiffed the Scarecrow’s fear toxin from ‘Batman’, essentially.



Since Spectre is connected by a neural network, they all have shared hallucinations, which make up some of the strangest missions in the series.
There’s a problem, though: BO2 is a 13-year-old game, so chances are that nobody knows who Mason even is, making the story even more confusing.
If I had to say something positive, the sequences themselves are visually unique for the series, with giant machetes falling from the sky, floating rocks and other otherworldly imagery.
It looks cool, but veers too much from Black Ops’ traditionally gritty realism into the realm of utter stupidity, especially in the boss fights.



Does anyone remember when Call of Duty used to be a somewhat grounded war game?



The developers attempted to explore the process of overcoming trauma and fear in these sequences, which is respectable, but anything good here is compromised by the terrible foundation I outlined earlier.
Every time I booted up the campaign, I was reminded of better campaigns from older titles and how far this franchise has plummeted. Were I scoring BO7 on its campaign alone, it’d score a dead zero.
The best way to put it is with Marlon Brando’s iconic quote from The Godfather, when Don Corleone looks at his son’s body in the morgue:
“Look how they massacred my boy.”
Zombies
Zombies mode is easily the strongest part of BO7. There are several game types you can play, including Standard Zombies with its convoluted main quest and a Survival mode on a small map.
The base map, ‘Ashes of the Damned’, has an interesting premise: you play in several small areas connected by roads you traverse with a new vehicle called Ol’ Tessie. Tessie allows you to upgrade weapons with the onboard Pack-A-Punch machine and is essential to complete the main quest.
As an idea, it’s solid, especially upgrading the vehicle to keep up with the escalating difficulty. However, I could not pause while playing and encountered lag, which impacted the experience.



This mode is not balanced for solo play either, so you’ll struggle to complete objectives while being swarmed by zombies. This can be solved by playing with friends, but if you make them play BO7, they may not be your friends anymore.
Regardless, herding a large group of zombies and dodging them never fails to satisfy, nor does emptying a magazine into said group and racking up points. Sadly, there aren’t enough maps at this time.
It’s a familiar mode to anyone who’s played Black Ops before and it’s quite good, having been refined over the years. But it isn’t enough to justify a buy, at least not for me.
A black eye for Black Ops
How Treyarch and Activision saw this as a product worth $70 is incomprehensible. Zombies alone cannot carry the weight of a lacklustre multiplayer and a truly abysmal campaign.
Trudging along while playing BO7, I wanted to play an older title in the series or something else entirely. If you’re a game developer, this is the worst possible outcome.
I absolutely cannot and will not recommend that anybody buy this. You’re better off spending your time and money on literally anything else.

The announcement by the GB chief election commissioner was not only about general elections, it also notified the holding of the much-awaited local bodies elections. The region, with its unique civic challenges and marred by development issues, has been governed without local bodies for two decades.
This has put enormous strain on successive elected governments as people — desperate for their daily civic needs such as electricity, water, sanitation, road repairs etc — look towards their elected representatives in the GB Assembly.
As the region is governed primarily through the federal government, GB’s reliance upon the centre and the budget granted to it has increased over time. Although GB has a legislative assembly of its own, the key decisions rest with the centre and its powerful bureaucracy.
This reliance is one of the reasons why the candidates and the voters in some cases look towards the ruling party in the centre before elections. This results in political defections in GB which have become a norm and are neither considered unethical nor immoral. While the defections generally occur before elections (as is currently happening) the outgoing government faced them within three years of coming into power. As the wind changed in the centre due to the no-confidence vote, the fate of the then-ruling PTI in GB was also sealed.
The then-GB CM and PTI’s regional president Khalid Khursheed Khan was disqualified by the GB Chief Court on the basis of obtaining a fake degree. Consequently, political instability, wrangling and defections have cast a shadow over the outgoing government.
The defections also do not matter much in the local context of GB. Voters in many constituencies, if not all, vote for the influential and prominent political figures who are well-known in the community and in a few cases, due to tribal affinity. Since the region desperately needs development, hence the ruling party in the centre is the best pick for these candidates. Before elections, the parties announce development schemes to tilt voters in their favour. The infrastructure of GB demands urgent attention. Due to difficult terrain, it deserves special focus which the successive governments have failed to deliver.

The region’s key decisions rest with the centre and its powerful bureaucracy.

Decades of neglect in the public health system have resulted in lack of health facilities, functioning laboratories, life-saving equipment, and availability of doctors across GB.
People in many cases take patients to what they call ‘down country’ for treatment, putting an additional burden on their finances. Even the basic facilities such as electricity, clean water and sanitation remain rare in many areas. Despite all these challenges, including a limited budget, the push to create more districts in GB is strange. In some areas, with a population of less than 50,000, carving out a district puts an additional burden on the limited budget. GB now pays more in salaries and spends less on its development, which should be the other way around.
A further burden on already meagre resources is tourism. While the recent boom in tourism and hordes of tourists arriving in GB has brought short-term benefits to the local population, the carbon footprint of these people and their vehicles has already started affecting the weather. GB is an ecologically fragile area. It cannot cater to mass tourism. GB needs a rational policy toward ecotourism and its implementation, benefitting local communities and the natural environment.
Taking tourists to mountain tops in a five-door jeep is not wise, neither are concrete hotels and guesthouses without proper sewerage and garbage disposal systems. Unfortunately, this is what has been done to GB in the name of promoting tourism which is evidently changing the region’s fragile weather.
The elephant is in the room now. In the last few years, flash floods have destroyed homes, bridges, hundreds of hectares of agricultural land and displaced population of several villages.

 

This year, Ghizer, Ghanche, Skardu and other areas faced unprecedented floods that deprived many people of their livelihoods. The incoming government will have to confront these challenges and formulate effective and long-term policies to provide meaningful relief to the population. Not to forget, GB has a large educated, yet unemployed youth population which will likely place significant pressure on the government for effective governance. A glimpse of this has been witnessed in the past five years, when the region was embroiled in mass demonstrations and large sit-ins over one issue or the other.
These protests were against the state’s attempt to end the wheat subsidy given to GB, and to impose tax. Sharp criticism was made of the GB Land Reforms Act of 2025 and against the arrests of leaders of the Awami Action Committee — vocal against certain government decisions — by civil society activists as well as political and religious circles. The longest sit-in of almost two months at the Sost dry port by GB traders and businessmen against the government’s effort to impose sales tax, advance income tax, and federal excise duty through FBR, resulted in the decision to exempt imports worth up to Rs4 billion from federal taxes if the goods are for local consumption.
The protesters demanded representation in the national legislature as a precondition to impose tax. The federal government’s move reopened the old wound and regenerated the debate of the region’s constitutional status and parliamentary representation.
Whether the incoming government will be able to resolve the chronic issue of GB’s representation is yet to be seen. While the future of GB remains uncertain, the formulation and implementation of effective and inclusive policies have the potential to mitigate the looming crises and place GB on a more stable and sustainable path.

This will be the second time the Emirati president will visit Pakistan this year, having met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Rahim Yar Khan in January. However, Friday’s trip, according to the FO, is his first official visit as president.
According to a statement by the Foreign Office (FO), President Al Nahyan will review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations with PM Shehbaz and the pair will “exchange views on regional and international issues of mutual interest”.
“The visit will provide an important opportunity to further strengthen the longstanding brotherly relations between Pak­istan and the United Arab Emirates,” the FO said.
The FO added that the visit reflects the depth of bilateral relations bet­ween both nations and their shared commitment to bolster collaboration in key areas, including trade, investment, energy, development and regional stability.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties, strengthened by historical connections and a large Pakistani expatriate community in the Emirates.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners and a key source of remittances, with thousands of Pakistanis working in various sectors. Both countries collaborate on defence, energy, and investment projects, with the UAE frequently providing financial aid and humanitarian assistance to Pakistan.
In April this year, Pakistan and the UAE signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen bonds between the people of both nations.
Two of the MoUs were for cooperation in the field of culture and the establishment of a joint committee for consular affairs, according to the report.
The third MoU was signed between the Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry for the establishment of the UAE-Pakistan Joint Business Council.</p><small>2025-12-26 05:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/694dd96880a37.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963333/lay-of-the-land' target='_blank'><strong>Lay of the land</strong></a><br><p>AS we close 2025, it is time to take a hard and honest look at the lay of the land of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Nearly 78 years after independence, Pakistan’s politics remains deeply unsettled. Of these years, approximately 33 were spent under four periods of direct military rule, with the remainder under various shades of indirect or hybrid regimes. It took 23 years for the country to hold its first general elections. To date, Pakistan has had 29 prime ministers — including caretakers and repeat tenures — yet not a single one has completed a full five-year constitutional term.

Decline is not destiny. All these crises are man-made and reversible.

Pakistan’s first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, was assassinated in 1951. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was executed in 1979. Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in 2007. Former PM Imran Khan has been incarcerated for nearly two years and sentenced to a cumulative 51 years.
Externally, Pakistan has fought four major wars with India — in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999 — and continues to experience border tensions, including earlier this year in May. The dismemberment of the country in 1971 remains a major national trauma. In 1998, Pakistan became one of the world’s nine nuclear-armed states.
Demographic pressures have compounded these challenges.
In 1947, West Pakistan’s population was approximately 32.7 million; today Pakistan’s population is close to 250m. East Pakistan, with a population of around 40m in 1947, as Bangladesh is now roughly 177m people. Pakistan’s population growth has outpaced its ability to govern, grow, educate, employ, and provide basic services.
The key determinants of national development — political stability, governance, respect for the Constitution and rule of law, inclusive institutions, economic growth, security, corruption control, and quality of life — are all in visible decline.

 

Politically, Pakistan lurches from one crisis to another. The current conflict is among the most serious in recent history. Since the tragic events of May 9, 2023, political polarisation has only intensified. At the heart of this crisis lies the unresolved question of civil-military relations.
Security challenges further darken the picture. Cross-border terrorism is on the rise, insurgency continues in Balochistan, and relations with neighbouring countries have deteriorated, including now Afghanistan.
Governance failures are equally stark.
Following the 18th Constitutional Amendment, provinces were granted authority and resources to manage policing, infrastructure, water and sanitation, health, education, and local governments. Yet provincial governments have largely failed to deliver.
Local government elections are routinely delayed or avoided to prevent the devolution of power and resources. Instead, development funds are distributed through MNAs and MPAs, fostering patronage, inefficiency, and corruption.
Despite long tenures — PPP in Sindh since 2008, PTI in KP since 2013, and repeated PML-N governments in Punjab over decades — the quality of governance and service delivery remains dismal. In southern Punjab and other marginalised regions, conditions are particularly dire.
The Constitution itself has been weakened. Politically motivated amendments, notably the 26th and 27th, have eroded judicial independence. Fundamental rights guaranteed under Part II, Chapter One of the Constitution are routinely violated, as are the Principles of Policy outlined in Chapter Two. Laws such as PECA, 2016, are increasingly used to suppress dissent.
The erosion of the rule of law is reflected in global rankings. The World Justice Project defines the rule of law as the foundation of justice, opportunity, and peace. In its 2024 index covering 143 countries, Pakistan scored 0.37, ranking 130th overall. Among South Asian countries, only Afghanistan ranks lower. Most alarming is Pakistan’s last-place ranking — 143 out of 143 — in the “order and security” category.
Economically, the situation is grim. Pakistan’s average growth rate over the past three years stands at just 1.7 per cent — the lowest for any three consecutive years in the country’s history. Approximately 45pc of the population lives below or near the poverty line, while unofficial unemployment assessment is at 22pc. This means nearly every second Pakistani is poor or near-poor, every fourth citizen is unemployed, and youth unemployment is even higher. Inflation over the past three to four years has reduced purchasing power by an estimated 65pc.

 

Taxation levels are among the highest in the world, with salaried classes bearing a disproportionate brunt. Corporations face effective tax rates of around 60pc, while electricity tariffs are higher than in most comparable countries. The cost of doing business has become prohibitively high, driving companies out of Pakistan and depressing investment to historic lows, despite official claims that the economy has ‘stabilised.’
Pakistan’s Human Development Index ranking has steadily worsened over the past decade. In 2024, Pakistan ranked 168 out of 193 countries, with all South Asian states except Afghanistan performing better. Health and education systems are in crisis: 40pc of children are stunted, and an estimated 40pc of school-age children are out of school. Pakistan ranks among the worst globally for neonatal mortality, hepatitis C prevalence, and type-II diabetes, and remains one of only two countries where polio has not been eradicated.
Women — half the population — continue to face systemic discrimination, exclusion, and lack of voice. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2025, Pakistan ranked last: 148 out of 148 countries.
This is the sobering reality as 2025 draws to a close. But decline is not destiny. All these crises are man-made and therefore reversible.
History offers perspective. In 1965, Pakistan’s GDP per capita was comparable to that of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea. Today, all are far ahead. In the 1990s, Pakistan was South Asia’s richest country and ranked above both India and Bangladesh on the Human Development Index. Many of these countries faced deep political and economic crises, yet emerged through sustained reforms, institutional strengthening, and political consensus.
Credible economists now agree that Pakistan’s current economic model is unsustainable. Yet recovery remains possible — if the country undertakes fundamental shifts in governance, economic policy, and institutional integrity.
Ultimately, everything hinges on politics. Without resolving the present political conflict and its underlying causes, no economic or social reform can sustainably succeed. Pakistan urgently needs a broad national consensus on a new direction. As the new year approaches, such consensus appears distressingly distant.

The Nigerian foreign ministry early on Friday confirmed the air strikes, describing them as “precision hits on terrorist targets” in the country.
The Department of Defence’s US Africa Command said “multiple ISIS terrorists” were killed in an attack in Sokoto state conducted at the request of Nigerian authorities, but few details were provided and it was not clear how many people died.
The strikes hit IS targets on Christmas Day, according to Trump.
“I have previously warned these Terrorists that if they did not stop the slaughtering of Christians, there would be hell to pay, and tonight, there was,” he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.
“May God Bless our Military,” he said, adding provocatively, “MERRY CHRISTMAS to all, including the dead Terrorists, of which there will be many more if their slaughter of Christians continues.”
The attacks mark the first by US forces in Nigeria under Trump, and come after the Republican leader unexpectedly berated the west African nation in October and November, saying Christians there faced an “existential threat” that amounted to “genocide” amid Nigeria’s myriad armed conflicts.
That diplomatic offensive was welcomed by some but interpreted by others as inflaming religious tensions in Africa’s most populous country, which has seen bouts of sectarian violence in the past.
Nigeria’s government and independent analysts reject framing the country’s violence in terms of religious persecution — a narrative long used by the Christian right in the United States and Europe.
But Trump, spotlighting what his administration says is global persecution of Christians, stressed last month that Washington was ready to take military action in Nigeria — with “guns-a-blazing” — to counter such killings.
‘Grateful’ for cooperation
The Nigerian foreign ministry said the country was engaged with international partners against terrorism.
“Nigerian authorities remain engaged in structured security cooperation with international partners, including the United States of America, in addressing the persistent threat of terrorism and violent extremism,” the ministry said in a statement on Friday.
Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth took to X to say he was “grateful for Nigerian government support & cooperation.”







The United States this year placed Nigeria back on the list of countries of “particular concern” regarding religious freedom, and has restricted the issuance of visas to Nigerians.
Trump last month also threatened to stop all aid to Abuja if it “continues to allow the killing of Christians“.
Nigeria is almost evenly divided between a Muslim-majority north and largely Christian south.
Its northeast has been in the grip of violence for more than 15 years by the Boko Haram group, which has claimed more than 40,000 lives and displaced two million people.
At the same time, large parts of the country’s northwest, north and centre have been hit by criminal gangs known as “bandits” who attack villages, killing and kidnapping residents.
On Wednesday, an explosion ripped through a mosque in the northeastern city of Maiduguri, killing at least seven worshippers. No armed groups immediately claimed responsibility.</p><small>2025-12-26 04:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/260905400e9bd7b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963298/kashmiri-rights-group-decries-indias-seizure-of-properties' target='_blank'><strong>Kashmiri rights group decries India’s seizure of properties</strong></a><br><p>MUZAFFARABAD: A London-based Kas­hmiri rights organisation holding special consultative status with the United Nations on Thursday condemned the Indian government’s recent confiscation of properties belonging to pro-freedom Kashmiri leaders and activists, saying New Delhi lacked the legal authority to seize assets in the internationally-recognised disputed territory and had converted its original protective mandate into a punitive regime.
“The application of domestic criminal laws, including the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), to suppress dissent and confiscate or attach properties of dissenting voices in occupied Kashmir is inconsistent with international obligations and the terms under which Indian forces were admitted into the territory in 1947,” said Dr Syed Nazir Gilani, president of the Jammu Kashmir Council for Human Rights (JKCHR).
In a statement, Dr Gilani argued that India’s military presence in occupied Jammu and Kashmir was conditional and temporary, confined to defence and the protection of life, property and civil rights pending a final determination of the region’s status.
He said the use of coercive domestic laws to silence political dissent and appropriate assets violated these commitments and breached obligations under the UN Charter, which, he maintained, took precedence over conflicting domestic legislation.

Says coercive domestic laws violate UN Charter obligations

Dr Gilani’s remarks came amid growing concern over property seizures in the occupied region, which critics and rights groups have widely condemned. According to local Kashmiri and Indian media reports, the administration has in recent years attached ancestral land in Pulwama and seized dozens of homes and other assets across the region under the pretext of security concerns or alleged encroachments.
In the latest such move, India’s National Investigation Agency (NIA) ordered the attachment of land in Budgam district belonging to US-based Kashmiri leader Dr Ghulam Nabi Fai, citing alleged involvement in activities proscribed under the UAPA.
Dr Gilani said India’s decision to refer the Kashmir dispute to the UN Security Council under Article 35 of the UN Charter had internationalised the issue, removing it from India’s exclusive domestic jurisdiction.
He added that subsequent UN resolutions had placed India in the role of an interim administrator bound by a UN-supervised process, including the obligation not to alter the territory’s status or prejudice the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination.
According to him, the use of IPC provisions relating to speech and association, as well as UAPA clauses permitting property attachment, violated India’s duty to protect property, exceeded the limits of a temporary mandate and contravened the UN Charter, under which international obligations override conflicting domestic laws.
“The confiscation of property belonging to dissenting voices amounts to a blatant violation of solemn commitments made to the government of Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan and the United Nations, and undermines the UN framework governing the dispute,” he said.
Dr Gilani further pointed out that UN Security Council Resolution 91 had safeguarded the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination, adding that India’s failure to adhere to the terms of its protective role in Jammu and Kashmir had incurred liabilities, including the loss of an entire generation.
He said the JKCHR would consult legal experts and consider pursuing cases seeking compensation and restitution for what he termed the wrongs committed against the people of Kashmir.
He also urged the governments of Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir to fulfil their responsibilities in accordance with UN Com­mission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP) resolutions and the UN framework.

Earlier this week a Hindutva mob tried to storm the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi, while attacks on Bangladeshi diplomatic missions in other Indian cities have also been reported.

 

Extremist groups in India such as the VHP are using the tragic lynching of a Bangladeshi Hindu man in Mymensingh as an excuse to target Dhaka’s missions in India. Bangladesh’s interim authorities had summoned the Indian high commissioner in Dhaka to protest against attacks on their missions in India, while Dhaka’s representative in Delhi was similarly summoned in a tit-for-tat exchange.
Bangladesh’s interim foreign minister has said his country’s top diplomat in India had received death threats. The Indian state, meanwhile, has tried to downplay the events, particularly attempts by extremist mobs to target Bangladeshi missions.

 

During Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s rule, Dhaka and Delhi were very much on the same page. However, anti-India feeling in Bangladesh has erupted after Ms Wajed’s government was toppled last year, with many seeing Delhi as supporting her authoritarian rule.
The fact that Sheikh Hasina fled to India after last year’s uprising has done little to dispel this impression. Moreover, reports that Osman Hadi’s suspected killer escaped to India have further added to the anger.
Perhaps the key reason behind the fraying of ties between both states is India’s patronising attitude towards its neighbours. Delhi should cooperate with Dhaka to trace Hadi’s killers, and should refrain from meddling in Bangladesh’s internal affairs and fanning communal fires.
The fact is that for there to be peace and amity in South Asia, the sovereignty of all states must be respected, and no state must act as if it is the regional hegemon, free to throw its weight around and bully others.

TAKING its cue from the glo­bal wave of populist politics — and its rising resonance in Pakistan — the Jamaat-i-Isl­ami appears to be charting a course to redefine its identity.
It is a path first explored under the leadership of the late Qazi Hussain Ahmad and subsequently set aside during the tenures of Syed Munawar Hassan and Sirajul Haq, when organisational discipline was prioritised over personal appeal. Under the current emir, Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, that trajectory appears to be resurfacing.
This is the assessment of party insiders, political analysts, and journalists observing the JI’s politics in general and its recent three-day congregation in Lahore, in particular. For many observers, the gathering served as a marker of a party testing new political registers, rather than abandoning old ones.
The most striking change at the event was that a large number of participants — including young girls — were seen carrying portraits of Hafiz Naeem.
For a party historically known for its collective identity and tightly controlled culture, the imagery gave the venue an uncharacteristically cultish appearance.
Many read this as an indication of internal realignment, where the iconography of its leaders is beginning to occupy a more central place in the political messaging.
Hafiz Naeem has reinforced this impression from the podium, declaring that the Jamaat had no fixed constituency or candidate. “All of Pakistan is our electorate, and every member is a candidate,” he told a gathering. Analysts interpreted the statement less as an organisational slogan and more as a personal — even populist — assertion.
Insiders acknowledge these developments as early signs of a shift towards personality-driven politics. Some within the party see strategic value in this approach. Others remain uncertain about how far such a shift can proceed without unsettling the party’s deeply embedded organisational ethos.
Old guard
The party’s old guard, which occupies key positions in its layered structure, has historically resisted departures from tradition. Ex-emir Sirajul Haq faced strong internal pushback when he tried to soften the party’s stance on the veil to broaden its appeal among women voters. “Whether the current emir will be allowed to cultivate personal charisma — especially if it begins to overshadow the Jamaat itself — remains an open question,” says a senior party insider.
JI Secretary General Ameerul Azeem describes the changes not as rupture but as part of a longer historical evolution that every political party must eventually und­ergo. In his view, the JI has consciously shifted towards a mass-movement model closer to what its founder, Maul­ana Abul A’la Maududi, originally envisioned.
Political analyst Mudassir Rizvi of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) believes Hafiz Naeem has both the experience and temperament to attempt such a transition — and that the party requires it. He points to Hafiz Naeem’s navigation of Karachi’s competitive political landscape, where the party contested against entrenched rivals such as the MQM and the PPP while still managing to expand its vote bank.
However, Mr Rizvi warns that personal charisma alone will not yield lasting gains unless it translates into organisational cohesion and broader electoral presence.
Political scientist Kamran Butt notes that internal assessments within the JI suggest that the establishment is unlikely to permit a near-term return of the PTI, while the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan appears to have lost momentum. He says should the PML-N or the PPP enter another cycle of political decline, the JI sees potential space to position itself as a right-of-centre alternative.
Gender and minorities
Alongside leadership strategy, a visible transformation is unfolding on the gender front. Long associated with conservative gender norms, the JI is cautiously recalibrating. Women’s wings have been mobilised, women in several party bodies are now elected rather than nominated, and transgender individuals are no longer actively excluded.
The party’s international linkages have also encouraged greater interfaith outreach, including visits to Sikh gurdwaras and engagement with Christian communities.
Yet internal realities remain complex. Journalist Suhail Warraich situates the Jamaat’s transformation within a longer arc of political contraction. As national relevance declined, he argues, the party increasingly retreated into local politics.
Figures such as Hidayat-ur-Rehman in Gwadar and Hafiz Naeemur Rehman in Karachi exemplify this localisation, reinforced by the Jamaat’s extensive welfare and charity network.
Veteran political scientist Rasool Bakhsh Rais also views this shift as pragmatic adaptation rather than ideological drift.
Base erosion?
However, senior journalist Badar Alam traces the Jamaat’s experimentation to the erosion of its traditional urban, religiously inclined middle-class base — displaced first by the MQM and later by the PTI.
Without a stable core constituency, he arg­u­es, the Jamaat risks reviving an old dil­e­mma: who comes first, the party or the indivi­dual? Whether the Jamaat’s attempt to redefine its identity matures into lasting political benefit or remains a temporary exp­eriment will depend on how effectively it manages these internal contradictions. For now, Hafiz Naeem has set the party on a new trajectory — but whether it will benefit the party or dent it instead remains the key question.

Without doubt, 2025 has been a tough year where militancy is concerned, with KP and Balochistan hit particularly hard by terrorist attacks, while even the federal capital witnessed its first suicide bombing in many years.
In fact, as per statistics, 2025 is said to be the bloodiest year as far as casualties in terrorist incidents are concerned since 2015. Hundreds of security personnel and civilians have been martyred in terrorist attacks, with the latest incident occurring earlier this week as militants targeted policemen in Karak, KP.
Therefore, a resolute counterterrorism plan is needed to neutralise these violent forces, and ensure peace in 2026.

 

Regarding the “political forces” the generals mentioned, this is widely believed to be a reference to the PTI. However, greater clarity is needed from state institutions regarding the exact contours of this nexus. But as this paper has said earlier, it may be unwise to link the political opposition with hard-core terrorist groups, as this would take the state’s focus away from battling militancy effectively.
The fact is that the banned TTP in KP, and Baloch separatist groups remain the biggest security challenges for the state, and must be dealt with through a multifaceted CT strategy to end the scourge of militancy, and enable the country to focus on development in an atmosphere of peace.
The army leadership discussed the “drivers” of militancy in Balochistan, and appreciated development initiatives and local empowerment efforts in the province. Indeed, along with kinetic actions, addressing genuine grievances of the affected population in Balochistan is essential to counter the separatist narrative. Furthermore, a credible political process is also a must in order to assure the local population that they are the masters of their destiny.
The situation in KP is perhaps more complicated. Here too, as in Balochistan, India is believed to be involved in supporting terrorist groups, while an unfriendly Taliban regime in Kabul is also doing nothing to control cross-border terrorism. The state should, therefore, continue diplomatic efforts to ensure that both Kabul and New Delhi are told clearly that Pakistan will not tolerate destabilising behaviour inside its borders.
Overall, a fresh CT approach is needed to permanently clear areas where militants are active, with minimal suffering of local populations, and to bring down the casualties amongst security personnel.

The report states that as of December 2024, China remained the world’s fourth-largest arms exporter, relying primarily on state-owned defence companies such as the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and North Industries Corporation (Norinco).
It notes that China’s arms exports are closely linked to its broader foreign policy and development outreach, including initiatives associated with the Belt and Road framework, and are particularly attractive to developing countries due to affordability and flexible terms.
According to this report, Pakistan figures prominently in China’s aviation exports. Beijing currently offers three fixed-wing combat aircraft for export: the fifth-generation FC-31 stealth fighter, the fourth-generation J-10C multirole combat aircraft, and the JF-17 Thunder, which is jointly developed and produced by China and Pakistan.
Importantly, the report confirms that Pakistan is the only country to which China has exported the J-10C. As of May 2025, China had delivered 20 J-10C aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force under two orders placed since 2020, with total orders amounting to 36 aircraft. While several other countries — including Egypt, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, Iran and Bangladesh — have expressed interest, no J-10C exports beyond Pakistan have taken place.

Pentagon report says Beijing has strengthened its position as major arms supplier

The report also highlights the JF-17 programme as a successful example of defence collaboration between two developing countries. Jointly produced by Pakistan and China, the aircraft is already in service with multiple air forces.
As of 2024, Azerbaijan, Myanmar and Nigeria were operating the JF-17, while Iraq was reported to be in discussions. For Pakistan, the aircraft remains a central component of its air force as well as an important defence export.
In addition to manned aircraft, the Pentagon report notes that China has supplied Pakistan with advanced, strike-capable unma­nned aerial vehicles, including the Caihong and Wing Loong series. These systems have also been exported to several other countries, reflecting China’s growing role in the global UAV market.

 

Beyond aviation, the report says China exports a wide range of military equipment across land, air defence and naval domains. Pakistan is identified as a long-standing recipient of Chinese naval platforms, including four frigates delivered in 2017 and 2018. The report adds that China is expected to expand its naval exports in the coming years, with Pakistan remaining among its core partners.
The Pentagon assessment attributes China’s growing appeal in the global arms market to competitive pricing, flexible financing and the absence of restrictive political conditions.
For Pakistan, the defence relationship with China is not limited to arms purchases but reflects a mature partnership encompassing joint development, production and long-term strategic cooperation, the report notes.

UNHCR data shows that in November alone, 171,055 Afghans returned to Afghanistan, with 37,899 deported through the Chaman, Torkham and Barabcha borders.
Also in November, over 31,500 Afghan Proof of Registration Cards (PoRs) card holders were sent to Afghanistan through UNH­­CR’s repatriation centres.
Heightened Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions in November disrupted humanitarian operations, restricted cross-border movements, and prompted temporary relocation of UN agencies from the Chaman border area.

All 54 refugee villages in KP, Balochistan and Punjab de-notified

Despite intensified imp­le­mentation of the third phase of the Illegal Fore­igners’ Repatriation Plan (IFRP) in Khyber Pakht­unkhwa, the UNHCR and partners ensured that essential and life-saving services were provided, including resumption of women and girls safe spaces and child friendly spaces, continued legal and mental health and psychosocial support.
Meanwhile, the handover of refugee health and education facilities to provincial authorities continued in KP and other districts.
The government introduced in September 2023, the IFRP, which has triggered large-scale return of Afghans. The first and second phases of the plan, implemented in September 2023 and April 2025, respectively, targeted undocumented Afghans and holders of the Afghan Citizenship Cards. The implementation of these phases saw return of over 1.1 million Afghans from urban areas and refugee villages as of July 2025.
The third phase, targeting holders of PoRs commenced in September 2025 and has seen close to 166,000 PoR holders returns. To date, over 1.82 million Afghans have returned to their country since the start of the IFRP. In November this year, 171,055 returned to Afghanistan, with 37,899 deportations registered.
The government has also de-notified all 54 refugee villages in KP, Balochistan and Punjab provinces and continues to urge Afghans to return to Afghanistan.
The UNHCR is advocating with the government to grant exemptions to students enrolled in universities. While a formal policy for students has not yet been issued, university students are currently being exempted from the IFRP.

The prosecutor’s office said arrest warrants were issued for 137 suspects, of whom 115 have so far been detained, following intelligence indicating that the IS terrorist organisation was planning attacks during the holiday period.
The operation launched after police received intelligence that ISIL members were “planning attacks in Turkiye against non-Muslims in particular”, during the holiday period, it added.
Officers seized firearms, ammunition and what officials described as organisational documents during the sweeps, Al Jazeera reported on Thursday.
Efforts are continuing to locate the remaining 22 suspects.
That sweep, coordinated between intelligence services, police and military forces, netted individuals involved in financing the group’s activities and spreading its propaganda.
The prosecutor’s office said those arrested were in contact with IS operatives outside Turkiye, underscoring the transnational nature of the threat.
Turkiye shares a 900-kilometre (559-mile) border with Syria, where militant groups are still active.
IS leader ‘killed’ in Syria
Also on Thursday, Syr­ian authorities claimed to have killed a senior IS leader in coordination with the US-led coalition, hours after the arrest near Damascus of another leader.
Syrian security and intelligence forces, working in coordination with the international coalition, conducted what the interior ministry described as a “precise security operation”.
“The operation resulted in neutralising the terrorist Mohammad Shahada, known as Abu Omar Shaddad, who is considered one of the prominent IS leaders in Syria,” it added.
“This operation comes as confirmation of the effectiveness of joint coordination between the national security agencies and international partners.”
Hours earlier, authorities said they captured Taha al-Zoubi, also known as Abu Omar Tabiya, an IS leader in Damascus, along with several of his men on Wednesday.
High-value arrest
Earlier this week, in a major operation along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, a Turkish national, who allegedly held a senior role within the IS group, was also captured.
The suspect was identified as Mehmet Goren, who reportedly served in the Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) province, Anadolu Agency reported.
According to the report, Goren had been tasked with organising suicide attacks targeting civilians in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkiye and Europe.
The Turkish National Intelligence Organisation (MIT) said that Goren travelled from Turkiye to the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, where he operated in IS camps and rose through the ranks to a leadership position.
IS-K, the regional affiliate of the IS group, has claimed responsibility for some of the worst attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan and beyond in recent years, many of them targeting civilians.

 

In March 2024, IS-K gunmen killed more than 140 people at a Moscow concert hall, and the group has carried out a series of deadly attacks in both Afghanistan and Pakistan since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
Goren allegedly worked alongside Ozgur Altun, known by the code name “Abu Yasir al-Turki”, who was previously arrested, transferred to Turkiye and jailed for facilitating the movement of militants from Turkiye to the region.

KARACHI: Business stakeholders have offered positive views of Pakistan International Airlines’ (PIA) acquisition by the Arif Habib consortium, with some seeing it as a chance to improve service and safety, while others say it could help revive investor confidence and accelerate the privatisation of other state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
Chief Executive and Secretary General of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) M. Abdul Aleem told Dawn he viewed the transaction as a positive step towards privatisation and said the government should be commended for handling the process “professionally”.
“We are positive that once things are stabilised by the new management, PIA will attract foreign investors,” he said, adding that the next few years would be critical and that the new management should be supported by all stakeholders.
Former Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik said the debate on PIA’s privatisation had largely overlooked what matters most to travellers. While policymakers focus on valuation, liabilities and timing, passengers, he said, judge airlines on simpler things such as punctuality, cleanliness, safety, staff response and route reliability. On these basic metrics, PIA had steadily lost public trust, he added.
Mr Malik said passengers today booked PIA not out of preference but compulsion, citing limited alternatives on some routes, especially to smaller cities, lack of competition during peak travel periods and affordability concerns.
Frequent delays, last-minute cancellations, inconsistent communication and poor ground handling had become routine, he said, adding that overseas Pakistanis increasingly viewed PIA as an airline of last resort rather than a preferred flag carrier.
“Privatisation, from a passenger’s standpoint, is not about selling an asset; it is about restoring accountability,” he said. “A privately run airline — properly regulated — has incentives aligned with customer satisfaction. Aircraft utilisation matters, turnaround times matter, complaints matter. Missed connections and lost baggage carry real costs for the operator, not just inconvenience for the traveller.”

 

“Critically, passengers do not need PIA to be ‘nationally owned’; they need it to be professionally run,” he said, adding that “pride in a flag carrier does not come from state ownership but from performance.”
He added, “Turkish Airlines, Emirates and Qatar Airways inspire national pride precisely because passengers trust them — not because of who owns the shares.”
‘Turning point’
Meanwhile, the leadership of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) urged the government to speed up the privatisation of other SOEs, saying the state spends nearly Rs800 billion annually to keep loss-making entities afloat.
Chairman of the Businessmen Group Zubair Motiwalla and KCCI President Muhammad Rehan Hanif said privatising PIA alone was expected to save about Rs100bn a year previously used to cover the airline’s losses. They argued the funds could be redirected towards development, social services and economic growth.
They opined that if more state-owned enterprises are privatised and taken over by capable Pakistani business groups, it would help restore Pakistan’s economic strength and credibility.
Such developments would clearly signal to the international community that Pakistan is an investable destination where local investors have strong confidence in the country’s future and are willing to invest and revive strategic national assets, they added.
PIA, once regarded as one of Asia’s finest airlines and a symbol of national pride, suffered decades of financial losses, operational inefficiencies and governance challenges under state ownership.
The successful privatisation, carried out through a transparent and competitive process, marks a turning point that offers a realistic opportunity to reverse this long decline and restore PIA’s lost stature both regionally and internationally, they added.

 

They hoped that PIA, under professional private management, could once again emerge as one of the most profitable and respected carriers, not only in Pakistan but across the entire region.
Shankar Talreja of Topline Securities, commenting on the historic $480 million deal in the last 20 years, was of the view that the bid value has significantly surpassed the market expectations of Rs80-100bn.
“The potential of turnaround in PIA is quite significant due to its landing rights over 78 destinations and 170 slots. Furthermore, this is a national airline of the world’s fifth most populous nation,” he said.
He said PIA’s deal would boost the morale of the privatisation ministry and set the tone for the next entities up for privatisation, i.e. electricity distribution companies (Discos).

Latest data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) showed that, as the first half of FY26 draws to a close, the government borrowing remains limited to Rs672bn, compared with debt retirement of Rs1.7 trillion in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
Bankers expect heavy borrowing in the second half of the current fiscal year as the government faces liquidity constraints due to revenue shortfalls, which they say remain below target.
Financial market sources said the government continues to rely on banks to stay within its targeted fiscal space. Bankers noted that dividend payouts to the federal government surged sharply in FY25, with around Rs2.7tr transferred to the national exchequer, providing significant fiscal relief.
Another SBP report shows that banks’ investments stood at Rs36.7tr by end-June 2025, underscoring that the bulk of domestic borrowing continues to come from the banking sector.

Rs672bn raised during 1HFY26 in contrast with Rs1.7tr debt retirement

Banks say around 86 per cent of the fiscal deficit is financed through bank borrowing, a factor they believe contributes to weak liquidity flows to the private sector.
In FY25, about 91pc of Pakistan’s total fiscal deficit was financed from domestic sources, with banks playing the dominant role.
Reliance on domestic banks has remained a persistent trend as external financing often falls short of targets.
In FY24, nearly 88pc of deficit financing was raised through domestic markets. FY23 was considered the most challenging year, when external financing pressures pushed the government to rely heavily on bank borrowing to bridge the fiscal gap.
A World Bank report issued on Dec 19 said Pakistan’s path to inclusive and sustainable growth requires stronger mobilisation of domestic resources and more efficient and transparent use of public funds.
The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors has approved $700m in financing for the Pakistan Public Resources for Inclusive Development – Multiphase Programmatic Approach (PRID-MPA), a multi-year initiative aimed at supporting macroeconomic stability and service delivery.
According to the report, the PRID-MPA will support federal and provincial reforms to mobilise domestic revenue, improve spending quality and leverage data and digital tools for better public services. The programme will provide up to $1.35bn in total financing, including $600m for federal programmes and $100m for Sindh.
“The results-based design ensures that resources are only disbursed once programme objectives are achieved,” the report said.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) has set aside the federal government’s power to inactivate a citizen’s passport and imp­ose a travel ban of five years or more by placing a person on the Passport Control List (PCL) — adjudicating that this authority was beyond the scope of the parent law.
However, Justice Asim Hafeez upheld the government’s powers to cancel, impound, or confiscate passports, subject to the fulfilment of statutory requirements.
The judgement was delivered at the Multan bench while allowing a petition filed by citizen Farhan Ali, who took up two grievances before the court.
First, he sought the setting aside of an order that dismissed his representation against the placement of his name on the PCL as premature.
Second, he questioned the legality and constitutionality of the power to inactivate a passport under Rule 23 of the Passports Rules, 2021, contending that such power was not provided under Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974, which authorised only cancellation, impounding, or confiscation of a passport.

 

The judge noted that the petitioner’s request for removal of name from the PCL had been dec­lined under clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 22 of the Passports Rules, 2021, which prescribed a normal retention period of five years or more.
He observed that a person placed in Category ‘B’ might be omitted even before the completion of five years while an appeal was under consideration.
Under category ‘B’, the list includes individuals refused passports for reasons other than anti-state activities. Names may also be placed in this category on the recommendations of government agencies or departments.
‘Lacking statutory backing’
Justice Hafeez held that clause (c) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 22 lacked statutory backing, describing it as arbitrary, disproportionate, and beyond the scope of the parent law.
He noted that the provision offered no categorisation or guidelines for determining proportionate restraint and conferred unstructured discretion upon the executive.
On the issue of passport inactivation, the judge held that Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974, did not provide for inactivation.
Declaring the clause substantially ultra vires the law, the judge directed the federal government to rationalise restraint periods in proportion to the nature of violations, noting that illegal overstay could not be equated with migrant smuggling, human trafficking, or criminal conduct abroad.
Justice Hafeez explained that inactivation was an informal action — wrapped in obscurity — often used to avoid procedural requirements and due-process obligations under the law.
He noted that “surreptitious inactivation” had caused travellers to find themselves in unexpected and humiliating situations at airports despite holding valid passports and visas.
Justice Hafeez ruled that Rule 23 of the Passports Rules, 2021, conflicted with the scheme of the parent law, and that the delegated legislation failed when it exceeded statutory limits or replaced legislative judgement with executive discretion.
“Inactivation of a passport manifests denial of the right to travel in a covert manner not envisaged by the Act,” the judge observed.
“I hold that power to inactivate passport under Rule 23 of the Rules 2021 is beyond the scope of Section 8 of the Act 1974 and same is declared ultra vires — only the power to inactivate is declared invalid and powers to cancel, impound or confiscate are intact and exercisable subject to the existence of conditions and fulfilment of requirements,” the judge wrote in the verdict.
‘30 days’
The judge ordered that the verdict would take effect after 30 days to allow the federal government to revise the rules in conformity with Section 8 of the Passports Act, 1974.
He allowed the petition and the impugned order dated Oct 6, 2025, was set aside.
The government was directed to decide the petitioner’s representation afresh in light of the judgement.
The verdict was announced after hearing arguments from the petitioner’s counsel, law officers representing the federal government, and officials from the Federal Investigation Agency and Immigration and Passports Department.

WITH the writ of Imran Khan over­ruling all others in the PTI, a number of party leaders are starting to become disillusioned with their incarcerated leader’s insistence on agitation rather than nego­tiations, to end the political impasse.
In addition to the five party stalwarts incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat, including Shah Mahmood Qureshi, more leaders have come forward in favour of talks with the government, despite opposition by some within the party, who equate dialogue with surrender.
The Imran loyalists, on the other hand, continue to toe their leader’s line, and are currently busy garnering support for the recent call for nationwide protests, issued by the PTI founder following his conviction in the Toshakhana-II case.
Although the PTI founder has charged leaders of the opposition alliance — Mehmood Khan Acha­kzai and Raja Nasir Abbas — with deciding whether to pursue dialogue with the government or opt for a street protest, his orders to his party are clear: there can be no detente as long as he remains behind bars.
The call for dialogue, however, has gained traction after a letter penned by the seasoned party leaders held in Kot Lakhpat jail received a ‘positive response’ from the prime minister, as well as other government figures.
Even the opposition alliance headed by Mr Achakzai has also expressed its willingness to engage with the government.
However, it seems that the party’s hands will stay tied as long as Mr Khan remains set in his ways. According to PTI leaders, the confusion — or uncertainty — within party circles over whether to prepare for protests or talks is largely attributed to the restrictions on access to Imran Khan.
Talking to Dawn, PTI Central Punjab General Secretary Bilal Ejaz regretted that had “mature politicians” been meeting Mr Khan in jail, things could have been very different.
How would someone kept in isolation react if those meeting him were telling him that millions were ready to join his cause, he posited, claiming that politicians were being kept away from Mr Khan and only non-political and ‘planted persons’ were allowed to meet him in jail.
Akhunzada Hussain, a spokesperson for the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan — the opposition alliance of which PTI is an essential component — is also demanding access to Mr Khan; for the sake of political clarity, and as a part of a series of confidence-building measures.
“Now the ball is in the government’s court; it should notify Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Nasir Abbas as opposition leaders in the two houses of parliament,” he said, adding that the alliance was willing to negotiate without calling off their street mobilisation plans and the protest planned for Feb 8.
He said the alliance had demanded fresh elections and measures to restore the supremacy of the Constitution, adding that they were looking towards PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif to lend a sympathetic ear.
“We are not addressing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, rather his elder brother, and explaining to him the common points.” He claimed that the opposition had continued exchanging notes with the elder Sharif on these issues, while asking the government to come to the table for talks.
Other PTI leaders echoed similar views. Aliya Hamza, who is PTI’s chief organiser in Punjab, said the onus was on the government to create an environment conducive for talks.
“We are not making any illegitimate demand, [rather we are demanding] legitimate constitutional and legal rights, as well as implementation of the jail manual in its letter and spirit,” she said, and alleged that that the government was still picking up party workers and registering cases against them.
When the establishment could talk to Nawaz Sharif while he was in jail, then why can’t they do it with Mr Khan in Adiala, she asked, rhetorically.
Ms Hamza also asserted the PTI would not shy away from protests, but called on the political committee to lay out a clear protest strategy, so that the rank and file they could focus their energies.
Former opposition leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, who was disqualified in May 9 cases, expressed reservations over the government’s ability to stick to the dialogue process, in light of the crackdown that the PTI was facing.
“We were not even nominated in the FIRs… on the basis of which we were disqualified,” he said, lamenting how parliamentary opposition leaders were disqualified by subordinate courts, even though the prerogative to disqualify a parliamentarian rested with the Supreme Court.
With the subject of talks between the government and agitating political forces has started gaining traction once again, so too has former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry re-emerged.
Some months ago, Mr Chaudhry a few other like-minded former PTI figures had come together to form the National Dialogue Committee, an attempt to lower political tempers.
Talking to Dawn, he said the committee had suggested the prime minister should take confidence-building measures and release the five senior PTI leaders languishing in Kot Lakhpat jail on parole, to enable them to lead and participate effectively in the dialogue process.
Mr Chaudhry was of the opinion that both the establishment and the PTI would have to review their positions, since neither of them were going anywhere. “The country’s political landscape is in a stalemate position,” he said, adding that the government should take a step forward, while the PTI needs to step back to create space and environment for a meaningful dialogue.

ISLAMABAD: The transfer of high court judges is expected in the coming weeks under the 27th Amendment, with sources in the judicial bureaucracy indicating that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) may soon take up the matter formally.
The move will come in light of the 27th Amendment that significantly altered the constitutional scheme governing the transfer of judges of the superior judiciary by empowering the JCP to recommend transfers of judges from one court to another without requiring their consent.
According to sources, the issue of judges’ transfers was discussed informally during a recent interaction among the chief justices of the high courts. The chief justices had assembled earlier this month to attend the 56th meeting of the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee (NJPMC).
Following the meeting, the NJPMC issued a statement highlighting key policy directions, including measures to reduce case backlog, improve the disposal of commercial litigation, and streamline mechanisms relating to tax cases. The statement, however, did not mention any deliberation on the transfer of judges, as the subject was not included in the formal agenda of the committee.
A senior official familiar with the development told Dawn that although the NJPMC did not formally deliberate on the matter, the issue of transfers was discussed informally among the chief justices on the sidelines of the meeting. The official added that the discussions were exploratory in nature and did not amount to any decision.
Sources further said that the JCP was expected to convene a series of meetings over the next month. Besides considering the confirmation of additional judges of the IHC, the LHC and the Balochistan High Court, the commission is likely to take up the issue of transfers as well.
Before the 27th Amend­ment, Article 200 required the consent of the judge proposed to be transferred, in addition to mandatory consultations among the president, the chief justice of Pakistan, and the chief justices of the high courts concerned. The revised constitutional provision replaced this mechanism with a process centred on the JCP.
Under the substituted Article 200, the president may transfer a judge of a high court from one court to another on the recommendation of the JCP. The amendment also addresses the question of seniority, providing that the seniority of a transferred judge shall be reckoned from the date of his initial appointment as a high court judge. However, it expressly bars the transfer of a judge to a high court where, upon transfer, they would become senior to the chief justice of that court. However, in such an eventuality, the transferred judge will be entitled to get an additional allowance. The amendment also made it clear that a judge who would not accept their transfer would accordingly be charged under Article 209 and be tried by the Supreme Judicial Council.
Following the passage of the amendment, reports circulated regarding the likely transfer of a number of judges. According to these reports, around 10 judges of the Lahore High Court (LHC) and four judges of the Islamabad High Court may be assigned to different courts or benches for periods ranging from six months to two years.
The reported proposed postings include benches of the Balochistan High Court, particularly the Zhob bench, as well as the Sindh High Court’s benches at Larkana, Sukkur and Mirpurkhas. No official confirmation had been issued regarding these reports.

The move marks a shift toward on-site monitoring as authorities seek to curb underreporting of taxable income in one of the country’s most lucrative professional sectors. The initiative gained mom­entum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.
Official figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan’s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns for TY2025.
Of the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns for TY2025, only 43.20pc of those exist on tax rolls with the tax authorities, placing the profession among the least compliant sectors in the tax system.
Moreover, even among those who filed tax returns, income declarations point to widespread underreporting, raising questions about enforcement, transparency, and the credibility of declared earnings within one of the country’s most established and high earning professions.

Officers deputed at private hospitals to monitor revenue and ensure tax compliance

A senior tax official told Dawn that the FBR has begun deploying IRS officers directly at the premises of commercial entities, including private hospitals and clinics, to strengthen monitoring and enforcement. According to the official, these officers are tasked with observing the provision of medical services and the collection of receipts in real time.
In the first phase, officers have been posted at 50 commercial hospitals under Section 175-C of the Income Tax Ordinance. The objective is to identify underreporting of revenues, particularly from high inpatient occupancy charges that, in some cases, exceed the rates charged by five star hotels.
Tax returns analysis
“We will identify non-compliant doctors through this exercise,” the official said, adding that private notices are being issued to encourage voluntary compliance. The official noted that voluntary compliance from doctors has already begun following the issuance of these notices.
The data place the number of registered doctors on the tax rolls at 130,243, of whom 56,287 filed income tax returns in TY2025, about 43pc of those registered. Among the filers, 48,704 doctors declared income, representing roughly 87pc of those who submitted returns.
Official figures showed that only around two in five registered doctors filed income tax returns in TY2025, with an even smaller share reporting taxable income.
However, 7,583 doctors reported zero income in their tax returns for TY2025.
Further analysis of the returns showed that 30,000 doctors of the 48,704 doctors have declared less than Rs2 million annual income, which accounted for 61.59pc of all doctors who declared taxable income in their returns. This percentage goes to 65 percent of total return filers, who declared less than Rs2 million annual income.
Moreover, most doctors fall in the lower reported income brackets.
Within the below Rs2m income bracket, the breakdown of tax returns declarations further highlights the scale of low declared earnings.
As many as 341 doctors reported annual income between Re1 and Rs100,000 in their returns, 17,647 doctors declared income ranging from Rs100,000 to Rs1m, while 12,959 reported annual earnings between Rs1m and Rs2m for TY2025.
According to data, a sharp decline in the number of doctors as income levels rise. The data show 6,655 doctors fall within the Rs2m to Rs3m annual income bracket, 6,959 doctors are in the Rs3m to Rs5m range, and 3,093 doctors declared annual income between Rs5m and Rs10m.
At the highest end of the scale, only 1,050 doctors declared annual income exceeding Rs10m in TY2025.According to the FBR, statistics highlight two gaps, first between registered doctors and those filing their tax returns, and second between filers and the income levels declared with the largest concentration of declarations below Rs2m per year in TY2025.

DERA ISMAIL KHAN / LAKKI MARWAT / QUETTA: Security forces and police neutralised 11 terrorists, including a high-value target, in separate intelligence-based operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan and Lakki Marwat districts and Balochistan’s Kalat district.
On Wednesday, two “khawarij” were killed in an operation in Dera Ismail Khan’s Kulachi area, the Inter-Services Public Rela­tions (ISPR) said in Thursday’s statement, using the state’s term for members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
During the operation, troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, killing two of them, incl­uding their “ringleader Dilawar”, it said.
According to ISPR, Dilawar was wanted by law enforcement agencies due to his involvement in terrorist activity and the government had put an Rs4 million bounty on him.
The statement added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain terrorists, who remained actively involved in terrorist activities against the security forces and civilians.
Meanwhile, in Lakki Marwat, a terrorist commander was killed in an exchange of fire with police and the Counter-Terrorism Depar­t­­­ment’s (CTD) Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team in Wanda Amir area on Thursday.
A police official said law enforcement personnel, with the support of volunteers from local peace committees, carried out an operation in the rural locality after receiving intelligence about the presence of TTP terrorists.
According to the official, a group of terrorists opened fire on the law enforcers using light and heavy weapons. Police and CTD personnel returned fire, and the exchange continued for some time.
After the firing stopped, police launched a search operation and recovered the body of a terrorist along with arms and ammunition.
The slain terrorist was identified as Barkatullah, also known as Barkati and Abuzar. His accomplices managed to escape, taking advantage of the difficult terrain, the official said.
Kalat operation
In a separate statement, ISPR said security forces conducted an operation in Kalat on Wednesday on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan”, the state’s term for Balochistan-based separatist groups.



It said that during the operation, security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and, after an intense exchange of fire, eight terrorists were killed.
“Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area,” ISPR said.
Nine children injured
Separately, in KP’s Tank district, at least nine children were injured on Wednesday after a drone strike hit a seminary in Shadi Khel village, within the jurisdiction of Tank Saddar police station, local sources said.
Rescue and hospital officials said Rescue 1122 shifted the injured children to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital, Tank, for treatment. Hospital sources confirmed that the injured included six boys and three girls.
Doctors said all the children were out of danger and in stable condition. Local sources said the strike occurred while the children were attending classes at the seminary.
Three security men, 11 civilians hurt
Meanwhile, the security situation turned tense in the Mir Ali subdivision of North Waziristan on Thursday after an hour-long exchange of heavy fire between security forces and militants, leaving three security personnel and at least 20 civilians injured.
Local sources said the clashes erupted around noon in areas adjoining Mir Ali. During the exchange, three security personnel sustained injuries, while mortar shells landed on residential houses in different localities, injuring at least 20 civilians, including women and children.
Security forces cordoned off Mir Ali Bazaar and the surrounding areas, and intermittent aerial firing was reported, triggering panic among residents.
All commercial activities were suspended as people remained confined to their homes amid fear and uncertainty.
A loud explosion was also heard near the Muski area along the Mir Ali-Khaisoor Road, while a security checkpost at Hasokhel Bridge came under heavy weapons fire.
Intense gunfire was reported in the Muski area, where three security personnel were injured and shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment.
Mortar shells also landed on houses in the Hasokhel, Muski and Ippi areas, causing injuries to civilians, including women and children.
Reacting to the incident, Awami National Party North Waziristan president Malik Nisar Ali expressed grave concern, saying a mortar shell had landed on his house and injured three members of his family.
He said targeting civilians, particularly women and children, was “deeply tragic and unacceptable”, and urged the authorities to ensure the protection of the civilian population and take concrete steps to restore lasting peace.

In a statement, the telecom regulator has said that the use of Sims registered in another individual’s name is considered a violation of applicable regulations, and any misuse of a SIM shall be the sole responsibility of the registered user.
PTA further emphasised that consumers must ensure responsible use of their SIMs and telecommunications connections. Users shall be individually accountable for all calls, messages, and data usage made through their SIMs or devices. 
Consumers are required to comply with all relevant rules and regulations, and failure to do so may result in necessary enforcement action in case of any violation.
The PTA has asked all telecom consumers to adopt responsible conduct and play an active and effective role in safeguarding the security, stability, and reliability of Pakistan’s telecommunications system.
This warning comes amid growing incidents of mobile-based financial fraud and cases of harassment. These incidents are burdening the redress mechanism, as in most cases the SIM owners were not involved in illegal activities.
In a population of over 250 million, around 196m SIMs have been issued in the country, signifying that a large number of people have several SIMs registered in their names.
Currently, a maximum of five voice SIMs and three data SIMs ownership is allowed under one CNIC for personal use, as per PTA regulations.

PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik said the province will implement party founder Imran Khan’s direction to launch a “mass protest movement”. 
Ms Malik instructed all ticket-holders, office-bearers, workers and lawyers in the Lahore division to ensure their presence at Liberty Roundabout to welcome Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.  
She urged party members to play their role in “restoring constitution, law and democracy in the country”. 
Ms Malik said it would be a “historic moment” to convert Lahore’s main boulevard into a march for the release of Khan. 
Earlier in the day, she said CM Afridi, his cabinet members and members of the Provincial Assembly would make their first stop in Punjab at Bhera. She asked ticket-holders and party office-bearers from the Sargodha and Mandi Bahauddin divisions to welcome Afridi at that location.

According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the meeting took place at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, where the pair discussed matters of mutual interest and regional security dynamics.
“Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening defence ties with Jordan and emphasised the importance of collaborative efforts to address evolving security challenges,” the statement read.
“The visiting dignitary (Maj Gen Al-Huneiti) appreciated the professionalism of the Pakistan armed forces and lauded their contributions towards regional peace and stability.”
The ISPR said that the meeting concluded with a shared resolve between Field Marshal Munir and Maj Gen Al-Huneiti to further deepen military cooperation between the two brotherly countries.
On November 16, Field Marshal Munir reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further enhancing military-to-military cooperation with Jordan and jointly realising the mutual vision of a stable and peaceful region, according to the military’s media affairs wing.
The army chief also underscored the “strong defence partnership” between Pakistan and the Hashemite Kingdom — the royal family of Jordan — during an official visit undertaken by Jordan’s King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein.
On October 23, King Abdullah II lauded the Pakistan military’s contributions towards regional peace and security in a meeting with the Field Marshal, who was on a trip to Jordan at the time.
During the visit, Field Marshal Munir also called on Maj Gen Al-Huneiti at the General Headquarters in Amman, where he was welcomed and presented with a guard of honour on his arrival.</p><small>2025-12-25 18:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/25223702e59703d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963189/tribunals-under-punjab-property-ownership-law-yet-to-become-operational' target='_blank'><strong>Tribunals under Punjab property ownership law yet to become operational</strong></a><br><p>The tribunals recently notified by the Punjab government under the property ownership law have yet to become fully operational, as they have not been provided with the requisite staff or designated premises to conduct proceedings.
On Monday, Lahore High Court (LHC) Chief Justice Aalia Neelum suspended the operation of the newly enacted Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Ordinance, 2025, which empowers deputy commissioner-led committees to decide property disputes.
In response to the suspension, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz argued that the move would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”.
During Wednesday’s hearing against the law, Justice Neelum remarked that the notification for the tribunals was recently issued after almost two and a half months, but the tribunals were still not functional, noting that neither staff nor place had been designated to the tribunals.
It may be mentioned that the Punjab government had appointed the LHC-nominated judicial officers as members of the tribunals to be established under Section 11 of the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immoveable Property Ordinance 2025.
A notification issued by the Board of Revenue, Punjab, explains judicial officers’ appointment in 36 districts out of 41 districts in the province. All the newly appointed nominees as Members of the Tribunals are retired district and session judges.
The notification says property tribunals established at Rawalpindi and Muzaffargarh shall exercise jurisdiction in the districts of Murree and Kot Addu, respectively, till the nomination of judicial officers by the LHC.
Similarly, the property tribunals of districts Gujrat, Chakwal, and Dera Ghazi Khan shall exercise jurisdiction in Wazirabad, Talagang and Taunsa districts, respectively.
The Punjab government said the property tribunals had been established to save citizens from illegal occupation of their immovable properties and protect their proprietary rights.
The government also said prosecutors, who would draw their salaries from their respective district offices, had also been appointed at respective tribunals to assist in the legal proceedings.
Also, the government entrusted the additional charge of Registrar Tribunals to assistant commissioners (coordination) in respective districts.</p><small>2025-12-25 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2514300979d6732.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963172/attempt-to-ambush-security-forces-convoy-thwarted-in-north-waziristans-mir-ali' target='_blank'><strong>Attempt to ambush security forces’ convoy thwarted in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali</strong></a><br><p>MIRANSHAH: Security situation turned tense in the Mir Ali subdivision of North Waziristan on Thursday after an hour-long exchange of heavy fire between security forces and militants, leaving three security personnel and at least 20 civilians injured.
According to security sources, Fitna al Khawarij militants attempted to attack a convoy on the main highway.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to local sources, the clashes erupted around noon in adjoining areas of Mir Ali. During the exchange, three security personnel sustained injuries, while mortar shells landed on residential houses in different localities of Hasokhel, Muski and Ippi areas, injuring 20 civilians, including women and children.
Security forces cordoned off Mir Ali Bazaar and surrounding areas, while intermittent aerial firing was reported, triggering panic among residents. All commercial activities were suspended as people remained confined to their homes amid fear and uncertainty.
Sources said the Bannu–Miranshah main road was completely closed for all kinds of traffic at the Khajori checkpost, resulting in long queues of vehicles and causing severe inconvenience to travelers.
Meanwhile, a loud explosion was heard near the Muski area on Mir Ali–Khaisoor Road, while a security check post at the Hasokhel Bridge came under heavy weapon attack. Intense gunfire was exchanged between security forces and militants in the Muski area, leaving three security personnel injured, who were shifted to a nearby hospital for treatment.
Medical Superintendent of Mir Ali DHQ Hospital, Dr Munir Aslam, said that 20 injured persons were brought to the hospital, seven of whom were referred to Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital in Bannu due to their critical condition, while treatment of the remaining injured is underway.
Sources added that local residents, carrying white flags, continued to shift the injured to hospitals despite the difficult and dangerous situation.
Reacting to the incident, Awami National Party North Waziristan President Malik Nisar Ali expressed grave concern, stating: “Unfortunately, a mortar shell also landed on my house, injuring three members of my family. Targeting innocent civilians, especially women and children, is deeply tragic and unacceptable.”
He urged the authorities to ensure the protection of civilian population and take serious steps for lasting peace in the area.
Following the incident, security forces launched a search operation in the area, while the situation remained tense till the filing of this report.
Multiple incidents of terrorism and violence have been reported from Mir Ali lately.
In October, four terrorists were killed by the security forces, foiling a suicide attack on a military camp in Mir Ali.
Earlier this month, unidentified militants blew up a government primary school in Mir Ali, jeopardising the future of more than 600 school-going children.
Days later, a government school in the same district with over 250 enrolled girls was destroyed with explosives.</p><small>2025-12-25 15:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2519421757679b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963185/pti-requests-ecp-to-extend-deadline-for-nomination-papers-in-islamabad-local-body-polls' target='_blank'><strong>PTI requests ECP to extend deadline for nomination papers in Islamabad local body polls</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Thursday approached the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) with a request for a three-day extension to the submission deadline for nomination papers in local body elections in Islamabad.
According to the application, submitted to the ECP’s Diary Branchand available with Dawn, Baldiat Committee Secretary Anjum Shahzad Tanoli requested that the chief election commissioner extend the deadline to December 27.
“With due respect, this is to draw your kind attention towards the schedule of local body elections in Islamabad, wherein the last date for submission of nomination papers has been fixed as 27th December,“ the application read.
It noted that the government announced a local holiday on December 26, stating that it would significantly affect the process of filing nomination papers.
“Islamabad comprises 125 union councils (UCs), and in each union council, at least nine councillors are required to submit their nomination papers,“ the application stated.
“The announced holiday will create serious administrative and logistical difficulties for candidates, proposers, and concerned offices, leading to unnecessary congestion and hardship on the final day.”
Based on the delay caused by a public holiday, Tanoli requested that the ECP extend the deadline to file nomination papers by at least three days “in the larger interest of transparency, fairness, and effective participation in the democratic process”.
PTI Regional President Amir Mughal, while talking to Dawn, said that there is insufficient time for the nomination process in the local government elections’ first phase. The poll covers 125 UCs and 1,125 councillors.
He also criticised amendments made to the Local Government Act of 2015, claiming that the law was altered with malicious intent to promote rigging and horse-trading.
Mughal further highlighted that direct elections for the chairman and vice-chairman posts had been abolished, and a new law was introduced to “manipulate councillors’ loyalty after they win, pressuring them to change their loyalties”.
“Despite these challenges, PTI is committed to actively participating in local elections as the people of Islamabad have always supported PTI and rejected the PML-N,” he claimed.
Mughal also emphasised that due to the ECP’s decisionto revoke the PTI’s election symbol, all party workers have been instructed to declare themselves as candidates under the “Sunni Ittehad Council” banner in their nomination papers.
The ECP has already announced the schedule for local government elections in the Islamabad Capital Territory. The term of the local government expired in February 2021, but elections could not be held and were further delayed due to “new legislation”.
In a notification also posted on social media, the ECP invited nomination papers to be issued by returning officers (RO) on December 19, while December 22-27 (excluding Quaid-i-Azam Day on December 25) were set as the dates for filing of nomination papers with the ROs by the candidates.







The names of nominated candidates will be published on December 29, while the nomination papers will be scrutinised by ROs from December 30 to January 3, 2026.
From January 5-8, appeals may be filed against the decisions of the ROs to accept or reject the nominations. These appeals will be decided by the Appellate Authority from January 9-13, and the revised candidate list will be published on January 14.
January 15 is the final day a candidate can withdraw from the elections, the day after which election symbols will be allotted and the list of contesting candidates published.
Polling will take place on February 15, with the results being consolidated between February 16 and 19.
The ECP, in its notification, added that polling hours will be observed from 8am to 4pm and that all polling activities would take place during office hours.</p><small>2025-12-25 14:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641497-nccia-arrests-34-in-online-scam-involving-foreign-pakistani-citizens' target='_blank'><strong>NCCIA arrests 34 in online scam involving foreign, Pakistani citizens</strong></a><br><p>
