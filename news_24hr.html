<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3016362667262ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938440/new-250-visa-fee-risks-deepening-us-travel-slump' target='_blank'><strong>New $250 visa fee risks deepening US travel slump</strong></a><br><p>A new $250 “visa integrity fee” imposed on travellers to the United States risks piling more pressure on the struggling travel industry, as overseas arrivals continue to fall due to President Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration and hostility to many foreign countries.
Overseas travel to the US fell 3.1 per cent year-on-year in July to 19.2 million visitors, according to US government data. It was the fifth month of decline this year, defying expectations that 2025 would see annual inbound visitors finally surpass the pre-pandemic level of 79.4m.
 
 

The new visa fee, set to go into effect on October 1, adds an additional hurdle for travellers from non-visa waiver countries such as Mexico, Argentina, India, Brazil and China. The extra charge raises the total visa cost to $442, one of the highest visitor fees in the world, according to the US Travel Association, a membership organisation.
“Any friction we add to the traveller experience is going to cut travel volumes by some amount,” said Gabe Rizzi, President of Altour, a global travel management company. “As the summer ends, this will become a more pressing issue, and we’ll have to factor the fees into travel budgets and documentation.”
International visitor spending in the US is projected to fall below $169 billion this year, down from $181bn in 2024, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.
The visa fee reinforces a bleak perception of the US under Trump, whose immigration policies, cuts to foreign aid and sweeping tariffs have eroded America’s appeal as a destination — even with major events such as the 2026 FIFA World Cup and Los Angeles 2028 Olympics on the horizon.
The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed government regulation that aims to tighten the duration of visas for students, cultural exchange visitors and members of the media.
In early August, the administration said the US could require bonds of up to $15,000 for some tourist and business visas under a pilot programme effective August 20 that will last for approximately a year, in an effort to crack down on visitors overstaying their visas.
Tourism Economics, an Oxford Economics consultancy, forecast in December 2024 that overseas travel to the US in 2025 would increase more than 10pc year-over-year. Instead, it is on track to fall 3pc, said Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics.
“We see it as a sustained setback, and we anticipate much of it is in place throughout the administration,” Ryan said.
Hardest hit
The newest visa fee is likely to hit hardest in Central and South American countries that have been a rare bright spot for US travel this year.
As of May, travel from Mexico to the US was up nearly 14pc in 2025, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office.
Arrivals from Argentina rose 20pc and from Brazil 4.6pc year-to-date. Overall, travel from Central America grew 3pc and from South America 0.7pc, compared with a decline of 2.3pc from Western Europe.

In China, arrivals have remained muted since the pandemic, with July numbers still 53pc below 2019 levels. The visa fee also threatens travel from India, where visits are down 2.4pc so far this year, driven by a near 18pc drop in students.
For some, the rise in fees will be absorbed as just another cost in an already expensive trip to the US.
“The US has always been selective about its visitors. If your financial standing isn’t up to par, getting a visa is tough anyway,“ said Su Shu, founder of Chinese firm Moment Travel in Chengdu.
As foreign visitors face higher entry fees, US travellers worry about stricter requirements being imposed abroad, said James Kitchen, travel agent and owner of Seas 2 Day & Travel.
“Travellers have expressed concern around reciprocal fees that may be imposed in the coming months,” Kitchen said.</p><small>2025-08-30 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621089-geo-news-team-assaulted-during-faisalabad-flood-coverage' target='_blank'><strong>Geo News team assaulted during Faisalabad flood coverage</strong></a><br><p>

The SCO summit, to be held in the northern port city of China’s Tianjin on Sunday and Monday, will gather more than 20 world leaders in a powerful show of Global South solidarity, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and India’s PM Narendra Modi.
Terming his visit “historic”, PM Shehbaz said on X today: “I look forward to meeting H.E. President Xi Jinping and other world leaders to further build upon our bilateral ties with China, our All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partner, as well as with other key countries of the region […]”
The premier expressed his aim to “enhance regional cooperation, strengthen multilateralism, and advance shared goals for peace and prosperity”.
 






According to a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa), the prime minister would hold meetings with President Xi and Premier Li Qiang, “during which multifaceted dimensions of Pakistan-China bilateral cooperation would be discussed”.
“He would also attend the military parade with President Xi and other world leaders being held in Beijing to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World’s Anti-Fascist War,” the Mofa added.
PM Shehbaz, as per the statement, would “interact with reputed Chinese businessmen and corporate executives to discuss bilateral trade, economic and investment ties”. He would also address a Pakistan-China B2B Investment Conference in Beijing.
The statement highlighted that the visit was a part of leadership-level exchanges between the two countries.
“It manifests the importance attached by the two countries to further deepen their All Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, reaffirm support on issues of respective core interests, advance Phase-II of CPEC and maintain regular communication on important regional and global developments,” Mofa said.
 






Ahead of Pakistan’s participation in the summit, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also posted on X, saying: “Pakistan’s all-weather strategic partnership with China is anchored in trust and strategic alignment. We value President Xi’s leadership and initiatives such as the Belt and Road, and the Global Development, Security & Civilization Initiatives, which continue to transform economies and strengthen regional integration.”
He added: “The SCO has become a pivotal Eurasian platform, advancing cooperation in security, trade, energy, connectivity, and culture under the principles of mutual trust and shared development.”
In today’s multipolar world, FM Dar said, the SCO’s role in promoting multilateralism, stability, and inclusive growth is more vital than ever.
 






Leaders from Central Asia, the Middle East, South Asia and Southeast Asia have been invited to the 25th SCO Heads of State Council.
The summit will also feature Modi’s first visit to China in more than seven years as the two neighbours work on further defusing tensions roiled by deadly border clashes in 2020.
Last week, the government said that PM Shehbaz’s visit to China will mark the formal launch of the second phase of the China­-Pakistan Economic Corr­idor (CPEC-II), focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.
“Prime minister’s upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC Phase-II, with both sides expected to set clear priorities and agree on tangible, measurable outcomes,” an official announcement had said, quoting Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, focal person on the multi-billion-dollar bilateral initiative.
In July, the two countries decided to form technical working groups to explore and implement projects focusing on high-yield cotton seed development, advanced water-saving irrigation technologies, and modern farming techniques.</p><small>2025-08-30 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/301526029f4fb39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938426/indonesia-protest-blaze-kills-3-as-anger-erupts-over-driver-death' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia protest blaze kills 3 as anger erupts over driver death</strong></a><br><p>A fire started by protesters at a council building in eastern Indonesia killed at least three people, a local official said on Saturday, after demonstrations across the country following the death of a man hit by a police vehicle.
Southeast Asia’s biggest economy was rocked by protests in major cities including the capital Jakarta on Friday after footage spread of a motorcycle taxi driver being run over by a police tactical vehicle in earlier rallies against low wages and financial perks for lawmakers.
Protests in Makassar, the biggest city on the eastern island of Sulawesi, descended into chaos outside the provincial and local city council buildings, which were both set on fire as demonstrators hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails.
Three people were killed as a result of the fire at the Makassar city council, its secretary Rahmat Mappatoba told AFP.
“They were trapped in the burning building,” he said, accusing protesters of igniting the blaze.
“Usually during a demonstration, protesters only throw rocks or burn a tyre in front of the office. They never stormed into the building or burned it.”
Two workers at the city council died at the scene and a third person, a civil servant, died in hospital.
At least four people were injured in the fire and were being treated at hospital, Rahmat added.
Hundreds of people were seen in footage posted by local media cheering and clapping as fire engulfed the building on Friday with few security forces in sight.
One man was heard shouting: “There are people upstairs!”
In footage verified by AFP, smouldering debris was seen falling from the roof of the city council building surrounded by palm trees as charred cars flickered with flames.
Inside protesters lit several fires as parts of the building collapsed, while others smashed glass and chanted “revolution”.
By Saturday, the building appeared to be a blacked-out wreck, with dozens of charred cars around it, as a crowd of locals turned up to inspect the scene, footage broadcast by local media showed.
Other images showed the South Sulawesi provincial council building ablaze overnight. Protesters had tried to knock down the gate and storm the building.
Makassar and South Sulawesi police did not immediately respond to AFP’s requests for comments.
Prabowo test
In Jakarta on Friday, hundreds massed outside the headquarters of the elite Mobile Brigade Corp (Brimob) paramilitary police unit they blamed for motorcycle gig driver Affan Kurniawan’s death the day before.
Protesters threw firecrackers as police responded with tear gas.
One group of demonstrators tried to tear down the gates of the unit, long accused of heavy-handed tactics, and pulled a sign from the building’s facade.
Police said they had detained seven officers for questioning in connection with Affan’s death.
The protests were the biggest and most violent of Prabowo Subianto’s presidency, a key test for the leader less than a year into his rule.
He has urged calm, and ordered an investigation into the driver’s death and that the officers involved be held accountable.
In a message posted on Instagram on Friday, Prabowo said the government was “committed to guaranteeing the livelihood” of the driver’s family, posting images with them at their home.
“In situations like this, I urge the public to remain calm and to trust the government that I lead,” he wrote on a post on X.
 






He has pledged fast, state-driven growth but has already faced protests for widespread government budget cuts to fund his populist policies including a billion-dollar free meal programme.
Protests this week have spread to other major cities, including Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang and Surabaya in Java, and Medan in North Sumatra province.</p><small>2025-08-30 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3015214955f6b91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938419/one-policeman-martyred-3-terrorists-killed-in-kohat-shootout' target='_blank'><strong>One policeman martyred, 3 terrorists killed in Kohat shootout</strong></a><br><p>At least one policeman was martyred and three terrorists were killed in a firing incident in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Kohat district, police said on Saturday.
According to Regional Police Officer Kohat Abbas Majeed Marwat, “One policeman was martyred and two others were injured in an operation against terrorists.”
He said, “Three terrorists have been killed and several others injured as police retaliated [against terrorists] in the mountains of Darmalak.” An operation is underway to arrest the injured terrorists, the official added.
“We will not let the sacrifices of our martyrs go in vain and our war against terrorism will continue.”
Earlier today, a statement from the Rescue 1122 read, “A tragic incident of firing on a police vehicle took place near the Darmalak police post in Kohat.”
As a result of the firing, one policeman was martyred on the spot and two policemen were injured, the statement said, adding that the injured officials were taken to Kohat District Headquarters Hospital.
Recent terrorist attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
Earlier this month, two Federal Constabulary personnel were martyred and 18 others were injured in a terrorist attack in KP’s Hangu district.
On August 14, five cops were martyred and another eight left injured as militants attacked police checkpoints at different locations across KP, including Peshawar, Upper Dir and Lower Dir.
Three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department in Bannu district in July.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-08-30 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621072-sindh-fears-over-16m-people-at-risk-amid-flood-threat' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh fears over 1.6m people at risk amid flood threat</strong></a><br><p>

The 11th NFC was constituted on August 22 to prepare a new award for sharing federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces.
Chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the NFC includes four provincial finance ministers and four non-statutory members, one from each province.
Its inaugural session, however, was postponed on the request of the Sindh government “due to the impending flood situation”.
As per the statement released today, the change became necessary after the “Government of Balochistan revised its nomination, recommending Mahfooz Ali Khan as its non ex-officio member in the 11th NFC”.
The statement added that the president has given the nod to this nomination, superseding the earlier approval.
The terms of reference set under clause 2 of Article 160 require the 11th NFC to distribute between the federation and provinces the net proceeds of five major tax categories as explained in clause 3 of Article 160.
These include: taxes on income (including corporation tax but excluding salaries paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund); taxes on the sale and purchase of imported, exported, produced, manufactured, or consumed goods; export duties on cotton and other duties as specified by the president; excise duties; and any other taxes specified by the president.
The notification for the 11th NFC also mandates recommendations on grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provinces, and on the exercise of borrowing powers by both tiers of government.
The new NFC is further tasked with considering sharing of expenditures incurred, or to be incurred, by the federation in respect of matters falling within the provinces’ domain; expenditures on trans-national issues; and financial responsibility for national projects to be shared by both the Centre and provinces.
This apparently indicates the Centre’s intention to push for provincial contributions toward natural calamities, horizontal health programmes, major dams, highways, and motorways. The federal government has also been advocating for an end to population-based incentives, replacing them with social sector performance, along with activation of local governments.
The NFC will also determine grants-in-aid from the Centre to the provinces, set borrowing powers and conditions for both, and assess resources required to meet expenditures of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and the newly merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (erstwhile Fata).</p><small>2025-08-30 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/3012554201aede8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1938410/lahore-atc-sends-imran-khans-triathlete-nephew-shahrez-to-jail-on-14-day-judicial-remand' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC sends Imran Khan’s triathlete nephew Shahrez to jail on 14-day judicial remand</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Saturday sent PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shahrez Khan to jail on judicial remand in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023 riots.
Lahore Police picked up Shahrez, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from his mother’s Lahore residence on August 21. His brother Shershah Khan was also arrested the next day over similar allegations, and sent on physical remand and then to jail.
Lahore police presented Shahrez before the court of ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill today upon the completion of his eight-day physical remand.
Advocate Rana Mudassar Umer and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja appeared as Shahrez’s counsel, while Imtiaz Ahmad Sipra was present as the prosecutor.
 
 

Sipra sought a further 30-day physical custody of Shahrez, while Umer urged the court to discharge his client from the case. Judge Gill denied the police’s request and ordered that Shahrez be sent to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.
“A cane has been recovered from the suspect’s possession,” the officer told the court, adding that Shahrez’s photogrammetry test had been conducted as well.
“Further investigation of the incident needs to be completed. Hence, further remand may be given,” Sipra said. He further said that Shahrez’s social media accounts also need to be verified, according to today’s court order, seen by Dawn.com.
Meanwhile, Advocate Umer filed a bail plea for Shahrez before the ATC. “No recovery of any kind was done from the suspect. The investigation has been completed,” the petition contended.
Terming Shahrez’s arrest “illegal”, the plea requested the court to order the triathlete’s release.
‘In Chitral on May 9’
Shahrez’s lawyers submitted photocopies of affidavits of seven people who either travelled with him or were residing at Chitral on May 9, according to the court order.
“Learned defence counsels representing the accused during the course of arguments have tendered some photographs, affidavits as well as detail of foreign trips of the accused,” the court order noted, adding that the defence lawyers had argued that Shahrez was not in Lahore from May 7 to May 12, 2023 but in Chitral.

According to the order, the investigating officer was asked whether he had considered the evidence, to which he replied that the documents were presented at about 12am, hence he could not verify or investigate them.
“This court is of the view that verification of social media accounts, air travel history and participation of the accused in international sports events could easily be verified and searched out through Google, social media and newspapers, etc, without taking into custody of the accused on physical remand.”
Judge Gill directed that Shahrez be presented before the court on September 13, and ordered the IO to submit the charge sheet by then.
During the hearing, Advocate Umer contended that the suspect was not present in Lahore on May 9, 2023 but was with family and friends in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chitral.
“The statement of the hotel manager where he stayed is also available,” Umer said.
“The suspect has been involved in this [case] because he is the PTI founder’s nephew,” the lawyer claimed. He added that no statement of Shahrez’s inclusion in the case was part of the record.
“Aleema Khan raises her voice for the PTI founder’s release. Aleema Khan’s son has been arrested to silence her voice,” Umer contended.
Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan have expressed their concerns over the arrests of Shahrez and Shershah, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
 
 

Shahrez’s wife has said her husband was in Chitral with her family on May 9, 2023, sharing purported pictures from the trip. At the same time, the PTI has challenged a video being shared of Shahrez, stating it was from the party’s public meeting in Kahna held on Sept 21, 2024, not from the 2023 riots.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests last week, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-08-30 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621044-war-then-water-punjab-border-villagers-face-back-to-back-evacuations' target='_blank'><strong>War then water: Punjab's border villagers face back-to-back evacuations</strong></a><br><p>

It was the second time this year she has had to flee, after abandoning her home during cross-border fighting between India and Pakistan in May.
“How many times do we need to evacuate now?” the 30-year-old mother said, her husband away ferrying their 10 cows to higher ground on a boat. “We lost out on so much during the war like school days for the children, and now the water is forcing us out again. Trouble is trouble.”

Shama’s ordeal is echoed across flood-hit Kasur, where families say they are exhausted by repeated displacements within months, first from the fighting, now from nature.
“The floods started earlier this month and only got worse,” said 27-year-old mother Bibi Zubaida, who lives with seven relatives in a three-bedroom house opposite a mosque that now broadcasts evacuation calls.
From the mosque loudspeakers, usually reserved for the call to prayer, came a different message: boats were ready for anyone who wanted to leave.
“When you live here, you choose to live with the threat of war and the threat of floods. Where does one go?” Zubaida said.
Kasur lies just a few kilometres from the Indian border. From their rooftops and rescue boats, residents said they could see Indian checkposts across the horizon, a reminder of how closely their fate is tied to decisions made on the other side.

The nations share rivers that were regulated for more than six decades under the Indus Waters Treaty. That agreement was suspended by India earlier this year, following the shooting of 26 people by militants that New Delhi said were backed by Islamabad, which Pakistan denies.
That attack triggered brief but intense cross-border battles between the nuclear-armed neighbours, driving villagers like Shama from their homes.
Then came the monsoon, and the rivers turned to flood.
On narrow wooden boats, families balanced motorcycles, belongings, and bleating goats alongside their children, as rescue workers steered them through fields now turned into rivers.
Rescue worker Muhammad Arsalan said many villagers hesitated to evacuate.
“People don’t always want to leave because they’re scared of thieves stealing what they’re leaving behind. They’re reluctant because they’ve done it so many times already,” said Arsalan, who has ferried more than 1,500 people to safety by boat in recent days.
“They love their goats and sheep, and sometimes refuse to leave without them,” he added, pausing to clear leaves stuck in the motor before restarting another run.

In India, cloud bursts in Ramban and Mahore regions of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir killed 10 people. Pakistani officials said the crisis was worsened by India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, halting the decades-old exchange of river data.
Islamabad also accused India of releasing large volumes of water without adequate warning.
“If the treaty was in operation, we could have managed the impact better,” Pakistan’s Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal told Reuters on Friday.
India has denied deliberately flooding Pakistan. It has blamed incessant monsoon rains and said it issued multiple flood alerts. Two gates of the Madhopur barrage on the Ravi River were damaged by surging water, Indian officials said.
Farmers say the deluge has wrecked their livelihoods. “Thirteen of my 15 acres are gone,” said Muhammad Amjad, a rice and vegetable grower. “Women and children are mainly evacuated. Men stay behind to guard whats left.”
The back-to-back displacements have underscored the vulnerability of communities straddling Pakistan’s volatile eastern border.
Officials warn the crisis could worsen as climate change intensifies monsoons and cross-border river disputes strain disaster planning.
“I’ve seen many floods, but they are coming too often now,” said Nawabuddin, a 74-year-old landowner, recalling the most memorable floods he witnessed in his lifetime — 1988, 2023 and now this one.
“We don’t want war, we don’t want excess water. We just want to live,” said Zubaida, whose newly renovated home and farmland now lie underwater.

“Because it might put you at a high risk (with) the Taliban, because in Afghanistan, women cannot play football,” Safdari told Reuters, fighting back tears.
Four years later, the sound of laughter and the thud of footballs echoed across a pitch tucked away at St George’s Park in west-central England this week, as world soccer’s governing body FIFA held an ID camp for an Afghan refugee team.
Safdari said the week was “emotional, full of love and joy.”

The camp was a chance to reconnect with teammates who share not just a love of the game, but a history of heartbreak and resilience. It was also a declaration of resistance.
“We want to use football as a powerful platform to represent the girls in Afghanistan, that we are not forgetting them,” said defender Najma Arefi, who was 18 when she fled Kabul.
“A dog on the street has more rights than a woman in Afghanistan. It makes me so emotional to talk about (female friends and family still there), the fact that they lost their dreams, they lost everything.

“We want to show the world that even if you’re closing your eyes, we’re still here. We’re still going to speak about them. We are not afraid.”

The global ID camp, the last of three led by coach Pauline Hamill, was part of FIFA’s efforts to build a 23-player squad for international friendly tournaments.
While FIFA President Gianni Infantino called the initiative an “important step in the right direction,” Safdari said Afghan women will not stop fighting for full international status.
“I was so close to my dream, and the Taliban took my dream away,” Safdari said.
“It’s a wonderful step from FIFA that they (are organising) these tournaments, but our aim is bigger. We are asking FIFA to allow us to be recognised and play on the international stage and represent our country in exile.”

Women’s sports
Unlike Afghanistan’s men’s team who continue to play under the national banner, the Taliban-controlled Afghan Football Federation has banned women’s sports.
While Safdari and Arefi found safety in Doncaster, England, their move was fraught with isolation and language barriers. Neither spoke English when they arrived.
“It was a tough journey,” said Safdari, who lives with siblings as her parents are still in Afghanistan.
“Being a refugee in England wasn’t easy. I couldn’t speak the language, it was a new society, and I felt like I had no one to support me.

“But, little by little, football gave me the strength and power to build up again.”

Arefi, who hopes to be a human rights lawyer, said she had always found solace in football.
“It was a way to feel free, leaving every struggle that we had in our life behind,” added Arefi, who won a national championship in 2021 with Herat City.
“On the pitch, there was passion, joy and freedom that was keeping us going.”
Safdari clutched a goalkeeping trophy and an Afghan shirt, treasures her parents managed to ship to her.
“When I look at this jersey, I’m telling myself I’m playing for all the women and girls told to be silent,” she said.
“Every time I wear my boots on the pitch, I’m playing for all those women who can’t even go for a walk the very basic human rights.”

Hamill said the opportunity to coach the team has had her pinching herself.
“When the opportunity comes to really make a difference, I think that you have to grab it with both hands,” said the former Scotland international.
“Thinking about what the players have been through really just immediately connects you with them, where you really want to support them and be part of giving them an amazing experience in football.
“They’re alive on the pitch, it’s their happy place, they get to do something they love.”

The 50 per cent levies on many Indian imports into the United States took effect this week as punishment for New Delhi’s massive purchases of Russian oil, part of US efforts to pressure Moscow into ending its war in Ukraine.
Since his return to the White House this year, US President Donald Trump has wielded tariffs as a wide-ranging policy tool, with the levies upending global trade.
Speaking at a construction industry event in New Delhi on Friday, Goyal said India was “always ready if anyone wants to have a free trade agreement with us”.
But, the trade minister added, India “will neither bow down nor ever appear weak”. “We will continue to move together and capture new markets.”
 
 

The latest tariffs salvo from Trump has strained US-India ties, with New Delhi earlier criticising the levies as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”.
Trade talks between the two countries have stumbled over agriculture and dairy markets.
Trump wants greater US access, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is determined to shield India’s farmers, a huge voter bloc.
The US was India’s top export destination in 2024, with shipments worth $87.3 billion.
But analysts have cautioned that a 50pc duty is akin to a trade embargo and is likely to harm smaller firms.
Exporters of textiles, seafood and jewelry have already reported cancelled US orders and losses to rivals such as Bangladesh and Vietnam, raising fears of heavy job cuts.
Goyal said the government would be coming out with several measures in the coming days to support every sector and boost exports.
“I can say with confidence that India’s exports this year will exceed 2024-25 numbers,” he said.</p><small>2025-08-30 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621032-pro-ttp-elements-present-in-afghan-govt-says-dpm-ishaq-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pro-TTP elements present in Afghan govt: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

Donald Trump has abruptly changed that, slapping 50 per cent tariffs on many Indian products as he seeks to punish it for buying oil from Russia.
India was a Cold War partner of Moscow, but since the 1990s US leaders have hoped for a joint front with fellow democracy India in the face of the rise of China.
In striking timing, Indian PM Narendra Modi heads to China this weekend, the latest meeting bet­ween the world’s two most populous nations as they explore areas of common ground.

The Modi-Trump bromance has faltered after the latter started taking credit for the ceasefire with Pakistan

Trump has accused India of fueling Moscow’s deadly attacks on Ukraine by purchasing Russian oil. Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro even called Ukraine “Modi’s war” in a Bloomberg TV interview.
Yet Trump has refrained from tougher US sanctions on Russia itself, saying he still hopes for a negotiated settlement.
“This is not just about tariffs, not just about Russia, not just about oil,” said Tanvi Madan of the Broo­k­ings Institution.
“There seems to be something broader going on here — personal on Trump’s side, piqued as he may be at India,” she said.
“And then on the Indian side, for Modi, it becomes a political issue.”
Faltering bromance
Trump and Modi appeared to forge a strong bond during Trump’s first term.
In 2020, Trump rejoiced as Modi invited him to inaugurate the world’s largest cricket stadium in front more than 120,000 people.
But Trump has since appeared irritated as he seeks credit for what he said was Nobel Prize-worthy diplomacy between Pakistan and India in May.
India, which adamantly rejects any third-party mediation on held Kashmir, has since given the cold shoulder to Trump as he muses of brokering between New Delhi and Islamabad.
Pakistan, by contrast, has emb­raced Trump’s attention, with its army chief meeting him at the White House.
US policymakers have long ski­rted around India’s sensitivities on Kashmir and sought to contain fallout from disagreements on other issues.
 
 

Jake Sullivan, national security adviser under Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, said that Trump had broken a bipartisan consensus with his “massive trade offensive” against India.
India is now thinking “I guess maybe we have to go show up in Beijing and sit with the Chinese because we’ve got to hedge against America,” Sullivan told The Bulwark.
Madan said that for the Indian establishment, the tariffs contradicted US assurances that unlike China, Washington would not use “economic ties to coerce India.” “If you’re India, even if you sort this particular issue out, you’re now saying, we used to see this increasing interaction with the US across many domains as an opportunity,” she said.
“And now Trump has made us realise that we should also see that integration or dependence as a vulnerability.”
Chance for China
For China, Modi’s trip is an opportunity “to drive a wedge between India and the US,” said William Yang, an analyst at the International Crisis Group.
“Beijing won’t miss the opportunity to present itself as a ‘reliable partner’ that is interested in deepening relations with New Delhi,” he said.
But he noted that India and China still had fundamental differences.
China is the key partner and military supplier of Pakistan and has sought to ramp up influence in the Indian Ocean.

Right-handed Salman hit a 36-ball 53 not out with three sixes and as many boundaries which lifted Pakistan to a solid 182-7 in their 20 overs.
Haris took 4-31 while fellow pacer Shaheen Afridi claimed 2-21, while spinners Mohammad Nawaz (2-23) and Sufiyan Muq­eem (2-25) dismissed Afghanistan for 143 in 19.5 overs before a noisy capacity 16,000 crowd at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.
 






Afghanistan matched Pakistan with opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz, 27-ball 38 with a six and three boundaries, adding 51 for the second wicket with Sediqullah Atal, who made 23.
It was right-armer Haris who changed the game with a two-wicket 12th over sending Atal and Karim Janat back without conceding a run.
Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan smashed five sixes and a four in his whirlwind 16-ball 39 but fell to Haris to end his team’s fight.
Salman, who was named man-of-the-match for his fighting knock, said staying at the wicket helped him score solidly later on.
 






“I saw the first seven-eight overs, it was holding [for the spinners when they bowled slow and for the change-ups of pacers]. I knew that if I could get in, I could hit sixes against any bowlers, and that is what I did,” Salman said in his post-match talk.
Commenting on Pakistan’s batting against spin bowling, the skipper said that the team were ready for the challenge.
“I am not as good as I used to be, but we came here ten days early, and we know there is going to be a lot of spin and we are up to that challenge,” he said.
On his team bowlers’ show, he said, “[Our] bowling was outstanding. Whoever came in, they bowled hard lengths. We knew there were going to be lot of slower balls. They [Haris and Shaheen] are some of the best fast bowlers in the world.
“Even [Sufiyan] Muqeem as well was impressive. The pick of the bowlers for me was [Mohammad] Nawaz. He always bowls difficult overs. It is not easy for a finger-spinner and he is doing so well - I am so happy for him. Scoring above par [today], it was a 150-160 kind of wicket, we scored 180-odd and we knew it would be challenging for them [Afghanistan].”
Earlier, Pakistan elected to bat first and were lifted by Salman’s fourth T20I half-century.
He anchored the innings admirably well after opener Sahibzada Farhan smashed two sixes and a boundary in his 10-ball 21 as Pakistan ended the batting powerplay at 54-1.
Salman added 53 for the fifth wicket with left-handed Mohammad Nawaz whose 11-ball 21 had two sixes and a boundary as the duo helped Pakistan get 51 runs in the last five overs.
Rashid, on his rearguard action with the bat, said, “It was needed at the end. We had it in our mind…that run-rate is something that matters. As long as I can try my best to get close to the target, and luckily we got some runs there.
“I feel this is a wicket of 190-200.”
Pakistan in their next tri-series match face hosts United Arab Emirates on Saturday.
All three teams face other each other twice with the top two playing the Sept 7 final.
The event is a build-up to the Asia Cup that starts on Sept 9.

A meeting, chaired by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah to review the flood situation in the province, was informed by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and the irrigation department that a high flood was expected to hit Guddu Barrage between Sept 3 and 4, potentially displacing over 52,000 families.
The CM instructed the PDMA and district administrations to get ready to establish more than 500 camps along river embankments to protect affected communities and livestock. “In case of a major flood wave, not a single life, human or animal, should be lost,” he stressed.
He also directed the deployment of over 30,000 personnel of Rescue-1122 and 178 boats — 72 in northern districts and 106 in southern districts — to respond to potential emergencies and support relocation efforts.

A press statement said that the meeting at the CM House was attended among others by provincial ministers Sharjeel Memon and Makhdoom Mahboob Zaman, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, PDMA Director General Salman Shah and others, while commissioners and DIGs participated in the meeting through a video link.
In view of the likely displacement of people, the chief minister directed to send boats in six vulnerable areas in Sukkur, four each in Ghotki, Khairpur, Shikarpur, Naushahro Feroze and Dadu, and three vulnerable areas in Shaheed Benazirabad.
The CM was informed that the Pakistan Navy had kept 26 boats on standby to support relief operations.
As for PDMA’s stock position, he was told that ample relief supplies — including mosquito nets, blankets, first-aid kits, kitchen sets, mattresses, plastic mats, portable toilets, quilts, jerry cans, sleeping mats, tents, de-watering pumps, and generators — were available for deployment.
Later, the chief minister, taking into account the vulnerability of the situation, decided to visit Guddu Barrage and Sukkur Barrage to assess preparedness and conducted an aerial survey of the vulnerable Indus embankments.
Water level being monitored: Sharjeel
Separately, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said the provincial government has taken comprehensive emergency measures at all levels to deal with the possible flood situation.
He said that water levels at Guddu, Sukkur and Kotri barrages are being continuously monitored and the situation was currently under control, but alternative plans were in place to respond to any emergency, said a press release.

After hearing prosecutor Irfana Qadri, complainant counsel Bahzad Akbar and defence side, Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Zahoor Chandio, who was also the presiding officer of the Gender-Based Violence Court (South), found Muhammad Ramzan guilty of throwing acid on his sister Sughra after she refused to give up her share in the inheritance property to her brother.  
“This case involves a heinous crime, specifically targeting a woman with acid, an act that causes lifelong physical and psychological trauma. Such offences are not merely crimes against an individual but are a scourge on society and an affront to public policy,” the judge observed.  
The court also handed down additional sentences; two years’ imprisonment for injuring with a knife to the victim and four years each for attacking her sons — Naeem and Waseem — who had rushed to rescue their mother.  
The court also imposed a total compensation of Rs450,000 for injuring the victims.  
According to the state prosecutor, in November 2022 the victim had gone to her brother’s house in Manzoor Colony, where he (the accused) threw acid on her. However, she managed to escape and ran to a nearby house, but the accused chased her and again attacked her and her sons with a knife.  
The prosecutor further stated that the accused had lost his share of the inheritance in gambling and was putting pressure on his sister to hand over her share to him, and over her refusal, he threw acid on her.  
In its order, the court noted that the accused in his statement claimed innocence and denied the allegations.  
However, it added that the accused failed to provide any alternative version of the events or offer any plausible explanation for the injuries sustained by the victims.

This alarming situation has exposed serious lapses on the part of the Prisons Department and the Punjab Aids Control Programme (PACP).
Adiala has been in the headlines lately as former PM Imran Khan is also incarcerated there. However, it must be kept in mind that Mr Khan is kept in isolation and is not allowed to mingle with other inmates.
The prison is currently very overcrowded as well, housing 4,337 prisoners against its authorised capacity of 1,994.

PACP report reveals there are 645 infected individuals in Punjab’s 43 prisons; some of them are already receiving anti-retroviral therapy

The presence of such a large number of HIV-infected prisoners poses a grave risk to the health and lives of other inmates if immediate measures are not taken to curb the transmission of the virus.
 
 

Medical experts explain that HIV attacks the body’s immune system, and remains incurable.
“Once you contract the infection, your body cannot get rid of it. However, there are medicines that can control HIV and prevent complications. Everyone diagnosed with HIV should be placed on Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART),” one medical expert said.
They expressed serious concern that if a high-profile prison like Adiala is struggling to contain the rapid spread of HIV/Aids, the situation in other jails could be even worse.
Numbers
The PACP report sheds light on the number of prisoners suffering from HIV/Aids across the province. It reveals that the number of HIV-positive inmates in all of Punjab’s 43 prisons has reached 645, with the highest number of cases being reported from Adiala Jail, where 148 inmates have tested positive for HIV.
According to official figures, 83 inmates were tested positive for the HIV/Aids in District Jail Lahore (also known as Camp Jail), followed by 37 in Central Jail Faisalabad, and 27 each in Central Jail Lahore (also known as Kot Lakhpat prison) and Central Jail Gujranwala.
 
 

In the remaining 38 prisons of Punjab, the combined number of HIV-positive inmates stands at 323. An official privy to the development claimed that several HIV-positive inmates were facing an interruption in the provision of medicines in the jails.
As per the PACP protocols, after screening process, jail authorities shift the suspected HIV patient to the ART centre of the district concerned, where the inmate undergoes further testing to confirmation the diagnosis.
It repeats tests using elaborate methods, and after confirmation that the inmate has tested positive, it shifts them back to prison, where the programme provides them with medicines for a three-month period.
PACP teams normally visit jails and perform screening of all inmates every six months or so.
Alarming situation
The HIV/Aids outbreak in the jails of Punjab, particularly, in Adiala, has caused alarm among PACP authorities.
This was evident from an official correspondence, wherein the PACP head immediately activated all the ART Centres established under the programme.
“All ART Centres shall undertake fortnightly visits to jails within their respective districts to ascertain the total number of HIV-positive patients registered from the jail and the number of those presently receiving Anti-Retroviral Therapy,” reads a letter issued by PACP Project Director Dr Summaira Ashraf.
She emphasised that the centres must ensure all registered jail patients continue to receive treatment without interruption and any gaps, deficiencies or challenges observed during the visit must be clearly identified and reported.
Talking to Dawn, Punjab Inspector General (Prisons) Mian Farooq Nazeer said the PACP had taken over responsibility of screening all new inmates for various diseases, including HIV/Aids and hepatitis B and C, a couple of years ago.
Following the guidelines, the programme was to provide kits at the health facilities of each jail where the prisoners were tested for chronic diseases, adding that jail doctors would then perform tests on the patients under the programme’s guidelines. However, he maintained that his department had nothing to do with the screening of inmates entering or leaving prisons.

He added that a National Industrial Policy was also in the works to strengthen long-term export prospects and position Pakistan’s manufacturing sector for global integration. Both initiatives are designed to enhance competitiveness and address longstanding inefficiencies.
The minister was speaking at a meeting with leading industrialists, including Kohinoor Mills CEO Aamir Fayyaz Sheikh, Aptma Chairman Kamran Ars­had, Fazal Cloth CEO Rehman Naseem, and Aptma Executive Director Shahid Sattar. Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan also attended.
According to an official statement, the commerce minister said the Textiles and Apparel Policy will focus on reducing manufacturing costs, improving productivity, promoting research and development, diversifying markets and products, and increasing Pakistan’s share in global trade.
He stressed that export growth must be Pakistan’s priority and assured stakeholders that policy decisions would be made in consultation with industry representatives. For the first time, he said, the government and industry were aligned in their determination to revive and expand exports.
Mr Jam also welcomed Aptma’s proposal to study the policies of regional competitors. Sharing insights from his recent visit to Dhaka, he noted Bangladesh’s success in industrial growth and readymade garment exports.
Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar said the National Industrial Policy would go beyond a few sectors to cover the entire industrial landscape. It would address energy, tariffs and taxation, financing, and economic zones, while also facilitating Greenfield projects, introducing land-lease models under public-private partnerships, and establishing a one-window facility for investors.
He added that under the vision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the new policy would inject momentum into industrial growth nationwide.
Industry’s concerns
The Aptma delegation urged the government to eliminate structural inefficiencies and create an enabling environment to boost competitiveness of export sectors.
The meeting concluded on a note of optimism, with both sides expressing confidence in boosting exports through sustainable policy support and collaborative efforts.

• Fund’s ‘Diagnosis Report’ flags poor prioritisation, delays, cost overruns as major shortcomings
• NHA told to start M-6 work by October or face parliamentary action
ISLAMABAD: The government has restricted financing for new projects under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) to just two per cent for the current year, in line with conditions of the ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
This was disclosed by Planning and Development Secretary Awais Manzur Sumra while briefing the Senate Standing Committee on Planning and Development, which met under the chairmanship of Senator Quratulain Marri.
Mr Sumra said the IMF had demanded that new development projects be limited to 10pc of the PSDP to maintain fiscal discipline, given the already large and longstanding project portfolio.
Accordingly, the government decided to prioritise ongoing projects of national importance for early completion, allocating only 2pc of PSDP funds for new schemes in the current budget. He said 2,518 projects worth Rs344 billion were completed or closed down in this process.
The secretary informed the committee that the IMF had also sent a questionnaire covering multiple areas, including Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and Public Investment Management (PIM), which were directly linked to the Planning Commission. Pakistan submitted the completed questionnaire on March 20, 2025.
While discussing the IMF’s Diagnosis Report, it was revealed that the lender had pointed out weak project prioritisation, frequent delays, cost overruns, and inadequate protection of funds for approved projects as major shortcomings. The committee chair stressed that, in line with its earlier recommendations, ongoing projects should be completed before new ones are taken up.
On the panel’s previous recommendations, Mr Sumra said the standing committee had made 22 proposals, some of which had been implemented while others remained under consideration. The committee demanded a detailed compliance report on projects recommended by senators, but the ministry sought more time. The chair directed that the relevant ministries be called to the next meeting to present their reports.
 
 

Mr Sumra also briefed the committee on the Intelligent Project Automation System (iPAS), designed to streamline development processes by integrating systems, improving budget detail, and automating budget releases.
Two major projects
The National Highway Authority (NHA) presented updates on two major projects — the Sukkur-Hyderabad-Karachi Motorway (M-6) and Karachi-Quetta-Chaman Road (N-25).
The committee members were informed that the M-6 comprises five sections between Hyderabad and Sukkur. In the first phase, the Noushehroferoz-Ranipur and Ranipur-Sukkur sections were being prioritised, with formal approvals expected in September 2025.
The committee was told that the Islamic Development Bank would fund two sections of M-6, while negotiations with the Saudi Development Fund and Opec Fund for International Development were underway. A delegation from the Saudi Development Fund is scheduled to visit Pakistan in October.
On the Karachi-Hyderabad (M-10) Motorway, the committee was informed that the six-lane, 168km-long project had a preliminary estimated cost of Rs254bn, with final estimates to be determined after detailed design and commercial feasibility. It will be included in next year’s PSDP.
The committee chairperson expressed strong concern over NHA’s performance on the M-6 project, noting that the authority had already lost four months and was now seeking another four to finalise decisions under the PPP model. She directed the NHA to ensure work on the project begins by October 2025, warning that if the deadline was missed, the matter would be referred to the upper house of parliament for intervention.
She also instructed that the Economic Affairs Division and other relevant departments be called to the next meeting to brief the committee on measures for timely implementation.

• Iranian president offers condolences and assistance
• Army chief visits Sialkot, Shakargarh, Narowal and Kartarpur flood-hit areas; assures Sikh community of Darbar Sahib’s restoration
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Friday announced that the federal government was preparing a comprehensive strategy with consultation of all federating units for the construction of water reservoirs and impro­ved water management across the country, as devastating floods continued to wreak havoc.
According to the PM Office, the prime minister said that water reservoirs would be built through consultation and complete coordination with the provinces. “Climate change is a reality, and only through effective preparedness can the damages of natural disasters be minimised,” he was quoted as saying.
 






The PM underlined that all provinces, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and the centre must work together to safeguard people from the adverse impacts of climate change, terming it a national issue that requires collective effort.
Relevant quarters are already working on his directives to formulate an effective policy for timely response to the impacts of climate change and the monsoon. The working paper of this policy will be shared with all provincial governments to devise a joint course of action.
 
 

The statement added that once the emergency situation subsides, the prime minister will convene a high-level meeting with the chief ministers of all four provinces, along with the heads of relevant institutions. The prime minister of AJ&K and the chief minister of Gilgit-Baltistan will also be invited to the session.
At the same time, the premier appreciated the gesture of Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) employees for donating their one-day salary, amounting to Rs20 million, to support flood victims.
Iran offers help
Also on Friday, the prime minister received a telephone call from the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, who conveyed his condolences and solidarity with the people of Pakistan over the devastation caused by the ongoing floods in various parts of the country.
Expressing sympathy with the bereaved families who lost loved ones and property in the calamity, President Pezeshkian assured that Iran stood by Pakistan in this difficult time and offered whatever assistance his country could extend to the flood-affected population.
 






The prime minister thanked President Pezeshkian for his thoughtful gesture and Iran’s expression of support, terming it a reflection of the deep fraternal ties between the two nations. He also requested that his warm regards and good wishes be conveyed to the Supreme Leader Ayatullah Ali Khamenei.
Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and expressed keen anticipation of their interaction at the upcoming SCO Summit in Tianjin, China, reports APP.
COAS visits flood-hit areas
Meanwhile, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited flood-affected areas of Punjab, including the Sialkot
Sector, Shakargarh, Narowal, and Kartarpur, to review the situation and ongoing rescue and relief efforts.
During his visit, the COAS interacted with the affected Sikh community and assured them that all religious sites damaged during the floods, including Darbar Sahib Kartarpur, would be fully restored to their original condition on priority.
 


He reiterated that it is the responsibility of the state and its institutions to protect the minorities and their religious sites and the state of Pakistan will leave no stone unturned to uphold its responsibility towards the minorities.
The Sikh community warmly welcomed the army chief at the flood-affected areas of Sialkot Sector and thanked the army and civil administration for their services during the calamity.
Gen Asim Munir also conducted an aerial survey of Durbar Sahib Kartarpur. While interacting with representatives of civil administration, he appreciated their proactive response, which helped minimise the loss of lives and property.

The middle section of Madhopur barra­­ge, which spans the Ravi River in India, was washed away by surging water, the Reu­ters news agency reported, referring to video broadcast by Indian media a day earlier.
Pakistani officials said that this damage unleashed an uncontrolled flow across the border, flooding some parts of Lahore on Friday.
 
 

An Indian government source, while confirming that two gates of Madhopur barrage had broken, denied there had been any deliberate attempt to flood Pakistan.
Indian authorities say they are trying to stem the flow on the Ravi, despite the damage to the barrage, and the flow was being controlled by the Ranjit Sagar Dam upst­ream, Reuters quoted a source as saying.
The official claimed that India was doing whatever it could, blaming incessant rain for causing the flood.

• Calls for revised Afghan refugee policy that balances humanitarian obligations and national security
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Friday expressed concern over the lack of preparedness of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) governments and their failure to act on early warnings issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
A meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and States and Frontier Regions, presided over by Senator Asad Qasim at the Parliament House, voiced displeasure over the absence of the GB chief secretary, stressing that the participation of senior officials was vital for effective parliamentary deliberations and meaningful decision-making.
The committee decided to defer the agenda pertaining to Gilgit-Baltistan and directed that senior GB officers must ensure their presence at future meetings.
Senators Faisal Saleem Rehman, Attaul Haq and Nadeem Ahmed Bhutto, the ministry’s additional secretary and senior officials from relevant departments attended the meeting. The committee members were briefed on monsoon-induced damage, relief operations, and tourism-related challenges in Azad Kashmir.
 






The State Disaster Management Authority secretary informed the meeting that since June 26, AJK had faced nine spells of monsoon rains following a May cloudburst. These disasters claimed 28 lives, damaged over 2,100 houses and caused extensive destruction of public infrastructure, including roads, water supply schemes, schools and electricity networks.
Committee Chairman Asad Qasim observed that despite NDMA alerts, tourists were not restricted from entering vulnerable areas, which was the responsibility of the local administration. He also noted the absence of early warning systems in disaster-prone zones and suggested installing such systems at 100-kilometre intervals across AJK.
On financial matters, the chairman raised concerns over the monitoring of relief funds, including Rs3 billion provided by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet. He suggested setting up an ad hoc oversight mechanism comprising parliamentarians, the judiciary and other stakeholders to ensure transparency and accountability.
Mr Qasim also questioned the accuracy of official data, warning that incomplete surveys and underreporting undermined public trust.
 
 

About communication infrastructure, the senators regretted that private operators had failed to provide services in remote areas, leaving the Special Communication Organ­isation (SCO) as the only functioning network during calamities.
The committee recommended that the Universal Services Fund be used to expand coverage, particularly in tourist areas, as required by the law.
Refugee policy
The committee also called for a revised and coordinated policy on Afghan refugees that balances humanitarian obligations with national security needs.
Phase III of the deportation plan will begin on September 1, targeting Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards. The committee was briefed on the role and scope of the Commissionerate for Afghan Refugees (CCAR).
The CCAR chief commissioner informed the committee that, following the expiry of the voluntary repatriation deadline, Afghan refugees’ status had been changed to “aliens”.
 
 

The government’s “Illegal Foreigners Repa­triation Plan”, announced in October 2023, required all undocumented migr­ants to leave under a three-phase regime. Phase I, launched in October 2023, covered the return of all illegal foreigners. Phase II, beginning April 1, 2025, included the deportation of illegal foreigners along with Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders. Since then, about 48,000 ACC holders have been deported. Phase III, starting September 1, will focus on POR card holders.
CCAR officials said that around 300,000 Afghans had voluntarily returned so far, with Sindh hosting nearly 80,000 refugees, and significant numbers residing in KP and Balochistan.
The committee members observed that undocumented refugees remained undercounted, while international funding for refugee management had largely dried up.
The officials said cooperation with the UNHCR was limited to humanitarian support, as agreements last revised in 2009 had expired.
The committee also sought clarity on the ownership of 54 refugee camps and their associated land assets.
“You know the numbers, you know the funds received, now we must ensure accountability, inter-ministerial cooperation, and clarity on the way forward,” the committee chairman said.

• Worst Sutlej flooding since 1955 compounded by Indian dam breach
LAHORE: In an unprecedented flood crisis, the Punjab government has initiated controlled breaches of key flood bunds to divert surging waters from the Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers, as all three major rivers overflowed simultaneously for the first time in the country’s history.
With 855,000 cusecs expected to reach Head Trimmu within 24 hours, authorities have evacuated over 429,000 residents, deploying explosives and breaching embankments to protect urban centres from catastrophic flooding.
Torrential monsoon rains ravaged both Pakistan and India this week, with further heavy downpours forecast for this weekend.
Bunds near Athara Hazari in Jhang district were breached to relieve pressure on Head Trimmu, situated downstream of the confluence of the Jhelum and Chenab rivers.
To prevent inundation of Jhang city, the Rivaz Bridge flood bund was breached, and residents from adjacent villages were evacuated. Explosives were deployed near Rungpur and Sher Shah bunds to divert water away from Head Muhammad Wala, where a surge of up to 800,000 cusecs is anticipated.
“There was no other way to drain the water,” Relief Commissioner Nabil Javed said, defending the drastic measures. “We are deploying all available resources and machinery to protect lives and infrastructure.”
Explosives were also deployed, with dynamite installed near the Rungpur and Sher Shah bunds to strategically divert water from Head Muhammad Wala.
Data released by Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Friday revealed that flows were predominantly steady with a notable improvement at Rivaz Bridge on the Chenab River, where the water level is now holding steady at 521.9 feet against the critical gauge of 526 feet.
However, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a flood warning for the Chenab River at Head Marala. As a precautionary measure, the NDMA sent out alerts via SMS to mobile phone users. The authority warned of a high flood risk at Marala, Khanki and Qadirabad headworks, urging residents in these areas to remain prepared for any emergency situation.
 






Water flow
On Friday, Marala and Khanki headworks were steady at 109,540 and 174,472 cusecs, respectively, while Qadirabad Headworks was at 175,272 cusecs and falling.
Chiniot Bridge remained at a very high but steady 855,000 cusecs, and Trimmu Headworks was steady at 128,215 cusecs.
Conditions on the Ravi River were mixed; Head Jassar was steady at 82,140 cusecs, and Ravi Syphon was falling at 160,515 cusecs. Shahdara was steady at 159,847 cusecs; however, Balloki Headworks continued to rise, reaching 180,520 cusecs. Sidhnai Headworks remained steady at 29,278 cusecs.
The Sutlej River was showing incre­a­sed activity at its upstream point, with Ganda Singh Wala rising at 385,569 cus­ecs. Downstream, Sule­­manki Headworks was steady at 138,058 cusecs, and Islam Headworks was steady at 60,814 cusecs.

20 lives lost, millions affected
According to PDMA data, over 1.46 million people in 1,769 mouzas have been affected due to extremely high floods in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers, with a total of 20 lives lost.
The government has evacuated over 429,177 people, of whom 3,565 were living in 365 relief camps, and 300,174 cattle were transported to safety.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the Sutlej River is facing the worst flooding since 1955. He said that the catastrophic inflow of water is a result of a dam breach in India, and it is increasing the threat to Kasur.
 


In 1955, more than 2,000 people lost their lives and crops were devastated in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) due to heavy floods caused by monsoon rains. Those floods also impacted 15 million people in Sindh and parts of India.
“We have been compelled to deliberately breach the embankment to save Ka­­s­ur city from devastation due to unprecedented water flow,” Mr Kathia said.
He said the crisis is widespread and evolving rapidly. “The Sutlej is not the only concern; the Chenab and Ravi rivers are also overflowing, marking the first time in Pakistan’s history that three major rivers have flooded simultaneously,” he added.
The PDMA chief termed it a “historic flood situation”, particularly noting the severe impact at Qadirabad Headworks.
Communities living downstream were bracing for impact, and water is expected to reach Sidhnai Headworks within 36 hours, while Okara, Sahiwal and Pakpattan remain on high alert.
Around 40 to 45 villages were already inundated in Mandi Bahauddin before the water receded back into the river. He said that 28 people lost their lives so far, though timely rescue operations have mitigated further casualties.
He said that evacuations in vulnerable areas continued, including those near Trimmu, where water levels are rising steadily. “The area downstream of Trimmu may not withstand this pressure,” Mr Kathia warned, though he expressed hope that damage could be minimised.
A statement from the PDMA has said the ninth spell of monsoon rains began, as heavy rains were forecasted till Sept 2.
The rains were predicted in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Gujrat, Sialkot, Narowal, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Okara, Sahiwal, Kasur, Jhang, Sargodha, Mianwali, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan and Rajanpur, the PDMA spokesperson said.
Arrangements in Multan
Earlier, National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) Chairman Shahryar Sultan and Multan Commissioner Amir Kareem Khan visited the Head Muhammad Wala breaching section and Bund Bosan to review the flood management arrangements.
Mr Khan briefed about the current flood situation and the measures being taken to mitigate potential risks.
He said that a flood surge of up to 800,000 cusecs is expected in the Chenab River within the next two days. “The Head Muhammad Wala Road will be breached if Multan city faces any threat. The final decision will be made by the technical committee of the Irrigation Department.”
He said that over 119,715 people have so far been safely relocated across the division and a total of 84 relief camps have been set up. He said that uninterrupted provision of meals and medical care is being ensured in all relief camps, while arrangements have also been made for the supply of fodder and water for livestock. The assessment of losses will be carried out once the water recedes, and full compensation will be provided to the affected families, he added.
Multan Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said the administration has set a target of relocating 300,000 residents to safer locations and assured that all riverine areas will be evacuated by Saturday night.

Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned a session of the National Assembly on Sept 1 (Monday) at 5pm in the Parliament House, according to a press release issued by the Presidency.
According to the Senate Secretariat, Mr Gilani and Mr Sadiq focused on strengthening institutional cooperation between the two houses of parliament and improving coordination on both national and international issues.
Talking to Dawn, PTI’s chief whip in the National Assembly, Amir Dogar, expressed concerns that the government intends to introduce controversial constitutional amendments in the near future.
 







President summons NA session on Sept 1

During their meeting at the Senate’s chairman’s residence, Mr Gilani briefed Mr Sadiq on preparations for the upcoming Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference, scheduled for Nov 11-12. The event will bring together representatives from over 45 countries, marking one of the largest multilateral parliamentary gatherings ever hosted by Pakistan.
 
 

Mr Gilani said the conference would address key global challenges, including regional peace, sustainable development, climate change and the need for collective strategies to tackle emerging threats.
Mr Sadiq assured Mr Gilani of the National Assembly’s full support in ensuring the successful organisation of the conference, expressing confidence that the event would serve as a significant opportunity for Pakistan to showcase its commitment to global dialogue, cooperation, and peace-building.
Both leaders also discussed the prevailing political and economic situation in the country, with a particular focus on the devastating impact of recent rains and floods. They expressed concern over the exacerbating situation caused by India’s release of floodwaters into Punjab’s rivers, which has intensified both human and material losses in the affected areas.
In light of the natural calamity, the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker appealed to the people of Pakistan to take precautionary measures and fully cooperate with the government and relevant authorities. They stressed the need for united national efforts to minimise casualties and reduce financial damages.

Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas delivered the judgment on three consolidated petitions filed by journalist Hamid Mir, the Judicial Activism Panel, and Sharif’s widow, Javeria Siddique.
The petitioners sought a federal government-initiated judicial commission for a “transparent inquiry” into the circumstances surrounding Sharif’s departure from Pakistan, his stay in Dubai, and his murder in Kenya in October 2022.
 
 

They argued that the current investigation by a Special Joint Investigation Team (SJIT) was flawed and violated constitutional rights to a fair trial and due process.
Deputy attorney general, representing the state, countered, stating that the Supreme Court was actively supervising the case following its suo motu intervention.
He stressed that procedural actions have been completed, including FIR registration and submitting charges to the trial court, alongside securing a Mutual Legal Assistance agreement with Kenya to facilitate the investigation.
After a review, Justice Minhas recalled the apex court’s intervention, with a five-member bench initiating oversight in December 2022 to guarantee an independent and impartial investigation.
He highlighted that the creation of the SJIT was under the Supreme Court’s directive, with continuous oversight from the apex court.
“The matter concerning the tragic murder of the journalist Arshad Sharif is presently sub judice before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Pakistan,” Justice Minhas stated in the written order. “Consequently, this Court is restrained from issuing any directive … as doing so would encroach upon the apex Court’s jurisdiction.”
While dismissing the petitions, the court granted the petitioners partial relief. It ordered the federal government and the SJIT to keep the petitioners “duly informed regarding all developments in the ongoing investigation”.
The court also directed the state to provide the petitioners with copies of all reports and findings and to apprise them of future progress.
The ruling concluded that the petitioners were “not without remedy” and could bring their concerns directly to the Supreme Court.
