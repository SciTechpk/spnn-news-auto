What has happened so far:

State media reports 19 Afghan border posts captured, dozens of khwarij killed
Kabul warns Islamabad of ‘negative consequences’ of using force
President Zardari says unfortunate that Afghan interim govt ‘turned away’ from occupied Kashmir’s just struggle
PM Shehbaz vows ‘every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response’
Dar says ‘defensive response’ not targeted towards Afghan civilian population
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran call for restraint after clashes broke out last night


“Pakistan Army has been targeting Afghan posts with utmost precision and captured 19 posts at the Afghan border from where attacks were carried out against Pakistan,” state-run Radio Pakistan reported, citing security sources.
 






The security sources said the Pakistan Army launched “successful strikes at Durrani Camp, Manojba Camp Battalion Headquarters and Manojba Camp-2, Ghaznali Headquarters in Noshki Sector and neutralised them completely”.
“Dozens of Taliban soldiers and Khwarij positioned in the camps and headquarters have been reportedly killed,” the report added.
Security sources said that the army had also devastated the Afghan Taliban’s “most important Asmatullah Karar Camp” at Spin Boldak. The sources noted that the camp was the Taliban’s “one of the biggest” from where terrorist activities against Pakistan were carried out.
Afghan Taliban and Khawarij hiding in the camp reportedly suffered “heavy losses”. Radio Pakistan said footage showed a “second engagement and destruction” of the Asmatullah Karar camp.
 






The second Battalion Headquarters of the Afghan Taliban in the Brabcha area, from “where Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists were launched into Pakistan”, was also targeted, as per the sources.
In a series of posts on X, PTV News said Afghanistan’s Barikot base camp, Manojba Camp-3, Karzai post, and Shapola Khula Taliban post were also destroyed.
Security forces also occupied an “important” Afghan post in Balochistan’s Zhob Sector and hoisted the Pakistani flag, the sources added. “Humvee-armoured personnel carrier of the Afghan Taliban deployed at the post was destroyed as well in the attack,” they said.
Targeting an Afghan Tank position at the mountain peaks opposite Kurram, the forces eliminated “several tanks of the Afghan Taliban”, the security sources said.
 






In an earlier Radio Pakistan report, security sources said Afghanistan’s Jandusar Post, Turkmenzai camp and Kharchar Fort had also been “completely destroyed”.
“The firing from Afghanistan side was aimed at getting the Khawarij formations crossed into the border of Pakistan. However, Pakistani posts, which were alert and ready, responded swiftly and forcefully,” the security sources added.
 






President Zardari, in a statement, noted that there were United Nations reports that “proved” terrorist attacks were carried out from the Afghan soil. However, he also stressed that bilateral respect and joint counterterrorism efforts were the key to long-term regional peace.
Asserting that no compromise will be made on Pakistan’s sovereignty, President Zardari said the country remained “firmly committed to safeguarding its national interests, regional sovereignty and security”.
He noted that attacks launched “from the territory of the Interim Afghan Government by India-backed Khawarij terrorists are a well-documented reality, confirmed in successive United Nations Security Council (UNSC) monitoring reports”.
The president pointed out that Pakistan had repeatedly “made it clear that its civilians and security personnel are being targeted through the nexus of the Indian sponsored Khawarij and other terror groups”.
 


President Zardari urged the interim Afghan government to take “concrete and verifiable action” against anti-Pakistan terrorist elements operating from the Afghan soil, the statement added. He termed the menace of terrorism “sponsored by India” as the “greatest threat to regional peace and stability”.
“Terrorism is a shared challenge and its burden cannot be placed on any single country,” the president was quoted as saying.
 






PM Shehbaz strongly condemned the “provocation by Afghanistan in Pakistan’s border areas”.
“There will be no compromise on Pakistan’s defence, and every provocation will be met with a strong and effective response,“ he asserted.
“We are proud of the professional excellence of our armed forces,” the premier said, hailing the army’s “strong and effective response to Afghanistan’s aggression”.
“The Pakistan Army not only gave a powerful response to Afghan aggression under the bold leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, but also destroyed several of their posts, forcing them to retreat,” the prime minister said.
 






“Our defence is in strong hands, and we know well how to defend every inch of our motherland,” PM Shehbaz said, adding that the army has always given a “crushing response to every form of external aggression”.
The prime minister also highlighted that Pakistan had “repeatedly provided Afghanistan with information regarding terrorist elements such as Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan, who are using Afghan soil to launch attacks against Pakistan”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Fitna-al-Hindu­stan is the term it uses to refer to terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
 
 

“Terrorist organisations are being supported by certain elements within Afghanistan,” he stated, expressing hope that the Afghan interim government will ensure its territory is not used by terrorist elements against Pakistan.
In one of the first official statements by Pakistan, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi lauded the security forces for their “prompt” response.
“Firing by Afghan forces on civilian population is a blatant violation of international laws. Pakistan’s brave forces have given a prompt and effective response that no provocation will be tolerated,” Naqvi said on X.
“Pakistan’s forces are alert and Afghanistan is being answered with stones for bricks. The people of Pakistan stand with the brave armed forces like a lead wall. Afghanistan will also be given a befitting reply like India.”
 






Following the border fighting, Afghan government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid urged Pakistan to “desist from using force as such actions will have negative consequences”.
Addressing a press conference in Kabul, Mujahid alleged that “certain elements within the Pakistani security establishment want to destabilise Afghanistan“.
He further warned that Kabul “possessed weapons to respond”, adding that the Afghanistan Islamic Emirate had made “efforts to resolve issues with Pakistan”.
 






‘Unfortunate that Afghan admin turned away from occupied Kashmir’s just struggle’
In his statement, President Zardari termed it unfortunate that the current Afghan interim administration had “turned away from the just struggle of the oppressed people” of India-occupied Kashmir, “thereby doing injustice to both history and the Muslim ummah”.
He reaffirmed that Pakistan will “never accept any disputed or misleading position on Jammu and Kashmir” and reiterated that India’s “unlawful claims over the territory” are contrary to international law and UNSC resolutions.
The president highlighted Pakistan’s hosting of millions of Afghan refugees for over decades, saying it “demonstrated Islamic fraternity and exemplary neighbourliness”.
 
 

However, he added that the “dignified repatriation of Afghan citizens” was in the interest of both countries and essential for sustainable peace.
“President Zardari reaffirmed that Pakistan will continue to support the educational and humanitarian needs of the Afghan people, but no compromise will ever be made on Pakistan’s national sovereignty,” the statement said.
The president emphasised that Pakistan had extended “every possible facilitation to Afghanistan in trade, economic connectivity, and people-to-people exchanges”. Mutual cooperation and economic partnership are the foundation for lasting peace and regional prosperity, he noted.
 
 

President Zardari underscored that Pakistan desires a peaceful, stable, and prosperous Afghanistan. He said brotherly relations must be based on mutual respect, security cooperation and a shared commitment to regional peace.
He expressed hope that the interim Afghan government will prevent its soil from being used by “Khawarij and India-backed terrorist elements against Pakistan”, stressing that only joint and practical measures can guarantee enduring peace in the region.
Defensive response not targeted towards Afghan civilian population: Dar
Expressing his “deep concern” over the latest developments, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar said “unprovoked firing and raids along Pak-Afghan border by the Taliban government is a serious provocation”.
“Pakistan’s befitting response and strikes are against Taliban infrastructure and to neutralise Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorist elements operating from Afghan soil,” he asserted in a post on X.
 






“Our defensive response is not targeted towards peace-loving Afghan civilian population. Unlike Taliban forces, we are exercising extreme caution in our defensive responses to avoid loss of civilian lives,” Dar added.
He expressed Pakistan’s expectation from the interim Afghan government to take “concrete measures against terrorist elements and their perpetrators that wish to derail Pak-Afghan relations”.
“Pakistan will take all possible measures to defend its own territory, sovereignty and its people,” the deputy premier pledged.
Calls for restraint
Saudi Arabia, with which Pakistan recently signed a mutual defence deal, expressed concern at the skirmishes.
“The kingdom calls for restraint, avoiding escalation, and embracing dialogue and wisdom to contribute to reducing tensions and maintaining security and stability in the region.
“The kingdom affirms its support for all regional and international efforts aimed at promoting peace and stability, and its continued commitment to ensuring security, which will achieve stability and prosperity for the brotherly Pakistani and Afghan peoples.”
 






Iranian top diplomat Abbas Araghchi called on Afghanistan and Pakistan “to exercise restraint” amid ongoing clashes.
“Our position is that both sides must exercise restraint,” Araghchi said during a live interview with state television, adding that “stability” between the countries “contributes to regional stability”.
 






Qatar’s foreign ministry urged both sides to prioritise dialogue, diplomacy, and restraint, and to work towards containing differences in a manner that helps to reduce tension and avoid escalation, in order to achieve regional security and stability.
The foreign ministry reiterated Qatar’s support for all regional and international efforts aimed at strengthening international peace and security, and affirmed its commitment to ensuring security and prosperity for the people of the two countries.
 






Clashes break out after Kabul blames Islamabad
Late last night, state-run Radio Pakistan issued the following statement on X, quoting security sources: “Unprovoked firing from the Afghan side at Pak-Afghan border, a strong, intense response from Pakistan Army.”
It said “Afghan forces carried out unprovoked firing at several locations”, Angoor Adda, Bajaur, Kurram, Dir, Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Bahram Chah in Balochistan along the Pak-Afghan border.
 


Radio Pakistan further said Pakistan was “targeting terrorist camps and hideouts of Khawarij (terrorists), ISIS located near the Pak-Afghan border inside Afghanistan with great precision. Afghan forces have retreated from several areas”.
 


In the early hours of Sunday, security sources said there were reports of significant damage inflicted on multiple Afghan posts and militant formations, security officials added.
They said artillery, tanks, light and heavy weapons were used in the retaliatory action.
 






State-run Radio Pakistan also shared footage of what it said were “Kharjis and Afghan soldiers being taken out”.
 






Separately, the Torkham border crossing has been closed for all kinds of traffic after the overnight firing exchanges at various locations, according to locals on the Pakistani side.
Afghan official Qureshi Badloon also confirmed the closure to Dawn.com from Nangarhar.
The clashes broke out after Kabul accused Islamabad of carrying out air strikes on the Afghan capital earlier this week, according to Taliban border forces.
“In retaliation for the air strikes by Pakistani forces“, Taliban border forces in the east are “engaged in heavy clashes against Pakistani forces’ posts in various border areas”, the Afghan military said in a statement earlier.
Taliban officials from the provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar, Paktika, Khost, and Helmand — all located on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan — confirmed the clashes.
Islamabad did not confirm that it was behind the attacks, but called on Kabul “to stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on its soil”.
Security sources said Afghan posts failed to provide covering fire to the militants and there were reports of “heavy losses” among Afghan border posts and militants.
“Kharijites and Daesh hideouts inside Afghanistan, operating under the patronage of the interim Afghan government, are being effectively targeted. Pakistan is using artillery, tanks, light, and heavy weapons. In addition, air resources and drones are also being used to target Daesh and Kharijite hideouts. The headquarters of Afghan forces, which have been sheltering Daesh and Fitna al-Khawarij, are also being targeted.”
 






The Afghan Ministry of Defence confirmed earlier that Afghan forces launched “retaliatory operations against Pakistani security forces” tonight.
“The operations ended at midnight. If the opposing side violates Afghanistan’s territory again, our armed forces are ready to defend their territory and will respond firmly,” said the statement.
Infiltration attempts in Pishin, Zhob
Pakistani posts also came under attack in the Baramcha area of Chagai district, which borders Afghanistan’s Helmand province. “Afghan forces opened indiscriminate fire at Pakistani border posts with heavy weapons late on Saturday night,” a senior official said.
He added that Afghan border posts were destroyed and casualties were taken by the other side. “Heavy exchange of fire continued for two hours.”
Security sources stated that Afghan forces also tried to infiltrate into Pishin and Zhob districts. However, the attempts were defeated by Pakistani forces in the area.
 






Deterioration in bilateral relations
The past week saw heightened tensions, with both sides exchanging sharp statements. Pakistan suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out,” Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly.
Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups.
Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan a day ago. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.”
Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi visited India earlier this week, marking India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021.
 
 

Speaking about the Thursday night explosion in Kabul during a press conference in New Delhi a day ago, Muttaqi had condemned the incident and Pakistan for its alleged role in it.
Earlier, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry did not directly respond when questioned whether Pakistan was responsible for the attacks. “To safeguard Pakistani lives and properties, what measures need to be taken will be taken,” he told reporters.
The Foreign Office had avoided directly acknowledging strikes in Kabul, instead framing Pakistan’s counter-terrorism actions as legitimate self-defence against militants operating from Afghan soil.
Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, the ISPR DG also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-12 10:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628204-serious-provocation-pakistan-says-will-take-all-measures-to-defend-territory-after-afghan-aggression' target='_blank'><strong>'Serious provocation': Pakistan says will 'take all measures to defend territory' after Afghan aggression</strong></a><br><p>

Left-arm spinner Senuran Muthusamy removed Haq, caught at short-leg by Tony de Zorzi, after a 236-minute knock that included seven fours and a six.
Next ball — the last before tea — Muthusamy had Saud Shakeel caught and bowled to bring South Africa back into the game.
At the break, Babar Azam was unbeaten on 23, having overturned a caught behind dismissal against Muthusamy on one, as Pakistan added 92 runs in the session.
 






Earlier spinner Prenelan Subrayen trapped Shan Masood lbw for 76, including nine fours and a six, to end a 161-run stand with Haq.
South Africa could have been in a better position had they not dropped
Masood on 61 and Haq on 72 with Subrayen the unlucky bowler on both occasions.
With the Gaddafi Stadium pitch likely to turn, Masood opted to bat after
winning the toss and named specialist spin duo Noman Ali and Sajid Khan in the team Pakistan lost opener Abdullah Shafique leg before to pace spearhead Kagiso Rabada off the third ball of the day.
South African captain Aiden Markram turned to his spinners in the sixth over and by lunch had used all three — Subrayen, Harmer and Muthusamy.
But there were no further dramas in the opening session as Pakistan reached 107-1 at lunch after Haq had brought up his 10th Test fifty.
The two-match series is part of the new World Test Championship two-year cycle. South Africa won the title by beating Australia in June.
The two-match series is part of the new World Test Championship two-year cycle. South Africa won the title by beating Australia in June.
The Shan Masood-led hosts, who finished an embarrassing last in the nine-team table of the 2023-25 WTC, must raise their game significantly in all departments if they are to resist Aiden Markram-captained tourists who claimed their maiden WTC crown by beating Australia in the final at Lord’s last year.
The Gaddafi Stadium did not host any Test in the previous WTC cycle after the venue was used for the third and final Test between Pakistan and Australia in March 2022. South Africa, on their last tour to Pakistan in 2021, lost a two-Test series 2-0.
While both the captains expected a spin-friendly track at the Gaddafi Stadium, there were doubts over the inclusion of key Pakistan off-spinner Sajid, who was suffering from a viral infection but did practise with the team yesteday.
Ahead of the game, Shan said taking 20 wickets, rather than piling up big scores, will be key to winning the Test series. “We don’t want flat tracks where matches end in draws,” he remarked.
In his presser, Markram acknowledged Pakistan’s plan to prepare spinning pitches at home and said that his players were ready for the challenge. “As a team not heavily exposed to these conditions, it is going to be exciting and a great opportunity for us to get things right here.”

Disney, Google, Ikea, Toyota, McDonald’s, and fellow airlines Air France and KLM are also reported to have had data stolen in a cyberattack targeting software firm Salesforce, with the information now being held to ransom.
Salesforce said this month it was “aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors”.
Qantas confirmed in July that hackers had targeted one of its customer contact centres, breaching a computer system used by a third party now known to have been Salesforce.
They secured access to sensitive information such as customer names, email addresses, phone numbers and birthdays, the blue-chip Australian company said.
No further breaches have taken place since, and the company is cooperating with Australian security services.
“Qantas is one of a number of companies globally that has had data released by cyber criminals following the airline’s cyber incident in early July, where customer data was stolen via a third-party platform,” the company said in a statement.
Most of the data leaked was names, email addresses and frequent flyer details, the firm said.
 
 

But some of the data included customers’ “business or home address, date of birth, phone number, gender and meal preferences”.
“No credit card details, personal financial information or passport details were impacted,” Qantas said.
It also said it had obtained a legal injunction with the Supreme Court of New South Wales, where the firm is headquartered, to prevent the stolen data from being “accessed, viewed, released, used, transmitted or published”.
Cybersecurity expert Troy Hunt told AFP that it would do little to prevent the spread of the data.
“It’s frankly ridiculous,” he said.
“It obviously doesn’t stop criminals at all anywhere, and it also really doesn’t have any effect on people outside of Australia.”
Hackers ‘laying siege’
In response to questions about the leak, tech giant Google pointed AFP to an August statement in which it said one of its corporate Salesforce servers had been targeted. It did not confirm if the data had been leaked.
“Google responded to the activity, performed an impact analysis and has completed email notifications to the potentially affected businesses,” Melanie Lombardi, head of Google Cloud Security Communications, said.
Cybersecurity analysts have linked the hack to individuals with ties to an alliance of cybercriminals called Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters.
Research group Unit 42 said in a note that the group had “asserted responsibility for laying siege to customer Salesforce tenants as part of a coordinated effort to steal data and hold it for ransom”.
The hackers had reportedly set an October 10 deadline for ransom payment.
‘Oldest tricks in the book’
The hackers stole the sensitive data using a social engineering technique, referring to a tactic of manipulating victims by pretending to be a company representative or other trusted person, experts said.
The FBI last month issued a warning about such attacks targeting Salesforce.
The agency said hackers posing as IT workers had tricked customer support employees into granting them access to sensitive data.
“They have been very effective,” expert Hunt said.
“And it hasn’t been using any sophisticated technical exploits… they have exploited really the oldest tricks in the books.” The hack of data from Australia’s biggest airline comes as a string of major cyberattacks in the country has raised concerns about the protection of personal data.
Qantas apologised last year after a glitch with its mobile app exposed some passengers’ names and travel details.

The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has been working with the Lebanese army to support a November ceasefire that sought to end more than a year of hostilities between Israel and militant group Hezbollah that culminated in two months of open war.
“Just before noon yesterday, an Israeli drone dropped a grenade that exploded near a UNIFIL position” in Kfar Kela, the force said in a statement published on Sunday.
“One peacekeeper was lightly injured and received medical assistance.”
Earlier this month, UNIFIL said Israeli drones had dropped multiple grenades near peacekeepers providing security for workers clearing rubble left over from the war.
And in a similar episode in September, UNIFIL said Israeli drones had dropped four grenades near peacekeepers, with Israel insisting at the time that there had been “no intentional fire” directed at the force.
UNIFIL said Saturday’s incident represented “another serious violation of resolution 1701 and concerning disregard for the safety of peacekeepers”.
UN Security Council Resolution 1701 ended a 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and formed the basis of the November ceasefire.
Under the US-brokered ceasefire, Hezbollah and Israel were both required to withdraw from south Lebanon, while UNIFIL deployed there alongside the Lebanese military, in part to help dismantle Hezbollah infrastructure.
Israel has kept up regular strikes in Lebanon on what it says are Hezbollah targets despite the truce, and has maintained its troops in five locations it deems strategic.
“We again call on the (Israeli army) to cease attacks on or near peacekeepers, who are working to rebuild the stability that both Israel and Lebanon have committed to restore,” the UN peacekeeping force said.
UNIFIL has been deployed since 1978 to separate Israel and Lebanon, and numbers some 10,000 personnel from almost 50 countries.
In August, the Security Council voted to end UNIFIL’s mission in 2027.</p><small>2025-10-12 09:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/12081907fbadc68.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948281/furore-over-absence-of-women-journalists-from-afghan-fm-muttaqis-presser-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>Furore over absence of women journalists from Afghan FM Muttaqi’s presser in India</strong></a><br><p>New Delhi: India’s opposition Congress party criticised the Narendra Modi government on Saturday over the absence of women journalists from a press conference addressed by visiting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, with Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asking the prime minister to clarify his position on the matter.
“Mr Modi, when you allow the exclusion of women journalists from a public forum, you are telling every woman in India that you are too weak to stand up for them. In our country, women have the right to equal participation in every space.
“Your silence in the face of such discrimination exposes the emptiness of your slogans on Nari Shakti,” Rahul Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, said in a post on X.
Mr Gandhi’s post followed Priyanka Vadra’s earlier message, in which she asked whether the prime minister’s recognition of women’s rights was “just convenient posturing from one election to another”, and questioned how such an “insult to some of India’s most competent women” could have been permitted.
 






“Prime Minister @narendramodi ji, please clarify your position on the removal of female journalists from the press conference of the representative of the Taliban on his visit to India,” she said on X.
The press conference, addressed by the Afghan foreign minister on Friday was restricted to a limited group of male journalists, with women reporters conspicuously absent.
Mr Muttaqi held the interaction at the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, hours after holding wide-ranging talks with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar.
 






Taliban decision
While there has been no official comment from the government of India, it is learnt that the decision on media invitations was taken by Taliban officials accompanying the visiting minister.
Sources said the Indian side had suggested to the Afghan delegation that women journalists be included among the invitees.
“(Tali)ban on female journalists in India. Shocking and unacceptable that the govt of India agreed to it — and that too in New Delhi on the eve of the Inter­na­ti­onal Day of the Girl Child,” Con­g­ress communications chief Jai­ram Ramesh said in a post on X.
 






Former finance minister P. Chidambaram, expressing his personal view, said: “The men journalists should have walked out when they found that their women colleagues were excluded (or not invited).”
 






Communist Party of India general secretary D. Raja, tagging External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in his X post, asked: “Was it just Taliban misogyny or a tacit endorsement of it on Indian soil? The Republic of India is built on equality. We are the nation which gave women voting rights from day one, when many Western countries lagged behind.
“To allow such exclusion here is blasphemy to our constitutional spirit.”
Mr Raja urged the ministry of external affairs to explain how it agreed to “permit this discriminatory spectacle”. “This is not a diplomatic nuance. This is nourishment to patriarchal ideology that wants to erase half the world from public life. We must call it out, without hesitation,” he added.
 






The high-profile visit has stirred strong reactions, including from Pakistan. Mr Jaishankar used the visit to push India’s agenda in Kabul.
While the countries have a common commitment towards growth and prosperity, Mr Jaishankar told Mr Muttaqi: “These are endangered by the shared threat of cross-border terrorism that both our nations face. We must coordinate efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We appreciate your sensitivity towards India’s security concerns.
“Your solidarity with us in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terrorist attack was noteworthy. India is fully committed to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Afghan­is­tan. Closer cooperation between us contributes to your national development, as well as regional stability and resilience.

The M2 motorway connects Lahore to Islamabad, while the M3 motorway links Lahore to Abdul Hakeem in Khanewal district, where it joins the M4 leading to Faisalabad and Multan.
A day ago, the main TLP procession reached Muridke after breaking through police security, hours after violent clashes in Lahore left over four dozen police personnel injured. The marchers then staged a sit-in at Muridke, blocked by trenches dug along the GT Road.
Roads that have been reopened today include parts of Margalla Road, Jinnah Avenue and Seventh Avenue, as well as Korang Road to Bani Gala; Jinnah Road to Park Road; Garden Avenue to Tulip Banquet Hall; Chand Tara Flyover to Club Road (Murree Road); Fazal-i-Haq Road, Nazimuddin Road, Embassy Road; Ninth Avenue from JUP to Shaheen Chowk via internal access from Margalla Road, and others.
TLP spokesperson Usman Naushahi told Dawn.com that protesters remained in Muridke and Sadhoke, saying, “We have not gone further yet.”
While internet service is slow in the area, mobile data services are working, according to citizens.
Meanwhile, the federal government moved over 1,200 paramilitary personnel to Punjab to intercept protesters, who have been marching on the capital from Lahore via GT Road.
Yesterday, police said a gathering of 300 people, carrying TLP flags, posters, and banners, reached the crossing from Dhoke Abbasi and surrounding areas.
The rally chanted anti-government slogans and delivered speeches, provoking people to join the TLP protest. The protesters also blocked the GT Road and refused to clear it when asked by the police. In response, the police used force, arresting 90 protesters and seizing sound systems, while others escaped.
Last night, the police also decided to lift some blockades from a few roads.</p><small>2025-10-12 09:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628196-opposition-parties-to-field-joint-candidate-for-kp-cm-election' target='_blank'><strong>Federal minister rules out governor's rule in KP for now</strong></a><br><p>

On Friday, Trump responded to Beijing’s most recent export controls by imposing additional tariffs of 100 per cent on China’s US-bound exports, along with new export controls on critical software by November 1.
The revived trade tensions have rattled Wall Street, sending Big Tech shares tumbling, worried foreign companies dependent on China’s production of processed rare earths and rare earth magnets, and could derail a summit between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping tentatively scheduled for later this month.
Responding to Trump
The Chinese commerce ministry’s statement on Sunday was Beijing’s first direct response to Trump’s lengthy Truth Social post on Friday, where he accused Beijing of suddenly raising trade tensions after an uneasy truce was reached six months ago between the world’s two largest economies, allowing them to trade goods without sky-high tariff rates.
 






“Our relationship with China over the past six months has been a very good one, thereby making this move on Trade an even more surprising one,” Trump said.
The commerce ministry said in an equally lengthy statement that its export controls on rare-earth elements followed a series of US measures since bilateral trade talks in Madrid last month.
Beijing cited the addition of Chinese companies to a US trade blacklist and Washington’s imposition of port fees on China-linked ships as examples.
“The US actions have severely harmed China’s interests and undermined the atmosphere of bilateral economic and trade talks, and China is resolutely opposed to them,” the ministry said.
Beijing stopped short of explicitly connecting these US actions to its export curbs on rare-earth elements, saying its curbs were motivated by concern about these materials’ military applications at a time of “frequent military conflicts”.
It also held off on announcing a corresponding levy on China-bound US imports, unlike earlier in the year, when both superpowers progressively ratcheted up tariffs on each other until the US rate was 145pc while China’s was 125pc.
“Willful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China. China’s position on the trade war is consistent: we do not want it, but we are not afraid of it,” the commerce ministry said, adding China would take corresponding measures if the US did not correct its course.
Path of Negotiations
China’s decision not to immediately respond in kind to Trump’s opening salvo in this latest round of trade tensions could leave the door open for both countries to negotiate a de-escalation, analysts said.
“By clarifying the rationale behind its retaliatory measures, Beijing is also outlining a potential path forward for negotiations. The ball is now in the US court,” said Alfredo Montufar-Helu, managing director at strategic advisory firm GreenPoint.
But Hutong Research said in a note on Saturday that if Beijing chooses not to respond to Trump’s 100pc tariff hike, it may signal that Beijing no longer prioritises a long-term deal with him, reflecting diminished confidence in his ability to restrain hawks or stick to commitments.
“Key watchpoints now: Whether Beijing moves to freeze or complicate the TikTok sale, given its political symbolism. Proceeding with the sale under current conditions would be seen as a major concession,” the research firm said.
China says export controls are not export bans
The commerce ministry also countered Trump’s narrative that China was using its dominance in processed rare earths and rare earth magnets to attack all countries, not just the US.
“We have been contacted by other Countries who are extremely angry at this great trade hostility, which came out of nowhere,” Trump said on Friday on Truth Social.
China produces over 90pc of the world’s processed rare earths and rare earth magnets. The 17 rare earths are vital materials in products ranging from electric vehicles to aircraft engines and military radars.
Exports of 12 of them are restricted after China’s commerce ministry on Thursday added five — holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium — along with related materials.
The commerce ministry statement on Sunday sought to reassure foreign companies spooked by the latest export curbs, promising to promote compliant trade by granting general licenses and license exemptions.
“China’s export controls are not export bans,” it said. “Any export applications for civilian use that comply with regulations will be approved, and relevant enterprises need not worry.”</p><small>2025-10-12 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/121104180a18916.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948344/48-pakistani-universities-make-it-to-times-higher-education-ranking' target='_blank'><strong>48 Pakistani universities make it to Times Higher Education ranking</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: This year 48 universities from Pakistan have made it to the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings for 2026.
The Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, is ranked between 401 and 500 category, followed by Bahauddin Zakariya University, Multan, which improved by 400 points to be in the 601-800 ranking.
Other institutions ranked between 601 and 800 include Air University, COMSATS University, Islamabad, Government College University, Faisalabad, National University of Sciences and Technology, Sukkur IBA, University of Lahore, and University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore.
 
 

Fifteen institutions ranked between 801–1000 include Abdul Wali Khan University of Mardan, Capital University of Science and Technology, Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology, Government College University Lahore, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Iqra University, Khwaja Fareed University of Engineering and Technology, RYK, Lahore University of Management and Sciences, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, University of Central Punjab, University of Engineering and Technology Taxila, University of Gujrat, University of Malakand, University of Management and Technology, and University of the Punjab.

Quaid-i-Azam on top, Zakariya second

Ten institutions ranked between 1001-1200 include Bahria University, Hazara University, Mansehra, Institute of Space Technology, PMAS Arid Agriculture University Rawalpindi, Riphah International University, The University of Haripur, University of Education, Lahore, University of Engineering and Technology, Peshawar, University of Okara, and University of Peshawar.
Eight others were ranked between 1201-1500 and six 1501 plus.
The 2026 rankings of the best universities in the world includes 2,191 institutions from 115 countries and territories.
Oxford retains the number one spot for the 10th consecutive year, driven by a strong research environment score. Princeton rises to joint third place, and is the only US university to achieve its best-ever finish this year. China has five universities in the top 40, up from three last year, but top universities remain steady. Hong Kong occupies a record six spots in the top 200 as a result of improvements in teaching metrics. India now has the second highest number of ranked universities for the first time, only behind the US.
The Times Higher Education World University Rankings are the only global performance tables that judge research-intensive universities across all their core missions: teaching, research, knowledge transfer and international outlook. It uses 18 carefully-calibrated performance indicators to provide the most comprehensive and balanced comparisons, trusted by students, academics, university leaders, industry and governments. One of the metrics (study abroad) currently has zero weight but they intend to include it in future.
BZU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Zubair Iqbal said the THE ranking improvement is result of collective efforts of the faculty, administration and employees.
He said the quality of research has been improved significantly and faculty members are encouraged to get projects for BZU. Various research incentives have also been provided to faculty.

He/she suddenly rises, lingers and then either fades away or falls off by the wayside. All this can happen within days, weeks, months or within a few years.
The appeal of such ‘heroes’ can be universal or entirely local. But the fact remains, their heroic status is almost always short-lived. People move on to search for another hero. 
But it is not really about a search as such. It is mostly about construction. According to the University of Richmond (Virginia) Professor Emeritus of Psychology Scott T. Allison, heroism is a concept shaped by social, psychological and historical factors. It is a process that is influenced by our individual biases, and our collective needs and values. So, on most occasions, heroes are constructed by people to broadcast their own ideals, wishes, beliefs and aspirations. 
A society, or segments of it, take fragments of information available of an event or of a personality and turn them into a “meaningful whole.” That meaningful whole is the hero. He/she is constructed from information and narratives that only support the beliefs of the constructors. 
Not too long ago, hundreds of men and women in Pakistan perceived the terrorist Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh as a ‘hero’. His personal life was often shrouded in mystery and so was the modus operandi through which he planned his acts of terror — especially the manner in which he organised the kidnapping and killing of the American journalist Daniel Pearl in 2002.

In the age of social media, ‘heroes’ rise and fall in the blink of an eye. From terrorists to influencers, from activists to politicians — societies routinely construct, romanticise and discard their chosen symbols of virtue and rebellion

Some segments of Pakistani society who were opposed to the contemporary politics of the country, and were anti-US, bridged the gaps between the fragments of information available on Sheikh with narratives that supported their beliefs. The ‘whole’ in this case became a man who was narrated as a “true Muslim” and “courageous”.
Then, when Sheikh was arrested and thrown in jail, the narrative that shaped him as a hero began to include an otherworldly dimension to his constructed persona. It was claimed by the constructors that, every time Sheikh stood up to say his prayers in his cell, a bright white light from above engulfed him. Of course, the fact that he had participated in a gruesome act of murder was never mentioned in any detail by those who had constructed him as a hero. Instead, his act was explained as a deed ordained by the Almighty himself. 
The same was the case with Mumtaz Qadri, the man who assassinated the former governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer. To thousands of (mostly Barelvi) Muslims, Qadri was a true believer who was fighting a kind of cosmic war against evil entities. Apparently, ‘eye-witness accounts’ of him in his death cell spoke about a constant ‘glow’ on his face.
 
 

This began to circulate on social media. The fact that he had actually filed a mercy plea against his conviction was suppressed by those who were constructing him as a hero. They were desperately seeking a ‘martyr’ for their ‘cause’.
The social psychologist George R. Goethals speaks of the “romance of heroism”, which leads to exaggerated perceptions of the heroic qualities in certain types of people, especially under conditions of stress and uncertainty. There are certain overarching cognitive and motivational biases within societies that can make them perceive heroic qualities in people, even when they are undeserving of that status. According to Goethals, when faced with uncertainty or stress, people are motivated to manufacture heroic leaders who can provide a sense of purpose and stability. 
To Allison, romanticised desires to designate people as heroes are subject to distortion and can induce people to choose poor leaders. Contemporary examples in this regard include modern-day political populists who portray being iconoclastic and ‘anti-mainstream’ as heroic traits. Their growing number of followers begin to believe that the system was failing and needed a jolt (applied by the leader) to slip out of the grip of mainstream forces.
 


Such ‘heroes’ begin to be explained as the “embodiment of the righteous people”, so much so that even the most glaring flaws in the ‘heroes’ — scandals, corruption, outright lies etc — are either conveniently ignored or begin being dismissed as ‘propaganda’; or worse, as something to be tolerated for the greater good that the ‘hero’ is expected to usher. 
In some cases, if there are enough people in a society who yearn for a leader who would restore (mostly mythical) versions of honesty, purity and piety, a hero is constructed as a messianic figure. These, too, are manufactured by individuals or segments of a society facing an existential crisis. In fact, the ‘crises’ can also be exaggerated.
In the age of social media, ‘influencers’ cultivate aspirational personas that are perceived as heroic. People involved in social causes or who have become ‘success stories’ are constructed as heroes, depending on current social, cultural and political trends. But they mostly fall off the radar as quickly as they appear on it.
Social media can also turn constructed heroes into constructed villains. Malala Yousafzai was elevated as a hero by the ‘progressives’ when she was shot in the face by Islamist militants in 2012. But a decade later, the same folk had begun to thumb their collective nose at her for not speaking out enough about Israeli atrocities in Gaza. 
However, her stint as hero was comparatively longer than most. There are social activists, lawyers, vloggers, influencers, et al whose currency has risen and fallen with rapid speed on social media. They were/are constructed heroes shaped by and for the consumption of social media users. Some are quite conscious of this and curate their actions and content accordingly.
 
 

Recently, social media elevated the former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad to the status of a ‘hero’ when he sailed to Gaza on a flotilla with a group of pro-Palestine activists — despite the fact that, before hopping on the boat, he was often derided by many for being a myopic right-wing reactionary. 
Constructing heroes can lead to passive admiration. People only have to post their admiration on social media and cheer for what they themselves have created to reflect their own unrealised ideals and agendas. They believe their admiration is emerging from critical thinking. It really isn’t.
On social media, it seems everyone is either always busy constructing heroes to validate their own beliefs and ideals, or they are creating villains to exemplify what they don’t like. It’s mostly about validation or vilification.

— Benjamin Netanyahu, prime minister of the Zionist entity at a nationally televised conference in January 2024
UPFRONT
As I write these lines, the immediate conditions in US President Donald Trump’s so-called ‘peace plan’ for the Middle East are being negotiated in Cairo. There are two ways of analysing the 20 points: as a standalone document or a document that must be juxtaposed with historical developments that have plagued the land of Palestine since colonial powers declared it terra nullius to solve Europe’s ‘Jewish problem.’
In this space I propose to first look at Trump’s plan as it stands and then collocate it with factors that have served to elude real peace in Occupied Palestine. Those factors are important because, without addressing them, Trump might just be setting up the place for more instability. And it won’t be for the first time.
As we would see, what was hailed as his greatest foreign policy achievement in the previous tenure, the Abraham Accords, contributed in no uncertain way in creating the conditions that led to increased Zionist violence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPTs) and ultimately to the October 7 attack by Hamas.
Before we proceed further, let’s establish a simple fact: this is not a peace plan. In fact, it’s not even a plan. At best, it can be described as a framework or certain guidelines. Its first and foremost objective is to achieve a ceasefire.
That cannot be faulted in and of itself, given the devastation in Gaza and the ongoing genocide in the Strip. But it’s important to flag this point to temper expectations about what can be achieved through these 20 points.

Far from promising lasting peace, US President Donald Trump’s plan for Gaza not only ignores the structural causes of the conflict in Palestine, it cements Zionist occupation, erases Palestinian sovereignty, institutionalises apartheid and legitimises genocide under the guise of diplomacy

The second fact is that this document does not address any of the structural, political, social, legal, economic and security issues for the Palestinians in Gaza or the OPTs, issues that have remained unaddressed since the colonial British Mandate.
UNPACKING THE PLAN
For a document that describes itself as a ‘peace plan’, it is surprisingly short on detail — granular specificities about timelines — and ambiguous over who gets to decide the timelines regarding multiple transitions or even how those transitions will take place.
Who is the overarching power? Trump at the head of a ‘Board of Peace’, the discredited and much-reviled Tony Blair representing Trump, or the apolitical Palestinian body assigned to run the municipal affairs in the Strip under an international transitional authority?
 
 

Who will determine that Gaza has been deradicalised and demilitarised? Which authority will command the international stabilisation force? Trump or the United Nations, which has traditionally operated peacekeeping and enforcement operations around the world under relevant UN Security Council resolutions?
This is not mere technicality. The Zionists abhor the UN; the UN has declared the assault on Gaza as a genocide. Trump and the US haven’t. Would the ISF report to Trump? Will this force come into being outside the UN/UNSC framework?
Observers have already noted how this document is loaded against the Gazans and is supportive of the Zionists. The linguistic vagueness of some of its clauses allow the Zionist entity large wiggle room to unilaterally determine whether conditions are being met, even for an extended ceasefire, the most immediate purported outcome. It throws the idea of a Palestinian state beyond the horizon into some unseen future and the document wilfully ignores the very causes of the conflict.
If anything, by bringing in international actors and a non-Palestinian stabilisation force — which the document describes as a “force [which] will be the long-term internal security solution” and coordinate with “Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas” — it seeks to replace the Zionist occupation of Gaza with another occupation.
It will be deeply ironic if the Gulf states pay for the structures of this new occupation, including the ISF, because the Zionist entity could argue that it is no longer in occupation of Gaza even as Gaza remains occupied and the Zionists continue to determine the Strip’s future.
Another important point is the mention of the January 19, 2025 agreement in the current document. That agreement saw prisoner swaps and was supposed to end the war. The Zionists unilaterally broke it on March 18, with pre-emptive strikes and justified the action “based on Hamas’s readiness to execute terror attacks, build up force and re-arm.”
But even before they broke the agreement, they had restricted the entrance and delivery of aid by fully controlling the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt. In this document too, they will retain control of Rafah and the Philadelphi Corridor, which runs along the entire border between Gaza and Egypt.
 
 

The document also envisages an interfaith dialogue geared towards changing mindsets and narratives. It is not clear how the exercise would work or who would undertake such a dialogue (the US? Some international syncretic body?). Who would determine that the mindsets have changed? Would it require addressing the apartheid and the occupation to which Palestinians have been subjected since 1948?
There’s no mention in the document of Zionist settlements and what Israeli architect and activist Eyal Weizman called vertical apartheid in the OPTs. In fact, the point about nixing the Zionist entity’s annexation of OPTs has just disappeared from the draft made public.
As for rebuilding Gaza and rehabilitating Gazans, the UN has estimated that 100 trucks working daily will take a minimum of 15 years just to clear the debris and unexploded ordnance in Gaza.
This is just a barebones review. There are multiple other points: reforming the Palestinian Authority (PA) and a maybe-ish reference to a credible pathway to a Palestinian state. Who will determine the key performance indicators for PA reforms? The Palestinians, the UN, the ‘Board of Peace’ or the Zionist entity? Who will determine and approve the conditions that may finally lead to Palestinian self-determination? What is the timeline? None of this is specified.
Trump wants quick results. Guess what? There are no quick results here. The win predictor for the plan as a just resolution forward is almost zero.
What Trump could do, however, is to set his peace plan on the right path by getting the history right. And it’s first lesson is that Zionists want to exterminate and expel the Palestinians. In order to understand the correct order of things, Trump has to first grasp that.

WHY TRUMP GOT IT WRONG THE LAST TIME
It all began after Donald Trump won as 45th President of the United States. Even before taking oath of office, he was working in support of the Zionist entity.
On the campaign trail, he had declared: “I think that [Barack] Obama has been very, very bad for the people of Israel. I am extremely strongly in favour… I respect it and have loved the people of Israel for a long time… we’re going to make sure that Israel is going to be in very good shape forever.”
During the transition period after his election, Netanyahu’s US ambassador, Ron Dermer, reached out to Trump to say that the outgoing president, Obama, whose relationship with Netanyahu had long hit rock bottom, was preparing to make a diplomatic move on the Palestinian issue at the United Nations Security Council. The move was to be spearheaded by Egypt.
Then, on December 21, 2016, Egypt circulated a draft condemning Zionist activities in the OPTs and declared that it would bring it to a vote in the UN Security Council the very next day. The Zionist entity went into overdrive. Netanyahu tweeted: “The US should veto the anti-Israel resolution at the UN Security Council on Thursday.”
Barak Ravid, a journalist from the Zionist entity, writes in his book Trump’s Peace that “Trump also put out a public statement calling on Obama to veto the resolution.” To cut the story short, the Egyptians caved into pressure from the Trump camp and Cairo declared that it was suspending the resolution indefinitely.
But the relief was short-lived. New Zealand, Malaysia, Senegal and Venezuela picked up the dropped ball and rammed the resolution through, with the US abstaining but not vetoing it. Netanyahu, Ravid writes, was furious, and summoned Dan Shapiro, the Jewish US ambassador to the Zionist entity, to give him a dressing down.
 
 

Later, Trump was to appoint David Friedman, an orthodox Zionist, as ambassador to the Zionist entity. Friedman’s orthodox religious views, his rejection of Palestinian statehood, his concept of Eretz Yisrael [Greater Israel] and his description of liberal Jews as “worse than kapos [a prisoner functionary at a Nazi concentration camp]” — a remark that almost cost him his nomination — are openly given in his book Sledgehammer: How Breaking with the Past Brought Peace to the Middle East.
The other person in Trump’s Middle East team was Jason Greenblat, who had studied in the 1980s “at a Yeshiva [Jewish seminary] located in a settlement” and “who shared Friedman’s passion for defending Israel.” The third was his son-in-law, Kushner.
After Trump’s inauguration, Kushner was to be the point person for resolving the Palestinian-Zionist conflict. Kushner brought in Avi Berkowitz, who had also spent years studying at a Yeshiva in Jerusalem. The composition of the team and how it would approach the issue was summed up by Friedman when he jokingly said: “Three orthodox Jews, that doesn’t seem like a good start.”
Kushner was clear. Getting the Zionist entity to deal with Palestinians was to be a separate track from getting Arab countries to normalise with the Zionist entity. His reasoning was thus: the UAE and Bahrain want to normalise with the Zionist entity. They want to be in the US camp and they are looking to modernise and diversify their economies. Let’s get Arab states to normalise and create the conditions that will force the Palestinians to make peace with the Zionist entity, having despaired of any external support.
The details of that process are complex and outside the scope of this article. But the long and short of it is that Trump’s Middle East team produced the Abraham Accords, despite Netanyahu’s insistence that there will be no Palestinian state and despite his constantly changing the goalposts and even blindsiding Trump during the presentation by Trump of the political portion of a peace deal at the White House in January 2020. Titled ‘Peace to Prosperity: A Vision to Improve the Lives of the Palestinian and Israeli People’, the deal sought to initiate a dialogue track between Zionists and the Palestinians.
Ravid notes in his book that, just as Trump presented his proposal, Netanyahu chimed in to say that “Israel will apply its laws to the Jordan Valley, to all Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria [West Bank] and to other areas that your plan designates as part of Israel and which the US agrees to recognise as part of Israel.”
Trump later reportedly said, “What the hell was that?” His proposal, even as it was loaded against the Palestinians and accepted the illegal Israeli settlements, was nonetheless about a land swap. It was a terrible deal — barren land for the Palestinians of the OPTs in the Negev desert — but it did allow some concessions to the Palestinians.
As the author and researcher Elham Fakhro writes in her book, “Netanyahu’s unilateral approach would have fragmented a possible Palestinian state beyond the model envisaged under the Trump proposal” and dispensed with any discussions with the Palestinians. In an interview to Ravid after he lost the election to Joe Biden, Trump used the F-bomb for Netanyahu and maintained that the man was simply not interested in a deal with the Palestinians.
In truth, the Trump and Netanyahu approaches can best be described as soft and hard annexations. David Friedman and Mike Pompeo wanted full annexation of the OPTs without any concessions to the Palestinians, while Kushner and Berkowitz insisted that “Israel’s annexation could only happen as part of the conditions laid down in the plan itself.”
The plan was rejected by the Palestinians as well as West Bank settlers who, like Netanyahu, were and are simply opposed to any idea of a Palestinian state and consider themselves the second vanguard to occupy the entire ‘Land of Israel’, as given in the Bible. For the settlers, a four-year freeze on settlement activity as part of the plan was another concession by Trump to the Palestinians on an issue that the Zionist hard right considers non-negotiable.
The plan was designed to fail, since Trump had earlier reversed decades of policy and accepted Jerusalem as the Zionist capital, recognised the occupied Golan Heights as part of the Zionist entity, and was now legitimising the settlements in violation of the 1978 Hensell Memorandum — wherein the US State Department legal adviser Herbert J Hansell had determined that Zionist settlements contravene the Fourth Geneva Convention and are therefore “inconsistent with international law.”
With the Zionist-Palestinian peace track dead in the water, it was the second track, getting interested Arab states to normalise with the Zionist entity that became the hallmark of Trump’s Middle East peace plan. The UAE and Bahrain already had covert and overt channels with the Zionist entity. It was time to make normalisation public, beginning with the UAE.
Here too, Netanyahu backtracked on his promises. One of the conditions by the UAE for normalisation was that the Zionists would not annex the OPTs. Within hours of Trump announcing the historic peace, Netanyahu in a televised speech said that “he had only agreed to delay the plans for annexation and not forgo them entirely.”
But the die had been cast and “Netanyahu’s backtracking did little to dissuade other states from following in the UAE’s footsteps.” Earlier, attempts by the PA to push through a resolution at the Arab League had failed because other member states did not want to antagonise the UAE.
Palestine’s and Palestinians’ isolation had begun. Simultaneously, unbeknown to anyone at the time, with Netanyahu gloating over his success to prescind the Palestinians and to ratchet up Zionist excess in the OPTs, the countdown to October 7, 2023 had also begun.
In trying to make a deal without appreciating the complexity of the situation, Trump had ended up preparing ground for a conflict that would result in Palestinian genocide and the Zionist entity’s isolation.

WHAT NEXT
After the Zionist entity’s illegal strike in Doha, which rattled the Gulf states, there was some expectation that the extraordinary session of the Arab League (AL) and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC) at Doha would come up with some concrete measures.
Instead, we got a lacklustre statement. For instance, the states that have normalised relations with the Zionist entity under the so-called Abraham Accords refused to entertain the idea of even downgrading diplomatic relations.
This was a repeat of the 2023 combined AL/OIC summit two weeks into the murderous onslaught of the Zionist entity in Gaza. The summit was convened by Saudi Arabia. But while it issued a pro forma statement calling for an immediate ceasefire, the entry of aid into the strip and the revival of talks around the two-state solution as the only viable framework for addressing the conflict, the six states that had normalised with the Zionist entity refused suggestions by Iran and Algeria that they cut off ties with the Zionist entity.
The summit ended up showcasing differences rather than closing ranks.
To recap: the Trump plan (a) treats the Palestinians as a threat, not an aggrieved party; (b) seeks to take the wind out of the sails of the movement to recognise Palestine; and (c) gives to Netanyahu what he wanted: Gaza under control, continuation of the policy of colonising the OPTs and interring the idea of a Palestinian state.
Trump recently told the media in the Zionist entity that “Israel has suffered a lot of damage on the world stage and I am gonna fix it. This [peace plan] is gonna fix it.”
One major problem from Netanyahu’s viewpoint is that, true to form, Trump is making it very public that he is the boss and he is pushing the buttons. Equally, Netanyahu is using it to get his rightwing coalition in line and telling them that this is about more than Gaza.
While his coalition has no interest in ending the war and most do not even see the return of captives as a priority — they want to expel the Palestinians and take over Gaza and the OPTs — they also want to stay in power. Recent polls show Netanyahu is unlikely to win a majority in the elections. That is helping to keep the flock together. Meanwhile, Netanyahu is most likely waiting for an opportunity to put a spoke in the wheels.
That could come sooner rather than later, since Hamas has entered the negotiations on a partial acceptance of the plan — the return of captives and permanent ceasefire — and has made no reference to the 20 points.
Hamas has also rejected any Western/external role in Gaza’s governance by saying that it “renews its agreement to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and Arab and Islamic support.”
Similarly, its ‘acceptance’ remains silent on one of the key demands of the US-Zionist plan: that Hamas disarm. Instead, Hamas has obliquely indicated that its disarmament and any role in governance are issues to be debated through an intra-Palestinian consensus. The subtext is that disarmament will have to proceed from, not precede, the establishment of a Palestinian state and the future is not just for Hamas to decide but must be based on a collective Palestinian consensus.
Read another way, Hamas is signalling that, beyond this point, the Palestinians as a collective need to step in and decide the future.
Netanyahu is hoping that, after the captives are returned, Trump would give an ultimatum to Hamas to accept other parts of the plan or face renewed hostilities.
So, why are the Arab states going along with this? First, because they also want an end to Hamas and second, they are hoping for some arrangement worked out by Trump, whereby the Zionist entity will give some space to the Palestinians, so they can continue with the normalisation process, the jewel being Saudi Arabia.
This is unlikely to happen because the very structures of this occupation prevent the Zionist entity from making a compromise with the Palestinians.
EPILOGUE
The Trump plan is unlikely to fly because (a) it’s ahistorical; (b) it doesn’t understand the nature of this war and its many battles; (c) it ignores societal attitudes in the Zionist entity, where the majority wants this war to continue and believes there are no innocents in Gaza; (d) the Zionist entity will never allow a Palestinian state — its parliament voted 68-9 in July 2024 to reject the idea of a Palestinian state, calling it an “existential danger” to the Zionist entity; and (e) flowing from (c) and (d), the Zionist entity has no interest in peace.
Its foremost objective is to ethnically cleanse Gaza and genocide is the means to that end.
The current talks might bring a brief reprieve, but a structural analysis forces us to look at the possibility of peace (defined even narrowly) as highly improbable. This should not be lost on the states that have “normalised” with the Zionists and thrown the Palestinians to the wolves. Will they re-evaluate?
Let me answer this question by first listing what they should have done after the Doha strike and which they can still do, and then list why they won’t do it and where this is headed.
What they should have done is:
• Derecognise/ delegitimise the Zionist entity
• Cut off and embargo trade and investment with the Zionist entity
•  Close all ports for Zionist-destined shipping
•  Close airspace for Zionist carriers
• Close US bases in the region (the OIC should have an extraordinary session, which should address the concerns of states)
•  Make a clear declaration of support for Palestine, including the right of return and ditching the stupid two-state solution
•  Provide financial support for building frontline states’ military capabilities
Much else can be done, but this should provide the baseline.
But this will not happen, because the ruling monarchies/ dictators want to perpetuate their rule and, in that, the US and the Zionists are their allies. So there’s no enabling environment for the actions listed above.
Three factors could help change this environment, one of which is happening:
• The extermination and expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza and the OPTs. In other words, complete occupation and annexation of Palestine. This will lead to a big exodus of Palestinians into Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and Syria.
• Continued attacks by the Zionists into neighbouring states, forcing them to rethink their options.
• The emergence of internal groups (Amal/Hezbollah in Lebanon against Zionist occupation of the ’80s/’90s is an example) that could either force the rulers to change course or help new dispensations to emerge.
As the political scientist and activist Norman Finkelstein said in an Al Jazeera programme, “There is no silver lining in a genocide.”

• Says courts likely to consider laying down arms as a mitigating factor in deciding cases
KARACHI: Surrendering dacoits in the Katcha region will face trial without pardon, though voluntary surrender may be considered a mitigating factor in sentencing by courts.
As per the Surrender Policy for Dacoits in Katcha Area of Sukkur and Larkana Divisions, recently approved by the Sindh cabinet, surrender does not mean pardon or immunity and all surrendering individuals shall face the prevailing law of the land, officials told Dawn.
The policy ensures surrendering dacoits would not face harm from law enforcement and their families would be shielded from any sort of harassment or retaliation, providing a safe passage for reintegration.
Speaking to Dawn, Home Minister Zia Lanjhar said that the Sindh government proactively worked to resolve tribal feuds, removing a major factor behind dacoit formation in the area.
 
 

He said that communities in the Katcha area were part of the extensive negotiations to build trust and confidence in the provincial government, aiming to remove incentives for criminals to keep operating.
“A large number of dacoits have now expressed willingness to surrender voluntarily,” he added.
The home minister said that the provincial government had formulated the surrender policy to consolidate peace, uphold the writ of the state and provide social-economic opportunities to local populace.
Surrender process
As per the policy, the process of surrender will be governed by the Criminal Procedure Code and Sindh Criminal Prosecution Service Act and all cases against the surrendering dacoits will proceed as per law.
However, courts may consider voluntary surrender as mitigating factor where legally permissible.
Surrendered dacoits will be categorised by the provincial police, in consultation with the prosecution department, based on the nature and gravity of their offenses. This categorisation will determine the course of action, including prosecution or reintegration measures under the policy.
The provincial police, working with the district administration and other agencies, will designate safe locations for dacoits to surrender as outlined in the policy.
All weapons, ammunition and explosives must be deposited with the police.
Under the surrender policy, all surrendering dacoits will undergo biometric registration and documentation. In cases where a valid Computerised National Identity Card is not available, the authorities concerned will initiate the process of for issuance of CNICs after due verification.
Protection of families
The policy guarantees protection for families of surrendered dacoits, ensuring no harassment, unlawful detention, or eviction, and allowing lawful landowners to continue cultivation and livelihood activities without interference.
It also ensures that families of surrendered dacoits would be provided access to public services, including healthcare and education.
Reintegration support
Under the surrender policy, technical and vocational training opportunities will be provided to surrendered individuals and their families, and agricultural support, including protection of harvests, will be ensured.
Employment opportunities in development projects in the Katcha region may also be offered to surrendered dacoits after completion of due process of law and their families.
Economic, social development
The provincial government in the surrender police also committed to sustained investment in the Katcha area for the revival of closed schools, construction and upgrading of schools, teachers’ recruitment, revival of closed health-care facilities, new hospitals, mobile health units, revival of closed veterinary facilities, provision of better communication services and community welfare programmes.

The Letters of Intent (LoIs) were signed at a ceremony held at the Governor House late Friday night in the presence of Saudi-Pakistan Joint Business Council (SPJBC) Chairman Prince Mansour bin Mohammad bin Saad Al Saud and Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori.
Saudi Ambassador Nawaf Saeed Al-Malki, Consul General Mohammed Abdullah Al-Subaie and Pakistan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmed Farooq also attended the event.
Under the MoUs, both countries agreed to collaborate on IT education, youth exchange programmes, joint training initiatives and sporting events to promote skills development and people-to-people connections.

KCCI urges Saudi investment in petrochemicals and agriculture

Speaking at the ceremony, Governor Tessori described Pak-Saudi relations as historically rooted in public goodwill, adding that partnerships in technology and sports would help develop youth potential while strengthening bilateral ties.
 






He announced that a friendly cricket match between the two countries would be organised soon to deepen cultural and social linkages.
Highlighting the global achievements of Pakistani youth, Mr Tessori said the provision of modern education, skills training and technological access remains a government priority. He called education, innovation and sports “critical pillars” of a sustainable and prosperous future.
Saudi team meets KCCI leadership
Prince Mansour also held a meeting with the leadership of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) to explore avenues for bilateral trade and investment.
 
 

The KCCI delegation, led by Chairman of Businessmen Group Zubair Motiwala and Vice Chairmen Anjum Nisar, Jawed Bilwani and Mian Abrar Ahmed, discussed sectoral opportunities in petrochemicals, downstream manufacturing, agriculture, IT and academic collaboration.
KCCI leadership stressed the urgent need for a domestic naphtha cracker facility — a foundational project for petrochemical value chains — to reduce reliance on imported polymers and raw materials. They argued that such a project could generate skilled jobs and boost competitiveness across key industrial sectors such as textiles, packaging, plastics and chemicals.
Publicly available industry estimates place the capital requirement for a naphtha cracker project in the multi-billion-dollar range. KCCI urged Saudi investors to consider viable financing models and long-term joint ventures to realise this goal.
The KCCI team called for detailed feasibility studies and the development of enabling infrastructure — including secure feedstock supply, port access and logistics — as well as fiscal incentives and regulatory clarity to attract anchor investors and foreign capital.
Beyond petrochemicals, opportunities were highlighted in value-added textiles, agribusiness, food processing and livestock development. KCCI noted that such investments would directly benefit small farmers, raise rural incomes and support export growth.
The delegation also proposed cooperation in information technology, including partnerships between Saudi industrial entities and Pakistani universities to support workforce development, R&D and technology transfer.
Exploring broad economic ties
Prince Mansour expressed keen interest in Pakistan’s potential and reiterated Saudi Arabia’s commitment to expanding economic cooperation, especially in energy, manufacturing, agriculture, and digital sectors.
He appreciated Governor Tessori’s initiatives on youth empowerment and acknowledged the talent and resilience of Pakistan’s young population.
The Saudi delegation’s discussions with KCCI reflected growing interest from Riyadh in strategic economic partnerships under Vision 2030, particularly as Pakistan looks to deepen ties with Gulf economies to attract investment and industrial collaboration.
The signing of the MoUs and the Saudi business delegation’s engagement with KCCI signal renewed momentum in Pakistan-Saudi bilateral economic ties, with a shared focus on youth development, industrialisation and technological collaboration. Stakeholders on both sides emphasised the need for structured partnerships, transparency in project development, and sustained dialogue to convert opportunities into tangible outcomes.

In an order issued by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, the court sought a compliance report from the secretary about an earlier order wherein the official was directed to place the matter before the prime minister for initiation of departmental proceedings against the responsible police officers. The incumbent IGP was also asked to submit a report on whether any action had been taken against the joint investigation team members and investigating officers involved.
The case stemmed from an FIR registered in 2015 for the recovery of Abdullah Umar and the judge was hearing a contempt petition filed by the victim’s wife, Zainab Zaeem.
Justice Kayani reminded the government functionaries about a 2019 order that had imposed a penalty of Rs2 million on senior police officials, including the IGP, over their failure to recover Mr Umar, and had directed the Accountant General of Pakistan Revenue (AGPR) to attach their salaries until his recovery.

Seeks report on action against police high-ups

During the hearing last week, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani was informed by Ms Zaeem that she had received Rs5m as per the earlier court order. The amount, she said, had been credited to her account.
The court proceedings had also involved in-camera briefings by officials of the Ministry of Defence regarding the alleged abduction. The additional attorney general (AAG) informed the court that two officials from the defence ministry intended to appear in chambers for an in-camera session, as directed by the court’s earlier order of Sept 26.
During the closed-door proceedings, it emerged that the nominated officers were senior officials from the defence ministry who had previously appeared in similar enforced disappearance cases. Justice Kayani, however, noted that the earlier directive — allowing the ministry to nominate officers from the relevant law enforcement agencies for the purpose of briefing — had not been followed in letter and spirit, said the court order.
Justice Kayani directed the respondents to fully comply with the previous court orders and nominate an officer from the field formation for the next in-camera briefing. 
He noted that the missing person, Mohammad Abdullah Umar, was “admittedly an injured person who was unable to perform his day-to-day functions prior to the date of his alleged abduction. 
The case was adjourned till Nov 11.

What is clear is that the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing in Gaza and their backers have learnt a lesson about the significance of the war of narratives.
And they aren’t wasting any time, given the speed with which they are moving to capture control over the means of propagating and controlling the narrative. A cursory glance at social media platform ownership and control abundantly demonstrates this. A day into the ceasefire has already seen a massive flood of pro-Israel content on all timelines.
With the use of algorithms and AI, the course of discussions is being altered to favour one side and the visibility of the other is being severely restricted. How do those on the other side, despite their staggering numbers, counter this?
The surge in support for the just Palestinian cause and the outpouring of outrage in Western cities at the Gaza genocide have been a characteristic response to the Israeli Occupation Forces’ (IOF) two-year brutal genocidal campaign in the Gaza Strip.

It’s difficult to say how any new conflict or renewed genocide will see content freely make its way to social media platforms.

Protesters have also found reprehensible the Israeli settler violence against the Palestinians, their displacement, the destruction of their infrastructure and their means of livelihood in the West Bank. These protesters have braved often ruthless police violence (as in Germany) and hundreds of arrests, as we saw in Britain, including of the infirm and elderly, for simply demonstrating with placards in support of an organisation designated ‘terrorist’, at the behest of the Labour touts of an Israeli arms manufacturer.
These street protests have shown how the genocidal Israeli apartheid state has lost the war for the moral high ground after decades of finding many a sympathetic ear for its victimhood narrative. This change in the public sentiment created a chasm between the genocide-supporting Western European governments and their people.
Perhaps for Israel, even worse was the change in mood in America where the apartheid state has always enjoyed unrivalled precedence owing in no insignificant measure to the funding of politicians — from White House incumbents to Congress members — by billionaire ‘friends of Israel’ and organisations such as the AIPAC.
In addition to the Israeli ban on foreign journalists reporting from Gaza, the legacy media itself may have covered the Gaza genocide with the necessary filters and censorship in place to offer a sanitised view of the murders of thousands of people, including some 20,000 children, following the Oct 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on Israel in which some 800 civilians and nearly 400 security personnel were killed.
 
 

It is not clear how many fell to Hamas and how many became victims of the Hannibal Directive of the IOF whereby the authorities prefer to kill their own citizens rather than have them fall into ‘enemy’ hands and become hostages and a bargaining chip. A few segments of the Israeli media that remain independent have carried gunship pilot testimonies about this.
As social media images continued to paint a picture of the brutally disproportionate IOF response in Gaza with the number of dead or amputee children running into several thousands, public opinion started to change in the US. Several recent opinion polls support this suggestion.
A majority of young Democrats started looking at Israel negatively and supporting the occupied Palestinian cause. But even more ominously for Israel and its unshakeable pillar of support, President Donald J. Trump, the genocide created a split within the latter’s MAGA movement.
With leading MAGA figures such as Marjorie Taylor Greene, Tucker Carlson and Candace Owens beginning to question the wisdom of blind US support to Israel, and its psychopathic leader Benjamin Netanyahu, the game was beginning to turn. Trump could neither ignore nor attack this influential segment of his diehard support base.
This split, along with the Trump family’s business ties with the mega rich Arab Gulf states, whose initial indifference to the Gaza genocide changed dramatically after Israel’s missile attack on Qatari soil, may have guided his hand to eventually ask Israel to pause its ruthless genocidal military campaign against Gaza’s Palestinians.
While X was already in the hands of one of Israel’s uncompromising supporters, Elon Musk, and with Meta (which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) controlled by the evil manipulator Mark Zuckerberg (whose track record of being pro-Israel and also backing right-wing causes is exactly like Musk’s), the very influential TikTok was the only social media platform that represented all user opinion regardless of who it favoured.
Brandishing the threat of shutting it down, Trump forced the Chinese owners to sell off TikTok US operations to Larry Ellison, the Oracle’s multibillionaire owner, whose son also owns/controls Paramount and, therefore, all the content on the influential CBS News in the US. Ellison is a diehard friend/funder of Israel and IOF.
With the wealth and social media empires owned by three of the richest men in the world — their collective worth surpassing a trillion and a half dollars — now firmly in the control of the genocidal Zionists’ sympathisers and supporters, it will be difficult to say how any new conflict or renewed genocide in Gaza will see content freely making its way to these platforms. Loopholes that existed earlier and afforded more openness will surely be plugged now.
Israel killed over 200 journalists in Gaza and blocked foreign media from the Strip to stop news trickling out to shape public opinion. It failed mainly because of social media images. Will this tightening of the grip via algorithms on social media change the flow of information and its impact on global public opinion? Or can the sheer numbers of users force these commercial enterprises not to censor at will?

The TTP, aligned with the Afghan Taliban and global terrorist networks such as Al Qaeda, fully exploited the government’s attempts at mainstreaming them and used the process to restructure and expand its network inside the country. On the other hand, the TLP, once a banned extremist organisation, exploits the state and violates its writ whenever it feels the need to mobilise its workers and bring them onto the streets.
While the TTP is a terrorist group directly confronting the state and its security forces, the TLP is an adversary of the state and society in disguise. It operates through narratives that weaken state authority, create diplomatic friction and damage Pakistan’s international standing. The group has already caused such strains in the past, particularly vis-à-vis European countries, most notably France. It has now announced a march on the US embassy in Islamabad at a time when Pakistan-US relations are stabilising after two decades of mistrust.
 
 

Any protest targeting the US diplomatic mission inevitably evokes memories among American and Pakistani security officials of the incident in November 1979, when the Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT), the radical student movement of the time, attacked the US embassy in Islamabad following false rumours that the US was involved in the assault on Masjid al-Haram in Makkah. A decade later, in February 1989, the IJT again resorted to violent protest, this time against a controversial novel.
The TLP carries the same menacing potential that the IJT once possessed. Both enjoyed, in their respective times, a degree of patronage from state institutions, a factor that encouraged them to push far beyond the limits set by their patrons, believing themselves to be autonomous and emboldened by their perceived bargaining power with the state.

The state now intends to eliminate the threat through coercive means, whatever the cost.

The state’s calculus has remained tricky. It remains puzzling why it so often surrenders to extremists under the pretext of maintaining peace and order through non-violent means. In certain instances, particularly during periods of political turmoil, the state has even allowed such groups the freedom to act, or worse, subtly encouraged them to do so. The purpose seems nothing more than to suppress political opponents.
Though the state institutions regard the TTP as an enemy, in the past, they have tried to deal with it in much the same way as they have handled the TLP in Punjab and Karachi, alternating between appeasement and accommodation. For now, however, the state has completely abandoned its earlier approach and intends to eliminate the threat through coercive means, whatever the cost.
 
 

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently warned Kabul to choose between supporting Pakistan or siding with the outlawed TTP, accusing militants of crossing from Afghanistan to carry out deadly attacks. He issued this warning during a visit to Bannu, where he was accompanied by Field Marshal Asim Munir and Peshawar Corps Commander Lt-Gen Omer Bukhari, following clashes in which 19 soldiers were martyred and 45 militants killed in KP.
Pakistan has, in recent months, pursued a calibrated strategy to pressure the Afghan Taliban to curb support for anti-Pakistan militant groups such as the TTP, the Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, and Baloch insurgent leaders. This effort has combined diplomatic engagement with public exposure of cross-border militant activity.
The recent aerial strikes reportedly inside Afghanistan on TTP hideouts and moving targets, conducted during Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Muttaqi’s visit to India, are seen as a message, both to the TTP, underscoring Pakistan’s zero tolerance for terrorism within its borders, and the Taliban leadership, reminding it that it cannot bypass Pakistan and must address its concerns. These developments have also reinforced the view within Pakistan’s security institutions that the TTP continues to receive backing from India.
The TTP problem becomes more complex because of its deep-rooted ties with the Afghan Taliban. The latter are unwilling to entirely abandon the TTP, as they view it in much the same way as the Pakistan establishment once viewed the Afghan Taliban — potential proxies in a complicated border security environment.
 
 

A segment within the Taliban leadership believes that if they sever ties with the TTP, Pakistan will become more assertive towards Afghanistan, particularly on issues of trade, border management and, most importantly, the long-standing border demarcation dispute. They continue to regard the Durand Line as a contested boundary between the two countries.
In this context, Pakistan’s options are limited, and the quickest course may be to rely on coercive measures, a choice that could provoke anger in Afghanistan. Islamabad already lacks a favourable public opinion there, particularly since the large-scale repatriation of Afghan refugees began.
Obviously, the TLP is not an armed militia like the TTP and therefore requires a different approach. Yet, its potential to harm national harmony, disrupt law and order, and create chaos has enormous consequences, clearly detrimental to the economy, political stability and the image Pakistan needs to project to attract foreign investment.
The TLP issue can be managed through a mix of measures: re-imposing the ban if necessary, taking control of its madressahs and mosques, as was done with the banned Jamaatud Dawa’s assets under UN Security Council and FATF pressure, and, most importantly, appointing moderate imams in its affiliated mosques.
However, this would pose a significant challenge for the state. The religious radicalism it has nurtured over the past four or more decades has produced very few moderate or reasonable religious scholars. Many of those who do exist have already left the country, while others are preparing to do so.

Two years after the genocide was unleashed by Israel, the Gazans are thankful that the slaughter is over — though for how long is anyone’s guess. But in the midst of their respite there is also grief and bitterness. Some have lost entire families, while others mourn a child, a sibling, a parent, a spouse or a friend murdered by the Zionist regime. Along with medics to address the effects of the deliberate famine inflicted on them, the survivors will need professional help to cope with their mental wounds.
Beyond the self-congratulatory rhetoric coming out of the White House about having secured ‘peace’, the first priority must be the humanitarian uplift of the population. As the spokesperson of the UN’s humanitarian agency said, the job ahead is “monumental”.
 
 

The Gaza genocide must never be forgotten. Just as the West ensures that the Holocaust — perpetrated by one of its own — continues to be remembered, so too must the memory of the Palestinian holocaust be kept alive. Over 67,000 people have been butchered by Tel Aviv in plain sight, while many more bodies may be buried under the tons of rubble. These crimes must not be forgotten and brushed under the rug; there must be accountability for those responsible, in Tel Aviv and beyond, for the murder and starvation of occupied Gaza’s population.
There are also important questions about how long the ceasefire will last, considering Israel’s dubious record of repeatedly breaking its word. More cynical observers are of the view that the Zionist regime may restart its genocidal campaign once the Israeli prisoners are back. One can only hope that this will not be the case, and that the architects of this plan, namely the US and the Arab states, ensure that Israel sticks to its word.
The status of the latter stages of Donald Trump’s peace deal are also unclear, specifically with regard to Hamas’s surrender of its weapons, and the question of who will govern Gaza. Several Palestinian groups, including Hamas, Islamic Jihad and the PFLP, have said they reject the ‘foreign guardianship’ of Gaza.
 
 

Under no means must a colonial enterprise be allowed to ‘oversee’ the Strip; it is the Palestinians themselves who should be deciding their future. After the ceasefire, it would be unfair not to acknowledge the tens of thousands, if not millions, of people who marched in Western cities calling for justice in Palestine, even as many of their governments remained complicit in the genocide.
But let there be no illusions: long-term peace can only come about with the liberation of occupied Palestinian land, and the creation of a viable Palestinian state.

“Everything that is done is elitist to satisfy or protect industry or perhaps pressure groups, but an ordinary person is not in the picture,” he said, speaking at Breathe Pakistan’s session “Judicial Activism and Litigation for Clean Air in Pakistan.”
Senior lawyer Faisal Siddiqui conducted the session.
The judge said he realised, during his whole career as a lawyer and a judge, “the ordinary person is not relevant.”

Says environmental watchdog fully captured by govt

Justice Shah, who is known for his work on public interest and the environment, said he was not against development, but it should be done in an intelligent way.
He lamented that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the regulatory body to control projects, was a department fully captured by the government. He said a famous judgement known as the “Imrana Tiwana case” held that there was total regulatory capture.
“Do you think the EPA can tell the provincial government that this project is not allowed?” Justice Shah said, highlighting the regulatory capture.
He also questioned the capacity and qualification of the people running the EPA.
 
 

He noted that the bureaucrats heading environment departments have no expertise required to deal with climate issues.
Justice Shah held civil society responsible for the lack of public interest litigation pertaining to air pollution and climate change. He said civil society had not done much to protect the environment.
“You should be more active, you should have come to courts, pursued cases and fought for your rights. If you are not going to fight for your right, nobody is going to bother about you,” he said, addressing civil society.
He maintained that civil society and regulatory functions were weak and the government was not interested in people.
Capacity building of judges
Justice Shah also called for the capacity building of judges in the higher courts, saying, “the environment is a niche litigation.”
He said the judiciary had few judges dealing with environmental matters as the whole corpus of the judiciary did not know much about the environment. He said the most serious existential threat Pakistan was facing was climate change.
There cannot be a more serious threat to Pakistan than climate change right now or air pollution and we are not bothered, he lamented.
He expressed his disappointment that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief Minister of Punjab Maryam Nawaz, who were invited to the conference, did not attend the event to tell the audience about their plans. He said they might be busy, but it shows what interests they have as far as climate change and air pollution are concerned, as these issues affect millions of people.
Justice Shah stated that the country would need “climate courts” in the future. He also called for establishing “climate finance” to cater to the chronic issues of the environment. He reiterated that there was a serious governance issue on the part of the executive, coupled with a nice relaxed civil society.

Gaps in law enforcement
Addressing the same questions, Supreme Court Justice Ayesha A. Malik also pointed out lapses on the part of the executive and the regulatory bodies. She said there were big gaps in the enforcement and the implementation.
The judge highlighted the issues she encountered hearing cases related to the establishment of brick kilns and poultry farms. She admitted that persons doing lawful businesses also need fair regulation.
She noted that in most of the cases related to environmental issues, the regulator appeared to have worked with no urgency and commitment.
Justice Malik regretted that the government did not have the capacity to dispose of the corpses after killing the dogs, which itself is wrong.
“You do not have an arrangement to deal with the carcass. You do not know what to do with it. Then why are you killing the dogs in the first place?” the judge asked.
She noted that the jurisprudence for judges evolves when a problem keeps coming before them. She called the gap in the enforcement and implementation a bigger challenge for all.

Lahore High Court Justice Jawad Hassan noted that Pakistan’s judiciary always led the way internationally on its judgements. He said Pakistan had its Constitution almost 53 years ago, but it never had the right to the environment in that Constitution. He said the 26th Amendment had only last year inserted Article 9A in the Constitution, which gives every citizen a right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.
He pointed out that decades ago there was litigation before the court for the enforcement of the motor vehicle ordinance, and the law had not been implemented by the government until last year, and now everybody had EPA stickers on their vehicles.
In an observation, which Justice Shah incidentally disagreed with, Justice Hassan said the government had woken up now just because of what the judiciary had been doing.
He was also of the opinion that the government had started taking robust measures for the enforcement of the environmental laws.

This has led to significant financial distress, particularly among industries already grappling with economic challenges.
Industrialists have pointed out that, had the gas consumption been assessed using off-peak rates, the cost per unit would be around Rs238. However, the bills reflect charges nearly double or up to two and a half times higher than this amount. The misapplication of peak-hour charges has led to widespread complaints from industrial consumers, who argue that this billing method is both incorrect and unjustified.

Karachi chamber raises concerns over peak-hour charges, demands uniform 24-hour tariff

In a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Businessmen Group (BMG) Chairman Zubair Motiwalla and Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jawed Bilwani called the inflated charges unaffordable and warned that if not corrected, they would lead to industry closures, loss of jobs, and a sharp decline in Pakistan’s export competitiveness.
While it has been suggested that the high charges stem from IMF directives, KCCI maintains that this justification is misplaced. The chamber emphasised that while IMF programmes may call for fiscal reforms, they do not mandate the indiscriminate application of peak-hour rates. They further argued that such pricing practices undermine the basic principles of cost-reflective pricing and fairness, contradicting the government’s industrial facilitation efforts.
The KCCI has urged the prime minister to intervene and direct a review of the gas bills issued to industrial consumers this month, ensuring the misapplication of peak-hour charges is corrected. They have also called for the introduction of a uniform 24-hour tariff for industrial users, which would simplify billing, restore fairness, and enhance investor and exporter confidence.

This funding aims to ensure a sustainable supply of safe water and alleviate the environmental damage caused by untreated sewage discharge in the city.
The loan, approved by the Beijing-based institution on Thursday, will also support the Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency (LWASA) in improving its institutional capacity, enabling it to provide better services to the residents of Lahore while becoming a financially sustainable entity.
Lahore faces a dual challenge of inadequate clean water and untreated wastewater overflow, both of which require urgent attention from the provincial government. The AIIB financing will be directed towards addressing these issues in a coordinated manner.
The Punjab government had requested the AIIB’s support for the construction of infrastructure to divert water from the nearby Banbawala Ravi Bedian Depalpur (BRBD) Canal, as well as the establishment of a new surface water treatment plant (SWTP). The project also seeks to reduce non-revenue water (NRW) from its current 45 per cent to below 20pc by replacing old pipes that are responsible for water losses and allowing the infiltration of wastewater, which contributes to the spread of waterborne diseases.
Another key aspect of the project is the installation of water meters. Currently, about 90pc of water connections in Lahore are unmetered, leading to overconsumption and water theft. The financing will enable the installation of bulk meters and the implementation of 100pc metering, billing, and collection systems, aiming for at least a 90pc collection rate.
The project will also invest in enhancing existing water quality monitoring systems and laboratories, as well as providing specialised staff training to ensure the maintenance of the new treatment plants and effective management of water resources. The government has also requested technical assistance to develop a regulatory framework to strengthen public-private partnerships for capital expansion and operational management.
 
 

On the wastewater front, Lahore currently lacks a treatment facility. All domestic and industrial wastewater is directly discharged into the River Ravi, resulting in severe pollution. It is estimated that the river receives approximately 640 million gallons per day (MGD) of untreated wastewater, effectively turning it into a sewage drain.
The River Ravi plays a crucial role in replenishing the groundwater supply for Lahore, contributing up to 82pc of the city’s water. However, the contamination of the river has led to polluted water seeping into the groundwater, rendering it unfit for drinking and harming soil fertility.
 
 

This contamination has led to an increase in waterborne diseases, including diarrhea, typhoid, hepatitis, and intestinal worms, in several parts of the city. Moreover, since Lahore is located at the upstream end of the River Ravi, the pollution has regional consequences, impacting agriculture and economic activities in the downstream areas.
To address these issues, LWASA has already prepared a blueprint and draft feasibility study for the construction of wastewater treatment plants. The plan includes six treatment plants, with three to be financed by the AIIB, while the remaining three are expected to be funded by other international financial institutions.

• Beijing residents dismiss US pressure, see limited impact on daily life
BEIJING: China will begin levying port fees on US-built, owned, operated, or flagged vessels from Tuesday, in a direct response to similar char­ges being introduced by the United States on China-linked ships the same day, the Chinese transport ministry said on Friday, as reported by Reuters.
Later that day, US President Donald Trump announced an increase in tariffs on all Chinese exports to the US, raising them to 100 per cent from Nov 1, and unveiled new export controls on strategic software. The move came in response to China’s recent curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.
Although few US-flagged or built ships are engaged in international trade, China’s new port fee regime casts a wider net by targeting vessels where US-domiciled funds hold 25pc or more in shares or board seats. Analysts say this will significantly broaden the scope of affected companies, particularly those listed on US exchanges.
“This could affect many public shipping companies and cause substantial disruption,” said Erik Broekhuizen, a marine analyst at shipbroking firm Poten & Partners.
Several shipping firms are already preparing for dual exposure to port levies from both countries. US-based Matson has told customers it will be subject to China’s fees but will maintain its current schedule. Oil tanker companies, although largely based outside the US, may also be impacted if they are listed on US exchanges. Scorpio Tankers, one of the sector’s largest operators, is among those potentially affected.
Data from shipbroker Fearnleys shows nearly 10pc of the global very large crude carrier fleet, and 13pc of the Suezmax, Aframax and LR2 fleet, could be caught in the net.
Energy data firm Vortexa estimated that 43 LPG super tankers — or 10pc of the global fleet — may also be affected.
China’s own carriers, including state-owned COSCO and its subsidiary OOCL, will face reciprocal fees from the US. COSCO could incur costs of nearly $2bn in 2026, analysts said. COSCO did not issue a public response.
China’s transport ministry criticised the US port fees as “discriminatory”, accusing Washington of undermining global trade and shipping stability.
Fee structure, timeline
The new port levy in China will start at 400 yuan ($56) per net metric ton from Tuesday. The rate will rise to 640 yuan ($90) from April 2026, 880 yuan ($124) from April 2027, and reach 1,120 yuan ($157) by April 2028.
The US, for its part, has imposed a flat rate of $50 per net tonnage on vessels owned or operated by Chinese entities.
The escalation follows a fragile truce agreed in August, which paused new tariffs for 90 days. That truce is set to expire in early November. In the current round of hostilities, Chinese imports of US agricultural and energy goods have dropped sharply.
“I felt nothing when I saw the news,” said Liu Ming, a 48-year-old software employee. “Trump always announces such capricious policies. China is not afraid.” While policymakers clash, residents in Beijing expressed little alarm over Trump’s latest tariff threat.
Several residents interviewed by AFP described Trump as unpredictable, with one joking that his stance could shift after a nap. Others warned the tariffs could hurt American consumers more than the Chinese economy.

• US, UK, and Nato conduct air patrol along Russia’s border
KYIV: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged US President Donald Trump on Saturday to use the diplomatic success he achieved in the Middle East as a model to end the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, saying that if Trump could stop one war, “others can be stopped as well.”
The appeal came during a phone call between the two leaders, just a day after Moscow launched what Ukrainian officials described as a large-scale attack targeting critical energy facilities across 10 regions, including the capital Kyiv.
“If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well, including the Russian war,” Zelen­sky wrote on Facebook, describing what he characterised as a “very positive and productive” conversation with Trump.
The timing of the appeal underscores Ukraine’s growing concern that its nearly three-year conflict with Russia has slipped down the international agenda, overshadowed by the Gaza crisis and other global flashpoints.
Diplomatic momentum has stalled in recent months, with both sides accusing the other of undermining potential negotiations.
Relations between the two leaders have warmed dramatically since Febru­ary, when they sparred during a now infamous televised meeting at the White House.
 
 

Trump has since grown more hostile towards Moscow while expressing sympathy for Ukraine.
In September, he wrote on Truth Social that Kyiv should try to “take back” all its occupied territory with Europe’s and Nato’s help.
US First Lady Melania Trump said Friday she had secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia after establishing an extraordinary back channel of communication with Putin.
Power restored
Meanwhile, emergency crews restored power to many parts of Ukraine after an overnight Russian drone and missile attack on Friday struck energy facilities, plunging large districts of Kyiv and other areas into darkness and cutting water supplies.
Friday’s strikes, which Ukrainian officials said killed at least five people and disrupted power supplies in the southern Odesa region.
Moscow has targeted Ukraine’s energy grid each winter since it invaded in 2022, cutting power and heating to millions of households and disrupting water supply in what Kyiv says is a brazen war crime.
Russia denies targeting civilians and says Ukraine uses the energy sites to power its military sector.
Ukrainian drone attacks meanwhile killed two people in Russia, according to regional officials. Both countries have accused each other of frustrating progress towards a peace deal in recent months.
Russia blames Kyiv and its European allies for the impasse, accusing them of undermining peace negotiations with Washington.
 
 

Ukraine and Europe accuse Russia of playing for time so it can seize more Ukrainian territory.
Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, describing it as a “special military operation” to demilitarise the country and prevent the expansion of NATO.
Kyiv and its European allies say the war is an illegal land grab that has resulted in tens of thousands of civilian and military casualties and widespread destruction.
Jets fly near Russian border
Britain said on Saturday that two Royal Air Force aircraft flew a 12-hour mission earlier this week alongside US and Nato forces to patrol the border of Russia, amid a series of recent Russian drone and aircraft incursions into Nato airspace.
“This was a substantial joint mission with our US and Nato allies,” defence minister John Healey said.
“Not only does this provide valuable intelligence to boost the operational awareness of our Armed Forces, but sends a powerful message of Nato unity to Putin and our adversaries,” Healey added.

• High-level diplomatic summit, led by the US and Egypt, planned to oversee the deal’s implementation
GAZA CITY: More than half a million displaced Palestinians have streamed back into the ruins of Gaza City since Friday’s ceasefire took hold, confronting a landscape of devastation that has transformed entire neighbourhoods into fields of rubble.
Long columns of residents travelled north along a coastal road, with many stunned by the destruction, after Israel agreed to the truce on Friday and pulled troops from several areas of the territory.
Raja Salmi was amongst those making the arduous journey home, walking for hours through the debris-strewn streets to reach what remained of her house in the once-affluent al-Rimal neighbourhood.
“I stood before it and cried,” she said, surveying the pile of rubble where her home once stood. “All those memories are now just dust.”
The mass return, confirmed by Gaza’s civil defence agency, came as Israel began preparations to release Palestinian prisoners under the terms of the US-brokered agreement. The Israeli prison service said staff had “operated throughout the night” to transfer detainees to facilities ahead of their release.
 


The complex prisoner exchange — 47 Israeli prisoners for 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 Gazans detained during the conflict represents the most significant diplomatic breakthrough since the war began.
However, the durability of the truce remains uncertain, as in an interview with AFP in Qatar, Hossam Badran, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, warned: “The second phase of the Trump plan, as it is clear from the points themselves, contains many complexities and difficulties.”
Hamas, he said, would not attend the formal signing of the Gaza peace deal in Egypt, where international leaders are due to gather Monday to discuss implementing the first phase of the ceasefire.
Hamas is resisting calls to disarm. An official from the group, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that it was “out of the question”.
Mr Badran said that, while the group does not want war, “our Palestinian people and the resistance force will undoubtedly confront and use all their capabilities to repel this aggression if this battle is imposed”.
Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 67,682 people, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, figures the United Nations considers credible.
International mobilisation
The truce has prompted a flurry of diplomatic activity, with Egyptian officials confirming plans for a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh to oversee the agreement’s implementation.
US President Donald Trump, who claimed credit for pushing through the deal, is expected to lead the summit alongside Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, though no date has been confirmed.
Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed arrangements for the summit on Friday.
European leaders are also mobilising, with Emmanuel Macron scheduled to arrive in Egypt on Monday, whilst Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni have signalled their intention to attend the gathering.
The international engagement extends to military planning, with Admiral Brad Cooper, head of US Central Command (CENTCOM), making a visit to Gaza on Saturday to discuss post-conflict stabilisation efforts.
Cooper stressed that whilst American forces would help coordinate a multinational monitoring force — potentially including troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the UAE — no US troops would be deployed inside Gaza itself.
However, under Trump’s peace plan, an initial deployment of 200 US troops is set to arrive in Israel to help monitor the ceasefire.

Punjab Police, in an attempt to stop the march towards the federal capital, have reportedly dug a trench on the road.
Earlier in the day, clashes between supporters of the religious party and police were reported in the Shahdara area of Lahore earlier today. At least 40 police personnel have been injured today, while the TLP claims that more than 10 of its workers have been killed in clashes with law enforcers.
TLP began its protests in Lahore on Thursday and announced plans to march to the US embassy in Islamabad to voice its opposition to the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after two years of conflict in Gaza. The demonstrations turned violent on Friday, with police launching baton charges and firing tear gas at protesters who had pelted
them with rocks, AFP journalists saw.
Arrests in Karachi
Police in Karachi arrested over a dozen TLP workers on Saturday in a bid to break up their protest at the Karachi Press Club (KPC).
Roads leading to JPC were blocked earlier in the day. DIG South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that 18 TLP workers were apprehended when they arrived at Regal Chowk in Saddar.
A spokesperson for the religious party, Mohammad Rehan Khan, told Dawn.com that as part of the country-wide protest, they had planned to demonstrate outside the KPC against the Punjab government’s action against their protest rally in Lahore. He said since all roads leading to the KPC were blocked, they could not reach the venue and confirmed that some party workers were detained by the police.
‘Cleared them from Lahore’
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran, addressing the media, said some police personnel were still admitted in hospitals and undergoing treatment, while others have been discharged. He added that TLP protesters have also damaged government property.
“We have records of 15 calls from citizens stating that the protesters have stolen their vehicles. You have seen how this group behaves in the past. The common citizen is the one who is suffering the most, roads are blocked, and property has been damaged,” said the senior police officer.
He elaborated that the police station in Shahdara was also ransacked by TLP supporters. “The frontline force for internal security is the police, and state institutions are backing us. We have cleared them from Lahore and the situation has settled somewhat. We are trying to make sure there is as little damage as possible.”
Offering the religious party an olive branch, Kamran said that they are open to talks. “But if you continue to inconvenience the public and vandalise property, then the state is ready to deal with the situation.”
Giving an overview of the situation, he said 112 police personnel have been injured since the start of the protest and added that some police personnel are also missing. “They [the TLP] are showing footage of where they are taking the abducted policemen,” said the DIG.
Punjab Police question TLP’s motives
Punjab Police posted a lengthy statement on X questioning the TLP’s motives behind the march. Video footage attached to the post showed policemen being beaten and cars with shattered windshields.
“A peace agreement has been reached in Gaza, the Muslims there are celebrating and thanking Allah for the establishment of peace; why are the TLP demonstrators representing by wreaking havoc in Pakistan?” the police asked in the statement.
“It is clear from such actions that the TLP people are also saddened by the establishment of peace in Gaza and this anarchist group is actively supporting the mission of Israeli Jews,” the statement added.
 






The police questioned how kidnapping police personnel and engaging in widespread vandalism displayed loyalty to the people of Gaza.
“Some anarchist groups from the TLP are misleading the public in the name of religion and trying to disrupt the peace,” the statement read. “Attacks on police officers and road closures will not be tolerated under any circumstances.”
Punjab Police warned that people who take the law into their own hands would be dealt with an iron fist and urged the public to avoid supporting “mischievous elements”, be mindful of misinformation and cooperate with the authorities.
Residents in twin cities face disruptions
Residents in Islamabad and Rawalpindi have complained of road closures, traffic jams, and mobile network disruptions.
Activities across the twin cities remained disrupted for the second consecutive day amid security measures and traffic restrictions, with authorities also suspending mobile internet connections and closing major roads. Shipping containers were being placed as barriers across major roads in the capital in anticipation of the arrival of the protesters.
Islamabad Police spokesperson Jawad Taqi told Dawn.com that no TLP protesters have entered the city, nor have any within the capital taken to streets to demonstrate.
“With the exception of Faizabad, all roads in Islamabad are open,” he said in a voice note. “There are no issues. Some containers have been placed on certain roads, but traffic is still able to move.”
According to an earlier notification issued by the Islamabad Traffic Police, “entry of all types of heavy vehicles into the capital will remain suspended until further notice.”
“Traffic diversions are being implemented due to the law and order situation in Islamabad’s Faizabad area, and commuters are advised to use alternative routes to avoid inconvenience,” the notification added.
Residents of the twin cities voiced frustration over the severe traffic disruptions.
Shazia Tahir, a resident of Islamabad, told Dawn.com that her usual 20-minute commute to work took more than an hour due to multiple road closures.
“I went to Radio Pakistan [office] this morning — the highway from Khanna was closed, and all connecting streets to Rawalpindi were blocked. Faizabad was also sealed. From the highway near Khanna Bridge, I had to take the service road through Sohan, then pass Margalla Town, take the road between Aabpara and F-6 to finally reach the Red Zone via Margalla Road. It took us one hour and fifteen minutes to get there,” she said.
Others reported communication disruptions alongside traffic issues. Fauzia Kulsoom, a journalist from Rawalpindi, told Dawn.com that mobile services in Islamabad’s Blue Area remained suspended from 2pm to 5pm the previous day.
“The Internet has been down for two days,” she said, adding that her work has been severely disrupted because of that.
Some residents described partial closures and heavy congestion in several areas. Riaz Ali, a resident of Bahria Town, Islamabad, told Dawn.com that while containers had been placed and certain routes blocked, movement elsewhere remained possible.
“Containers exist, some roads are blocked — Faizabad and GT Road — but things are otherwise open. I haven’t travelled over the past couple of days, but data services are still off,” he said.
He added that on GT Road, near City Grammar School, containers had been placed on both sides, causing severe traffic jams. “There were large trucks, and only a few bikers managed to pass through the narrow gaps between the containers. Police presence was minimal, just a couple of officers. At the entrance to Bahria Phase 7, traffic was also backed up. In short, traffic was choked badly in this part of Bahria yesterday,” he said.
Meanwhile, citizens in other parts of the country trying to travel to Islamabad also voiced frustration over the road closures and communication outages.
Ramna Saeed, an Islamabad resident currently in Gujranwala, said she was unable to travel to the capital for her final LLB exam due to road closures.
“All main entry points — Chanda Qila, Sadoki, Kamoki — were shut since morning, and trenches were dug overnight. We haven’t seen such measures here before,” she said.
Ramna added that students and commuters were left stranded, with little information on when routes would reopen. “Mobile internet has also been disrupted, and although calls work, 3G and 4G services are barely functioning,” she said.
Key intersections, including Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh Turn, DAV College Chowk, MH Chowk, and Naz Cinema, were closed to traffic. In the Saddar area, Haider Road, Suzuki Stand, and Murree Chowk were also blocked, while access roads leading to Kachehri Chowk remained inaccessible, per the traffic police notification.
It said partial traffic movement resumed at Sawan Bridge and New Gulzar-i-Quaid, but major interchanges such as Chakri, Thalian, Brahma, and Mandara stayed closed, severing Rawalpindi’s access from major highways. The situation was similar at rural entry points, with Dholtala Mor, Misa Kaswal, Bai Khan Bridge, and GT Road near Gujar Khan all shut down.
Meanwhile, motorway authorities said M-1 was open only towards Peshawar, while M-2 remained closed in both the Rawalpindi and Lahore directions.
Friday clashes following protest call
As many as 50 police officers were injured in Friday’s clashes, a senior police official told AFP, while TLP’s claims that some of its members had been killed could not be verified independently.
The TLP said the protests had originally been organised to oppose the Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, which Pakistan backed, but was now intended to express solidarity with Palestinians.
“We have no demands, apart from showing solidarity with the people of Gaza,” senior TLP member Allama Muhammad Irfan told AFP as the protesters set off for Islamabad.
“We have no idea when we will reach Islamabad, but the government is being brutal with us. We are not negotiating with the government at all,” Irfan said.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry vowed on Thursday not to let the protesters enter Islamabad.
“There is no room for any radical activity in Islamabad,” he told reporters. “Why is an agreement that is acceptable to Hamas and Palestine not acceptable to you?”
Israel declared a ceasefire and began pulling back its troops at around noon on Friday, as tens of thousands of Palestinians began walking back towards their devastated homes.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the deal on Thursday as a “historic opportunity to secure lasting peace”.
“We will continue to work with partners, friends and the leaders of brotherly nations to ensure that peace, security and dignity for the Palestinian people are established,” he said.

“As part of a treatment plan for prostate cancer, President Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment,” the spokesperson said.
In May, the 82-year-old ex-president’s office announced that Biden had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that spread to his bones after he experienced urinary symptoms and a prostate nodule was found.
“Cancer touches us all. Like so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places,” Biden, whose son Beau Biden died of cancer in 2015, said at the time in a post on X. “Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.“
 






Biden’s health had been in the spotlight due to a new book detailing his declining health as he campaigned last year for a second presidential term against Donald Trump.
In July 2024, Biden announced he was dropping out of the race after a disastrous debate performance against Trump and endorsed his vice president Kamala Harris for the presidency. She went on to lose to Trump, who began his second term in January.
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men, according to the American Cancer Society. It is particularly common in the elderly — around 80 per cent of men over 80 have some cancerous cells in their prostate gland, research has estimated.
While it is highly treatable if discovered early, it is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, the organisation said. Hormone therapy is a common treatment that can shrink tumours and slow cancer growth, but it is not a cure.
Trump, 79, the oldest person ever elected president, underwent his second medical checkup of the year on Friday and his doctor declared him to be in “excellent overall health“.</p><small>2025-10-11 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/112249561607995.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948209/deflecting-responsibility-cant-absolve-afghan-govt-of-obligations-towards-regional-peace-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Deflecting responsibility can’t absolve Afghan govt of obligations towards regional peace: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday night censured Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi for remarks during his visit to India and said “deflecting” the responsibility of controlling terrorism could not absolve the Afghan authorities of their responsibilities towards regional peace.
Muttaqi visited India earlier this week, marking India’s first high-level engagement with the Taliban government since it took power in 2021. Speaking about a Thursday night explosion in Kabul during a press conference in New Delhi a day ago, Muttaqi had condemned the incident and Pakistan for its alleged role in it, saying: “Whatever the problems are in each country should be solved by themselves.”
He said there was no terrorist organisation or group left in Afghanistan. “If other countries achieve peace themselves as we did in Afghanistan, then there will be peace in the entire region. Since the last eight months, there has not been even a small incident in Afghanistan. In four years, no one has been harmed from Afghanistan’s soil. So this is the best proof that we have presented.”
In a statement issued today, the FO said Pakistan’s strong reservations on the elements of the India-Afghanistan joint statement were conveyed to Afghanistan’s ambassador to Pakistan by the additional foreign secretary (West Asia & Afghanistan) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today.
“Pakistan also strongly rejected the Afghan acting foreign minister’s assertion that terrorism is Pakistan’s internal problem,” the FO said, adding that Pakistan had repeatedly shared details regarding the presence of Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan terrorist elements “operating from Afghan soil against Pakistan with support from elements within Afghanistan”.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al-Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“It was emphasised that by deflecting the responsibility of controlling terrorism towards Pakistan cannot absolve the Interim Afghan Government of its obligations towards ensuring peace and stability in the region and beyond,” the FO said.
 






Elaborating on reservations regarding the joint statement, the FO said: “It was conveyed that the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India is in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the legal status of Jammu and Kashmir. The joint statement is highly insensitive to the sacrifices and sentiments of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in their just struggle for the right to self-determination.”
The FO said that Pakistan had “generously” hosted nearly four million Afghans for over four decades “in the spirit of good neighbourliness and Islamic brotherhood”.
It said that with peace gradually returning to Afghanistan, it was time for unauthorised Afghan nationals residing in Pakistan to return to their country.
“Like all other countries and in line with international norms and practices, Pakistan has the right to regulate the presence of foreign nationals residing inside its territory. At the same time, along with the repatriation of Afghan nationals, Pakistan has also been generously issuing medical and study visas to address the medical and educational needs of Afghan nationals. In the spirit of Islamic brotherhood and good neighbourly relations, Pakistan will continue to extend humanitarian support to the people of Afghanistan.”
“Pakistan is desirous of seeing a peaceful, stable, regionally connected and prosperous Afghanistan. Accordingly, Pakistan has extended all possible trade, economic and connectivity facilitation to Afghanistan. Such measures are aimed at promoting cooperation and socio-economic development of the two countries,” the FO added.
At the same time, it said the government had the responsibility to “take all possible measures for the safety and security of its people”.
The FO concluded by saying that Pakistan “expects the interim Afghan government to play its due role in supporting Pakistan to achieve this noble objective by taking concrete measures to prevent its territory from being used” by terrorist elements against Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said earlier that Afghanistan’s export of terrorism would vitiate the atmosphere and cause a fissure in bilateral relations that Pakistan did not desire.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
The past week was particularly charged with statements to and fro from both sides as Pakistan suffered a string of martyrdoms of security forces in intelligence-based operations, while Afghanistan accused the former of violating its sovereignty.
Addressing the matter in an interview with Geo News, Asif said: “The terrorism they’re exporting to Pakistan, there will be a fissure created in relations in this environment, which is not our desire. We want our relations to continue respectfully.”
The defence minister also called on people to monitor and take notice of any suspicious activity in their midst and take action as a community against any terrorist facilitators. “If you remain silent due to fear or any other reason, then I think it is understood as agreement.’’
Islamabad maintains that its patience is wearing thin after a series of deadly attacks inside Pakistan that it blames on militants operating from Afghan territory. “Enough is enough, Pakistan government and armed forces’ patience has worn out,” Asif had said on Thursday in the National Assembly.
Kabul, however, denies allegations of providing safe havens to these groups.
Afghan officials, meanwhile, publicly blamed Pakistan a day ago. The Afghan defence ministry said, “Once again, Pakistan violated Afghan airspace, bombed a civilian market in the Paktika airspace near the Durand Line, and also violated the territory of the capital Kabul.”
Speaking at a separate news conference in Peshawar, held almost simultaneously with the FO briefing, military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry also declined to confirm or deny whether the military had carried out strikes in Kabul. He nonetheless underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself. “Afghanistan is being used as a base of operations for carrying out terrorism in Pakistan. There is also evidence of this,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-11 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628134-highly-insensitive-pakistan-voices-concerns-over-india-afghanistan-joint-statement' target='_blank'><strong>'Highly insensitive': Pakistan voices concerns over India-Afghanistan joint statement</strong></a><br><p>

The moot was held at the Expo Centre in Lahore on Saturday as part of DawnMedia’s ‘Breathe Pakistan’ initiative.
The conference was held with the aim of shedding light on actionable solutions, fostering high-level dialogue, and driving collective action for cleaner air in Pakistan. Sessions covered a broad range of themes, including governance and policy frameworks, financing clean air, smog and industrial responsibility, judicial activism, public health impacts, nationwide air quality standards, and regional cooperation on transboundary pollution.
A press release issued said: “Concluding the event, participants agreed that Pakistan’s fight for clean air must now move from promise to policy and from data to delivery. DawnMedia reaffirmed its commitment to continue convening dialogue through Breathe Pakistan, keeping the spotlight on collective
action for cleaner skies and healthier futures.”
It said the day-long event brought together ministers, superior court judges, and international
experts to discuss solutions for air pollution with Punjab, the province hardest hit by smog,
remaining central to the conversation, “even in the chief minister’s absence”.

6:47pm — Session on the health crisis amid smog
World Health Organisation Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo said breathing clean air was a basic human right.
He said 256,000 people died in Pakistan every year due to air pollution, adding that they were not just numbers but ‘‘brothers, fathers, sisters, mothers, sons’’ who all had unique stories and dreams.
Luo said the impact of air pollution was very real.
‘‘What are we going to do about this? The good news is that it is in our hand.’’
He stressed that air pollution was a threat without borders and had severe impact on the most vulnerable with access to less resources.
‘‘Air pollution does not distinguish between social classes. No one will be safe until everyone is safe. Pakistan faces severe air pollution.’’
Dr. Saima Saeed, director of the Lung Health Programme at Indus Hospital and Health Network, said 60 per cent of patients referred to the hospital for respiratory symptoms had asthma. ’‘There’s a huge burden of respiratory disease due to air pollution,“ she said, adding that various other health-related issues were also caused.
Unicef Representative in Pakistan Pernille Ironside said air pollution was a “direct preventable killer” with children uniquely vulnerable to it. She said the issue had become the number two killer of children worldwide under the age of five.

6:20pm — Pakistan Air Quality Initiative founder Abid Omar
Abid Omar said there was a need to go beyond just the data and talk about what the policies should be.
‘‘Even today in Pakistan and the Punjab government, the policymaking is weak because … the evidence-based policymaking] in more advanced cases is not mature enough.’’

6:09pm — Urban Unit CEO Dr Omar Masud
Questioned whether research was driving interest in policy and if that could be replicated at the national level, Dr Omar Masud said local action was being increasingly driven by monitoring data at the city level.
‘‘We are about to come to a crossroads when it comes to sensor level monitoring. We need cooperation and integration and less competition. We will see more data streams in this season and in coming years that will be telling us of air quality. Now it is up to the government and non-government sector as to how they integrate this data.’’
He said the biggest challenge was in communicating the data to the public.
“Without behavioral change, you can’t tackle the problem of air quality and behavioral change can only come when necessary information is presented in a very cogent way.’’

6:04pm — Dr Naveed Arshad, director of LUMS Energy Institute
Questioned about how institutions were informing policy about major sectors, Dr Naveed Arshad said the LUMS Energy Institute looked at the whole energy ecosystem and mapped it to the challenges being faced in the country before going to the government for policy advocacy.
He said the goal’s institute was to help achieve implementation of policies and solutions.

6pm — Session on developing National Air Quality Management Framework
Climate and sustainability expert Dawar Butt said there were initiative from the federal and provincial governments that showed they understood the importance of pollution.
He said air pollution really started to become a problem again for Pakistan in 2012 when the country’s supply of natural gas ran out.

5:53pm — Shazia Rafi, president and convenor of AirQualityAsia
AirQualityAsia president Shazia Rafia said in a video message that air pollution was a silent killer and an accelerator of climate change.
‘‘All air pollution is transboundary as the air knows no borders, it is visible from space.’’

5:31pm — Nazifa Butt, director of climate action and sustainability at WWF-Pakistan
WWF-Pakistan director Nazifa Butt said Karachi, Dhaka, Lahore and New Delhi were all cities that were facing challenges of extreme weather conditions and climate impact.
She said populations were growing and that would need more energy and thus more burning of fossil fuels. ‘‘We are all sitting in a geographic zone that is very risky in terms of development, economic growth and climatic impacts.’’
Butt said among the main drivers of air pollution in South Asia were rapid urbanisation and industrial growth, vehicular emissions and crop residue burning.
She also pointed to a lack of political will, poor governance and lack of infrastructure to tackle air pollution.
“We are asking for a plan for the government to step forward and build their own capacity first.’’
Butt called for legally binding climate treaties and setting of targets to reduce and control emissions.

5:15pm — Aban Marker Kabraji, senior regional adviser for climate and environment to the regional director of UNEP Asia-Pacific
UN official Aban Marker Kabraji said the messaging that Dawn had brought forth in technical understanding of the issue, along with the convening power and influencing, was “remarkable’’ along with consistency and commitment to tackle the issue of air pollution again and again.
She said 99 per cent of the population breathes polluted air and air pollution caused over 100,000 premature deaths annually with Lahore, Faisalabad, Peshawar and Karachi among the top 10 most polluted cities in the world.
Kabraji said the Indus-Ganges Plain was one of the most polluted parts of the world in air quality with Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, all 3 countries, impacted.
She proposed UN facilitation promoting regional air quality dialogue on shared airshed management, joint residue management and farmers incentives in Punjab and Haryan and lastly, data sharing and harmonisation.
Kabraji said the way forward lay in scaling up low-cost air quality monitoring, integrating air quality targets in NDC revision (2025), mobilising climate and private finance, regional cooperation for emission alerts and citizen engagement through youth-led air monitoring apps.

5:05pm — Sri Lanka MP Harshana Rajakaruna suggests regional strategy to tackle pollution
Sri Lanka MP Harshana Rajakaruna thanked the conference organisers for holding the event to address a problem that “crosses borders as easily as the wind”.
He said Sri Lankans also had concerns about pollution. He added the country had witnessed spikes in poor air quality linked to poor local sources and longrange transport from neighbouring regions.
Rajakaruna mentioned the problems that his own country faced in encountering and tackling pollution.
‘‘The human consequences of inaction are grave. Poor air quality shortens life expectancy, increases hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular disease, undermines children’s lung development and school attendance and reduces worker productivity.’’
He said the above issues were not confined to environmental briefs but emergencies related to public health, economics and social justice.
The lawmaker outlined a three-pronged approach for the region to tackle the issue: create a regional monitoring and data sharing network with transparent real-time data accessible to governments, scientists and the public; coordinated policy and enforceemnt across borders and thirdly, mobilising finance, technology and capacity through international partnerships.
He also underlined two matters of political importance. ’’Diplomacy matters. Environmental diplomacy is not a secondary concern, it is central to regional stability and shared prosperity,“ he said, adding that regional associations and global forums should be used to build an architecture of cooperation on air and marine quality.
‘‘Justice matters. Small islands and coastal communities should not be the unwilling recipients of other states’ pollution. Where possible, we should negotiate responsibility sharing mechanisms, including technical support, funding for mitigation and remediation assistance.’’
He commended Pakistan for taking decisive steps to place clear air on the national agenda and convening forums such as Breathe Pakistan to foster regional dialogue.
‘‘The leadership shown here in policy, public engagement and industrial innovation set an example and opens space for cooperation and action across South Asia. Sri Lanka extends its solidarity with Pakistan’s effort and stands ready to work in partnership.’’
He also proposed the formation of a regional task force with scientists, officials and civil society representatives to short a draft memorandum of understanding that outlines shared monitoring protocols, emergency notification procedures and a plan for joint capacity building.
’’Pollution that begins across borders can end lives here at home. The air we breathe and the seas that sustain our livelihoods are common goods. Protecting them demands compassion, solidarity and practical cooperation.
‘‘Let us seize this moment not for rhetoric but real measurable action for the health of our children, for the resillience of our economies and for dignity of our coastal communities. Sri Lanka stands with Pakistan and with all other nations of the Indian Ocean and South Asia in this work. Let us go forward.’’

4:49pm — Dr Jian Gao
Professor Dr Jian Gao, deputy director of the Institute of Atmospheric Research at the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, said China had focused on pollution control for half a century.
He walked through various measures that China took to control air pollution.

4:41pm — Session 6 begins on tackling trans-boundary air pollution
UN’s resident and humanitarian coordinator for Pakistan, Mohamed Yahya, began the session with saying that air pollution and climate change did not respect borders and there were no customs or immigration checks when pollutants were crossing from one border to the next.
‘‘If there is anything that really encourages cooperation and specifically international cooperation, it is the issue of climate change … and air pollution.’’
Recalling the smog last year in Lahore, he said the issue affected New Delhi as well. ‘‘The genius of Breathe Pakistan initiative was to realise early on … that Pakistan cannot deal with this issue alone and if there is anything that can encourage cooperation and coming together, it is the issue of air pollution and climate change.’’

3:48pm — Lunch break

3:46pm — Justice Hassan stresses need for climate finance
LHC’s Justice Hassan recalled Pakistan becoming a member of the Loss and Damage Fund in COP28 in November 2023, saying the country got “lucky”.
He underscored the need to work on climate financing. “We can’t depend on loans from the GFF (Global Financing Facility) and other countries,” he said.
“We need funding, and we need climate finance. We have a framework now; the finance minister is working on it. We will have a meeting very soon on it.”

3:42 — Justice Shah says judges also need to understand environmental science better
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah said that judges needed to understand climate and environmental science better. He also noted that climate courts needed to be introduced in the future.
“So there are a number of things we need to be doing in the judiciary as far is building capacity to deal with environmental issues once we get done with some of our constitutional issues,” he said.
 
 

“More judges ought to get involved and mainstreamed into the process of dealing with the environment,” he said. However, he stated that the judiciary was not the problem in this case.
“The disconnect is the implementation part, where the executive does not follow what we say,” he said.
He also said that climate issues could not be addressed without financing, adding: “One of the major issues the government faces is finance. They don’t have the finances allocated for this purpose.”
The judge also expressed disappointment at the missing presence of the prime minister and chief minister at the event.

3:38pm — Justice Mansoor Ali Shah criticises a ‘dead’ civil society
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah also took aim at a “dead civil society”.
“Where are the public interest litigation? You want to sit at home and crib about air pollution? When have you come out to file petitions? When have you gone out protesting?
“Civil societies that are dead, this happens to them. So live with the air pollution you have because you haven’t done much. You should be more active … fight for your right! If you don’t want to fight for your right, nobody is gonna bother.”

3:27pm — Justice Ayesha calls on youth to focus on playing their role
Justice Ayesha called on the youth to focus on what their role in combatting air pollution is and if they wanted their rights, “whether it be writing, speaking out, protesting or bringing litigation to courts”.
She said, “We lack in the expertise as well. We don’t see the academic churning out information, reports and articles on it. We also dont see the youth paying attention to this.”
She also noted that the issue required a “lot of investment”. “It requires will and commitment.”

3:22pm — We fail to recognise that air pollution is actually a public health emergency: Justice Ayesha
Justice Ayesha Malik observed, “Today, we fail to recognise the fact that air pollution is actually a public health emergency.”
She underscored, “The impact it is having for the generations to come, we won’t be able to resolve the issue, we won’t be able to save the generations.”
Speaking on governance, the judge noted that government policies and laws existed, but “where is the monitoring under that policy, where is the reporting, where is the data on the basis of which the decisions were made?”
Justice Ayesha emphasised the need for reporting and monitoring: “You need the science. Without the science, you cannot solve the issue.”

3:13pm — Air pollution can be tackled through cooperative federalism rather than devolution to provinces: Justice Shah
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah said that the first problem in addressing air pollution was the devolution of the issue to the provinces.
“The subject of pollution has now been devolved to the provinces. There is no national domain to oversee the whole problem at the national level. So I think there is a huge disconnect at a federal and provincial level.”
 
 

Justice Shah said that in his opinion, this could be resolved through cooperative federalism. “The federal government will have to play a role in laying down policy or standards … devolution of pollution is a problematic area which needs to be addressed,” he said.
The judge further went on to say, “I don’t think the government is interested in changing the life of an ordinary person. It is all elitist to satisfy or protect an industry or a pressure group, but an ordinary person is not in the picture.”
Justice Shah said he was not terming development “bad”, but there had to be intelligent ways of doing it. He said that Pakistan’s Environment Protection Agency (EPA) was a department that was subservient to the government. “How could it oppose the government’s will and wishes?”

3:03pm — ‘Many gaps’ in the regulatory set-up: Justice Ayesha
SC’s Justice Ayesha Malik noted that the right to clean air had been recognised as a basic right decades ago, adding that there were “many gaps” in the regulatory set-up.
Recalling her time at the LHC, she said there were a lot of cases related to brick kilns and poultry farms. Justice Ayesha detailed that a lot of emissions and odours come from the waste at poultry farms.
She also highlighted that the owners of these places also approached the courts, saying that the regulator was being unfair to them.
“When we were looking at cases in the Supreme Court — whether it’s related to floods, surface mining, deforestation — the issues are the same. It’s about the way the regulator is handling the matter. […] You don’t feel that urgency, that level of commitment where they realise that the air people are breathing is toxic.”

3:00pm — ‘Governance missing’: Justice Shah notes huge gap between jurispudence, reality
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah observed that the judiciary had been “very active” when it came to climate cases and that “governance” was missing.
“The courts have been very robustly directing and pushing the government to address the issue of air pollution and climate change because to the courts, people matter.”
He went on to say that the judiciary had worked in order to protect people and their fundamental rights.  “That’s the toolkit for us, that’s the prime consideration the judge has — to protect the fundamental rights of a person.”
However, he regretted that there was a huge gap between the jurisprudence and the reality on the ground.

“What’s going on? What’s missing? It’s governance, governance,
governance.”

2:56pm — Spotlight on climate cases withers away once they’re decided: Justice Shah
Justice Mansoor Ali Shah said that a case from 1997 was decided nine years later, which led to several interesting moves, including getting rid of the two-stroke rickshaws and moving on to CNG buses.
“For the first time, vehicular air pollution was considered and recognised as a source of air pollution,” he said.
“The point I am trying to make is that once the case is going on, the spotlight is on the government and they respond … but it withers away once the case is decided,” the judge added.

2:50pm — Justice Shah details Pakistan’s judicial history in climate cases
SC Senior Puisne Judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah highlighted that SC’s “iconic judge”, Justice Saleem Akhtar, took up a case about vehicular pollution in Karachi in 1993 and “got it all started”.
Directives were given about car inspections and maintenance. While “nothing much came about” in that, a major landmark decision of 1994 “set the tone for environmental pollution in Pakistan”, which was in the Shehla Zia case about a grid station being set up in Islamabad.
 
 

“That judgment for the first time says that right to life would mean the right to a healthier, better life,” Justice Shah pointed out.
The judge further recalled that in 1997, he was part of a group that went to the Lahore High Court with a plea seeking to address vehicular air pollution. “At that time, the judiciary didn’t understand. They thought it was a fancy litigation. We weren’t given that respect … the petition was kept pending for nine years.”

2:42pm — Panel on ‘Judicial Activism and Litigation for Clean Air in Pakistan’ begins
The session on judicial activism for clean air has begun, where Supreme Court’s Senior Puisne Judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Ayesha Malik will give their insights.
Lahore High Court’s Jawad Hassan will also shed light on the judicial aspect of tackling climate change.
Moderating the session, Senior advocate Faisal Siddiqi said the three judges had “all the [four] Cs that every great judge must have — competence, creativity, courage and conscience”.

2:30pm — Farmers definitely not villains in this: Pakistan Agriculture Coalition CEO
 
 

Asked about a viable solution to the burning of crop residuals, Pakistan Agriculture Coalition CEO Kazim M. Saeed said: “Farmers are definitely not the villains in this, maybe they’re the anti-hero of the story”.
He stressed the need for the interests of individuals and the public interest to be aligned. Saeed noted that stubble burning only occurred during winters and pointed out that the problem did not exist 40-45 years ago, when only wheat was harvested on a large scale and rice crops were cut by hand.

2:19pm — We have to make electric vehicles more friendly for consumers: automaker general manager
Ali Zaidi, the general manager of Marketing and Brands at Nexgen Autos’ Omoda & Jaecoo, has stressed the need to make electric vehicles more “friendly” for consumers.
He pointed out that 33pc is the share of emissions from vehicles in Karachi and 35pc in Lahore. “This is a huge chunk so the question is not whether we will be able to make EVs viable in the next five years, it is more of a statement that we have to.”
He stressed the need for the step to be sustainable: “If it is not sustainable, it can not run on itself, so it has to make business sense.”

He further said the company was looking at how to reduce the transport bill for consumers by 40pc in the next 10 years, which will also lead to a “40pc reduction” in our oil imports.

2:02pm — PSO board chairman sheds light on his company’s steps
Pakistan State Oil (PSO) Board of Management Chairman Asif Baigmohamed is now presenting a keynote address.
“We’re waiting for somebody else to do something. My humble submission is let’s try to see what we can do,” he said. He contended that if Beijing was able to combat air pollution, Pakistan could do so too.
He highlighted that PSO has been reviewing how it can make things more sustainable and profitable, giving the example of reducing 760 processes of the company to 430 and digitising them.
“That’s the keyword. It has to be profitable.”

1:55pm — EBM CEO proposes national clear air forum
Zeelaf Munir said that the next step would be to embed collaboration into Pakistan’s environmental framework to move from isolated efforts to a shared strategy.
“That is why what I am proposing is the creation of a national clean air forum. A permanent platform where government, industries, academia and NGOs collaborate, share data and co-design practical solutions. A space where research meets regulation.”

1:50pm — EBM CEO says clean air an economic necessity
English Biscuit Manufacturers Managing Director & CEO Zeelaf Munir addressed the day’s fourth session, ‘The Smog Equation’. In her keynote speech, she said: “Each year the grey sky returns, it reminds us that leadership today must be measured not only by growth or profit but by the quality of air people breathe.”
She said that clean air “was a responsibility we all shared”. She noted that air pollution costs Pakistan’s nearly 6pc of its GDP every year, more than what is spent on health and education combined.
“It weakens our workforce, drives us healthcare costs and deters investment. Clean air is not just a social cause, it is an economic necessity.”

1:37pm: BoP chairman stresses federal, provincial integration
The Bank of Punjab chairman said that integration at a federal and provincial level was something that was the need of the hour.
“The projects rests in the provinces while the entire effort of fundraising is being done at a federal level. And that lack of disconnect is causing a lack of delivery as far as a project’s financing is concerned.”

1:34pm: BoP chairman highlights challenges to Pakistan’s climate financing
The Bank of Punjab chairman said that Pakistan’s climate financing gap was around $348 billion between now and 2030. He said that the impact of flooding in the country could be another $100bn between now and 2030.
“The dilemma is that we have enough capital available internationally. The challenge is that we do not have enough projects to tap into that funding,” he said.
“The world is not short of capital. The world is short in the confidence they have in Pakistan’s readiness.”

1:29pm: BoP chairman says 6pc of Pakistan’s GDP affected every year by climate crisis
Zafar Masud, the Bank of Punjab chairman, gave his closing remarks for the session, calling it a “transformational agenda”. He said that around six per cent of Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP) was being affected due to the climate crisis every year.

He said that “dirty air” meant “lower repayments, weaker exports and high non-performing loans”.
Noting the recent floods in the country, he said that that was in addition to what he had said before. “So altogether it’s a substantial impact.”
He said that the conference was not just about awareness but also about making concrete the ideas of structured finance and the way forward.

1:24pm — Rafay Alam details how air pollution revolution began in European cities
Asked about other countries around the world facing climate change issues, Climate expert Rafay Alam acknowledged they were “rich, white countries” but stressed how they started on addressing those problems.
Alam noted that Stockholm had immense automobile-related pollution, the United Kingdom had major pollution after World War 2, and as well as in California in the 1970s.
“There have been laws made in each of these countries to address air pollution,” he said, stressing that even those laws were a result of some action.

1:20pm — Onus on consumers to create ‘demand’ for financing green projects: BoP official
Bank of Punjab’s (BoP) Arslan Muhammad Iqbal said it was on the consumer that a “demand” was created to finance green projects.
He asserted that the “funding is there”, mentioning the Green Sukuk bonds.
He noted that BoP was the only Pakistani bank to get a 50m euro lending facility from a France-based multilateral, which can be used to fund green energy.

01:05pm: Climate expert Rafay Alam says improvements in environment not overnight solutions
Rafay Alam, an environmental lawyer, said that while people liked to have a clean environment, they had cosmetic superficial ambitions in this regard.
“Look at it this way: you have to use the black and white of printed policy paper to manifest the change in the quality of the air outside. That requires an immense and very accurate amount of data. You can’t do it without that.”
He went on to say that most improvements in the environment were not overnight solutions and took time.

12:50pm — Session on ‘Financing Clean Air for Pakistan’ begins
World Bank Senior Environment Specialist Shafick Hoossein started off the session by giving a presentation as part of the session ‘Financing Clean Air for Pakistan’.
Hoossein stated that 99pc of the world’s population breathes air that does not meet the WHO standards. Out of international development funds, only 1pc is provided to address the issue of air quality, he added.
Fatima Attarwala, editor at Dawn’s Business & Finance weekly, is moderating the session. In her remarks, she said that the conversation would focus on how to make air pollution work for Pakistan.

12:49pm — Ahsan Iqbal asks developed world to do more
The planning minister further said that everyone had heard the “grand announcements at COP after COP”.
“We have seen the press releases and the photo ops. But where is the action? This inaction is feulling the storms that drown our children. Your emissions are the poison in our lungs … Now, we ask the developed world to do more.”
He went on to say: “The time for blame is over. The time for action is now. Let’s rollup our sleeves, let’s clear the air and let’s get to work.”

12:47pm — This year’s floods ‘not a natural disaster, but a man-made climate catastrophe’
Ahsan Iqbal said the poisoned air was not just one symptom of a deeper sickness but a “climate crisis that is pounding our nation with terrifying fury”.
He also mentioned this year’s monstrous monsoon floods, stating that they were not a natural disaster, but a “man-made climate catastrophe”.
“Over 1,200 lives lost, 4 million countrymen displaced and economic haemorrhage in billions of dollars. I have walked through those flood camps, and I have seen because my own district (Narowal) was one of the worst affected.
“This is the human face of climate injustice.”

12:46pm — Pakistan bears a burden it did not create: Ahsan Iqbal
The planning minister also highlighted that Pakistan was bearing a burden it did not contribute as much to.
“Every action is a bullet in this fight for clean air. And I say to our international partners and the global community, that Pakistan bears a burden it did not create. We are on the frontlines of a war we did not start. We are doing our part with limited resources,” Iqbal said.
“We call for the urgent delivery and scaling up of climate finance. The promises made in Glasgow and Sharm el-Sheikh but become a reality on the ground in Pakistan.
“We need access to cutting-edge green technology on preferential terms,” he said, calling for the “major emitters of the world” to increase their net-zero timelimes.
“Our survival should not be negotiable in their boardrooms.”

12:33pm — Polluted air ‘holding our nation back’: planning minister
Calling the issue a “battle for survival”, Ahsan Iqbal stressed the need to “confront a brutal, inescapable truth — the air we breathe is making us sick and it is holding our nation back”.
“As of yesterday, our air was not just poor, it was a toxic cocktail, a public health emergency. Lahore’s AQI at 400 is a red alert for our nation,” the planning minister pointed out.
“Let’s be clear; this is not just Lahore’s problem. Karachi, Faisalabad, Peshawar, almost all our urban engines are drowning in pollution.
“To put that in human terms, breathing this air is equivalent to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.”
He cited a study as stating that pollution levels witness a spike during winters, but also underscored that the levels have a “very steady line through summers also”.

12:28pm — The very air we breathe has become our enemy, says Ahsan Iqbal
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal termed the ‘Breathe Pakistan’ initiative “very timely”. “This conference is not only about pollution; it is about leadership, partnership, and collaboration.”
“When we look out the window, the beautiful bustling city of Lahore, we find it suffocating. Its vibrant heart is struggling and its lungs are choked.

“The very air we breathe has become our enemy.”

11:52am — Short break

11:45am — ‘EPA to be expanded to entire Punjab next year’
Silwat Saeed also highlighted the various measures being taken by the Punjab government, including an environment protection force, which she said is being experimented with for the first time in the province.
“This is actually providing miraculous results,” the Punjab environment department official said, noting that the teams had specialised equipment with them.
Saeed said the force, currently in Lahore, will also be expanded to the rest of Punjab, with 10 industrial hotspots to be prioritised initially and the entire province next year.

11:42am — ‘Air quality monitors in Punjab increased from 2 to 41 in past year’
Silwat Saeed detailed Punjab’s three-pronged approach to tackle air pollution, which comprises first monitoring the quality of the air we breathe, then mitigating it, and then finally engaging with the citizenry to inform and empower them.
“Without localised data, there is nothing that can work. […] In earlier decades, we were sitting in the dark, we didn’t know what was wrong. Now that has changed.”
The Punjab official stated that the number of air quality monitors has increased from two to 41 in the past year. “Within the next 6-7 months, the number would be 100 for the entire Punjab.”
She further noted that a detailed study was currently being undertaken by the Punjab government to see why the air in the province had pollutants that “are affecting our health”.

11:38am — ‘First time that Punjab’s development programme has been climate-tagged’
The Punjab environment department official asserted that it was for the first time that the province’s development programme had been “climate-tagged”.
“You would be seeing that the transport sector has been given around Rs269bn that has been tagged for climate change mitigation and adaptation programmes,” she said, referring to the largest allocation.
Others were Rs95bn for raising awareness, Rs65bn for capacity building, Rs62bn for water resources, Rs47bn for forestry, and Rs16bn for agriculture and livestock.
Saeed noted that it was a cross-sectoral issue and the “real villain is not a single entity which you can point out and fix”.

11:30am — Pakistan located in a ‘geographical trap’, adding to its pollution woes: Silwat Saeed
Silwat Saeed noted that urbanisation has also resulted in the “huge menace of smog”, but it was also a manifestation of deteriorating air quality, which becomes palpable because of temperature inversions.
The Punjab official further highlighted that Pakistan was located in a “geographical trap” that added to its pollution woes.
“The northern area of this entire region is actually the foothill of the Himalayas, and the foothills would act as a lid when all the pollutants from the region get trapped and then they whirl around within the cities in the region, not only in Pakistan but also in India, Bangladesh and Nepal.”

11:24am — Session 2 on a ‘greener Punjab’ begins
Silwat Saeed, Punjab’s Environment Protection and Climate Change Department secretary, kicked off the day’s second session, ‘A Greener Punjab To Combat Air Pollution’.
She appreciated DawnMedia for “uniting” her department to speak about how environmental governance was being transformed at a sub-national level.
“This problem is not some distant abstract thing. It is right in front of us.”
She noted that it was not the first time the world was seeing the issue of air pollution, mentioning the advancement in industrialisation in Europe during the last century.

11:20am — ‘About 5pc of entire global GDP lost because of pollution’
Mohamed Yahya said that “about $6 trillion annually, about 5pc of the entire global GDP, is lost because of pollution”.
“There’s no better and more heartbreaking place to discuss this issue. I want to congratulate the Dawn group [for organising the conference].”
Recalling last year’s smog, the UN official said the stain was so profound here in Lahore that it was visible from space. “A glaring testament of what needs to be done.”

“The smog is our creation.”


11:18am — ‘Silent pandemic’ of air pollution a global emergency: UN resident coordinator
“The science is clear,” UN’s Yahya said, adding that the numbers should shake everyone. Citing WHO estimates, he pointed out that “99pc of us in this room and 99pc of humanity breathes air that is unsafe”.
“Let that number be something that galvanises us. This is not a distant threat. It’s a global siege.  About seven million people lose their lives every year because of the air they breathe.
“It’s the single greatest environmental risk of our lives and a silent pandemic.”

11:13am —  What happens when the air we breathe turns against us?: UN’s Yahya
UN’s resident and humanitarian coordinator for Pakistan, Mohamed Yahya, termed the air we breathe as “our most intimate and non-negotiable relationship with our world”.
“It’s not an abstract concept but a fabric of life itself, the substance that fuels our cells, our lungs, our dreams. But what happens when that very substance turns against us? When the air we breathe becomes a slow-acting poison?” he asked.

**11:10am — Musadik Malik notes China leading solar revolution after smog problems 10-15 years ago
The climate change minister noted that the South Asian cities of Lahore and New Delhi were not mentioned when the issue of the most polluted cities was highlighted 10-15 years ago.
“The names mentioned were Beijing and Shanghai, and now they are providing 60-75pc of the world’s solar technology. Not only did they fix their cities, but they also led the solar revolution throughout the world to counter the problem they were facing”.

11:04am — Policy in works to update old oil refineries: minister Malik
Hailing the “amazing initiatives” being carried out under CM Maryam Nawaz, the climate minister said 8,000 to 10,000 bikes have been distributed, 600 or 500 e-buses are on the roads or will be launched, and anti-smog guns have been installed.
“We will keep bringing higher standards for fuel. We’ve made a policy to update our old refineries … can be brought up to the best standards in the world,” the federal minister said, adding that incentives were to be given as well and some companies were working on the policy.

10:55am — Climate minister Musadik Malik calls air pollution a man-made phenomenon
Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik called air pollution a man-made phenomenon, adding that it was up to us to fix it. He noted that climate change and environmental issues were not major objectives in the past and hard work was being carried out to fix this.
He refrained from citing different laws and policies, but said that the federal government and Punjab were doing very good work with regard to climate change.
The minister said around 40pc of children’s lung functioning were affected due to polluted air.
He added: “This is not just smog. Also look at it through the lens of death. And it is not just death. Also look at it through the lens of love, and when you see the faces hidden behind the haze, maybe then we will solve the issues more quickly.”

10:45am — Musadik Malik mentions link between life expectancy and air pollution
Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik is addressing the event via a video link, apologising that he could not reach Lahore due to “some special circumstances, as you know”.
“Pollution and all these environmental hazards … they stand in the way of our success,” the minister said.
He recalled that his father had been in a coma during his last days and prayed for “just one more day” for his life. Stressing the importance of life, Malik said five to eight years of the lives of all Lahore residents, including elders, were wasted due to smog.
“We probably do not associate this with the grief and mortality that comes ahead of us because of smog or air pollution,” he said, adding that according to some estimates, 128,000 premature deaths occur in Pakistan every year, and a person’s five to eight years of life are cut short due to air pollution.

10:37am — Mandatory recycling bins in Punjab schools from Oct 30
The Punjab minister also reflected on her recent visits to Japan. “The entire waste management in Japan is for segregated waste, so that technology cannot be brought to Pakistan,” she said.
“So now we’re going to China for that technology and waste incinerators. We’ve started this in schools. We thought schools would be the right place to start this and embed it into our curriculum. After Oct 30, the schools have to keep five recycling bins at schools mandatory,” Aurangzeb said.

10:30am — ‘Transboundary arrangement’ may now be taken up with UN, WB after recent events: Punjab minister
Marriyum Aurangzeb also observed the lack of data regarding air pollution and highlighted the phenomenon of transboundary pollution.
“The major seasonal contributor to high AQI levels in Lahore and Multan … that easterly wind corridor from India plays a critical role and is a major contributor to seasonal AQI levels. We had started a transboundary arrangement but because of recent events, we may take this forward with the UN or World Bank.”
“Breathe Pakistan is a great initiative for spreading awareness … the responsibility is shared, and whatever we choose has consequences on the environment and climate change,” Aurangzeb stressed.

10:26 — ‘Climate Change Vision 2025 tells policy and action plan for next 10 years’
Aurangzeb pointed out that Punjab’s Climate Change Vision 2025 detailed the policy and action plan for the next 10 years.
She highlighted that the Punjab government introduced vehicle fitness certificates for the “first time ever”.
“We are using safe city cameras to identify smoke coming from cars. We have a Punjab Clean Air Programme, which also has a buy-back policy of old vehicles, two-wheelers and three-wheelers.
’[…] For the first time ever, we have mobile fuel testing labs. EPA Punjab has started fuel testing to test petrol at petrol stations in Punjab. In the last eight months, 1,100 electric buses have arrived in Punjab.“

10:21 — Aurangzeb lists steps taken by Punjab govt to tackle smog
Aurangzeb emphasised that Punjab now had a state-of-the-art environmental force. Listing the steps taken by the provincial government, she said a subsidy programme with 80pc paid by the government was initiated and Lahore Division now had 5,000 superseeders.
Stubble burning zones were mapped, investment was done in the mechanisation of agriculture, and drone monitoring for industrial units is carried out. Around 11,000 brick kilns across the Punjab were also mapped and those without zigzag technology were sealed.

10:17 — Punjab minister details CM Maryam’s smog mitigation plan
The Punjab senior minister recalled the smog mitigation plan launched by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
“When I speak about Punjab interventions, we have completed the entire legal framework. We are now doing AI-predictable modelling for forecasting AQI levels,” Aurangzeb highlighted.
“Localisation of smog mitigation was critical to the intervention, so we took a multi-sectoral lens to smog mitigation,” she said, noting smog guns imported two months ago and deployed in Lahore.
“For predictable forecasting, we have 41 air monitors across Punjab, and will have 100 across Punjab by 2026.”

10:12am — Marriyum Aurangzeb says such initiatives key to tackling climate change issues
Beginning her address, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb noted the presence of “lots of experts, media people and policymakers and civil society”, adding that it reflected the shared responsibility toward climate resilience and climate adaptation.
Thanking DawnMedia for taking the initiative, the Punjab minister said she was a “bit sceptical” when she participated in the February conference. “I did not think it would be a sustainable initiative. So my heartfelt congrats to Naz, to you and the Dawn group for sustaining this initiative because that is the key to issues like climate change.”
“I want other media groups to be made part of this initiative. I will present a case study from our chief minister. Lahore, a heritage hotspot of Pakistan,  [and] the heartbeat of Pakistan, is confronted with seasonal smog. This is a year-long phenomenon. AQI levels of Lahore and other regions of Punjab were not satisfactory, so we started working on smog mitigation objectives,” Aurangzeb highlighted.
She said her government was “in shock that we are talking about it in March” when she called a meeting, as the air quality issue is a year-long phenomenon. “We started off with a multi-sectoral lens for climate change.”

10:07am — Dawn CEO Nazafreen stresses commitment to cleaner skies
Inaugurating the moot, Nazafreen Saigol-Lakhani, the CEO of Dawn, says: “On behalf of DawnMedia, it is an honour and my responsibility to welcome you all to Breathe Pakistan’s The Air We Breathe — a critical gathering focused on one of the most urgent challenges, air pollution.”
Recalling the initiative’s launch, she said: “Our aim was to start a national dialogue on climate change. At the first conference, experts came together to issue a charter for a climate-resilient Pakistan.
“Today, The Air We Breathe builds on that momentum. As we enter another smog season, this conference focuses on practical tangible measures to tackle air pollution,” Saigol-Lakhani added.
She further said, “We are helping to weave a living network of collaboration to ensure shared commitments … I hope today’s discussions will inspire collective action and send a strong message that the health of people and the future of Pakistan are not policy points but our priorities.
“Let us commit to cleaner skies and a healthier environment for generations to come.”

KPA Speaker Babar Saleem Swati posted the schedule for Monday’s session on his X account. It said the election for the next chief minister would be held on the date.
 






On Wednesday, Gandapur said that he resigned from his role as the provincial chief executive, while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the CM’s role.
However, his resignation letter, which was shared with the media the previous night, had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s house denying having ever received it.
“Today at 2:30 pm, the handwritten resignation advice of the CM Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was duly received and acknowledged by Governor House,” Kundi posted on X earlier today.
“After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he added.
 






‘PTI will eradicate terrorism under KP’s new leadership’
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said during a press conference today that under the leadership of incoming CM Sohail Afridi, the party will eradicate terrorism in KP.
“Any complaints that have arisen recently from the government will be resolved,” he said. “On Monday, Sohail Afridi will be sworn in as the new KP chief minister.”
“Afridi will be the first CM to hail from the tribal areas. He is young and determined,” Raja added. “This province will progress greatly under his leadership. We hope for an end to bloodshed through diplomacy, so we can eradicate terrorism in the region.”
The PTI secretary general also noted that under Article 130(8) (the chief minister may, by writing under his hand addressed to the president, resign his office) of the Constitution, a chief minister can resign from office and does not require the acceptance or approval of the governor.
Responding to a question about why no notification was issued for CM Gandapur’s resignation, Raja said that notifications “are just for information” and serve no purpose.
Meanwhile, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in an interview on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan reiterated Raja’s point about the constitution granting the CM freedom to resign from their post.
“It’s written in the constitution that if the governor accepts the resignation, then the house will select its leader and CM,” he said. “It is shameful that a local rivalry with the governor is being played upon like this
“He (CM Gandapur) wants his resignation accepted immediately so that Sohail Afridi, [PTI founder] Imran Khan’s pick for CM, can sit in the seat. This cannot be left up in the air.”
When asked to confirm if there would be a session at the KP assembly on Monday, Akram replied in the affirmative.
“We have the numbers,” he said. “There is a clear majority if there is no misadventure.”
When asked if the PTI will consult with the federal government about an alternative candidate, the party spokesperson replied: “We do not have to consult with the government about who we nominate. It is the PTI’s and Imran Khan’s mandate. Did the government consult us on bringing Maryam and Bugti in as CMs?
“He (Afridi) has been a cabinet member for one and a half years. If he were a facilitator, then why did nobody say anything then?”
The PTI information secretary reiterated that the PTI stands against terrorists but believes that collateral damage in military operations could create an insurgency and make the population vengeful and vindictive.
“Khan sahib says we are against terrorism, but for the long-term benefit, you cannot mire the country in insurgencies,” he said.
Earlier, Gandapur left for Dera Ismail Khan after saying farewell to his staff at the chief minister’s house.
In his first media interaction after resi­g­ning, Gandapur had pressed for the swift acceptance of his resignation on Thu­rsday night. He said any delay in the process would be detrimental to the province.</p><small>2025-10-11 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628136-watch-gold-found-in-karachis-malir-river' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: Gold found in Karachi's Malir River?</strong></a><br><p>

Police sources earlier stated that Teefi Butt had initially fled to Glasgow (UK) soon after the murder of Ameer Balaj Tipu. During the course of the investigation, police arrested Ameer Balaj’s close friend, Ahsan Shah, for giving information to Butt and his gangsters about the movement of his friend.
More recently, Teefi Butt travelled to Dubai for renewal of his London visa after it expired, which ultimately led to his capture.
The CCD had also formally requested the Lahore capital city police officer (CCPO) to transfer the investigation of the Ameer Balaj murder case to them. The case was originally registered at Chuhng Police Station.
Ameer Balaj was killed during a marriage ceremony in February 2024. Teefi Butt and Aqeel Butt alias Gogi Butt were nominated in the case. Gogi Butt is currently out on bail and Teefi Butt was declared an absconder.
A statement from the CCD today stated that Teefi Butt, who had been arrested in Dubai earlier with the aid of Interpol, had landed at Karachi Airport a day prior and was handed over to CCD custody, who were to transport him to Lahore by road.
“When the CCD team reached near Sanjarpur, District Rahim Yar Khan, in the wee hours of 11th October, a number of armed assailants intercepted the CCD vehicle and opened indiscriminate fire,” the statement claimed.
During the gun battle, a CCD officer sustained serious bullet injuries and was rushed to a nearby hospital. The suspects allegedly freed Teefi Butt and fled the scene. Local police and CCD officers were immediately notified, according to the statement.
“At around [5am], the Rahim Yar Khan CCD team spotted two suspicious vehicles and tried to intercept them. A heavy exchange of gunfire ensued between the CCD team and the assailants, lasting for about 20 to 25 minutes,” the statement added.
“One person was found seriously injured at the scene [and] he succumbed to his injuries while being evacuated to a local hospital by the CCD team. Later on, he was identified as Khawaja Tareef Butt alias Teefi Butt.”
The statement added that another policeman sustained serious injuries during the gunfight and was transported to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.
“Multiple teams from both the local police and Rahim Yar Khan CCD are actively pursuing those involved in the attack, injuring two police officials and the killing of Khawaja Tareef Butt alias Teefi Butt,” the statement read, adding that further investigation was underway.
Old rivalry
The families of Tipu and the Butts have a decades-old rivalry in alleged underworld circles of Lahore. They were at the top of 20 ‘gangsters’ of the city when the Lahore police launched a crackdown in 2021 under the command of the then CCPO Ghulam Mahmood Dogar.
Gogi Butt was earlier arrested under anti-terrorism charges.
Ameer Balaj’s grandfather Ameeruddin alias Billa Truckanwala was also engaged in the feud and he had fallen victim to the enmity in 1998. Ameer Balaj’s father Arif Ameer alias Tipu Truckanwala was shot dead by his rivals in 2010 and he was the third generation that fell victim to the gang rivalry.
According to the reports, Ameer Balaj had recently joined the PML-N after quitting the PTI.
Sharing the background to the gangsters of Lahore, a police official said the provincial capital had been in the spotlight for many decades when several underworld dons terrorised Lahoriites, particularly, in the second tenure of Shehbaz Sharif as the chief minister in 2008.
He alleged the prime suspects nominated in the murder case of Ameer Balaj, namely Gogi Butt and Teefi Butt, were also among the top underworld dons besides Arif Ameer alias Tipu Truckanwala and many others. Some of them were killed by their rivals, while others were shot dead in alleged ‘staged encounters’ during the tenure of Shehbaz.
Prominent among them were Saqib Langra, Mubeen Butt, Aslam Bassa and Naveed Lumbiwala.
About Arif Ameer alias Tipu Truckanwala, the officer said he had no particular criminal record but had enmities with many groups in Lahore.
With the passage of time, the police officer said, some underworld dons joined political parties to seek shelter under the ruling political figures to avoid criminal cases. He said Gogi Butt and Teefi Butt were also among those who resumed political activities. However, they kept on ruling the city’s crime world by expanding their networks.
Some gangsters of the city, like the Butts, feared that as Ameer Balaj would assume significance, he might pose challenges to them in the future.
The gruesome killing of young Ameer Balaj shocked the underworld community, his family, relatives and the close circles besides the traders as he was also the owner of a prominent goods transport network.
The people associated with the crime circles fear that the murder of Ameer Balaj may lead to a new era of ‘killings’ between these two groups/families.
Concerns over CCD ‘encounters’
Earlier in July, the Lahore High Court (LHC) directed Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar to review the encounters being carried out by CCD.
LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum, hearing a case in connection with a woman’s petition against the killing of her son in an alleged CCD encounter, noted that the high court was receiving 50 petitions daily regarding fake police encounters and observed that the current wave of CCD encounters must be assessed.
The chief justice also instructed the IGP to conduct a thorough review of the ongoing encounters and ensure that such fake encounters were not repeated in the future.
She observed that “Whenever there is firing, the bullet is so intelligent that it never hits a police official or vehicle“. The chief justice further stated that the FIRs of all alleged police encounters follow the same pattern.</p><small>2025-10-11 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628103-pti-activist-falak-javed-arrested-in-another-case' target='_blank'><strong>PTI activist Falak Javed arrested in another case</strong></a><br><p>
