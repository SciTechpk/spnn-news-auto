At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials said, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to “relentlessly pursue” the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ late on Wednesday, Asif asserted there was evidence that the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was working as an Indian proxy.
“We will present evidence of India’s involvement. We will corroborate whatever we have claimed,” he said.
 


“The relation between BLA and India is well-known as their leadership is in New Delhi. The allegation against us was unsubstantiated but BLA is fighting like an Indian proxy,” he added.
He was referring to the Pahalgam attack last month in occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, following which India, without evidence, had blamed Pakistan for backing the attackers.
Asif further said, “BLA and TTP are Indian proxies. They have nothing to do with religion or nationalism, India is financing them and they’re involved in bloodshed here.”
In reply to a question on dealing with the situation, the minister said that “Pakistan will strike with full force and there will be no leniency”, stressing that attacking non-combatants, including school children, was unacceptable.
Asif said Pakistan called for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack, which India didn’t agree to, adding that the world should be informed that the Narendra Modi-led regime was “very irresponsible for using a false incident as a pretext to wage a nuclear war”.
He said Pakistan “will not start nuclear confrontation but cannot stay silent if nuclear devices are thrown at us”.
“Pakistan showed restraint, but still India attacked our bases in the dark of the night,” he highlighted.
A day ago, the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), also said that “Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians”.
It noted that India had “failed” against Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.
“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of [sic] basic human norms,” the ISPR said.
“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian-sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military vowed.
 
 

On Monday, the ISPR said 12 terrorists of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said India was activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan. He had detailed the arrest of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as “irr­e­futable evidence” of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind­ian military personnel.
China, Pakistan and Afghanistan agree their soil won’t be used for cross-border terrorism: Dar
In a separate development, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that during the trilateral meeting between China, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all sides agreed that their soil would not be used for cross-border terrorism.
In a meeting at the Foreign Office, Dar discussed the possibility of increasing diplomatic engagement with Kabul, referring to a statement by Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. He said, “We will look into all these aspects. I fully support the idea that we should settle issues with all neighbours. The core principle should be that there should be no terrorism from other countries.”
He said that he had categorically stated the position that “we will not tolerate terrorism” during his visit to Afghanistan. “You should not allow use of your soil and we will not allow our soil,” he added, referring to his talks with Afghan Taliban leaders.
Dar later addressed a press conference where he said, “The government has a clear resolve. We will deal with terrorism the same way we dealt in 2013 and 2018.
“The Chinese interest also lies in this. […] This was also discussed in the trilateral meeting,” the deputy premier said, referring to the recent moot in China.
 


The foreign minister further said that in his meeting with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the latter offered condolences for the Pakistani lives lost during the recent conflict with India.
“He reaffirmed that Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and its dignity were very close to them [China],” Dar said.
Dar highlighted that China agreed the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to the UN resolutions, adding that Beijing, like Islamabad, believed that a major reason for the tension in the region was the Kashmir dispute.
Indian High Commission staff member declared persona non grata
Separately, the Foreign Office said that a staff member of the High Commission of India in Islamabad was declared persona non grata for “engaging in activities inconsistent with his privileged status”.
“The concerned official has been directed to leave Pakistan within 24 hours,” FO said in a post on X in the early hours of Thursday.
The FO added that the Indian Chargé d’Affaires was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey the decision.
“It was stressed that none of the diplomats or staff members of the Indian High Commission should misuse their privileges and status in any manner,” FO said.
 






The decision came after India yesterday declared a Pakistani official persona non grata for engaging in activities not consistent with his official status in the country and asked him to leave India within 24 hours.
A statement from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said: “Charge d’Affaires, Pakistan High Commission, was issued a demarche to this effect today. He was asked to strictly ensure that none of the Pakistani diplomats or officials in India misuse their privileges and status in any manner.”</p><small>2025-05-22 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605675-sindh-govt-announces-summer-vacation-for-schools' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt announces summer holiday dates for schools</strong></a><br><p>

The court has reiterated that the murderer must pay for the crime with his life. It is, no doubt, a dire sentence — this paper, in principle, opposes capital punishment.
The judges, it must be noted, did commute the death sentence on the rape charge to life imprisonment, and the kidnapping sentence from 10 years to one. However, when it came to the murder charge, it appears they felt it necessary to match the severity of the crime with the severity of the punishment. Many well-wishers hope that the verdict will bring the Mukadam family some closure after their long ordeal to secure justice for their murdered daughter.
 
 

Noor’s brutal killing had shaken the Pakistani public out of its reverie to take note of the misogyny and domestic violence prevalent in society. The case had been closely followed. The evidence, eyewitness accounts, and sequence of events stitched together by the media from police reports had painted a deeply unsettling picture of Jaffar and the tragic circumstances surrounding Noor’s demise.
 
 

It was evident that her death was the result of not just one person’s malevolence, but a preventable tragedy caused by several individuals failing to do the right thing at the right time. These individuals seem to have been quite aware that a woman was being held against her will and likely being subjected to violence, but ignored her plight. It is unfortunate that their role in the murder never faced enough scrutiny; it would have helped establish that violence against women may be perpetrated by individuals, but it is enabled by society.
On a related note, it is also disappointing that the superior judiciary took so much time giving finality to the verdict. It ought to have taken the matter up with the urgency it demanded.

US President Donald Trump quickly condemned the attack, saying, “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on anti-Semitism, must end, now!”
“Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA,” he added on social media.
 






Gunfire broke out on the sidewalk outside the Capital Jewish Museum in the centre of Washington as the venue held a social event for young professionals and diplomatic staff.
The victims were a young couple who planned to get married, the Israeli ambassador said.
A video clip circulating on social media showed a young bearded man in a jacket and white shirt shouting “free, free Palestine” as he was led away by police.
Police confirmed the suspected shooter walked into the museum after the shooting and had been detained.
“We believe the shooting was committed by a single suspect who is now in custody,” Washington Police Chief Pamela Smith told reporters.
“Prior to the shooting, the suspect was observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum. He approached a group of four people, produced a handgun and opened fire.
“After the shooting, the suspect then entered the museum and was detained by event security.”
She said the handcuffed suspect identified where he had discarded the weapon and chanted “Free, free Palestine”. Police identified him as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered enhanced security measures at Israeli diplomatic missions worldwide after the incident.
“I have instructed to enhance security arrangements at Israeli missions around the world and to increase protection for state representatives,” he said.
“We are witnessing the terrible price of anti-Semitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel.”
“I am devastated by the scenes in Washington,” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement.
“This is a despicable act of hatred, of anti-Semitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy.
“America and Israel will stand united in defence of our people and our shared values. Terror and hate will not break us.”
‘Unspeakable act of violence’
Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said, “Harming diplomats and the Jewish community is crossing a red line.
“Israel will continue to act resolutely to protect its citizens and representatives — everywhere in the world.”
The targeted event appeared to be a reception hosted by the American Jewish Committee (AJC) for Jewish young professionals and the Washington diplomatic community.
The evening was “dedicated to fostering unity and celebrating Jewish heritage,” with an invitation to the event saying the location would be “shared upon registration”.
“American Jewish Committee (AJC) can confirm that we hosted an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC this evening,” AJC CEO Ted Deutch said in a statement.
“We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue… Our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”
 
 

The museum is in downtown Washington, close to the US Capitol and just 1.6 kilometres from the White House.
Police Chief Smith said officers responded to multiple calls of a shooting near the museum at around 9pm on Wednesday evening (6am Thursday).
First responders found a man and a woman unconscious and not breathing.
Despite life-saving efforts, both were pronounced dead.
Engagement
Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter told reporters the young staffers were a couple “about to be engaged”.
“The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,” Leiter said.
He added that he spoke to Trump by telephone, with the president assuring that the United States will “do everything it can possibly do to fight and end anti-Semitism.”

“We’ll stand together tall and firm, and we will confront this moral depravity without fear and with determination,” Leiter said.
Emergency vehicles remained at the scene in the morning after police taped off the area.
“We’re going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send the clear message that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters.
“The horrific incident is going to frighten a lot of people in our city, and in our country. I want to be clear that we will not tolerate this violence or hate.”</p><small>2025-05-22 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605665-senators-denounce-khuzdar-carnage-demand-justice-for-slain-schoolchildren' target='_blank'><strong>Senators denounce Khuzdar school bus bombing, demand justice for slain children</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier this week, the government promoted Gen Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his “strategic leadership and decisive role” in defeating India during the military confrontation between the two countries that ended with a US-mediated ceasefire.
Field marshal is the highest rank in armies modelled after the British Army. In Pakistan, it was awarded only once before, to General Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1959.
Speaking to reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail yesterday after meeting with incarcerated ex-premier Imran Khan, Gohar said: “A long time has passed. The PTI is a major party, Khan sahib is the most popular leader. We want these difficulties to end now.
“This is why I am saying that the [army chief] has gotten this new honour of field marshal. [We] have congratulated but after this new honour, there is an increased responsibility on him to play his role even more and make the situation better.”
 
 

Responding to a question, Gohar said that the PTI would issue a formal stance on the development. He added, “We have no strife with the military. Khan sahib also said yesterday that we stand with our armed forces and whoever is related to the armed forces will be uncontroversial.”
“Contacts have not been restored for now, but it is definitely our desire. Khan sahib has said that we never closed the door for talks with the establishment,” Gohar further said.
Gohar’s comments echoed those stated in a post on Imran’s X account, wherein the ex-PM said he was willing to speak to those who have power, in the best interest of the country.
Asked specifically about alleged intervention in politics, Gohar said, “We all say that the military should have no role in politics, […] and I say that whatever happens should be above politics.
“After all, it is a major institution. It has had an influence and remains, so I will request that whoever can play their role in making the situation better to do so,” the PTI leader added.
The elevation, first cleared by the federal cabinet and later communicated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to President Asif Ali Zardari, marks the first such promotion in over six decades.
The government also announced a second, open-ended extension in the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu, making him the first Pakistan Air Force head to receive two extensions.
Gohar also spoke about India, saying that “an air of war was still lingering”.
He termed that the Pakistani forces had secured an “amazing victory, which India could not have even imagined”. “In my opinion, this war was even more serious than the 1965 or 1971 wars, because both countries are now nuclear powers,” he highlighted.
However, he cautioned the nation to remain united and alert against India’s “another such attempt and nefarious intentions”.
Implications for military hierarchy
A Ministry of Defence notification said that Gen Munir’s promotion to field marshal had been made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (Rules) 1998.
The rules are classified, but according to a military source, the mentioned rule reads: “199-A. Promotion to field marshal. A general officer, whether serving or retired, may be promoted to the rank of field marshal by the federal government without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.”
However, experts noted the silence of the Constitution and the Pakistan Army Act on such an appointment.
 
 

While the rank does not grant additional operational authority, its conferral during a period of heightened regional tension carries strategic and political symbolism. It may also bolster Field Marshal Munir’s standing both within the military and in political circles, particularly amid ongoing internal instability and civil-military friction.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who previously headed the Senate defence committee, noted: “Field Marshal Asim Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure, more so, given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians. Even before May, which has become an inflection point for Pakistan, for India and for South Asia, all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.”
COAS Munir’s promotion is not expected to alter operational command but serves as a symbolic acknowledgement of his wartime leadership.
The global precedent supports this view. In India, Field Marshals Sam Manekshaw (1973) and K.M. Cariappa (1986) were promoted purely for ceremonial reasons, with no changes to the army’s structure. Similarly, in the United Kingdom and the United States, five-star titles have historically honoured extraordinary service during major wars without altering command frameworks.</p><small>2025-05-22 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2214383849b454d.png?r=143902' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912589/japan-taxi-driver-suspected-of-raping-50-women-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Japan taxi driver suspected of raping 50 women: reports</strong></a><br><p>Japanese police said on Thursday they arrested a former taxi driver on suspicion of drugging and raping a female passenger, with media reports saying there could be dozens more victims.
The Yomiuri Shimbun daily and Jiji Press reported that police found about 3,000 videos and images of him sexually assaulting around 50 women in his taxi or his home.
Last year, the man “got a woman, then in her 20s, to take sleeping pills which caused her to lose consciousness, took her to his home and committed an indecent act, which he filmed,” a Tokyo police spokesman told AFP.
Police arrested the 54-year-old on Wednesday on “suspicion of non-consensual sexual intercourse and violation of the law on punishment of filming of sexual parts,” he added without elaborating further.
Traces of sleeping pills were detected in her hair, according to media reports.
The footage recovered on the man’s phone and other devices dated back to 2008, the reports said.
Media also said that he was arrested last October on suspicion of drugging another woman and robbing her of 40,000 yen ($280).
He was later released before being taken into custody again in December for alleged indecent assault, the reports said.</p><small>2025-05-22 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605652-another-student-injured-in-khuzdar-school-bus-attack-dies' target='_blank'><strong>Another student succumbs to injuries sustained in Khuzdar bus attack</strong></a><br><p>

Exports witnessed significant growth to Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, spurred by recent changes in the regional political landscape. However, trade with these countries continues to face considerable challenges, largely due to unfavourable government policies.
Despite this positive development in exports, the overall trade gap with regional countries widened, primarily due to increased imports from China, India and Bangladesh during the period under review.
In FY24, the trade deficit with these countries stood at $9.506bn, up 49pc from $6.382bn in the preceding year.

Export gains to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka offset by soaring imports

Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw a hefty growth in July-April FY25. Still, exports to other countries, especially China, continued to decline during the period, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — rose 2.37pc to $3.743bn in July-April FY25 from $3.656bn over the same period last year.
Contrary to this, imports surged 23.84pc to $13.530bn in 10MFY25 from $10.925bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 23.87pc to $13.191bn in 10MFY25 from $10.649bn over the same period last year. In FY24, imports from China stood at $13.506bn, up by 39.78pc from $9.662bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh.
Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 11.65pc to $2.070bn in 10MFY25 from $2.343bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.
Imports from India increased 14.35pc to $196.77m in 10MFY25 from $172.07m over the last year. In FY24, imports from India rose 8.866pc to $206.89m — up from $190.04m in the same period last year.
Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $0.51m in 10MFY25 against $1.25m over the last year. Exports to India stood at $3.669m in FY24 against $0.329m in the same period the previous year.
Exports to Afghanistan increased 52.46pc to $666.59m in 10MFY25 from $437.22m last year. Imports stood at $22.77m against $7.38m in 10MFY24, a growth of 208pc.
The Torkham border station remained closed for almost 27 days last month which disrupted the imports and exports to Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s main exports to Afghanistan include sugar in the current fiscal year. In the past four months, Pakistan exported more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar, mostly to Afghanistan.
No formal data is available for trade with Iran, as most of it occurs through informal channels. However, Pakistan has adopted a barter trade arrangement, especially as smuggling of Iranian petroleum products and LPG through Balochistan’s porous border continues.
Exports to Bangladesh increased by 24.77pc to $668.94m in 10MFY25 from $536.12m. Imports grew 43.35pc to $68.87m in 10MFY from $48.04m over the last year. The uptick in trade followed the ouster of the Hasina government in Dhaka. Pakistan has resumed rice exports to Bangladesh in the current fiscal year.
Exports to Sri Lanka dropped 0.52pc to $326.90m in 10MFY25 from $328.62m the last year. This decline was attributed to reduced economic activity in Sri Lanka. Imports from Sri Lanka remained static at $49m during the months under review.
Shipments to Nepal fell to $2.17m from $2.42m over the last year.
Exports to Maldives rose to $7.96m in 10MFY25 from $7.67m over the last year. No trade activity was recorded between Pakistan and Bhutan during the current fiscal year or the corresponding period last year.

Due to the incident, a traffic jam was witnessed on the slip roads, which created problems for the residents, while the site was cordoned off by the authorities. According to the district administration officials, gas accumulated in the pipeline caused the explosion. They said that the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) officials were informed about the incident and asked to check the reason behind it.
District Emergency Officer Sibghatullah told Dawn that Rescue 1122 received a call about the explosion in the sewer line and rushed to the site. He said that two people were injured in the first gas explosion and four people were injured in the second explosion. He said the injured were moved to Holy Family Hospital, where their condition was termed stable.
Meanwhile, the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited officials checked the area and said the sewer pipeline exploded because there was no gas leakage in the SNGPL pipelines. “It is strange that the two explosions occurred on a road which was reconstructed last year. We suspect that the civic agency possibly used substandard material,” said Muhammad Fareed, a shopkeeper.
A resident Nasir Ali hoped that the relevant department would fill the ditch soon because it was causing problems for the people, especially the schoolchildren. He said that the civic bodies needed to excavate the entire portion to check the status of the utility lines.
Wasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf told Dawn the explosion did not occur in Wasa’s sewer line. He said that the drain was not a part of Wasa’s designated tributaries of Leh Nullah scheduled for one-time cleaning. He said that twin explosions occurred in front of Sunrise Bakery, E-Block, Satellite Town. The affected drain had no ventilating opening or manholes except for a single grating in front of the bakery, leading to gas accumulation.
He said that the explosion caused significant damage, such as the dismantling of the inlet gratings, damage to the concrete slabs, and displacement of the asphaltic layer on the adjacent road.
He advised the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation to remodel the drain to ensure proper gas ventilation and install manholes (ventilating openings) at regular intervals, not more than 20 metres apart, to mitigate the possible gas build-up.

In a statement, the commission issued a prediction regarding the sighting of the crescent moon for the month of Zilhaj 1446 AH, “based on scientific analysis, astronomical data, and modern observational techniques.”
It said according to astronomical models, the birth of the new moon for Zilhaj will occur on May 27, 2025, at 8:02pm PST.
The scientific analysis for May 27, 2025 (29 Ziqa’ad) in Pakistan indicates the age of the moon at sunset will be approximately 11 hours and 34 minutes, it mentioned.
“Even under the most optimal weather conditions, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country is extremely low, as there will only be a 37-minute interval between sunset and moonset,” it added.
The commission said 1st Zilhaj is expected to fall on May 29. Therefore, Eidul Azha will be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.
It added that the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee holds the final authority to confirm the moon’s sighting based on eyewitness testimonies and weather conditions.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><small>2025-05-22 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22132318c5f3acb.jpg?r=132340' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912510/wasa-clears-iesco-cda-dues-after-aid-from-punjab-government' target='_blank'><strong>Wasa clears Iesco, CDA dues after aid from Punjab government</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has settled its liabilities after paying Rs1.9 billion to the Islamabad Electric Supply Company and Rs1.5 billion to the Capital Development Authority with the aid provided by the provincial government.
Talking to Dawn, Wasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf said that the provincial government had been requested to provide financial aid to the agency to clear its liabilities. He said Rs1.980 billion owed to Iesco had been pending for the last two years for the electricity supply to 480 tube wells in the garrison city and the Rawal Dam filtration plant. He said that it was difficult for the agency to pay the electricity supply bills because of its meagre income over the last two years.
Regarding the CDA, there was Rs1.59 billion outstanding amount pending for the last 16 years against Wasa’s share for the operation and maintenance of the Khanpur Dam Filtration Plant in Sangjani.
He said that a year ago, Wasa did not have additional money available to pay its share to the CDA and the provincial government was approached with a request to clear the pending amount. He said that Wasa was getting 6 million gallons daily (MGD) of water from Khanpur Dam and it shared the operational and maintenance cost with the CDA.

Agency’s MD says Rs1.9bn paid to Iesco for electricity, Rs1.5bn to CDA for Khanpur plant operations

Speaking about the Wasa budget, he said the agency had planned to complete the annual budget next month, adding that this year, Wasa would present a surplus budget. He said that after getting the financial aid from the Punjab government, the income generated from the water and sewerage bills would be used to upgrade the water supply system in the garrison city.
Mr Ashraf said that Wasa had aimed to recover Rs2.371 billion in the current fiscal year and so far it has recovered Rs3 billion. He added that the recovery will increase in June as well.
He said in the last fiscal year 2023-24, a target of Rs1.570 billion was fixed and Rs1.717 billion was recovered, adding that the target for this fiscal year was Rs2.7 billion and the agency had already recovered Rs3 billion in 11 months.
“There are 134,681 consumers in the garrison city, and 96,971 consumers are paying their bills, while the recovery teams have been asked to bring all consumers in the paying category,” he said.
He said the basic reason for better recovery this year was the “new plan of recovery”, as the agency formed special teams to recover money from habitual defaulters without any discrimination. He warned that defaulters were being given time till May 31 to clear their dues, after which, the civic agency would not waive off late fee charges and instalments.

The dialogue mainly focused on aligning Pakistan’s fiscal strategy with inclusive growth goals.
The speakers said with a budget deficit of over 6.8pc of the GDP and debt levels exceeding 70pc, there is an urgent need to safeguard and expand investments in health, education, nutrition and social protection. Despite tax revenues below 10pc of the GDP, they said, development for children and marginalised groups cannot be delayed.

Say urgent need to safeguard, expand investments in health, education, nutrition, social protection

The conference on ‘Strengthening Fiscal Policies for Inclusive and Sustainable Development: Advancing Child and Gender-Responsive Public Investments’ was jointly organised by the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Unicef Pakistan and Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI). Government officials, economists, development partners and civil society representatives took part in the dialogue and deliberated on reorienting fiscal frameworks toward equity, sustainability and inclusive growth.
Insights from Unicef’s Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) revealed a persistent gap between policy commitments and actual social sector allocations, notably in provinces like Sindh where education spending has dropped to 1.8pc of GDP.
Anchored in the government’s Uraan Pakistan programme — specifically the equity and empowerment pillar — the speakers called for targeted fiscal shifts toward inclusive and people-centred development. Key priorities include digital literacy, green skills, education access and civic engagement, especially for women, youths, and under-served communities.
SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri said Pakistan was navigating two IMF programmes — the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) — with contrasting objectives. While the EFF focuses on reducing energy circular debt and raising energy prices, the RSF emphasises green technology and climate resilience.
“This paradox presents both challenges and opportunities,” Dr Suleri said, urging policymakers to integrate climate tagging into development to empower girls and adolescents through climate-aligned and inclusive fiscal planning.
Unicef Representative Sharmila Rasool emphasised the importance of human capital in a rapidly changing global environment.
“Pakistan’s Human Capital Index stands at 0.41, which suggests that only 41pc of the children will reach their full potential,” she said.
Ms Rasool called for bringing about urgent reforms in tax equity and public expenditure.
She noted that Pakistan’s regressive tax system unfairly burdened the poorest while shielding the elites. She reaffirmed Unicef’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s efforts to align spending with equity, especially for children and adolescents.
Joint Chief Economist Ministry of Planning, speaking on behalf of Federal Minister for Planning, Dr Mohammad Ali Talpur, highlighted that under the Uraan Pakistan, fiscal policy must be a tool for social justice.
“Our fiscal decisions must uplift those most under-served — especially children, women and low-income families,” he said.
He announced the formation of a high-level technical working group to explore reallocation strategies, identify new fiscal opportunities and reinforce Pakistan’s commitment to inclusive development under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Director Research, Planning and Development Department, Government of Balochistan, Dr Lutfur Rehman presented the province’s challenges, including dysfunctional girls’ schools and inadequate spending on children’s services.
He also stressed the need for targeted investments to uplift marginalised populations.
Representative from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Pir Aimal highlighted the geopolitical challenges in the tribal regions and said the province prioritised social sector financing under the 5Es-based Uraan Pakistan programme.
A representative from the Sindh government shared that post-flood reconstruction efforts were being directed toward social protection, education and healthcare. The upcoming provincial budget aims to balance disaster recovery with long-term social investment.
Ayesha Javaid from the finance ministry mentioned that for the first time, Pakistan’s federal budget was gender responsive. She acknowledged the extensive institutional efforts needed to incorporate gender into fiscal planning.
Head of Nust Policy Studies Department Dr Ashfaq Hassan Khan, presenting a critical economic analysis, stressed that Pakistan’s budget deficit was driven by soaring interest payments and that the current monetary policy, particularly high interest rates, was unsustainable. He advocated for a freeze on new infrastructure projects and called for immediate privatisation of loss-making state enterprises to relieve fiscal pressure.
World Bank representative Tobias Becker presented empirical findings under the Uraan Pakistan, indicating that the poor contribute disproportionately to the tax system while benefiting less from public spending.
He noted excessive subsidies in electricity and tertiary education and urged reorientation toward primary education and equitable subsidy distribution.
SDPI Deputy Executive Director Dr Sajid Amin Javaid underscored that gender was often treated as a residual issue in financial policy. He called for a dedicated public finance and social investment framework that incorporated gender, climate and private sector financing.
“We need a body focused on mobilising social investments and modernising our industrial and regulatory systems,” he suggested.
Member of Social Sector, Planning Commission said: “Real GDP growth stands at 2.38pc and inflation has eased significantly. However, poverty remains high and 25.6 million children are still out of school.”
Ms Bashir emphasised that inclusive fiscal reform was not a cost but an investment. A high-level working group will be convened to explore reallocations and alternative financing models targeting children, youth and women, she added.

During a session marked by strong reservations from Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan and treasury lawmakers regarding the proposed Local Bodies Bill, several members expressed serious concerns over the step, with some asserting it would “bury local governments”.
Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah, speaking on a point of order, criticised the bill, echoing sentiments that it would undermine elected representatives by prioritising district commissioners. Provincial Minister for Local Government Zeeshan Rafiq defended the bill, stating that perceptions of it being detrimental were false and would be addressed.
However, MPA Ahmad Iqbal insisted that the new bill would indeed dismantle local governance, despite Minister Rafiq’s assurances to the contrary.
The assembly unanimously passed a condemnatory resolution regarding the recent terrorist attack in Khuzdar, which resulted in the martyrdom of children. The resolution, presented by Provincial Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Mujtaba Shuja, strongly condemned the act and demanded that terrorists be brought to justice.
Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah highlighted the sacrifices made for Pakistan and accused India of funding traitors to weaken the country through terrorism.
Speaker Khan affirmed the nation’s solidarity with the armed forces, stating that the army had “made India bite the dust.” He also mentioned that events, including a ceremony honoring Field Marshal Asim Munir, were postponed due to the Khuzdar tragedy.
Information Minister Azma Bukhari attributed the tragedy to “cowardly enemy proxies” instigated by India and reiterated the Punjab government’s commitment to supporting Balochistan and continuing “Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos” to eliminate these elements.
In the absence of the opposition PTI, who were reportedly in Islamabad under the leadership of Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar, the assembly proceeded to approve several key pieces of legislation. Among the 14 bills passed were the Punjab Motor Vehicles Amendment Bill 2025 (Bill Nos. 25, 43, and 45), the Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Punjab Workers’ Welfare Fund (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Companies Profits (Workers’ Participation) (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Stamp (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Provincial Employees Social Security (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Punjab Arms (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Punjab Judicial Academy (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Punjab Fertilizer Control Bill 2025, the Police Order (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Punjab Financial Advisory Services Bill 2025, and the Punjab Anti-Terrorism Amendment Bill 2025.
The Punjab Anti-Terrorism Amendment Bill 2025 was approved by suspending the rules, marking it as the 14th bill passed with a majority vote. All bills were approved with only 50 members present in the house.
Speaker Khan also urged members to actively participate in the “Suthra Punjab” (Clean Punjab) programme, calling it a “revolutionary step” by the government that aims to direct development towards rural areas for the first time.
During a discussion on the functionality of government vehicles, Minister Zeeshan Rafiq stated that no new vehicles had been purchased for the Local Government Department since 2008. MPA Ahmad Iqbal raised concerns about the lack of cooperation from “Suthra Punjab” contractors in his constituency.

The Court’s unequivocal stance against the use of mental illness as a shield for premeditated brutality, and its refusal to bow to elite pressure, marked a vital precedent in Pakistan’s legal history. For women across the country, this decision holds both symbolic and structural significance. It signals that, however fragile or infrequent, there remains an institutional capacity for justice within Pakistan’s highest judicial forum.
A precedent against patriarchy
The Noor Mukadam case has, from its inception, transcended the boundaries of an individual crime. It became a sociopolitical parable: both a mirror and a battleground.
Noor’s status as the daughter of a former diplomat underscores the brutal truth that in Pakistan, privilege offers no inherent protection from patriarchal violence. Whether by a husband, brother, romantic partner, or friend, women of every socioeconomic class navigate a landscape of danger.

This is the first insight the case thrust into public consciousness: class may dictate access to power, but it does not inoculate women from violence.

Yet the case also reveals a second, more paradoxical dynamic of privilege — one that ultimately facilitated this rare instance of justice. Noor’s family, bolstered by social capital and political access, refused to compromise. They rejected hush money, resisted societal pressure to remain silent, and pursued the legal route with resilience. In a system where most women’s cases dissolve into procedural inertia or social coercion, the Mukadam family’s perseverance altered the trajectory of what might otherwise have been another unrecorded statistic. This is not to suggest replicability — most families lack such resources — but rather to acknowledge that power, when aligned with principle, can still disrupt entrenched patterns of impunity.
The age of virtual resistance
Tuesday’s Supreme Court verdict must also be understood within the broader sociotechnical context in which this case unfolded.
From 2021 onwards, Noor’s case galvanised an extraordinary wave of online activism. Hashtags such as #JusticeForNoor and #SayHerName proliferated across platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram, transforming public grief into digital mobilisation.
Pakistani women and allies used social media not only to express rage and solidarity but to build pressure on institutions long characterised by inertia. In a context where conventional routes to justice are often inaccessible or ineffective, the digital sphere emerged as a crucial arena of feminist activism as documented in Mursrat Yasmin’s research paper — through archiving memories, amplifying voices, and demanding accountability.
This phenomenon also reflects a broader evolution of digital citizenship in Pakistan. The convergence of grief, memory, and mobilisation online, particularly among urban youth and and a subset of women, demonstrated the immense potential of social media to generate counter-publics. These online collectives resisted attempts to deflect blame, demanded transparency in court proceedings, and even critiqued the weaponisation of mental illness in legal defences.
Per the study, the online terrain, once dismissed as ephemeral, has proven itself capable of sustaining momentum, translating hashtags into headline pressure.
Beginning of vindication, not victory
In this regard, Zahir Jaffer’s legal strategy was especially adverse. His lawyers invoked the concept of mental illness, hoping to exploit a domain that remains grossly misunderstood in Pakistan. Where depression, trauma, and psychosis are colloquially reduced to “woh pagal hai,” the courtroom becomes a space vulnerable to manipulation. Yet, the Supreme Court decisively rejected this line of reasoning — refusing to conflate mental illness with moral absolution. This rejection is not only a legal outcome; it is a normative intervention in how mental health and criminality intersect in public discourse.
To be clear, structural justice for women in Pakistan remains elusive. Rape conviction rates continue to hover at a dismal 0.5 per cent, and the majority of survivors never report assaults, deterred by social stigma, institutional apathy, and the likelihood of retraumatisation. According to the Sustainable Social Development Organisation’s 2024 report, in 2024 alone, over 32,000 cases of gender-based violence were reported, yet conviction rates for rape, kidnapping, and domestic abuse remained below 1pc.
Noor’s case is an anomaly. But it is a powerful one.
That a man as wealthy and socially connected as Zahir Jaffer could not evade conviction, even after deploying every legal and psychological defense at his disposal, is a significant statement. That the Supreme Court refused to bend under pressure, and did so publicly and emphatically, offers a rare moment of jurisprudential clarity.
From a sociological perspective, the verdict also creates what French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu might call a shift in the “symbolic capital” available to women in Pakistan’s public discourse. Symbolic capital — prestige, honour, or recognition — can alter one’s social position in ways that transcend economic class. For a woman listening to the verdict in a remote area or reading about it online, this moment can act as an affective and symbolic resource, helping her reframe what is imaginable in her own fight for justice. The reinforcement of legal accountability, public solidarity, and media support may not immediately alter lived realities, but it can gradually reconfigure the cognitive maps through which justice, resistance, and survival are interpreted, as Bourdieu writes in The Forms of Capital.
Justice in Pakistan is neither routine nor guaranteed. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), an estimated 56pc of women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have neither sought formal help nor confided in anyone about their ordeal — something we hope to change in the coming years.
Tuesday’s verdict, shaped not only by legal arguments but also by a mobilised civil society and a digitally active public, suggests that the arc of justice, while often obstructed, can still bend in the right direction. For Pakistani women, that is not victory, but it is, perhaps, the beginning of vindication.</p><small>2025-05-22 08:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2212563310cb463.png?r=125737' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912455/pti-objects-to-executives-overreach-in-punjab-tax-legislation' target='_blank'><strong>PTI objects to executive’s ‘overreach’ in Punjab tax legislation</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has strongly objected to the rising trend of allowing the executive to encroach upon the sole prerogative of the Punjab Assembly of imposing taxes, visible in the recently passed several bills, particularly relating to the establishment of authorities.
PTI legislator Ahmer Rasheed Bhatti, while speaking to Dawn on Saturday, pointed out a growing trend in legislation, whereby the executive was overstepping the Punjab Assembly’s sole prerogative of legislation and lamented that the members were not bothered at all.
The PTI MPA said almost over two dozen bills had been passed during the last three sessions since January this year. In most bills, he said, a line was written “maybe prescribed by rules” and asserted that the “maybe” should have been substituted by “shall be”. He said, legally speaking, “maybe” was a vague expression, which did not bind the government to frame rules and the executive could play with this expression.
In the Punjab Enforcement Regulatory Authority Act, it may be mentioned, the expression “may be prescribed” has been used more than 100 times, which shows that the administrative department is either not sure what sort of legislation they intend to do or they intend to do as they please.

Party MPA cites court verdicts and constitutional articles stipulating  legislature’s sole prerogative to impose tax

“The sad part is that the legislators whose job description comprises two functions i.e to legislate and perform oversight over government, they are failing miserably at both,” Mr Bhatti lamented.
Citing an example, Mr Bhatti said the government itself proposed in the Agricultural Income Tax Bill that the tax rate may be decided by the government through rules. Asserting that Article 77 read with Article 127 of the Constitution of Pakistan states that levying tax is the sole prerogative of the assembly, he regretted that the legislature itself was allowing the executive to drive as it liked.
Referring to different bills like Punjab Agricultural Income Tax Bill, Punjab Local Government Bill, Punjab Spatial Planning Authority Bill, Punjab Water and Sanitation Authority Bill, Punjab Education, Curriculum, Training and Assessment Authority Bill, the PTI MPA stated that the authorities were allowed to raise funds while using different government instruments such as bonds, debentures etc. He said the authority was a regulatory body but granted powers of public sector companies that had the powers to raise funds.
Mr Bhatti, who had left the civil service and joined politics, said there were multiple Supreme Court judgements observing that excessive delegated legislation should not be done and cited judgements in the Flying Carpet Company vs Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2016 Lahore 35) and the Engineer Iqbal Zafar Jhagra vs Federation of Pakistan and others (2014 SCMR 1337).
In the LHC flying carpet case, the judgement says: “legislature could not repose any power, essentially legislative, in another body or organ; it could not efface itself and set up a parallel legislative authority; it must exercise its judgement on vital matters of policy and enact the general principles which should be embodied in the legislation”.
Similarly, in the Iqbal Jhagra case in the Supreme Court, the judgement says: “…such legislative powers could not be delegated to the Executive authorities – Majlis-i-Shoora (Parliament) /Legislature alone and not the Government /Executive was empowered to levy tax. Delegation of such power to the Government/Executive was for the purpose of implementation of such laws, which was to be done by framing rules, or issuing notifications or guidelines, depending upon the case, but in no case, authority to levy tax for the Federation was to be delegated to the Government/Executive”.
This reporter severally tried to seek comment from Punjab law secretary Asif Bilal Lodhi on the legislation matter during the past weeks but he opted to keep mum.

It was a statement win for Gladiators, who came into the match against the defending champions as the league stage’s table toppers and the Saud Shakeel-led side hardly felt the heat of the big occasion.
After having posted 209-5, thanks to what proved to be a match-winning partnership between Chandimal and Faheem, Gladiators never really let United get away with the game as Usman took three wickets.
Chasing the big total, United — who will now face the winners of the first Eliminator between Karachi Kings and Lahore Qalandars — scampered on their way to 45-1 in the powerplay, with opener Alex Hales playing Faheem’s pace onto his stumps early in the innings.
The incoming Rassie van der Dussen responded to the slow start when he lifted two towering sixes over Faheem’s head in the seventh over. The South African went after pacer Mohammad Wasim Jr for two cracking boundaries in the ninth, but was undone by a deadly yorker.
 
 

Gladiators were 94-2 by the halfway stage after Salman Ali Agha and Sahibzada Farhan hit a four and a six respectively in the 10th over. Right after bringing up his half century in 33 balls, Farhan holed Usman Tariq’s spin out to Khawaja Nafay at square-leg.
As pressure increased over United, captain Shadab, who had slog-swept Usman for a six over midwicket, was stunned by a one-handed catch by his counterpart Saud, who jumped into the air to intercept the ball after Shadab had cut spinner Abrar Ahmed.
Faheem then returned to bamboozle the incoming James Neesham with an outswinger that chipped the bail off the stump before the Salman counterattacked with two boundaries as United reeled at 143-5.
But they got deeper in trouble when Mohammad Amir bounced out Imad Wasim.
A ramp shot by Salman off Mohammad Wasim suggested the batter could take the match till the end, but Usman’s return in the 18th saw him perish, with Naseem Shah following him back to the pavilion on the very next ball, virtually ending the proceedings before Amir and Wasim took the last two wickets.
Earlier, Chandimal and Faheem led Gladiators’ fightback after a difficult start. Getting together when Gladiators were reeling at 111-5 by the 12th over, the duo went on to play together until the penultimate ball of the innings, combining for 95 off 40 balls with Chandimal staying unbeaten at 49 off 29 (four fours and three sixes) while Faheem added 45 off 23 (four fours and three sixes).
Gladiators were effective with the bat in the powerplay, getting 68 off it but also losing three wickets; those of Saud and in-form batters Rilee Rossouw and Hasan Nawaz.
The fall of three wickets early into the innings did seem to play on the minds of Allen and Avishka Fernando; the Quetta batters present on the crease, with only 28 runs coming across the next four overs, also thanks to some tight bowling by spinner Imad and Neesham.
With Gladiators at 98-3 at the halfway stage, Fernando took on Imad in the 11th over, driving down the ground for four before slogging past midwicket for six, only to see Allen (41 off 27, seven fours) get caught in the same area two balls later.
The introduction of Shadab’s leg-spin in the next over brought about Fernando’s ouster as well, the right-hander getting trapped in front after adding 32 off 21 (two fours and a six).
Shadab’s return in the 14th over saw Dinesh Chandimal punishing the bowler for pitching it in the right-hander’s slot by two hits for sixes straight down the ground.
Chandimal cut Imad with prowess for a boundary and played a similar shot off Neesham for four more to bring up 150 for Gladiators by the 16th over.
As Quetta amped things up, Faheem bludgeoned Salman for a four before smashing his yorker for a straight six before Chandimal dispatched two fours and a six off Neesham.
Faheem took on Naseem in the next over, pulling for six and placing the ball past cover and backward point for fours. The left-hander dragged a slower one over the leg-side for another six before holing one out to Shadab in the final over, but by then Gladiators had enough on the board to eventually take the match.

The strong quake struck 82 kilometres (51 miles) northeast of Crete’s capital Heraklion at 3:19am GMT (8:19am PKT) at a depth of 68 kilometres (42 miles), the USGS said.
AFP journalists said it was felt as far away as Athens and Egypt.
Greek state television ERT said many residents in the Cretan regions of Rethymno and Lasithi were woken by the quake just after 6:00am (11am PKT) and quickly exited their homes as a precaution.
Local media showed supermarket items strewn on floors, and reported minor rockslides on rural roads.
The tremor “occurred at a great depth and there is no particular reason for residents to worry,” Athanassios Ganas, general director of Research at the Geodynamics Institute of the National Observatory of Athens, told ERT.
State news agency ANA said fire department units in Crete had been placed on general alert, with vehicles patrolling to assess the situation.
The mayor of Heraklion, Alexis Kalokerinos, told ERT that there were no particular problems in the city and that closing schools would not be necessary.
The quake struck just over a week after a 6.1-magnitude tremor hit near the island of Kasos east of Crete, and was felt in the outlying area.
The region, popular with tourists, has been hit with multiple tremors in recent months, prompting schools in Santorini and neighbouring islands to temporarily close.
Thousands of earthquakes, mainly of low magnitude, have been recorded since January between the islands of Santorini, Amorgos, Ios and Anafi in the Cyclades group southeast of the Greek mainland.
They have not caused casualties or significant damage.
Located where the African and Anatolian tectonic plates converge, the Aegean Sea is often hit by quakes.
But the region had not experienced a phenomenon of such magnitude since records began in 1964, experts say.</p><small>2025-05-22 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2212042574b2d45.jpg?r=120429' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912529/naila-kiani-eyes-12th-eight-thousander' target='_blank'><strong>Naila Kiani eyes 12th eight-thousander</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Renowned mountaineer Naila Kiani, only Pakistani woman climber to have summited 11 of the world’s 14 eight-thousander peaks, on Wednesday began her summit push to ascend Kanchenjunga (8,586 metres), the world’s third-highest mountain located in Nepal.
She arrived at Kanchenjunga Base Camp on May 5, completed her acclimatisation rotation, and had been waiting for a suitable weather window. According to a statement from her team, Ms Kiani left Camp 2 on Wednesday and was headed toward Camp 3, targeting to reach the summit by Thursday or Friday, depending on conditions.
“Climbing Kanchenjunga has been an incredibly difficult expedition and a harsh reminder of how hard it is to climb mountains over 8,000m,” Ms Kiani said in a message to her team before resuming her ascent. “I’m now at Camp 2 and need every ounce of physical strength and mental determination to make it through. I’m praying … it’s been very tough so far.”
Ms Kiani is part of the Imagine Nepal expedition. Her team said weather at the peak remains uncertain.

Seeks to become first Pakistani woman to summit all 14 highest peaks

If conditions allow, her final summit push was to start on Wednesday or Thursday from Camp 3.
“This expedition marks a significant step in her ambitious quest to climb all 14 of the world’s 8,000-metre peaks,” the statement read. Only 65 climbers globally, including just 14 women have conquered all 14 eight-thousanders peaks
Her previous summits incl­ude Everest, K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum I and II, Annapurna, Lhotse, Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu. The ascent of Kanchen­junga would bring her closer to completing the elite 14-peak challenge.
“Each mountain presents its own set of challenges, but the drive to represent Pakistan on these global heights keeps me going,” Ms Kiani said.
“I’m very grateful that the Bard Foundation has made this attempt possible and for their support throughout my mountaineering journey.”
“Kanchenjunga is known for its treacherous terrains and unpredictable weather,” she added.
“But with determination and the support of my family, team and followers, I’m hopeful for a successful summit.”
Ms Kiani was awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz last year for her mountaineering achievements.
She is also a Dubai-based banker, amateur boxer and mother of two.
She gained initial fame in 2018 after wedding photos at K2 Base Camp went viral.
In October 2023, Ms Kiani and fellow climber Sirbaz Khan survived an avalanche on Tibet’s Shishapangma peak, while four other climbers were killed or went missing.

• Observes it is embarrassing for judges to bracket them for deciding in favour of a political party
ISLAMABAD: Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan on Wednesday took exception to uncharitable pleadings on behalf of PTI chairman Imran Khan in which disparaging remarks were made against certain judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
“This is embarrassing even for judges to bracket them for deciding in favour of a political party,” Justice Hassan regretted, adding how the Chief Justice of Pakistan could mark cases to the judge mentioned in the petition after reading such remarks in the plea.
Justice Hassan was a member of the five-judge Constitutional Bench that had taken up a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kaya­­ni, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sat­tar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
In the petition, PTI founder Imran Khan had contended that the five IHC judges were punished because they decided false cases on merit registered and filed against the petitioner without fear or favour.
“Moreover, former IHC chief justice Aamir Farooq, who now was rewarded by appointing him as judge of the Supreme Court, was repeatedly asked to recuse himself from petitioner’s cases, but he refused to do so.”
“And when IHC judges made a representation to former IHC CJ, the same were dismissed forthwith, issuing a fresh seniority list in which the senior puisine judge of IHC was demoted from his position while a freshly transferred judge was put in the senior most position,” the petition had contended.
The petition went on to state that a few days later former IHC CJ was appointed to the apex court and hence rewarded for damaging petitioner’s case, life and liberty, whereas the judges who stood up against the illegal and undue external pressures were punished by having their seniority disturbed. The entire debacle clearly showed lack of good faith, which is a dagger in the heart of Pakistan’s stability, the petition had regretted.
While pointing towards Advocate Idrees Asharaf, Justice Hassan today observed that the counsel had filed two petitions on behalf of Advocate Raja Muqsid and PTI founder Imran Khan and wondered whether any political party or a politician could ever claim such a stance in his petition.
The counsel, however, explained that the petition, to which Justice Hassan was referring to, in fact was originally filed by PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen. The counsel made it clear that the points he highlighted in the petition he filed was based on legal plain stating that his aim in fact was for the enforcement of law and the Constitution.
However, Justice Hassan regretted that such a petition should be dismissed by imposing a heavy cost as a punishment, also stating that the system should be allowed to work.
Earlier, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi on behalf of former presidents of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association contended that the central issue in the present dispute revolves around the seniority of IHC judges and if CB settles the matter then other issues regarding the transfer of judges to IHC as well as taking of oath before entering IHC will become merely an academic exercise.
The counsel urged CB to interpret Article 200 of the Constitution under which the judges were transferred to IHC in a way that the matter should not become a case of judges versus judges rather it should enhance the concept of comity among judges and reduces the conflict.
The counsel was of the view the seniority of the judges who were transferred should start from the bottom of the seniority list of IHC though they could retain seniority in their parent high court from where they have been transferred.
The record showed that the seniority issue was kept hidden from the chief justices at the time of seeking consultation with them, adding the seniority conflict among the judges was created by the executive when they have no power to disturb the seniority. This is where the malice comes, the counsel argued. The case will now be taken up again on Friday.

She suffered complications and was referred to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, where she remained under treatment for a week and died on Tuesday.
He said on Wednesday scores of people from nearby villages attacked the hospital, beat the staff with sticks and stones, damaged ambulances parked there and the health facility.
Dr Sultan said he and his colleagues had established the hospital several years ago, where quality treatment was being provided free of cost.
He said that the incident extremely saddened him. He said it was the second hospital in the world where treatment of fistula was being provided to women free of cost.
Dr Sultan, who was a former principal of the Dow Medical College, lamented that if such ‘hooliganism’ prevailed, who would provide services to the community.

• Says Nawaz was consulted before army chief’s elevation to field marshal
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said Saudi Arabia could be the “neutral” venue for much-needed talks between Pakistan and India on critical issues.
The premier also said that he had consulted PML-N President Nawaz Sharif on his decision to elevate Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir to field marshal.
Talking to a group of TV anchors at the PM House, he said that Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during the dialogue with India.
In response to a question if there was a possibility of a third venue for talks in light of the mediation offered by US President Donald Trump, the premier ruled out the possibility of China as a neutral venue, saying India would never agree to that.
However, a participant told Dawn, the PM expressed the hope that Saudi Arabia could be the third country where both sides could agree to hold the negotiations.
When it was pointed out that India intends to hold dialogue on terrorism while Pakistan wants to focus on Kashmir, the PM reiterated: “Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during Pakistan-India talks.”
Regarding the appointment of COAS Gen Munir as field marshal, PM Shehbaz said: “It was my own decision to make the army chief a field marshal.”
Responding to a question that Nawaz Sharif had always remained opposed to giving extension to the army chief’s term in office, PM Shehbaz said he took his elder brother into confidence before taking any decision and likewise the COAS was made field marshal after consultation with the ruling party president.
“I always consult Nawaz Sharif before taking any key decision and that also happened in case of [elevation of] Gen Asim Munir,” he added.
In reply to a question that the PTI-led KP government needs to be supported in its efforts for eradicating terrorism, the prime minister said Centre was already helping the province in this regard as over Rs600 billion had been released to the KP government under the Public Sector Development Programme.
He said that situation between Pakistan and India was de-escalating after the DGMOs of the two sides made contacts with each other.
He said if talks were held between the two arch rivals, the National Secur­ity Adviser will lead Paki­stan’s side in the process.
Meeting on housing
Presiding over a meeting on the low-cost housing, the prime minister said that affordable projects would not only make residential units accessible to the common man but would also boost national economy and create jobs.
He said the relevant task force, in collaboration with the ministry of fina­n­ce and banks, should soon submit recommendations for financing low-cost hou­s­ing projects, which should be included in the upcoming budget proposals.
He observed that sustainable growth of economy was closely linked with the development of the construction sector.
Ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Riaz Hussain Pirzada, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh­a­mmad Aurangzeb, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, the FBR chairman and other senior officials attended the mee­t­ing, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The meeting was infor­med that the Condominium Act 2025 and amendments to the Foreclosure Law were in their final stages and after their approval it would become easier to obtain loans for the construction and ownership of homes under the low-cost housing schemes.
The task force briefed the meeting on the progress in initiating construction projects, particularly low-cost housing schemes.

In a statement, the Ministry of Finance said it was initiating a comprehensive strategy to regulate digital assets and accelerate the growth of Pakistan’s virtual asset economy. On the recommendations of the Pak­istan Cryptocurrency Cou­ncil (PCC), a dedicated body, ‘Pakistan Digital Assets Authority’, would regulate blockchain-based financial infrastructure to ensure the FATF-comp­liant innovation, economic inclusion, and responsible adoption of digital assets, it said.
“Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up — but to lead. With the PDAA, we are creating a future-ready framework that protects consumers, invites global investment, and puts Pakistan at the forefront of financial innovation,” said Finance Minister and PCC Chairman Muhammad Aurangzeb.
He said PDAA would serve as a specialised regulatory body with a clear mandate to oversee licensing, compliance, and innovation within the digital asset ecosystem. It will regulate exchanges, custodians, wallets, tokenised platforms, stablecoins, and DeFi applications — all under a single, agile framework.
The strategic decision aligns Pakistan with other forward-thinking economies such as the UAE, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong — all of which have established digital assets regulators to foster innovation while ensuring compliance with global financial norms.
The PDAA is expected to regulate more than $25 billion informal crypto market, enable tokenisation of national assets and government debt, provide legal clarity to global and local investors and facilitate monetisation of Pakistan’s surplus electricity through regulated Bitcoin mining.
The Authority is also expected to empower the youth and startups to build blockchain-based solutions at scale. With the proposed PDAA, Pakistan is signalling its intent to become a competitive player in the global digital economy, inviting responsible innovation and building trust with investors, entrepreneurs, and international partners.
“This is not just about crypto — it’s about rewriting our financial future, expanding access, and creating new export channels through tokenisation, digital finance, and Web3 innovation,” said Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of Pakistan Crypto Council — a body created a couple of months ago to guide cryptocurrency business in the country.

He warned that a nuclear confrontation bet­ween India and Pakistan will have devastating consequences for the entire region and beyond.
“There is a need to hold dialogue and find solution to the issue of terrorism. People of both countries seek peace, which is not possible until the three main issues — Kashmir, terrorism, and water — are resolved,” he said while talking to reporters after attending a briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
A former foreign minister, Mr Bhutto-Zardari will soon lead a high-level diplomatic delegation to various capitals to apprise the world leaders of India’s aggression aimed at destabilising regional peace.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently decided to send a high-level delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda in the aftermath of the recent military escalation.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari will lead the delegation, comprising Senator Sherry Rehman, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Sabzwari, Tehmina Janjua, and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
The PPP legislator told media persons that he and other members of the delegation had received an initial briefing at the Foreign Office on the ceasefire, Kashmir, terrorism and the Indian “attack” on the Indus Waters Treaty.
He said such briefings will continue for the next few days, and then as per the prime minister’s directive, they will visit different countries to present Pakistan’s stance, which is based on peace.
The PPP leader said Pakistan desired peace in the region which can be achieved by addressing the flashpoints, whether it was the Kashmir dispute or terrorism.
“Pakistan is one of the biggest victims of terrorism,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari cautioned that the “new normal” that India was seeking was not in its favour either.
“We have seen how after a terrorist attack, both countries can come close to a nuclear war,” he pointed out.
He expressed grave concerns about India’s weaponisation of water and highlighted the need for Pakistan to apprise the world about it.
He said they would inform foreign governments and people that a conflict between two nuclear countries would have severe consequences beyond the region.
The PPP chief appreciated the prime minister’s efforts during the conflict, saying Pakistan demonstrated a ‘reasonable and rational role’ after India’s baseless accusations.
“Pakistan was not the aggressor, we only defended ourselves,” he said, adding that “the world is welcoming our stance as we stood with the truth, while India built a narrative on lies and falsehoods.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari, in a recent post on X, announced that he was appointed by the prime minister to “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
“I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” he wrote.
In a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.

The authorities, however, have committed to meeting any revenue shortfall through reduced expenditure in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) during the current year. An increase in the petroleum levy and the introduction of a carbon levy on petroleum and other energy products are expected to be part of the forthcoming budget, sources said.
Informed sources told Dawn that, on the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) have discussed possible relief measures with the IMF mission, which has been engaged in budget discussions since May 14. Among the proposed concessions is an average 2.5 per cent reduction in income tax rates across all salaried income slabs.
However, this proposal hinges on IMF staff being satisfied with the government’s revenue plan that supports the programme’s target of a 1.6pc primary budget surplus — approximately Rs2.1 trillion. An official told Dawn that discussions on budget targets are still ongoing and that no measures have been finalised.

Authorities pledge PSDP cuts to cover revenue gap

Datasheets and projections, in line with the proposed budgetary framework reviewed in the first biannual review a few weeks ago, have been shared with the IMF. Responses to the Fund’s queries are currently being compiled. The official said that the IMF’s position on the proposed revenue and expenditure strategy will become clearer once its staff analyses the data through its software-based framework.
He added that the IMF has neither accepted nor rejected the proposed relief measures for the budget, contrary to reports in certain quarters. Formal discussions regarding budgetary proposals for the real estate sector have yet to take place.
The government’s “Tajir Dost” scheme for retailers, meanwhile, has failed to yield the desired results and is likely to be replaced by a more effective revenue collection strategy.
The IMF has also emphasised the need to reduce provincial expenditures and increase provincial revenue contributions to maintain fiscal discipline and progress towards implementing a national fiscal pact. A key priority at the provincial level, according to the Fund, should be the effective enforcement of agriculture income tax beginning September 2025.
The government has pledged to withhold PSDP disbursements to offset revenue shortfalls and expects additional tax revenues through the resolution of litigation cases. The Fund has already acknowledged the authorities’ commitment to pursuing resolution of outstanding legal cases — worth Rs367 billion out of a total Rs770bn under dispute. These include cases before the Supreme Court (Rs43bn), high courts in Islamabad, Sindh and Lahore (Rs217bn), and the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (Rs104bn).
A favorable SC ruling could effectively resolve cases involving an estimated Rs120bn, according to the IMF.
