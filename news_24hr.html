While China dominates the global supply of these minerals, the US is trying to catch up by rushing to strike mineral resources deals with several countries and taking other initiatives.
Over the decades, China built a near-monopoly in the extraction and processing capacity of rare earth minerals, which are used in electronics, electric cars, radars and military weapon systems. Last year, President Donald Trump saw how China pushed back against his tariffs by imposing curbs on exports of rare earth minerals. This threatened US industry and forced Washington to back down. He has since stepped up efforts to reduce dependence on China by seeking to develop alternate sources of supply and make new investments. His stated aim to seize Greenland is mostly driven by this.
Trump has also announced the establishment of a strategic critical-minerals stockpile, named ‘Project Vault’ worth $12 billion, in an effort to reduce the risk to manufacturers from supply disruptions, while his administration tries to deal with China’s dominance in rare earths and other metals. Last week, Washington hosted a critical minerals ministerial to which delegations from 50 countries were invited with the aim of forming a preferential trade bloc and seeking collaboration to diversify supply chains.
An insightful new book describes how China came to establish its ascendancy in the batteries sector by making strategic investments much earlier, while the US focused on oil and the technologies of the past. The Elements of Power by journalist Nicolas Niarchos is a fascinating tour de force of the development of the battery industry, evolution of the demand for lithium and cobalt, the scientific advances that were made and who profited from all of this. His story about the ‘age of batteries’ focuses on its innovative aspects, companies that spearheaded technological progress and the geopolitical implications. But it exposes its perils and moral dilemmas as well. For him, this is also a tragic saga “whose protagonists are some of the poorest people in the world” exploited by wealthy countries and predatory companies.

The global competition for critical minerals and metals is set to intensify.

The 20th century, Niarchos says, was powered by oil. But lithium-ion batteries make the modern world possible, being the “foot soldiers of the digital revolution”. They make powerful tech available for every aspect of life, powering cellphones, laptops, medical devices, electric vehicles, drones and jet engines among other things. The metals and materials that go into these batteries come from countries across the world.
He argues that understanding these batteries and how they are made are key to understanding how a new form of power is being created, “one that is measurable in dollars, strategic influence and volts”. He reminds the reader that 70 to 90 per cent of lithium-ion batteries are made in China. And “as with oil, battery power has become political power”. Indeed, the acquisition of critical minerals is driving geostrategic shifts and competition for resources not seen since the time of the Cold War.
Several chapters delve into the colonial history of exploitation and scramble for resources by powerful outsiders. Much of the book’s focus is on the Democratic Republic of Congo, which possesses around half of the world’s supply of metals. Faced with exploitation, conflict, corruption, intrigue and the miserable conditions in which miners work, its people live in poverty while others in far-off lands benefit and enrich themselves from the country’s mineral resources. This highlights a key theme of the book — how rich countries use these resources for their green energy transition (as they produce no emissions) to get away from reliance on fossil fuels and find an answer to climate change. But it comes at the expense of environmental damage and abuses, including child labour, where these resources are mined. As the author puts it, at the bottom of the supply chain “people have toiled in squalid conditions, in poverty and human bondage to extract the minerals needed to make these batteries”.
The chapters on how China achieved major milestones in the development of the battery industry are particularly insightful. They zero in on how Chinese companies such as BYD succeeded in producing devices to store power. The country’s production of electric vehicles surged by leaps and bounds. By 2024, it was able to produce a million cars in a single month. Describing Chinese investment activity in Africa, Niarchos highlights the surge in its investments by the early 2010s. This filled a void left by the US and Europe who myopically gave the continent the cold shoulder. Meanwhile in 2023, China’s CATL became the world’s largest producer of lithium-ion batteries.

 

Niarchos notes that Washington, a late starter with modest investment, began to take serious interest after Trump’s return to power. He appointed his daughter Tiffany’s father-in-law, Massad Boulos, as senior adviser for Africa. Although his book doesn’t cover this, one of Trump’s major initiatives is Pax Silica. This is designed to build reliable supply chains for technologies needed for AI, especially silicon and critical minerals. While trying to boost domestic production aided by state intervention and capital, Trump has sought bilateral deals with many countries to gain access to resources.
For Niarchos it is important to address the moral dilemma concerning the detrimental effects of the new ‘energy revolution’. There is no easy answer to this, but he argues that investing in environmentally responsible mining should be encouraged to meet climate goals. Above all, it is necessary to listen to the people from whose land minerals are acquired, to their needs, pollution concerns and aspirations for a better, healthier world. “Such people,” he writes, “are commonly erased thanks to big-stakes financial dealings and complex, often deadly geopolitical games in the cutthroat competition of resources.”
He is, of course, right. But whether or not this message of his book reaches the corridors of power of big countries and is ever acted upon is an open question. What is certain, however, is that the global competition and battle for mineral resources is set to intensify.
The writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.
Published in Dawn, February 9th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-09 04:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/090912504844656.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972031/new-zealands-christchurch-mosque-killer-appeals-conviction' target='_blank'><strong>New Zealand’s Christchurch mosque killer appeals conviction</strong></a><br><p>A white supremacist who shot and killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in 2019 launched an appeal Monday seeking to overturn his conviction.
Brenton Tarrant, an Australian former gym instructor, admitted carrying out New Zealand’s deadliest modern-day mass shooting before being sentenced to life in jail in August 2020.
Now, the convicted killer argues that his “torturous and inhumane” detention conditions during his trial made him incapable of making rational decisions when he pleaded guilty, according to a court synopsis of the case.
Tarrant is being held in a specialist unit for prisoners of extreme risk at Auckland Prison, seldom interacting with inmates or other people.
“I did not have the mind frame or mental health required to be making informed decisions at that time,” Tarrant told the court, according to the New Zealand Herald.
Tarrant said his state of mind was such that he had considered trying to implicate President Donald Trump in the crime.
Life without parole
“What I said at the time is ‘perhaps I could go out and say there was a second shooter on the roof, perhaps I could say it was Donald J Trump’,” he said, according to national broadcaster RNZ.
If the Court of Appeal in Wellington upholds Tarrant’s conviction, it would hold a separate hearing later in the year to consider an appeal against his sentence.
His penalty of life imprisonment without parole was the stiffest in New Zealand history.
Armed with an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons, Tarrant attacked worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019.
He published an online manifesto before the attacks and then livestreamed the killings for 17 minutes.
His victims were all Muslim and included children, women and the elderly.
‘Not prepared’
There are heavy restrictions on who can be in court during Monday’s appeal hearing, with only counsel, media and court officials allowed.
Families and friends of those killed or wounded in the attacks have been invited to watch proceedings in Christchurch remotely by video with a one-hour delay.
Members of the public are also able to watch the hearing by video link with a one-hour delay at a separate courtroom in Wellington.
Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed by Tarrant inside the Linwood mosque, told Christchurch’s The Press newspaper she had thought “this is the end of it” when Tarrant was sentenced.
“Little did you know that you are allowed to do this six years later. I was not prepared to do this,” she said.
The hearing is being held before three Court of Appeal judges.
In most Court of Appeal hearings the judges reserve their decision to be published at a later date, meaning a verdict is unlikely this week.
After Tarrant’s livestream, Facebook said it removed 1.5 million videos that proliferated within the first 24 hours showing the harrowing viral footage.
Then-prime minister Jacinda Ardern quickly moved to tighten gun laws in the aftermath and put pressure on social media giants to curb online extremism.
In 2021, Tarrant’s former lawyer, Tony Ellis, said his client had believed “the simplest way out was to plead guilty”, arguing the plea was made under duress.
The names of Tarrant’s current lawyers have been suppressed by the court.</p><small>2026-02-09 04:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971933/spectre-of-joblessness' target='_blank'><strong>Spectre of joblessness</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN’S unemployment crisis is no longer just another demographic concern; it is already restricting growth. So when World Bank president Ajay Banga said that employment creation will remain a “binding constraint on growth” over the long term, he meant that, instead of being a problem to be dealt with later, the lack of jobs will limit how fast the economy can grow.
His warning that the country must create some 30m jobs over the next decade shows the scale of the challenge. In fact, current growth patterns are moving in the opposite direction as the data shows. The average annual GDP growth of just 1.7pc between 2022 and 2025, combined with high inflation, has eroded real incomes and weakened labour demand. Agriculture, manufacturing, construction and wholesale and retail trade that traditionally absorb the bulk of the workforce and together employ more than three-quarters of workers have experienced a decline. Manufacturing, construction, and trade have all contracted, shrinking the economy’s ability to produce jobs when millions of young people are entering the labour market each year.
The consequences are visible. The latest Labour Force Survey shows that our unemployment rate has risen to 7.1pc in FY25, the highest level in 21 years. Other estimates present an even bleaker picture. The Population and Housing Census 2023 puts the unemployment rate at 22pc, which means the youth find no space to work and prefer to leave the country if they find an opportunity.

 

Variations in the estimated extent of the problem apart, the underlying trend is unmistakable: job creation lags far behind workers’ expansion. With the labour force growing by roughly 3pc annually, sustained growth of at least 5pc or higher is necessary to prevent further deterioration in labour market conditions. This mismatch between growing labour supply and shrinking labour demand explains why employment has become, as Mr Banga described, Pakistan’s “North Star” policy challenge.
Without rapid job expansion, the demographic dividend risks turning into a liability, as seen in outward migration and social stress. The record outflow of skilled professionals going abroad in a single year signals that the employment problem is not limited to low-skilled workers; it is affecting highly trained human capital as well.

 

Equally troubling is the interaction between weak employment growth and declining real incomes. Cumulative inflation in recent years has outpaced income gains, resulting in a fall in real per capita household income and a rise in poverty risks. At the same time, inequality trends suggest that whatever limited growth has occurred has been unevenly distributed. When growth is both slow and unequal, the labour market becomes the primary channel through which economic stress is transmitted across society.

Though newspapers across the United States have been facing brutal industry headwinds, Lewis’s management of the outlet was sharply criticised by subscribers and employees alike during his two-year tenure as he tried to reverse financial losses at the daily.
Lewis, who is English, has been replaced by Jeff D’Onofrio, a former CEO of social media platform Tumblr who had joined the Post as chief financial officer last year, the paper announced.
In an email to staff shared on social media by one of the newspaper’s reporters, Lewis said it was “the right time for me to step aside.” A statement from the Post said only that D’Onofrio was succeeding Lewis “effective immediately”. Hundreds of Post journalists — including most of its overseas, local and sports staff — were let go in the sweeping cuts announced on Wednesday.
The Post did not disclose the number of jobs being eliminated, but The New York Times reported approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off. The paper’s entire Middle East roster was let go as was its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent as the war with Russia grinds on.
Sports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported. Hundreds turned out Thursday at a protest in front of the paper’s headquarters in downtown Washington.
Newspapers across the country have cratered under falling revenues and subscriptions as they compete for eyeballs with social media, and as internet revenue pales in comparison to what print advertising once commanded.
However, national papers like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have managed to weather the storm and come out financially solid — something the Post, even with a billionaire backer, has failed to do.
In Lewis’s note to staff, shared on X by White House bureau chief Matt Viser, Lewis said “difficult decisions have been taken” during his tenure “in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news.”

“She has been sentenced to six years in prison for gathering and collusion to commit crimes,” lawyer Mostafa Nili said, adding that she had also received a two-year ban on leaving the country. Mohammadi was also handed a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for propaganda activities and is to be exiled for two years to the city of Khosf in the eastern province of South Khorasan, the lawyer stated. Under Iranian law, jail sentences run concurrently.
Nili expressed hope that due to Mohammadi’s health issues, she could be temporarily “released on bail to receive treatment”. He added that the verdict issued was not final and could be appealed.
Over the past quarter-century, Mohammadi, 53, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her vocal campaigning against Iran’s use of capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women.
Mohammadi has spent much of the past decade behind bars and has not seen her twin children, who live in Paris, since 2015. In December 2024, she was released on medical grounds, initially for three weeks, due to “her physical condition after the removal of a tumour and a bone graft”, according to her lawyer. However, she spent much of last year outside of custody, continuing to make statements in spite of her lawyers’ fears she could be sent back to prison. On Dec 12, Mohammadi was held in Mashhad with other activists after speaking at a ceremony honouring a lawyer who had been found dead.

Anutin set the stage for the snap election in mid-December during a border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, a move political analysts said appeared to be timed by the conservative leader to cash in on surging nationalism.
It is a gamble that paid off for a prime minister, who — having taken over after premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the populist Pheu Thai Party was ousted over the Cambodian crisis — then dissolved parliament less than 100 days later.

Reformist party leader concedes defeat

“Bhumjaithai’s victory today is a victory for all Thais, whether you voted for Bhumjaithai Party or not,” Anutin told a press briefing. “We have to do the utmost to serve the Thai people to our full ability.” With more than 90pc of polling stations reporting, preliminary results released by the election commission showed the Bhumjaithai Party with a sizeable lead over the progressive People’s Party in second place, followed by the once-dominant Pheu Thai Party.
People’s Party concedes defeat
The leader of Thailand’s reformist People’s Party, one of three main contenders, conceded defeat in the country’s general election on Sunday. “We acknowledge that we did not come first,” Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut told reporters at his party headquarters in Bangkok.
“We stand by our principle of respecting the party that finishes first and its right to form the government.”
Power to govern
When Anutin dissolved parliament in December, he cited dysfunction and infighting between rival parties as making it impossible to lead a minority government.
While the Bhumjaithai Party was unlikely to win a majority outright, the results suggest it is in a strong position to push through campaign pledges, said Napon Jatusripitak, a political scientist at the Bangkok-based Thailand Future think-tank. Those include implementing a consumer subsidy programme and ditching an agreement with Cambodia over maritime claims.
“For the first time in a long time, we will likely have a government that has sufficient effective power to govern,” he said. “We are seeing what I would describe as a marriage of convenience between technocrats, conservative elites, and traditional politicians.” Critical to Anutin’s success were his embrace of nationalism and Bhumjaithai’s strategy of winning over politicians from rival parties in rural areas, analysts said.
“The scale of its victory was unanticipated, perhaps demonstrating that the more nationalist political environment and its ability to consolidate the conservative electorate all worked in its favour,” said Mathis Lohatepanont, an independent political analyst.
Opinion polls
With a message of structural change and reforms to Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, the People’s Party had led most opinion polls during the campaign season. But in a survey conducted during the campaign’s final week and released on Sunday, the National Institute for Development Administration projected that Bhumjaithai would be the winner with between 140 and 150 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, ahead of 125-135 for the People’s Party.
The progressive party’s earlier support for Anutin as prime minister was likely a severe miscalculation, undermining its own ideological purity and allowing Bhumjaithai to attain the benefits of incumbency, Mathis said.
Natthaphong said he did not see the election as the result of any mistakes by his party, but instead highlighted that its opponents had not been complacent. “I’m not blaming any factors. Our responsibility now has to be to focus on the grassroots,” he said. “We’ve done a lot already but haven’t been able to crack what they have. It wasn’t good enough.”
Constitutional referendum
Thai voters were also asked during the vote to decide if a new constitution should replace a 2017 military-backed charter that critics say concentrated power in undemocratic institutions, including a powerful senate that is chosen through an indirect selection process with limited public participation.
The election commission’s early count showed voters backing the referendum by a margin of nearly two to one. Thailand has had 20 constitutions since the end of its absolute monarchy in 1932, with most of the changes coming in the wake of military coups. The new government and lawmakers can start the amendment process in parliament with two more referendums required to adopt a new constitution.

Following up on the World Bank president’s visit to Pakistan last week, both sides reviewed progress under the country partnership framework (CPF) and discussed the way forward to further strengthen development cooperation. The discussions covered priority sectors including energy, education, health, climate resilience, debt-for-development swaps, fiscal reforms and infrastructure development.
Emphasis was placed on adopting a more focused approach, introducing clear performance trackers and ensuring robust implementation mechanisms to translate commitments into tangible outcomes.
Ms Bjerde reaffirmed the World Bank’s strong commitment to Pakistan’s 10-year development programme amounting to $20 billion, underscoring the Bank’s continued support for Pakistan’s reform and development agenda. She highlighted the importance of sustained engagement and effective execution to maximise the programme’s developmental impact.
Pakistan, KSA discuss investment
Mr Aurangzeb and Saudi Economy and Planning Minister Faisal bin Fadhil Alibrahim on Sunday discussed investments and tech talent collaboration on the sidelines of the conference.







According to another statement, the two sides reviewed follow-ups on matters relating to Saudi investments in Pakistan and broader bilateral economic cooperation. The Saudi minister highlighted the high-quality artificial intelligence and technology talent being produced by Pakistan, noting that it ranks among the top one or two globally. He said Saudi Arabia was keen to leverage Pakistani tech talent to support the Kingdom’s technological transformation.
In this context, he referred to US businessman and former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, who has also acknowledged the strength and potential of Pakistani technology professionals.
Mr Aurangzeb said Pakistan was planning to create a structured pipeline of skilled human resources for key international markets, including Saudi Arabia, to generate economic impact for both sides. The Saudi minister also noted progress on the Gulf Cooperation Council free trade agreement and emphasised prioritising increased trade and exchanges with Pakistan.

The report said 47 members (14pc) were absent for the entire session.
Among cabinet members from the National Assembly, only one federal minister — Khalid Hussain Magsi of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) — attended all sittings, while seven ministers did not attend any.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not attend any sitting. Other prominent figures who missed all sittings included former PM Nawaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
The federal ministers who did not attend a single sitting were Ahsan Iqbal, Abdul Aleem Khan, Syed Mustafa Kamal, Awais Leghari, Amir Muqam, Aurangzeb Khichi and Muhammad Moeen. Chaudhry Salik Hussain, Chaudhry Tanvir Hussain and Raza Hayat Hiraj atten­ded one of the seven sittings.
The report also noted that PM Shehbaz’s son Hamza Shehbaz, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani’s son Ali Musa Gilani, PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain’s nephew Hussain Elahi, and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s wife Musarrat Khawaja missed all sittings. JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman attended one sitting, while PPP leader Aseefa Bhutto attended three and missed four.
Leader of the Opposition Mehmood Khan Achakzai attended all four sittings after his appointment on Jan 16, and two of the three sittings held before it.
The sixth sitting recorded the highest attendance, with 222 MNAs (67pc of the current membership) present. The third sitting had the lowest attendance, with 135 MNAs (41pc) in the House.
On the day of the highest attendance, the House observed a private members’ day and passed the Elections (Amen­dment) Bill, 2025, and the Corporate Social Responsibility Bill, 2025.
The elections bill sought to limit public disclosure of legislators’ assets and liabilities, citing security and privacy concerns. The CSR bill laid down guidelines for corporate social responsibility expenditure by for-profit companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. During the sitting with the lowest attendance, eight government bills were introduced and two ordinances were laid.
Committee powers
Meanwhile, Fafen urged parliament to strengthen the committee system by operationalising Article 66 of the Constitution. through legislation that provides enforceable oversight powers.
Fafen said the lack of enabling legislation under Article 66(3) had left committee powers largely “symbolic”, weakening scrutiny of the executive. It also cited concerns raised in International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessments regarding weak enforcement of oversight mechanisms, executive dominance and limited transparency.

It involves multiple stages within the provincial Board of Revenue (BoR) department before a grower is able to lay their hands on their land’s record. Since most landholdings are owned by small and medium-sized farmers, speedy access to their land records remains cumbersome for many in Sindh.
Though Sindh’s revenue records were scanned over the past decade, procedures for mortgaging farmland, accessing passbooks, issuing sales certificates for land, and obtaining farm credit remained unchanged. This procedure still primarily revolves around the Tapedar (land record keeper) and the Mukhtiarkar (officer handling land disputes and mutation). For many growers, access to agricultural credit from banks was affected by this process, which needs simplification.
Although People’s Service Centres (PSCs) were established in Sindh soon after the formation of the PPP government in 2008, the services mentioned above were not handled at these centres. They, instead, dealt with the provision of a computerised copy of form-VII, a principal document for agricultural land, form-II for urban land, and mutation of urban property records through sub-registrars.
After the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December 2007, revenue records were lost in arson attacks that occurred in many districts at the time. This necessitated the scanning and storage of all records, as well as the entry of new records, in the Board of Revenue (BoR) data bank under the Provincial Record Cell (PRC). This automation project was termed the Land Administration and Revenue Management Information System (LARMIS).

A farmer is considered lucky if he is able to meet all formalities in one go; otherwise, multiple institutional visits, loss of time, and financial costs to attain land documents are his fate

The Sindh High Court had also intervened in the matter, considering the importance of land revenue records to ensure elimination of tampering, interpolation and forgery in official paperwork; an otherwise common phenomenon. This set the tone for the automation process.
Later, BoR linked PRC to LARMIS while introducing e-stamps to eliminate the use of fake stamps — an infamous practice. This would result in a financial loss to the government’s kitty. Past and present revenue officials claim that the introduction of e-stamps has helped control the use of fake stamps and tampering, and has also contributed to revenue generation.
Sub-registrars sit in PSCs to handle mutations in the registries of urban property and to issue computer-generated copies of forms. According to District Manager PSC of Hyderabad, Ghulam Ali, land deeds/registries have been linked with Nadra and the Federal Board of Revenue for biometric verification and property valuation, respectively. “Human intervention has been reduced through this procedure. Pictures of sellers and buyers, as well as the inspector of the sub-registrar’s office, are taken to make sure who is dealing with every single property,” he informed.
However, by and large, PSCs have not served the farming community. According to farmers, PSCs don’t deliver services under one roof. Transfer, sale, and purchase of farmlands, as well as mortgaging and loan assistance procedures, are still manually processed.

 

Farmers must still visit post offices to get passbooks. They must approach the Tapedar, Mukhtiarkar, and assistant commissioner at the taluka level before they can obtain the necessary BoR land documents. A farmer is considered lucky if he can meet all formalities in one go; otherwise, multiple visits, wasted time, and financial costs are his fate. Farmers have to chase revenue officials across different offices to get petty issues related to their property resolved if they intend to buy/sell land, or mortgage property to obtain farm credit.
“Sindh as a province doesn’t have a proportional share in the disbursement of farm credit. Difficulties in getting BoR land documents when they are needed the most are the primary reason why we fail to get a loan,” said Mahmood Nawaz Shah, President of Sindh Abadgar Board. He explained this affects the cash flow, and farmers remain unable to use inputs as required for any major cash crop,” he contended.
“Things are much better in Punjab. There, farmers can easily access farm credit because the entire bank documentation process can be completed under one roof, and the bank handles their documentation directly to extend loans quickly. But in Sindh, we face the decades-old cumbersome processes,” he said.
Punjab established its Punjab Land Records Authority (PLRA) in 2017; this is not the case in Sindh. The Director General-led PLRA is a body that operates within the Punjab BoR. “No manual dealings of records are done by BoR staff any longer. Services centres are established at the tehsil level here, where computerised land record management for farmers is done,” said the deputy director of one such service centre in a Punjab district.
According to Khalid Mehmood Khokhar, President of the Pakistan Kissan Ittehad, the entire record has not only been computerised, but it also provided at the tehsil level. “We face a problem of a different nature — the menace of illegal gratification,” he said.
The Sindh government initially partnered with the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) to automate and computerise revenue records. It has established its own body, Sindh Information Technology Company (SITC), headed by Zainul Abiden Shah as of late.
A Sindh BoR official involved in the automation process noted that a pilot project approved by the Sindh cabinet is underway in two districts. The project, in collaboration with the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Sukkur, is being executed in three dehs — two in Matiari and one in the Sukkur district. Officials hope it will be completed in the next couple of months, and then replicated in other parts of the province to simplify overall land management.
“The pilot project will enable BoR to see what kind of issues are emerging during the trial, which will be accordingly fixed to make the system safe and sound. We plan to redesign the dynamics of revenue record automation and issue passwords to each farmer for land records to access them,” he said.
Sindh has around 6,090 dehs of 138 talukas in 30 districts. The problem of non-existent infrastructure at the taluka level was a major impediment for the government. Learnings in this pilot project would help the government tackle the problems efficiently.

ISLAMABAD: Amid a decline in the revenue-to-GDP ratio despite purported reforms, the four provinces reached close to meeting their IMF-dictated annual target of delivering a cash surplus to the Centre within the first half of the current fiscal year.
The official fiscal operations data released by the Ministry of Finance for July-December 2025 suggest the four provinces returned Rs1.18 trillion in cash to the Centre, just Rs285 billion short of the Rs1.464tr target set for the whole under the IMF’s $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
During the same period last year, the provinces had jointly produced over 50 lower surpluses worth Rs775bn against the budgeted target of Rs1.2tr.
With its larger fiscal muscle, Punjab led the provinces by providing Rs609bn budget surplus in six months, followed by Sindh’s Rs354bn. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s PTI government was not to be left behind as it extended Rs175bn surplus, while Balochistan also came up with Rs41bn bounty to the Centre.
This helped the federal government in containing fiscal balance in Rs542bn surplus when compared to Rs1.5tr deficit of last year — a turnaround of almost four times.
The six-monthly fiscal surplus came in at 0.4pc of GDP in the current year when compared to a deficit of 1.3pc of GDP last year. Despite this improvement, primary balance — the gap between total revenues and expenditures excluding interest payments — stood at 3.2pc of GDP when compared to 3.1pc of GDP last year, showing little improvement in government expenses despite the so-called rightsizing and administrative reforms.
Except for Balochistan, all three provinces appeared to be in competition and put in extra effort to create fiscal surpluses, given their healthy shares or were hampered by their institutional capacity to spend on their people. The Punjab government spared Rs610bn for the Centre this year, almost 83pc greater than Rs333bn of last year. Sindh provided Rs354bn this year against Rs264bn of last year, up 34pc.
Despite being an opposition administration, KP more than doubled (up 103pc) its budget surplus to Rs175bn this year when compared to its Rs86bn of the first half of last year. Balochistan had extended a surplus of Rs92bn to the Centre in the first six months of the fiscal year last year, but more than halved to Rs41bn in the current year.
On the other hand, the country’s revenue-to-GDP ratio dropped to 8.2pc in the first six months this year when compared to 8.5pc of the same period last year despite additional measures and so-called reforms.
The decline here was on both fronts, ie tax and non-tax. The data showed the tax-to-GDP ratio falling from 5.3pc in July-December of last year to 5.2pc this year. Non-tax revenue to GDP ratio also dropped from 3.2pc last year to 3.1pc this year, despite a 50pc increase in petroleum development alone to Rs823bn.
The Ministry of Finance data suggested the Centre’s own total revenue collection also dropped to 4.8pc of GDP from 4.9pc last year. This was mainly because of a decline in direct taxes to 2.3pc of GDP in the current fiscal, down from 2.4pc last year.
While the share of customs and excise duties remained unchanged at 0.5pc and 0.3pc of GDP, the general sales tax collection also fell to 1.6pc of GDP from 1.7pc last year. Provincial collection also remained static at 0.4pc of GDP.
On the expenditure front, total expenditure dropped to 7.8pc of GDP in the first half of the current year from 9.9pc of GDP last year, chiefly because of lower interest costs following the State Bank’s policy rate cut by half to 11pc from a historic 22pc a year earlier. Of this, current expenditure was down to 7.4pc of GDP as of Dec 31 this year when compared to 8.8pc last year.
The Ministry of Finance reported that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected Rs6.161tr during the first half of the current fiscal year, an increase of Rs536bn compared to the amount collected in the corresponding period of last year, a growth of 10pc.
Non-tax revenue was reported at Rs3.799tr, which included Rs2.428tr profit received from the State Bank of Pakistan. Petroleum development levy collection stood at Rs823bn, an increase of 50pc compared to the corresponding period of last year.
Provincial tax collection showed a robust 28pc growth to Rs569bn, an increase of Rs126bn compared to the corresponding period of the last fiscal. Provincial non-tax revenue was Rs155bn, showing an increase of Rs12bn compared to the corresponding period of the previous year, a growth of 8pc.

Pakistan is a beneficiary of EU GSP+, which grants duty-free access for two-thirds of Pakistani exports. This has been a lifeline for Pakistan’s textile and apparel industries, leather goods manufacturers, and agricultural exporters, earning up to $9 billion during FY25, with textiles contributing about $7bn.
For an economy persistently short of foreign exchange, coupled with escalating foreign and domestic debts, exports to the EU are considered imperative. Unfortunately, exporters, barring a few large ones, continue to have tunnel vision and remain mini-retail exporters. In real time, Pakistan has not taken maximum advantage of GSP+.
Since 2014, Pakistan has enjoyed its EU GSP+ status, but the state has also grown complacent that its exports to the EU will be given preferential access forever. The government went an extra mile to project implementation of the 27 Conventions and pledged to implement any new EU-mandated conditionalities for the next GSP+. Meanwhile, the annual EU monitoring missions to Pakistan continue to urge the nation to do more before the current status ends on December 31, 2027.

The cautionary signal is that GSP+ is only a short- or medium-term booster, not a complete panacea for Pakistan’s alarming economic situation

The EU-India FTA, especially, brought the sky down on Pakistan’s textile exporters. The industry already bears a heavy load of expensive electricity and gas rates, enduring power and gas loadshedding, an uncomfortable bank markup rate, excessive taxation, perennially low productivity of workers, minimal economies of scale, and a threatening law and order situation; the chips are stacked up against them, and now this FTA is a loaded dice.
Decision-makers in Islamabad have yet to come out of their cocoon, while the industry has sounded the death knell (although a dirge is frequently sung by industry leaders). The usual ‘appeal’ advertisements in living colour are placed in leading newspapers but are now structured to portray more pictures of policymakers with every new appeal; as always, the industry leaders are assured of full assistance and support.
Fantastic announcements emerge from Islamabad to soothe the exporters: “export-led growth”, “export emergency”, and “exporters are ambassadors” routinely emanate from the capital, but then there are no visible signs of implementation.
About 130 years ago, American Editor Charles Dudley Warner, in his editorial, wrote, “Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody does anything about it”. This is the stark truth when it comes to Pakistan’s export potential. Therefore, actual exporters and the government must maintain optimism and ensure that the EU GSP+ boat does not leave the shores without them being on board.
The cautionary signal is that GSP+ is only a short- or medium-term booster, not a complete panacea for Pakistan’s alarming economic situation. The real remedy is a mix of factors, including diversifying products, tapping new markets, a sense of urgency, and having government and stakeholders on the same page.
Uncertainty in the global marketplace persists, as evidenced by mounting tensions, strategic realignments, and legal challenges. There will be heightened volatility and aggressive developments in global trade, as exporters cope with the challenges of tariff recalibration and realignment of economic pacts. No wonder the EU-India FTA is being touted as the “mother of all deals”.
Our options are limited; factors that should be discussed in Islamabad — as well as the many chambers and trade associations — include addressing utility rates, focusing on economic diplomacy, the ramifications of climate change, green skills development, green vocational training, and improved efficiency and productivity.
Whether Pakistan is at an advantageous position to undertake progressive transformation or whether the apathetic, nonchalant, parochial, bureaucratic mindset and easy-going attitude would again put a spanner in achieving export-led growth must be the top priority; Pakistani exporters would lose out on prospects to make their mark in the global marketplace.
The overarching point is whether exporters would continue at the same snail speed to enhance exports, despite assiduously complying with the GSP+ Conventions and conditionalities or whether they want to scale to new heights. Will they be able to compete with India or other regional nations in increasing their market share and even protecting from nations encroaching on whatever share they hold is the focal concern.
If they are unable to do so, then Pakistan may just forget about renewing its GSP+ status after 2027, take it easy on compliance, divert attention to China or the African market, or just endeavour to survive by quoting low prices for their products. The clouds are dark, and the signs on the horizon are ominous.

NEW DELHI: Indian farmers on Monday slammed a new US trade deal as “a surrender to multinational agricultural giants”, calling for the commerce minister’s resignation as Congress accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of capitulating to US President Donald Trump over the “Epstein files” release.
Congress leaders claimed an Indian minister, a businessman and individuals close to the prime minister were mentioned in the files, along with Modi.

 

According to a report in The Hindu, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) demanded Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s immediate resignation as soon as he explained the details of the bilateral pact.
Leaders of the union representing apple and cotton growers said any relaxation on the import of cotton would be disastrous for the economies of Jammu and Kashmir, Him­­­­achal Pradesh, Mah­ar­ashtra and Gujarat.
Talking to reporters at a press conference on Saturday, SKM leaders called the framework for the interim agreement on bilateral trade a “total surrender” to America’s agriculture sector.
They cited the inclusion of dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits in the joint statement.
The leaders warned that the animal feed market would be completely monopolised by US companies.
SKM leaders urged farmers across the country to join protest demonstrations on Feb 12 and to support a general strike of workers as a “befitting reply to the anti-people Modi government”.
The leaders said Goyal’s claim that the agriculture and dairy sectors were excluded from the agreement was incorrect.
“Dairy products are part of the FTAs signed with the UK, New Zealand and European Union and the fresh revelations have undoubtedly proved the Commerce Minister is consciously propagating falsehood and betraying the farmers and the entire people,” the SKM statement said.
“SKM considers the role of Commerce Minister as a traitor and demands his immediate resignation.”
The organisation demanded that Prime Minister Modi desist from signing the India-US Free Trade Agreement or face “massive pan-India united mass struggles”.
Farmers’ leaders highlighted tariff disparities, noting that US tariffs on Indian goods rose from zero in 2023-24 to 18pc, while Indian tariff rates on US agriculture products dropped from between 30pc and 150pc to zero. They said this would make Indian agriculture hang by the noose of US MNCs.
The SKM also questioned Goyal’s position that the animal husbandry sector had requested imported feed. The group said poultry groups were the ones demanding feed based on maize and soybean to reduce minimum support prices for domestic crops.
“We have heard that the animal feed in US may contain non-vegetarian items too. Why does the government want our cows to eat non-vegetarian food?” asked Rakesh Tikait, a prominent SKM leader.
The statement also targeted the ruling party’s ideological parent organisation.
“The RSS had been claiming no import of milk of animals fed with meat. That was a non-tariff barrier,” the statement said. “Now, the RSS has been made to eat its own claim by ‘Master’ Donald Trump and they have cowed down completely.”
M.Y. Tarigami, leader of the Apple Farmers Federation of India and a Jammu and Kashmir lawmaker, said the trade deal would devastate regional economies.
“We have been facing problems in apple cultivation due to lack of marketing facilities and climatic challenges,” Tarigami said. “Farmers in both the states are already in distress. This announcement will be a huge setback for apple and tree nut growers.”
“In a state like Jammu and Kashmir, where there are no other economic avenues such as industry, the only source of income was cultivation of apples and dry fruits,” Tarigami added. “The Union government does not care about farmers here and is working for their masters in the United States.”
Protesting against the government’s lack of transparency regarding the deal, the Congress party on Friday displayed a poster reading “Trap Deal” at the main entrance of the Parliament complex.
Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters that President Trump pressured Modi into signing the deal because of the Epstein files.
“The truth is that over the past few days, Narendra Modi has been troubled because matters related to him have come up in the Epstein files. After that, Narendra Modi surrendered before Trump and struck a trade deal,” Kharge said.
“He sacrificed the country’s farmers. Modi is making our people poor and making America’s farmers rich.”

LONDON / PARIS / NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s chief of staff Morgan McSweeney has quit, he said in a statement on Sunday, as pressure intensifies on Starmer over his decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the United States.
Starmer is facing what is widely seen as the biggest crisis of his 18 months in power over his decision to send Mandelson to Washington in 2024, after files showed the extent of Mandelson’s relationship to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The departure of McSweeney, 48, a political strategist who was instrumental in Starmer’s rise to power, is yet another blow to the government.
With polls showing Starmer is hugely unpopular with voters, some in his own party are openly questioning his judgement and his future, and it remains to be seen whether McSweeney’s exit will be enough to silence his critics.
“The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself,” McSweeney said in a statement posted on X by political correspondents.







“When asked, I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice.”
Starmer sacked Mandelson last September over his links to Epstein. Mandelson is now under police investigation for alleged misconduct in office.
The UK foreign ministry said on Sunday it was reviewing an exit payment to Mandelson.
Mandelson received an estimated pay-out of between £38,750 and £55,000 ($52,000 and $74,000) after only seven months in the job as British ambassador to the US, according to a report in the Sunday Times.
Dalai Lama denies ties
The office of the Dalai Lama said on Sunday that he had never met Epstein, after Chinese media reported the Tibetan Buddhist leader’s name was mentioned in a cache of files released by the US government.
An AFP search of the files found the Dalai Lama’s name was mentioned more than 150 times with no mention of him meeting or interacting with Epstein.
“Some recent media reports and social media posts concerning the ‘Epstein files’ are attempting to link His Holiness the Dalai Lama with Jeffrey Epstein,” the leader’s office said in a statement posted on X.







“We can unequivocally confirm that His Holiness has never met Jeffrey Epstein or authorised any meeting or interaction with him by anyone on His Holiness’s behalf,” it added.
Forced to step down as IMA chief
Veteran French politician Jack Lang, a former minister, was forced out of a key cultural post — president of the Arab World Institute (IMA) — on Saturday as pressure grew on him over revelations in the latest release of the Epstein files.
He offered to resign in a letter to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who told reporters he planned to launch the process to name an interim president for the IMA.
But Lang continued to insist he was innocent of any wrongdoing.
Lang, who has headed the IMA since 2013, is the most high-profile public figure in France caught up in the latest release of private messages from the convicted sex offender.
“I offer to submit my resignation” at the next board meeting, the 86-year-old wrote in the letter, seen by AFP.
On Friday, French prosecutors said they had opened a preliminary investigation of Lang and his daughter Caroline over “laundering of aggravated tax-fraud proceeds” after they were mentioned in files related to Epstein.

The country lacks an institutional mechanism to align supply and demand for agricultural commodities — factoring in last year’s crop acreage, domestic needs, global supply conditions, and export prospects — and to guide farmers on crop selection. As a result, at sowing time, farmers largely make decisions based on the prior years’ crop profitability, rather than forward-looking market signals.
This information gap usually produces two outcomes: in some crops, acreage expands excessively, creating a market glut that leads to price crashes and heavy losses for farmers. In others, cultivated area contracts sharply, which fuels imports and ultimately forces consumers to pay higher prices for the crop. The cycle repeats itself almost every year — crops change, but the underlying dysfunction remains intact.
So far, this mismatch of supply and demand has been most pronounced in vegetables, where farmers are often forced to destroy their mature, fruit-bearing crops or divert the produce to livestock feed, particularly during peak harvesting days. While seemingly drastic, these actions represent a logical response to the harsh financial realities farmers face.
In many cases, market prices fall so low that they fail to cover even basic costs such as harvesting labour, packaging, and transportation. In recent years, tomatoes, white radish, squash, onion, turnip, cauliflower, coriander, and spinach have all inflicted heavy losses on growers; this year, cabbage and potatoes have joined the list. Unfortunately, such massive food losses are neither documented nor accounted for in any meaningful analysis.

Destroying mature crops in the face of overproduction or a weak market is a waste of the country’s resources and a clear sign of systemic failure

Until recently, these recurring vegetable losses were considered a localised problem rather than a systemic threat, as most vegetables are grown on small areas with limited production volumes. Potatoes, however, were cultivated on around one million acres this year, making the current crisis a matter of widespread concern.
Given the intensifying competition in global markets, the broader risk is far more serious. Persistently poor crop planning, ineffective government policies, and a weak agricultural advisory system threaten to extend similar overproduction-driven losses to major exportable field crops as well.
Rice offers a worrying early signal. In the first half of FY26, Pakistan’s rice exports have declined by around 50pc, whereas in FY25, the rice area expanded to 9.6m acres — an increase of 7.2pc. The area is set to expand further in the coming season as farmers are switching away from cotton and sesame. Already, the cotton area has decreased by 15pc in FY25, while sesame acreage in Punjab contracted by 37pc (2025 crop). Moreover, the rapid spread of solar-powered tubewells has proved a key catalyst for the unchecked expansion of rice cultivation.
Likewise, if Pakistan’s maize — one of the country’s five major crops — faces export pressures due to shifting global supply conditions or international market dynamics, the domestic market could quickly turn adverse for farmers due to oversupply.
Regrettably, unlike China, India, and several other countries, Pakistan has failed to develop a biofuel industry — bioethanol and biodiesel — that can absorb surplus maize, sugarcane, and other agricultural crops as raw material.

 

All this underscores the urgent need for an institutional mechanism, supported by a full-fledged team of experts and researchers who regularly apply rigorous analytical tools and modelling techniques to assess national demand, worldwide market trends, and export potential for each crop. Such a framework should translate market signals into crop-wise acreage targets and, in turn, advise farmers to increase or reduce cultivated area well ahead of each sowing season.
In addition, the government should use remote sensing, satellite imagery, and artificial intelligence-based models that can estimate acreage with reasonable accuracy within two to three weeks of sowing to monitor the area under newly sown crops so farmers can be warned when cultivation exceeds market-viable clusters. These tools also provide reasonably accurate yield forecasts months in advance, which can enable early government policy responses and timely market interventions. They also allow authorities to proactively identify and pursue export opportunities.
The real question, however, is whether farmers will follow such advisories. Some advocate crop zoning as a solution, but in a democratic country, compelling farmers to plant specific crops amounts to an infringement of economic freedom.
Consider cotton: growers face repeated losses due to the absence of a support price, the imposition of an 18pc sales tax on locally produced cotton, limited access to high-yielding and climate-resilient seed varieties, and sharply rising input costs. Under these conditions, compelling them to return to cotton cultivation cannot be justified unless the government first fixes these distortions and provides an enabling environment for the crop.
One thing, however, is certain: farmers are more likely to heed clear warnings against planting crops facing overproduction or having weak market prospects, as no one knowingly steps into a loss-making venture.
In an increasingly competitive global environment, a business-as-usual approach in the agriculture sector is no longer an option. Pakistan must harness modern technologies to strategically plan crop areas and make the best use of scarce land and water resources. When market gluts force farmers to destroy mature crops or divert produce to livestock feed, these are often dismissed as farmers’ losses, but in reality, they represent a national loss — a waste of the country’s precious natural and financial resources.

“Criminalising the resistance, its weapons, and those who carried it out is something we should not accept,” Khaled Meshal said at a conference in Doha.
“As long as there is occupation, there is resistance. Resistance is a right of peoples under occupation … something nations take pride in,” said Meshal, who previously headed the group.
Hamas has waged an armed struggle against Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. A US-brokered “ceasefire” in Gaza is in its second phase, which foresees demilitarisation of the territory — including the disarmament of Hamas — along with a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces.

Top leader Meshal urges ‘Board of Peace’ to take ‘balanced approach’

Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
Israeli officials claim that Hamas still has around 20,000 fighters and about 60,000 Kalashnikovs in Gaza.
A Palestinian technocratic committee has been set up with a goal of taking over the day-to-day governance in the battered Gaza Strip, but it remains unclear whether, or how, it will address the issue of demilitarisation.
The committee operates under the so-called “Board of Peace”, an initiative launched by US President Donald Trump.
Originally conceived to oversee the Gaza truce and post-war reconstruction, the board’s mandate has since expanded, prompting conce­rns among critics that it could evo­lve into a rival to the United Nations.
Trump unveiled the board at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos last month, where leaders and officials from nearly two dozen countries joined him in signing its founding charter.
Alongside the “Board of Peace”, Trump also created a Gaza Exe­cutive Board — an advisory panel to the Palestinian technocratic committee — comprising international figures including US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as well as controversial former British prime minister Tony Blair.
On Sunday, Meshal urged the “Board of Peace” to adopt what he called a “balanced approach” that would allow for Gaza’s reconstruction and the flow of aid to its roughly 2.2 million residents, while warning that Hamas would “not accept foreign rule” over Palestinian territory.
“We adhere to our national principles and reject the logic of guardianship, external intervention, or the return of a mandate in any form,” Meshal said.
“Palestinians are to govern Pale­s­t­inians. Gaza belongs to the people of Gaza and to Palestine. We will not accept foreign rule,” he added.
Meanwhile, around 180 Pales­tinians left the Gaza Strip since Feb 2 when the Rafah crossing with Egypt was partially reopened, according to officials in the territory.
The Rafah crossing is the only gateway left for Palestinians in Gaza to the outside world that does not pass through Israel.
Between Monday and Thursday, 135 people crossed into Egypt from Gaza through the crossing, mostly patients and their companions, according to Ismail al-Thawabteh, head of the Hamas-run media office in the Palestinian territory. He said the crossing was closed on Friday and Saturday.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society confirmed that 135 residents of Gaza had left through the crossing between Feb 2 and 5. On Sunday, another 44 people, including 19 patients, left the Gaza Strip through the crossing to Egypt, Mohammed Abu Salmiya, director of the territory’s main Al-Shifa Hospital, said.

PM’s Aide Rana Sanaullah speaks during the Asma Jahangir Conference.—X/KenRoth

• PM aide’s contention that ‘innocents may get caught up’ in the wake of action following terror attacks prompts heckling, walkout• Dr Malik, Akhtar Mengal stress need for political, not military-based solutions
LAHORE: At a charged discussion about the situation in Balochistan, PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah ignited controversy when he implied that innocent civilians were bound to get caught up in the fallout of attacks such as the ones witnessed across the province on Jan 31.
The PM’s aide was speaking during a session, titled ‘Is There a Political Will to Solve the Crisis in Balochistan’, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday.
The minister was part of a distinguished panel, which also incl­uded BNP-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal and National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, and was moderated by Mujahid Barelvi.
The controversy reared its head when Mr Sanaullah was responding to points raised by the other speaker regarding the treatment meted out to the people from Balochistan.
Referring to demands such as the abolition of checkpoints from across the province, he said that this could not happen unless terrorism and violence were rooted out.
“If incidents like Jan 31 happen, then security forces will take act­ion, and there is a possibility that some of the people taken into custody could be innocent,” he said.
This prompted a reaction from the audience, and some — like rights activist Sheema Kermani — got up from her seat and began to heckle the minister. He responded by chiding the hecklers, saying that their refusal to listen to him had ‘exposed them’.
Ms Kermani then walked out of the venue, with many people following suit. Speaking to Dawn outside the hall, she said: “Asma Jahangir must be turning in her grave”.
“Asma’s name is a symbol for people’s rights, for resistance, defiance and justice. If in this conference, you give a platform to such people who justify state violence, then we will not sit and hear it… If [Asma] had been here, she herself would have walked out and wouldn’t have let such persons speak.”
‘Political people’
Earlier, in his remarks, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch termed insurgency and enforced disappearances as the two major issues facing the province, which did not seem to have a solution. “Whenever I go to my area, four or five people come [up to me] daily, complaining about a missing person.”
The state and political leadership should find a solution to these issues, he demanded.
“If you deal with Balochistan as a security issue, then conditions would get worse by the day. If you involve political people and parties, then the situation may improve,” he suggested.
“For parties which have roots among the masses, in Balochistan as well as [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa, space is shrinking on a daily basis,” he regretted.
He also regretted how those who got the votes from the people were not allowed to enter parliament, but others were sent there ‘symbolically’.
Dr Baloch, who was also part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, recalled that they had agreed on a number of points, including an end to enforced disappearances.
He called for political reforms and the handover of resources to the province, and stressed the need to protect the 1972 Constitution, the 18th Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award.
‘Military solution to a political issue’
At the outset, BNP-M leader Akhtar Mengal posited that while the Balochistan issue was a political one, successive rulers had tried to solve it through military means, and warned that continued reliance on the coercive approach could lead to further tensions.
Going into history, he recalled the original arrangement between the Khan of Kalat and the Quaid-i-Azam, where it was agreed that most administrative powers would remain with Balochistan. However, he regretted that this and subsequent pacts were not implemented.
He also referred to past periods of conflict, including operations under different governments, the killing of Nawaz Akbar Bugti and the issue of enforced disappearances, which he said had deeply affected many families, including his own.
He also criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined, while expressing concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties.
He also referred to jailed human rights lawyers and activists, Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying that they had been jailed for 17 years over a mere tweet, while those who had harmed the country and looted had not spent a single day behind bars, or were accorded A or B class prison facilities.
Sanaullah’s response
Responding to these grievances, Mr Sanaullah said nothing could be done about the past, as it could not be changed.
“Right now Balochistan had two crises, one is being represented by Akhtar Mengal and Dr Malik, and the other side being Bashir Zaib and his accomplices,” he said, referring to one of the leaders of the banned BLA.
“In my view, both these crises have different solutions and different demands. We are making a mistake by taking them as one.” He also maintained that enforced disappearances and violence in Balochistan started simultaneously, calling it a ‘chicken and egg story’, adding that they would also end together, just as they had started.

LAHORE / ISLAMABAD / PESHAWAR / QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lah­ore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections.
A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported from Quetta.
The PTI, a part of the TTAP, had announced a strike for Sunday to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, which it alleges were marred by rigging.
The party also said it will observe a day of mourning following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives.
In the evening, the TTAP could not hold a torch-bearing rally outside Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque as planned, claiming road closures and the arrest of over two dozen workers.
Despite the alleged arre­sts of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, former senator Mushtaq Ahmed, and other TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhu­nzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site.
Mr Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.”
Mr Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown on party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located.

However, police did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker.
Mixed response
In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest.
A partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed.
PTI workers from across the city gathered at Hash­tnagri Bazaar from where they took out a protest. Upon reaching the historic Chowk Yadgar, the rally’s venue, the procession converted into a public gathering, which was addressed by the PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan and others.
PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”.
Meanwhile, daily life in Karachi and other parts of Sindh remained largely unaffected on Sunday. How­ever, police blocked many roads across the city, especially in the areas leading to the Karachi Press Club and the Election Commission of Pakistan, to thwart any protest by the opposition alliance.
All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday.
He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed.
But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.”
Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district.
In Punjab, markets in Lah­ore exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with rou­tine traffic movement obse­rved. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival, which was in its last day.
The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops.
Meanwhile, most markets in Islamabad and Rawalpindi remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city.
While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar.
Strike in Balochistan
Meanwhile, a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic.
Mobile internet services have been suspended again, a Dawn correspondent reported.
Workers of the PTI and the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, staged demonstrations in some areas of the city.
Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads.
In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far.







Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades.
The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm.
Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held.
PTI hails public ‘response’
In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”.
He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser also congratulated the nation on the “successful” observance of Feb 8 as a “black day”.
Talking to Dawn, he claimed that at a number of places, including Swabi, “powers that be forced people to open their shops and also threatened transporters that strict action will be taken if they do not bring their vehicles on the road”.
On the other hand, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.”

Talking to Dawn, the minister said, “It has been witnessed for the first time that wheel jam strike itself suffered the wheel jam.”
He said people rejected the TTAP’s protest call as they were fed up with the politics of unrest and division in the nation.

Tarar says people fed up with politics of unrest, division; PPP says country needs stability, not chaos

Minister for States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam also asserted that the public rejected the TTAP’s call for a wheel-jammed and shutter-down strike.
Chaos, negativity
Also, PPP Secretary General Muhammad Humaiyun Khan said the strike called by the opposition had completely failed.
“People have rejected the politics of chaos and negativity,” he added.
He said the daily business continued and all business and trade centres remained opened, which was a proof of the fact that people would not support such ill-tactics (of the opposition).
“The country does not require protests but economic stability and welfare of the people,” Mr Khan said.
He added that the PPP would continue to play its positive and democratic role for addressing people’s problems.

The crackdown, launched on the special directives of Inspector General of Police Balochistan Mohammad Tahir Khan also resulted in the safe recovery of six kidnapped persons during operations in Quetta and districts across seven ranges. 
Police recovered a large cache of weapons, including 135 pistols, 19 revolvers, 20 Kalashnikovs, 1,329 rounds of ammunition and 114 magazines. Officials said 148 cases were registered specifically against criminals, leading to the arrest of 147 suspects from whom weapons and ammunition were seized. 
Regarding narcotics enforcement, 204 cases were registered against drug peddlers, resulting in the arrest of 213 individuals.  

Six kidnapped victims, huge cache of illegal firearms recovered; thousands of kilograms of narcotics confiscated

Police recovered huge quantities of narcotics, including over 2,799 kilograms of hashish, 2,442 kilograms of crystal meth, also known as ice, and 1,687 kilograms of opium. Other seizures included 10 kilograms of bhang, 84 grams of heroin, 573 bottles of liquor and 129 cans of beer. 
During the crackdown, police recovered six stolen vehicles, 67 motorcycles, 24 mobile phones and 35 tola of gold. Officials said they also arrested 155 proclaimed offenders and 342 absconders, while detaining 841 suspects involved in various crimes. 
Authorities also seized 165,000 rupees in cash, 4,950 litres of Iranian diesel and 21,376 litres of Iranian petrol. Additionally, 2,010 cartons of Iranian cigarettes and 68 banned and illegal medicines were confiscated. 
Balochistan Police said they remain committed to protecting the lives and property of citizens and are utilising all available resources, with public cooperation, to “prevent crime and ensure a peaceful and secure environment across the province”.

The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion.
After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that.
Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told Dawn that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan.
They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.”
The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source.
They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.”
The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.”







Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings.
Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.







Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said.
The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter.







Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting.
Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials.







The high-level visits come a day after the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup commenced.
The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland.
Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the ICC rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka.
After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.

 

In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.
It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.
“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.
A government source told Dawn at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.
According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.
“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.
Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.
It was reported earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.
Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
Pakistan, who edged out the Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.
Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.</p><small>2026-02-08 21:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649800-pm-shehbaz-expected-to-attend-first-trump-initiated-gaza-board-of-peace-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz expected to attend first Trump‑launched 'Board of Peace' meeting</strong></a><br><p>

Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmed told Dawn that “the militants attacked a police post  and an exchange of fire also took place, but the policemen, deployed at the facility, retaliated, forcing the militants to escape.”
The CCPO added that the situation was “under control”.
No casualties or injuries were reported as a result of the attack; however, the nature of the attack and physical losses are yet to be ascertained.
On November 26, unidentified persons blew up a gas pipeline in Hameed Khan Machine area, some five miles south of the police post in Passani.
Residents said that an explosion had triggered a fire from the pipeline.
A police official said that the pipeline was blown up for the second time. “The same pipeline was blown up two years ago by terrorists,” he added.
On August 15 last year, police and security forces repulsed three midnight militant attacks at as many locations in the jurisdiction of Mattani police station.
Police officials said that militants attacked the Hameed Khan police checkpoint using the latest weaponry from a nearby forest. However, they said that the militants could not hit the police post since they were firing from a distance.
They added that the personnel returned the fire, repulsing the attack. They said that there were no casualties reported.
In a similar attack on Fort Mackson, commonly known as Kishangar post, the militants fired from a distance, which too was repulsed.
The third attack was carried out at the Azakhel Dam post. However, the attack was repulsed when the personnel fired back.</p><small>2026-02-08 19:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649786-karachi-literature-festival-ends-with-healthy-cultural-debates' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Literature Festival ends with healthy cultural debates</strong></a><br><p>

“Lahore is happy today, I am happy, too. The residents of Lahore played a vital role in making this Basant successful by following all the rules and regulations,” she said in a statement, posted on PML-N’s official X account.







Maryam continued: “The idea of safe Basant will also be adopted in other cities.”
Brightly coloured kites soared through the skies over Lahore this weekend, marking the return of a festival after a 19-year ban that had been imposed over safety concerns.
Families and groups of friends gathered on rooftops, in parks and on streets for the three-day kite-flying festival.
“Everyone is excited — all of Punjab, all of Pakistan. It has become hard to find kites and strings because they sold out,” Shahzaib, a kite flyer, told AFP.







Punjab authorities banned the festival in 2007 due to a series of fatal accidents caused by glass powder-coated kite strings and celebratory aerial gunfire.
The exceptionally sharp strings, known as manjha, had badly injured and killed pedestrians and motorcyclists, prompting the crackdown.
But this year, authorities relented, allowing the festival for three days but with ramped-up safety measures in place in a move welcomed by many Lahoris and thousands who travelled to the city from across the country to take part.
“People had lost businesses when the ban happened. After the ban lifted, I sold 20,000 to 25,000 kites,” said Tariq, a kite maker.
Rights groups and cultural activists have long criticised the ban, arguing that poor enforcement rather than the festival itself was to blame for past tragedies.
Some official events planned to take place during the festival were cancelled after a suicide blast at a mosque in Islamabad on Friday killed 36 people.
Police were deployed across the city to enforce safety rules, while hospitals were placed on alert to deal with potential injuries.
Authorities also monitored kite sales — including using QR codes to track kites — and confiscated banned materials, including glass-coated strings.
Motorcycle riders placed protective rods on their bikes to intercept kite strings before they could cut riders.
Kite fighting was the main attraction of the festival, with participants manoeuvring their kites to sever the strings of their opponents’, often drawing cheers from neighbouring rooftops.
Workshops that once lay dormant were operating again to meet demand.
“Buying and flying kites should not be a one-time thing,” said Chand Ustad, 51, string maker.
“Keep buying them, keep flying them, this helps our business as well,” added Ustad.</p><small>2026-02-08 18:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/08225848095e7aa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971881/kamindu-heroics-steer-sri-lanka-past-ireland-in-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Kamindu heroics steer Sri Lanka past Ireland in T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Sri Lanka’s 11th-hour call to draft in Kamindu Mendis proved a masterstroke as the all-rounder produced a match-turning cameo to set up a 20-run win over Ireland in their T20 World Cup opener at Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.
Kamindu’s blistering 44 off 19 balls with four fours and two sixes gave Sri Lanka the late thrust they badly needed to post 163.
The spin trio of Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga and Dunith Wellalage then ran through the Irish middle order, sharing seven wickets to seal a comfortable victory.
“I just wanted to score a few boundaries and put a partnership with Kusal Mendis,” said Kamindu.
“Kusal was outstanding today. He deserves a lot of credit. We wanted someone to bat through the innings.
“They played well during the run chase until the 15th over. We had to keep our calm and we knew they had to take risks and we bowled well towards the end.” Hasaranga claimed three wickets to take his World Cup tally to 40, second only to Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan, who has 50.
There were anxious moments when the leg-spinner, who has a history with hamstring injuries, limped off after his second over.
Though he returned to complete his quota, he moved gingerly, raising questions over his fitness for the rest of the campaign.
Sri Lanka’s innings had been stuck in first gear until Kamindu strode in with the scoreboard reading 86 for four in the 14th over, boundaries having dried up against Ireland’s spinners.
The left-hander broke a 57-ball boundary drought with a cheeky reverse sweep and then went into overdrive, plundering 21 runs in the 17th over to wrestle back the momentum.
With Kusal Mendis playing the sheet anchor role in an unbeaten half-century, Sri Lanka found a competitive total from what had looked like a below-par platform.
Ireland were marshalled by left-arm spinner George Dockrell, who returned a miserly spell of 2-17.
A 49-run stand between Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector for the third wicket kept Ireland in the hunt.
From a promising 105 for two, Ireland lost their way and folded for 143 in 19.5 overs with Matheesha Pathirana cleaning up with two wickets in the final over.
“They got 15 runs too many,” said Ireland captain Paul Sterling.
“Bit sloppy in the field and we have plenty of work to do before the next game.
“We were confident with plenty of wickets in hand, but Sri Lanka held their nerve.
“Spin is a challenge for us. It wasn’t coming onto the bat as much as we expected. Spin, I believe, is going to play a big role in this tournament.”

The conservative Takaichi, Japan’s first female leader who says she is inspired by Britain’s “Iron Lady” Margaret Thatcher, was projected to deliver as many as 328 of the 465 seats in parliament’s lower house for her Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
The LDP alone sailed past the 233 seats needed for a majority less than two hours after polls closed, on track for one of its best-ever election results.
With her coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, Takaichi now has a supermajority of two-thirds of seats, easing her legislative agenda as she can override the upper chamber, which she does not control.



Winter election brings blizzard of votes
“This election involved major policy shifts — particularly a major shift in economic and fiscal policy, as well as strengthening security policy,” Takaichi said in a television interview as the results rolled in.
“These are policies that have drawn a great deal of opposition … If we have received the public’s support, then we truly must tackle these issues with all our strength.”

Takaichi, 64, called the rare winter snap election to capitalise on her buoyant personal approval ratings since she was elevated to lead the long-ruling LDP late last year.
Voters have been drawn to her straight-talking, hardworking image, but her nationalistic leanings and emphasis on security have strained ties with Japan’s powerful neighbour China, while her promises of tax cuts have rattled financial markets.
Residents trudged through snow to cast their ballots, with record snowfall in some parts snarling traffic and requiring some polling stations to close early. It was only the third post-war election held in February, with elections typically called during milder months.

 

Outside a polling station in the town of Uonuma in the mountainous Niigata prefecture, 54-year-old teacher Kazushige Cho braved below-freezing temperatures and deep snow to cast his vote for Takaichi’s LDP.
“It feels like she’s creating a sense of direction — like the whole country is pulling together and moving forward,” Cho said.
But Takaichi’s election promise to suspend an 8 per cent sales tax on food to help households cope with rising prices has rattled investors concerned about how the nation with the heaviest debt burden among advanced economies will fund the plan.
Takaichi said on Sunday she would speed up consideration of the sales tax cut while focusing on fiscal sustainability.
“Her plans for the cut in the consumption tax leave open big question marks about funding and how she’s going to go about making the arithmetic add up,” said Chris Scicluna, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe in London.
Backed by Trump, bashed by China
The head of Japan’s top business lobby Keidanren, Yoshinobu Tsutsui, welcomed Takaichi’s win as restoring political stability. “Japan’s economy is now at a critical juncture for achieving sustainable and strong growth,” he said.
The LDP, which has ruled for almost all of Japan’s postwar history, had lost control of both houses in elections over the past 15 months under Takaichi’s predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba.
Takaichi has managed to turn around the party’s fortunes by striking a chord with younger voters.
She has even sparked a “sanakatsu” craze, roughly translated as “Sanae-mania”. Her handbag and the pink pen she scribbles notes with in parliament have been in high demand.
US President Donald Trump last week gave Takaichi his “total endorsement” and said he would host her at the White House next month.
China will also be parsing the result.

 

Weeks after taking office, Takaichi touched off the biggest dispute with Beijing in over a decade by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, the democratic island claimed by China.
China responded with several countermeasures, including urging its citizens not to travel to Japan.
Taiwan President Lai Ching-te was one of the first foreign leaders to congratulate Takaichi, saying he hoped her victory would “bring a more prosperous and secure future for Japan and its partners in the region”.
Takaichi’s strong mandate could accelerate her plans to bolster Japan’s defences, further angering Beijing, which has cast her as attempting to revive its militaristic past.

 

Japan’s Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi told TV stations on Sunday evening that he wanted to push ahead with policies to strengthen Japan’s defence while pursuing dialogue with China.
“Beijing will not welcome Takaichi’s victory,” said David Boling, principal at the Asia Group, a firm that advises companies on geopolitical risk.
“China now faces the reality that she is firmly in place — and that its efforts to isolate her completely failed.”</p><small>2026-02-08 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/08211712c82c20d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971877/policeman-martyred-in-south-waziristan-firing-incident-father-brother-injured' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman martyred in South Waziristan firing incident; father, brother injured</strong></a><br><p>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A policeman was shot dead, while two of his family members were injured on Sunday after unidentified armed men opened fire on them in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan district, officials said.
According to the police, the incident took place in the Boya area of Upper South Waziristan. The policeman, identified as Constable Zahidullah Wazir, was martyred on the spot, while his father, Ghulam Nabi, and brother, Waheed, sustained serious injuries. All three belonged to the Shakai tehsil of Upper South Waziristan District.
“The martyred police constable was the brother of Muhammad Jan Wazir, a political moharrir of the district administration, Lower South Wazirista,” Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Wana Circle, Asghar Ali Shah, told Dawn.
“The condition of the injured persons is critical; however, they are being provided immediate medical treatment.”
Following the incident, the unidentified assailants managed to flee the scene. Police rushed to the area soon after receiving information, cordoned off the locality, and collected evidence, they said.
The injured persons and the body of the martyred police constable were taken to the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) Wana, where medical treatment of the injured was underway.
DSP Shah added that the police have formally initiated an investigation to determine the nature and motives of the attack.
He clarified that the family of political Moharrir Wazir had “no personal enmity with anyone, and initial evidence suggested that the incident was an act of terrorism.”
Over the past year, the law and order situation in Lower and Upper South Waziristan as well as North Waziristan, has remained highly volatile, causing serious concern among local tribes.
Tribal elders have stated that frequent incidents have created fear and insecurity among the population.
According to police reports, incidents of bomb blasts, targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom, killings of civilians, and attacks on police and security forces’ check posts have intensified in the three tribal districts of KP, posing serious threats to overall peace and stability in the region.
The situation gradually worsened since November 2022, when the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government and vowed to target security personnel, police and personnel of law enforcement agencies.</p><small>2026-02-08 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/082146215be92f1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971863/islamabad-lahore-remain-open-despite-ttaps-strike-call-over-2024-rigging-quetta-shuts-shops' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad, Lahore remain open despite TTAP’s strike call over 2024 ‘rigging’; Quetta shuts shops</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE/ISLAMABAD/PESHAWAR/QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lahore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections.
The PTI — a part of the TTAP — had announced a strike today to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024 general elections, which it alleges were marred by rigging. The party also said it will observe a day of mourning following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives.
A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported in Quetta. In Lahore, all major markets remained closed, primarily due to Sunday and the ongoing Basant festival.
In the evening, the TTAP could not hold a torch-bearing rally outside Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque as planned, claiming road closures and the arrest of over two dozen workers.
Despite the alleged arrests of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmed, as well as TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhunzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site.
Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown against the party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located.
However, police sources did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker.
Speaking to the media, Abbas criticised the Punjab government for “supporting Basant and dance parties” in the wake of the Islamabad imambargah attack. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had cancelled her Basant-related activities following the incident.
“The law enforcement agencies failed badly to provide security to the masses, and that is why such a huge number of people lost their lives,” Abbas added.







Meanwhile, Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.”
He asserted that the movement will soon gain further momentum and stated that the whole nation was worried about PTI founder Imran Khan’s health.
In his remarks, Ahmed termed Pakistan’s possible participation in the upcoming meeting of the United States-led Board of Peace as “unfortunate”.
Yousafzai claimed that the shutter-down strike was successful in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and interior Sindh. “However, it was partially successful in Punjab, Karachi and Hyderabad,” he acknowledged.







Earlier in the day, the TTAP and PTI shared purported visuals of shops shut in various cities, including KP’s Peshawar, Abbottabad, Balakot, Haripur, Bajaur, Upper Chitral and Lakki Marwat; Sindh’s Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Badin and Nawabshah; Punjab’s Mandi Bahauddin, Mianwali, Muzaffargarh; and Balochistan’s Quetta, Chaman, Zhob, and Kuchlak.
It also posted videos showing PTI workers and supporters gathered in KP’s Kohat, as well as Balochistan’s Nasirabad, Qila Saifullah, Chaman and Pishin.







KP
In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest.
A Dawn correspondent reported a partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed.
PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”.
He expressed his gratitude to “all traders associations and transport associations of Haripur for their cooperation in showing solidarity” with TTAP’s call.







PTI district president Irfan Saleem said workers in Peshawar would gather in the Hashtnagri area around noon before marching through the city. He said a rally at Chowk Yadgar would be addressed by party leaders.
PTI’s chapter arranged a gathering at Chowk Yadgar in the afternoon. Seating arrangement and panaflex boards could be seen at the venue prior to the event, with PTI banners hanging in front of closed shops.
PTI KP Deputy Information Secretary Ikram Khatana had said party workers would gather at Hashtnagri Chowk around 12pm and later march through Rampura Bazaar to reach Chowk Yadgar.
All the district chapters across the province were to arrange events, according to Khatana.
In Okara, police arrested 30 PTI workers ahead of Sunday’s protests.
PTI’s Mehr Abdul Sattar was detained for seven days under the MPO Ordinance. Police also raided the house of PTI-backed MNA Usama Hamza in Gojra, but he was not found.
Sindh
All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday.
He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed.
But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.”
Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district.







The PTI’s Karachi chapter also claimed that markets in Safoora Town, North Nazimabad, Landhi, Shah Faisal Colony, Model Town and Malir were shut by traders to record their protest silently.
In another post, Sheikh contended, “This strike is not just a strike, it’s a referendum! Today’s nationwide strike has set a new precedent.
“Historically, strikes in this province were enforced with sticks, threats, roadblocks, burning tyres, even bullets and arson.”
He claimed, “This may be the first strike in Pakistan’s history where workers were not on the streets — yet the public itself shut everything down. That is not a strike; that is a referendum.”







Punjab
In Punjab, the PTI said it would observe a “silent agitation” by urging people to stay home and keep bazaars and transport shut voluntarily as part of a shutter-down and wheel-jam strike to express their resentment against a “Form-47 government that stole people’s mandate”.
However, a Dawn correspondent in Lahore reported that markets exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with routine traffic movement observed. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival, which was in its last day.
The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops.







PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged people to suspend outdoor activity and stay home as a form of protest. She also called for torch-bearing rallies after Maghrib prayers at the union council level.
Party leaders in the province also criticised police raids and arrests of workers on Saturday, alleging harassment of families during search operations.
Islamabad, Rawalpindi
Meanwhile, most of the markets in the federal capital remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call.
These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city.
While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar.
Fawad Khan, a PTI supporter who was selling garments, said that he and other traders cannot afford to close their shops.
“We are already hand-to-mouth, and I cannot starve my family. I am a follower of Imran Khan and even voted for his candidate, but I cannot afford to close the stall,” he said.

Muhammad Faiq, a resident who had come for shopping, said that although they have sympathy for PTI, it was not possible for him to remain limited to his house on a Sunday.
“I get only one day in a week to purchase grocery and I must do it,” he said.
However, resident Muhammad Danish said that all the political parties were the same and they never cared about the masses.
“When PTI was in power, they did not care about the masses and Imran Khan has been facing charges that he sold the [state] gifts. He used to give examples of different premiers that they come to office on bicycles but he himself travelled on a helicopter to go to office,” he said.
“No one, including the establishment, cares about Pakistan; otherwise, we would not be suffering and facing such a situation,” he lamented.
PTI Islamabad President Amir Mughal had said the party would combine the protest with mourning activities.
A local district administration official confirmed that the metro bus service that runs between the twin cities was suspended. The electric bus service operated by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was also suspended.
However, traffic on the capital’s roads was reported to be the same as usual.
Balochistan
A complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in the provincial capital Quetta.
All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin in Quetta, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic.
Mobile internet services have been suspended again, a Dawn correspondent reported.
Workers of the PTI and the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — which is headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai — staged demonstrations in some areas of the city.
Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads.
In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far.







Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades.
Police were reported to have used tear gas to disperse the protesters, and removed the barricades and the burning tyres to open the road for traffic.
The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm.
A small demonstration also took place near Airport Road, but police dispersed the participants and cleared the route for traffic.
Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held.
Protesters attempted to block inter-provincial roads, but police dispersed them, reportedly resorting to baton charges in Qila Saifullah.







In Chaman, political workers pelted stones at the police, injuring one constable who was taken to a hospital.
In an exchange on X, Balochistan government official Shahid Rind said in a reply to Achakzai that the Quetta Airport road usually displayed similar scenes as today on “a Sunday in winters”.
In his post, Achakzai had shared a picture showing a deserted road.







In a post, the TTAP said its workers had “blocked all roads” in Balochistan’s Loralai and Harnai. Tyres were also burned to block the road near Duki’s Eidgah Chowk, it said.







PTI hails public ‘response’
In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”.
He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike.
“It is a day of mourning over the stolen vote and terrorism in Balochistan and Islamabad,” he added.







Recalling the Feb 8, 2024 elections, Raja termed it a “historic moment of the Pakistani nation’s democratic expression”. He highlighted that the people voted for PTI in support of its founder, Imran Khan despite “months-long oppression and snatching the electoral symbol”.
He further said, “On that dark evening, the wolves who looted the votes of those young people and of the entire nation across the country, they negated the very existence of millions of human beings.”







Meanwhile, KP CM Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for what he called a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike.
In a social media post on X, he wrote: “I thank all Pakistanis for once again sending a clear message today to those who robbed them of their mandate that we stood with Imran Khan, we are standing with him today, and we will continue to stand with him.
“Across Pakistan, people participated wholeheartedly in the shutter-down and wheel-jam strike, which is both encouraging and also fearsome for our opponents,” he claimed.
“Today, Pakistanis once again rejected the imposed group and those who brought them to power,” the KP CM said.
Furthermore, he said that “each small or big event holds great importance” in the opposition’s movement for the supremacy of the Constitution and the law, and for the restoration of an independent judiciary.
“We must neither abuse nor resort to bullets. We must continue our peaceful struggle within the framework of the Constitution and the law, so that no one gets an excuse to open fire,” CM Afridi said.
He reiterated the PTI’s allegation that its supporters were fired upon during the Nov 26, 2024 protest in Islamabad.
“Yet even today, Pakistanis are fearless and are not stepping back from any sacrifice,” the chief minister said, hailing the supporters’ courage.
On the other hand, CM Maryam said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.”







Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the public had “rejected the politics of incitement and division”, quipping that the “wheel-jam [strike] itself was jammed”.
“The public is tired of protest politics and the PTI’s call was badly dismissed. There is hustle and bustle despite a Sunday,” he said on X.







Minister for States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam also asserted that the public rejected the TTAP’s call for a wheel-jammed and shutter-down strike.
“The people of KP have realised how long they can keep believing the false narrative that has been pushed for the last 13 years,” he said in a statement.
Muqam said the people of KP wanted progress, peace and development. He claimed this was the first time he had seen a chief minister calling for businesses to be shut down.
On Saturday, PTI leader Asad Qaiser had told Dawn the party had neither postponed nor cancelled its protest programme in the wake of the Islamabad attack. “The day will be observed as a National Day of Mourning and, at the same time, protests will be held across the country against rigging in the general election,” he said.
Qaiser said the party would hold protests and a shutter-down strike “with the masses” against the alleged electoral manipulation.

American and Iranian diplomats held indirect talks in Oman on Friday, aimed at reviving diplomacy amid a US naval buildup near Iran and Tehran’s vows of a harsh response if attacked.
“Zero enrichment can never be accepted by us. Hence, we need to focus on discussions that accept enrichment inside Iran while building trust that enrichment is and will stay for peaceful purposes,” Araqchi said.
Iran and the US held five rounds of nuclear talks last year, which stalled mainly due to disagreements over uranium enrichment inside Iran. In June, the US attacked Iranian nuclear facilities at the end of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign.
Tehran has since said it has halted enrichment activity, which the US views as a possible pathway to nuclear bombs. Iran says its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful purposes.
A diplomat in the region briefed by Iran told Reuters on Friday that Tehran was open to discussing the “level and purity” of enrichment as well as other arrangements, as long as it was allowed to enrich uranium on its soil and would be granted sanctions relief in addition to military de-escalation.
“Iran’s insistence on enrichment is not merely technical or economic (…) it is rooted in a desire for independence and dignity,” Araqchi said. “No one has the right to tell the Iranian nation what it should or should not have.”
The minister also said that Iran’s missile programme, which the US would like to include in negotiations, had never been part of the agenda.
President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a post on Sunday that talks with the US were a “step forward” and that Tehran wanted its rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to be respected.







The date and venue of the next round of talks will be determined in consultation with Oman and might not be Muscat, Araqchi said.</p><small>2026-02-08 13:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/08173238d672d9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971868/president-zardari-says-afghan-taliban-have-created-situation-similar-to-or-worse-than-pre-911' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari says Afghan Taliban have created situation ‘similar to or worse than pre-9/11’</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday issued renewed warnings about the threats to global peace due to “terrorist organisations operating in Afghanistan”, and criticised the Taliban regime’s policies, which he said created conditions “similar to or worse than pre-9/11”.
He made the remarks in a statement thanking world leaders for showing solidarity with Pakistan over the recent attack on an imambargah in Islamabad, which killed 36 people and injured more than 160. The militant group Islamic State (IS) had claimed responsibility for the attack.
In a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat, Zardari reiterated the Pakistani nation’s resolve to combat terrorism and violent ideology.
“Pakistan has long maintained that terrorism cannot be confronted by a single country in isolation,” he was quoted as saying.
Citing Pakistan’s experience, he said in the statement that whenever “terrorist groups are allowed space, facilitation or impunity beyond national borders, the consequences are borne by innocent civilians all over the world.”
Under such a context, he continued, certain neighbouring countries had become partners in crime by allowing terrorist elements to operate against Pakistan from their soil, while some not only finance them directly but also provide them with technical and military means.
“This is a reality that has shaped the regional developments in recent years. Pakistan takes strong exception to the situation in Afghanistan, where the Taliban regime has created conditions similar to or worse than pre-9/11, when terror organisations posed threats to global peace, ending in the 9/11 tragedy,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The Sept 11, 2001, attacks, also known as 9/11, refer to a series of coordinated plane hijackings by the armed Al Qaeda group, which claimed almost 3,000 lives.
Zardari also accused India of “assisting the Taliban regime and threatening not only Pakistan but also the regional and global peace.”
Following Friday’s mosque attack in Islamabad, government officials, including the Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, had also blamed “Indian-backed proxies” for carrying out the attack.
President Zardari appreciated the international community for expressing solidarity with Pakistan in its fight against terrorism.
“Pakistan is humbled by the strong and sincere outpouring of support and solidarity from world leaders, governments and international organisations,” he said in the statement.
“The messages of sympathy and solidarity had brought comfort to the people of Pakistan and strength to the families who mourned.”
Islamabad has reiterated that Afghanistan’s soil has been continuously used by terrorists against Pakistan and urged the Taliban regime to rein in the terror groups’ operations in its land to target civilians and military personnel in Pakistan.</p><small>2026-02-08 12:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/08154605829f0bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971867/basant-festivities-in-lahore-can-continue-till-5am-on-monday-announces-punjab-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>Basant festivities in Lahore can continue till 5am on Monday, announces Punjab CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced on Sunday that Basant festivities in Lahore could continue till 5am on Monday, extending the previous deadline that was set to end today.







Previously, the Punjab government had given the approval for Basant celebrations in the provincial capital for just three days, from February 6-8.
But the provincial chief executive said in a post on social media platform X today: “Looking at the incredible energy, festivity, unity, and joy across Lahore, Punjab and Pakistan … I am pleased to announce that Basant celebrations timings are being extended till 5am tomorrow morning.”
She said the extension was a “reward for the people of Lahore” for celebrating Basant with great discipline and for responsibly following all safety standard operating procedures.
“Please continue to celebrate safely, stay away from electric wires, secure your rooftops, and follow all guidelines. Let’s make this historic Basant joyful, safe, and memorable for everyone.” she added.
The kite-flying festival was banned in 2007 in Punjab because of an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused by sharp strings, particularly to motorcyclists and pillion riders, as well as by celebratory gunfire.
In December last year, the Punjab government decided to lift a ban on the festival after 18 years, though with strict regulations in place. The authorities also decided to limit the festivities to Lahore, and CM Maryam earlier said that Basant in Lahore was being organised as a pilot project so that “ we can see how effective our security protocols and SOPs”.
According to the Punjab government’s instructions, only cotton string is allowed to be sold for kite-flying during Basant, whereas the manufacturing of metallic string material and kites exceeding fixed sizes is strictly prohibited.
The provincial government has also imposed a ban on the manufacturing of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party.
Despite safety protocols, the Punjab home department’s control room received at least 118 Basant-related accident cases, including six casualties, during the first two days of the festival. The six casualties included four incidents of falling from rooftops and one each when young boys tried to climb an electric pole and a tree to catch kites. About 112 injuries occurred due to twine.</p><small>2026-02-08 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649720-islamabad-picks-concrete-over-trees-angering-residents' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad picks concrete over trees, angering residents</strong></a><br><p>

According to the sources, Islamabad received the invitation as part of the outreach to countries that have already joined the board, which was launched by Trump late last month. The meeting is expected to focus on giving formal shape to the board, including its structure, mandate and secretariat, the sources said.

 

“This will be a key meeting aimed at giving a shape and structure to the board,” one diplomatic source said. Asked whether Pakistan could be approached to contribute troops to a proposed international stabilisation force for Gaza, the source said such discussions were premature.
“That would come later. First, we have to give shape to the board, form a structure, set up a secretariat and define its direction,“ he added.
Another source also said it was “still too early” for any discussion on troop contributions.
Pakistan is among the 14 countries that signed the charter of the Board of Peace on January 22 on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, becoming a founding member of the body.
The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established last month. Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository. President Trump has designated the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the board’s headquarters.
A controversial initiative
The White House has proposed holding the first BoP meeting at the US Institute of Peace in Washington, according to an Axios report citing a US official and diplomats from four participating countries. The plans, which include a fundraising component for Gaza’s reconstruction, remain at an early stage and could still change.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to meet President Trump at the White House on Feb 18, a day before the planned board meeting.
Trump, who will chair the body, has said the Board of Peace will aim to resolve global conflicts — a claim that has alarmed many experts, who fear the initiative could undermine the United Nations and existing multilateral mechanisms.
While several Middle Eastern allies of Washington have joined the board, many of the US’s traditional Western allies have so far stayed away, reflecting unease over both its structure and mandate.
Pakistan’s calculus
For Pakistan, participation in the meeting reflects a cautious but deliberate diplomatic choice. As a long-standing supporter of Palestinian rights, Islamabad has sought to remain engaged in international discussions on Gaza, while avoiding initiatives that could legitimise external control over the Palestinian territory.
A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.

 

However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated violations. Since October, more than 550 Palestinians and four Israeli soldiers have been killed.
Israel’s assaults on Gaza since October 2023 have killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, displaced the entire population and triggered a severe humanitarian crisis. Multiple rights organisations, scholars and a UN inquiry have said the campaign amounts to genocide — an allegation Israel denies.
Under Trump’s Gaza plan unveiled late last year, the Board of Peace was originally intended to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance before being expanded to address global conflicts.
Rights experts and scholars have criticised the concept, arguing that a US-led board overseeing the affairs of a foreign territory resembles a colonial structure. The absence of Palestinian representation on the board has further deepened these concerns.
For Pakistan, attendance at the inaugural meeting does not necessarily signal endorsement of the board’s broader vision. Instead, officials suggest Islamabad sees value in remaining present at a forum that could influence Gaza’s future — while reserving its position on key issues such as governance, accountability and any potential military role.
As the Board of Peace takes shape, Pakistan’s challenge will be to balance diplomatic engagement with its stated commitment to Palestinian self-determination and international law — a line that is likely to come under increasing pressure as the initiative moves from concept to implementation.</p><small>2026-02-08 07:25</small></div><hr>
