Earlier, an initial statement by Rescue 1122 said the incident took place early in the morning after the boiler of the factory exploded, causing the collapse of the building and nearby structures.
However, the rescue service later attributed the explosion to a gas leak, which was also confirmed in the statement issued by Faisalabad Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar’s office.
The statement by the commissioner’s office said no boiler was present in the factory, adding that four factories were operating in the Malikpur area. “A fire erupted in one of the factories due to gas leakage and engulfed the other factories as well.”
Seven houses in the area were also affected, the statement said. According to Rescue 1122, the explosion caused the roof of the factory and those of adjacent houses to collapse.
The statement by the commissioner’s office said that 15 bodies had been pulled out from the rubble, five more than the earlier reported death toll of 10 by Rescue 1122.
According to the statement, 10 of the injured people were taken to Allied Hospital, and three were discharged after first aid.
It added that a five-member inquiry team was being constituted to probe the incident.
The statement said that the rescue operation at the site had been completed and the clearance process was under way. The situation was being monitored, it added, further quoting Commissioner Raja saying that “we share the grief of the heirs of those killed in this unfortunate accident”.
An earlier statement by Rescue 1122 detailed the rescue operation, saying that it was carried out under the supervision of the district emergency officer, and more than 20 ambulances and fire tenders took part in it.
It also said that the Faisalabad Control Room had received a call about the explosion at the factory at 5:28am.
Videos of the rescue work shared by Rescue 1122 showed workers combing through the rubble of buildings and looking for survivors.
Meanwhile, Punjab Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar had directed that Rescue 1122, the fire brigade and all related agencies be provided full support.
In a statement, he said that police officers and officials should continue rescue operations to find people buried underneath the rubble. He also directed traffic police to ensure easy access to the site of the incident for ambulances and other rescue vehicles.
Last year in April, a dozen workers were injured in a steam boiler explosion at a textile mill in Faisalabad. Rescue 1122 reported that as a result of the blast, not only did fire break out in the factory, but the roof of a hall also caved in.</p><small>2025-11-21 06:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2110322030a0b71.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956457/afridi-pens-letter-to-maryam-over-manhandling-of-imrans-sisters-denial-of-his-visitation-rights' target='_blank'><strong>Afridi pens letter to Maryam over manhandling of Imran’s sisters, denial of his visitation rights</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter to his counterpart in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, has raised concerns over the alleged manhandling of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters by police and the obstruction of the incarcerated ex-premier’s visitation rights.
The development comes after Afridi on Thursday was denied access to meet Imran for a seventh time. Further, two days ago police had allegedly manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with him.
The letter, which was shared by the PTI on social media platform X early on Friday, said that Afridi wished to draw Maryam’s attention to “serious concerns” regarding the “administration of court-mandated visitation rights” of Imran and the recent treatment of his family members.
 






“Clear and binding judicial directions govern Imran’s visitation schedule. These orders explicitly permit his close family members and nominated individuals to meet him on specified days. Despite the unambiguous nature of these instructions, repeated reports indicate persistent non-implementation by the authorities responsible for compliance,” Afridi said.
He also termed accounts of the “inappropriate and rough treatment” of Imran’s sisters during a recent attempt to visit him as “particularly disturbing”.
“These individuals are apolitical private citizens, seeking only to meet their brother in accordance with court permissions. Even if restrictions were to exist for political visitors — which is a different category altogether — there is no conceivable legal or administrative basis for obstructing or mishandling immediate family members whose presence is neither political nor disruptive in nature,” the KP chief minister said.
“Their obstruction, physical restraint or temporary detention is therefore wholly unacceptable,” he said.
Afridi said that such actions created a “clear impression” that judicial directives were being disregarded, and that jail and police authorities were not safeguarding or facilitating the rights of visitors.
He urged Maryam to ensure a proper, safe and dignified waiting area for authorised visitors.
“The current practice of stopping them nearly a kilometre away and compelling elderly family members — particularly women — to sit on roads is wholly inappropriate and must be discontinued,” he said.
He said that the Punjab government should ensure the implementation of all court directives on visitation. He also called for identifying and holding individuals accountable for obstructing, insulting, or physically manhandling peaceful visitors, including Imran’s family and members of the KP cabinet.
He said that the Punjab government should also issue instructions to the prison and police authorities to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Further, he called for establishing a mechanism ensuring that all future meetings were facilitated in an “orderly, respectful and legally compliant manner”.
Afridi ended his letter by saying that Imran was a former prime minister and the leader of a political party he himself represented.
“Any deviation from court-mandated procedures in his case, or any disrespectful treatment of his immediate family, becomes a matter of direct institutional concern,” he said, adding that he could not remain indifferent when Imran’s dignity and rights were being compromised.
“I am therefore constrained to demand that these issues be addressed promptly, decisively and in full conformity with judicial directions,” he said.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
On Thursday, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed concern over the reports of Imran’s sisters being “manhandled” and noted that the rights of prisoners’ families to meet their relatives and the right to peaceful assembly were protected under national and international human rights law.
“HRCP calls for a transparent inquiry and urges authorities to ensure the rights, safety and dignity of all involved are fully respected,” it said in a post on X.</p><small>2025-11-21 06:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634682-after-e-challans-robot-cars-to-curb-no-parking-violations-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>After e-challans, robot cars to curb no-parking violations in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

The Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) has openly opposed the move and is making efforts to ensure that the IHC continues to function at its current building. The building presently houses the newly-established Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which had initially been shifted there temporarily but is now expected to continue operations in the building.
In view of the growing concerns, the IHCBA convened a meeting of its executive body and also announced that it would hold a press conference on Friday (today). Earlier on Wednesday, IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Gillani and Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja met Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to discuss the matter.
According to the association, the minister assured the delegation that the IHC would continue functioning in its present building for the time being.
However, the Islamabad District Bar Association (IDBA) has welcomed the proposed transfer of the high court to G-10. The IDBA convened a cabinet meeting under the chairmanship of its president Naeem Gujjar to deliberate on the matter. According to a statement issued after the meeting, the cabinet said relocating the high court would make it easier for lawyers to perform their duties and would also facilitate the production of prisoners, potentially speeding up the process of justice.
The IDBA stressed the need for broader consultation on the matter and called a general body meeting for November 22 to gauge the collective opinion of the legal community. All lawyers have been instructed to ensure their participation.
Meanwhile, in a parallel development, a delegation of the IHCBA called on FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan and other judges. The delegation led by President Gillani and Secretary Jajja visited the chamber of the chief justice where all the FCC judges were present.
The delegation presented bouquets to Chief Justice Aminuddin, Justice Arshad Hussain Shah, Justice Rozi Khan and others, congratulating them on assuming their roles at the newly-established court.

Talking to media persons, he said it was unfortunate that despite having orders from the Islamabad High Court, he was not allowed to meet the patron-in-chief of his party.
He revealed that he has written a letter to the Chief Justice but has not received any response regarding the issue.
When asked about the Election Commission of Pakistan taking notice of his statement, Sohail Afridi said that he had only said rigging would not be allowed in the by-elections, but his statement was twisted.

• ADB delegation calls on Sindh CM, expresses willingness to consider loan extension, additional financing
• University Road users continue to face hardships due to delays
KARACHI: The stalled construction on the much-delayed Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Red Line has resumed after the removal of several bottlenecks following the chief minister’s intervention but there is still no clear timeline in sight for the project’s completion while thousands of University Road commuters continue to face daily hardships.
The work was stopped around two months ago due to a number of issues, including the rising cost of the project and relocation of underground utility lines.
On Thursday, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon told a delegation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), which funds the project, that the work has been resumed on the Red Line project and that the provincial government was committed to accelerating implementation and addressing bottlenecks.
Designed to cover around 27 kilometres from Malir Halt to Numaish via University Road, the BRT Red Line project was announced in 2017 with an initial cost of around Rs79 billion, but due to persistent delays and mismanagement by the provincial government, the estimated cost has now escalated to Rs103 billion.
After commencement of the work in early 2022, the project was initially scheduled for completion by 2023, which was later pushed to 2024 and has subsequently been extended to the end of 2026.
For many, even the revised timeline appears to be wholly unrealistic as the project continues to progress at a snail’s pace and various factors have been cited by officials to justify these delays, including disputes with contractors, safety stoppages, rising construction costs due to depreciation of the rupee, difficulties in land acquisition, relocation of utilities and coordination failures between implementing agencies.
However, following renewed commitments and claims by the authorities that all bottlenecks have been removed, the project’s development has resumed after its suspension in September, the sources said.
‘ADB ready to consider loan extension, additional financing’
On Thursday, an ADB delegation led by its country head Emma Fan called on Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah at CM House, where the two sides reviewed the progress of development projects in the province being funded by the bank and discussed future cooperation in major sectors, including transport, infrastructure, urban development, and climate resilience.
According to a statement issued by the CM House, the meeting reviewed key initiatives, including the Karachi BRT Red Line Project, urban mobility improvements, infrastructure modernisation, and programmes aimed at strengthening resilience against climate shocks. The ADB country director expressed appreciation for the Sindh government’s engagement and reaffirmed ADB’s support for ongoing and future initiatives. She said the Sindh Government has demonstrated strong ownership of ADB-supported programmes.
She also stressed the importance of meeting performance benchmarks, enhancing institutional capacity, particularly within TransKarachi for the BRT system and addressing safeguards and community concerns promptly.
“The ADB is ready to consider loan extensions and additional financing based on improved performance and compliance. We encourage the province to maintain momentum so that key development objectives can be achieved within agreed timelines,” she added.
Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon told the meeting that the bottlenecks in the BRT Red Line had been removed with the intervention of the chief minister and the halted work has been resumed.
The CM assured the ADB team of the provincial government’s commitment to accelerate implementation and address bottlenecks.
The discussion included updates on financing needs, institutional strengthening, project performance, and timelines for the completion of major components.
“The projects related to urban transport, water, climate resilience and infrastructure are essential for improving the quality of life in Karachi and other cities. My government is closely monitoring progress and will extend every support needed for timely completion,” the statement quoted the CM as saying.
Both sides agreed to maintain close coordination in the coming months, particularly on issues related to financing, project restructuring where needed, community grievance redressal, safeguard compliance, and capacity strengthening of implementing agencies.
The CM also thanked the ADB delegation for their continued support and expressed confidence that the partnership would further deepen through cooperation and shared development goals.

According to Anadolu Agency, the meeting, held at Nato headquarters, focused on the state of Pakistan-US ties amid rising instability in South Asia. According to Pakistan’s foreign ministry post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the discussions also covered climate change and other global developments.
 






Mr Rutte praised Pakist­an’s “contributions to regional pea­ce and stability” and acknowledged its counterterrorism efforts. Mr Dar rei­terated Islamabad’s “unwavering commitment” to tackling militancy, warning that the threat Pakistan fa­­ces is “primarily supported and perpetrated from beyond its borders”.
The foreign minister said Pakistan sought a “peaceful and stable South Asia” and emphasised the need for constructive dialogue. Both sides agreed to expand engagement and continue cooperation on security challenges.
“European and South Asian security are intertwined,” Rutte said on X after the meeting, calling close cooperation “essential for promoting stability and prosperity”.
 






The deputy PM’s meeting with the Nato chief is part of a three-day visit to Brussels, which began on Wednesday. It marked the first such high-level meeting since then-Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi met with former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg in 2021.
In a separate engagement, Mr Dar met EU Commissioner for Inter­national Partnerships Jutta Urpila­inen to discuss ways of strengthening Pakistan-EU cooperation ahead of the 7th Pakist­an-EU Strategic Dialogue, which the foreign minister will co-chair.
Later, hosting a dinner for members of the European parliament at Pakistan House, the deputy PM urged European businesses to invest in Pakistan, citing opportunities in agriculture, textiles, housing and information technology, APP reported.
With more than 60pc of its population under 30, Pakistan was em­­erging as a rising economy, he said.
Calling the Pakistan-EU relationship a “pillar for peace, stability and development”, Mr Dar said Islamabad aimed to deepen political and economic ties with the bloc, highlighting the role of the GSP+ trade regime in boosting bilateral trade and investment.
 
 

The dinner was attended by senior MEPs, including committee chairs and coordinators dealing with Sou­th Asia, foreign affairs, trade and security, as well as Pakistan’s senior diplomatic representatives.

Chairing a meeting to review the privatisation status of the national flag carrier, the premier emphasised the need to develop a clear strategy to increase the number of airworthy aircraft in its fleet and ensure that all flights depart on time.
The prime minister also stressed that improving operational efficiency must remain a top priority.
The premier was informed that the Privatisation Commission had prequalified four parties for the long-awaited PIA transaction. The business plan aims to sell a 75 per cent stake with management control. However, strict conditions will be enforced to ensure that the airline’s name and branding remain unchanged after privatisation.
A press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said the officials briefed the meeting on the ongoing PIA privatisation process and the accompanying business plan.
The premier was also informed that the bidding phase would commence soon.
In early July, after detailed scrutiny, the Board of the Privatisation Commission prequalified four entities — Fauji Fert­iliser Company Ltd; Air Blue (Private) Ltd; a consortium comprising Lucky Cement Ltd, Hub Power Holdings Ltd, Kohat Cement Company Ltd and Metro Ventures (Pvt) Ltd; and another consortium consisting of Arif Habib Corporation Ltd, Fatima Fertiliser Company Ltd, City Schools (Private) Ltd and Lake City Holdings (Private) Ltd.
In the current month, the government approved the inclusion of AKD Group Holdings (Pvt) Ltd in the consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Ltd (AHCL), following the consortium’s request.
The meeting was attended by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali, and senior government officials.
The meeting was further informed that the number of airworthy aircraft in PIA’s fleet will be increased from 18 to 38 by 2029. Currently serving over 30 cities, PIA aims to expand its service network to more than 40 destinations by 2029.
Meanwhile, the premier separately discussed matters related to the Housing Ministry with Minister for Housing and Works Riaz Hussain Pirzada and reviewed the country’s overall political situation.
Published in Dawn, November 21st, 2025</p><small>2025-11-21 03:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/691fd7f0a72f9.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956420/unsc-resolution-on-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>UNSC resolution on Gaza</strong></a><br><p>THE UN Security Council Resolution 2803 passed on Nov 17 on Gaza has some noticeable features from the standpoint of international law. Let us take up at least a few.
Firstly, it does not mention the UN Charter’s provision under which it is adopted, and this is a deviation from the practice in vogue in the UNSC wherein resolutions mention in their respective preambles the legal provision under which they are enabled. However, when one examines the substance of Resolution 2803, it seems to be in the nature of conferring a mandate on separately negotiated “regional and collective arrangements” by member states of the Middle East, Turkiye, Pakistan, and of course, the US — the lead driver in initiating and pushing through this particular ‘regional arrangement’. All this is actually closer to the mandate under Chapter VIII of the Charter — to be more specific, under Article 52 of the said chapter.
So what difference does this make? After all, President Donald Trump and the US administration have received the much-needed mandate from the UN. There was no veto by China or Russia. All OIC states, including Pakistan, have agreed, and those in the UNSC have voted favourably. Clearly, the first and foremost motivation of all Muslim states — and rightly so — was to secure legally what was possible and achievable politically a halt to any further genocide plans and killing of Palestinians.
However, if the resolution is to be taken as being passed under Chapter VIII titled ‘Regional Arrangements’, then it is submitted that the regional arrangements of neighbouring countries can now have a life of their own. Let’s explain this. A regional arrangement of the sort being authorised by the present resolution will be constrained to seek authorisation from the UNSC itself for any enforcement action (read: military action) due to the requirements of Article 53 of the UN Charter. However, what if due to any reason, such as Israeli action or Hamas’s defiance, or for that matter if President Trump is no longer in office, the process at the UNSC is stalled? That’s when the independent mandate of any existing regional arrangement is resurrected as envisioned under Article 52 of the Charter.

It is striking that Resolution 2803 in its annexed plan assures that ‘Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza’.

It is striking that Resolution 2803 in its annexed plan assures in paragraph 16 that “Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza”. This is an important statement from the sponsors of regional arrangements and is now reflected as a collective position with the consent of Israel. This adds legal clarity and reinforces the most important principle of modern statecraft that the occupation of a territory under international law cannot legitimise title. The entire regional arrangement or a series of them, including measures to create a board of peace and international stabilisation force (ISF), will eventually lead to the gradual withdrawal of the Israeli Defence Forces from Gaza territory.
One may ask if the resolution contains a roadmap leading to a two-state solution. It does, but not so explicitly as one would want. That process is tied to the reform programme of the Palestinian Authority and the advancement of Gaza’s redevelopment plan. It is then that the issue of “Palestinian self-determination and statehood” will be taken up.
 
 

Though the regional arrangement under Resolution 2803 is a sort of a detour from the chain of dozens of resolutions on the two-state solution by the UNSC, 2803 does not defy the resolutions and the plans contained in them per se, and instead, notes their existence in the preamble. In other words, this resolution sets up a regional arrangement, sponsored and led by the US, as a parallel regime, arguably also calling for a solution under Chapter VI of the Charter relating to the ‘Pacific Settlement of Disputes’. But it cannot be interpreted in any way as to render ineffective the previous proposals for two-state solutions already adopted by UNSC resolutions, including 242 and 1397 among several others.
The setting up of the ISF mandate under Resolution 2803 is also unique because it will be installed with the consent of both Israel and Egypt. It is initially for two years, but the period is extendable. It is to “use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate consistent with international law including international humanitarian law [emphasis added]”. As things move forward, one foresees a tense moment amongst ISF commanders debating the limits or extent of the mandate, particularly if there are incidents such as defiance by Hamas or Israeli bombing. It must be known clearly that when the ISF is in place, Israel’s ‘right’ to use force in an area of ISF mandate is forfeited. That will actually increase manifold the responsibility of the ISF to maintain security and peace in the region.
The plan annexed to Resolution 2803 makes a very interesting mention of what is referred to as “interfaith dialogue” to “try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis”. As we know, the Palestinian narrative is primarily drawn from the modern international law principle of self-determination and the right to resist occupation as recognised by the UN itself all along. On the other hand, the Israeli narrative is based, inter alia, on an ancient biblical covenant of the promised land as a justification for a ‘Greater Israel’.
It will be interesting to see how the US, through interfaith dialogue, is able to make Israel understand that notwithstanding which religion dominated which area in the past or which nation was allowed permission to enter or use land resources, it is now the UN Charter that can override religious or cultural narratives as the prevailing law today to determine mutual relations, the legitimate means of adding to existing territories and to ensure respect for state boundaries.

• Critics say decision is meant to help PML-N, allowing it more time to pick candidate
ISLAMABAD: In yet another violation of the Constitution, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has taken the poll date for a Senate seat from Punjab beyond the deadline stipulated in the green book.
The schedule for by-election on the seat, which fell vacant due to death of PML-N parliamentary leader in the Se­­nate Irfanul Haque Siddiqui, has been amended within 48 hours of its issuance.
“In exercise of powers conferred und­er Article 218(3) read with Article 254 of the Constitution, Sections 107 and 128 of the Elections Act, 2017, and all other powers enabling in this behalf, the Elec­tion Programme issued vide Notification of even number dated 17th November, 2025, for conduct of Senate Election aga­inst one general seat from Punjab province, which fell vacant due to death of Mr Irfanul Haque Siddiqui, is hereby amended due to ongoing activities of (12) By-Elections in different National/Provincial Assembly constituencies. Con­­sequently, above referred No­­tification stands modified,” said a notification issued by the ECP on Wednesday.
The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was purportedly issued on Wednesday, but emerged only on Thursday, a day before the last date for filing nominations under the original schedule. Surprisingly, the notification is still not available on the ECP’s official website.
Under Article 224(5) of the Constitu­tion, a vacancy in the Senate is to be filled within 30 days from the date of its occurrence. The Senate seat became vacant on Nov 10, and by-election was supposed to be held by Dec 9, the date previously fixed as the poll day.
A senior ECP official when contacted said the schedule had been amended due to other ongoing electoral activities and not under any political influence. He said that under Article 254 of the Constitution, “When any act or thing is required by the Constitution to be done within a particular period and it is not done within that period, the doing of the act or thing shall not be invalid or otherwise ineffective by reason only that it was not done within that period”.
He also referred to Section 107 of the Elections Act, which specifies timeline for various stages of Senate elections starting from inviting nominations and said under Section 128 of the Act, “The Commission may, for reasons which it considers sufficient, extend the time for completion of an election to the Senate by making necessary amendments in the notification issued under Section 107”.
He, however, could not explain as to how by-polls in some constituencies necessitate putting off Senate by-polls where members of a provincial assembly are to cast votes.
Critics say the decision was clearly meant to please the PML-N, allowing it more time to pick a candidate for the seat. They point out that the poll date for by-election on 13 National and provincial assembly seats was Nov 23 and insist that there was no cogent reason to delay the Senate by-election for a month after that.
Under the schedule issued on Nov 17, nomination papers were to be submitted on Nov 20 and 21 while scrutiny of documents was to be completed by Nov 25.
The electoral body also announced Nov 29 as the final date for filing of appeals against the acceptance or rejection of nomination papers and Dec 1 as the last date for withdrawal of candidature. The candidates will now file nomination papers on Dec 4 and 5. Each step has been delayed for around two weeks. The polling will be held on Dec 24 instead of Dec 9.

Female labour force participation rates are around 74pc — one of the highest in the region. Contrast this with Pakistan. Our literacy rate is less than 70pc and female labour force participation rates are around 25pc.
Recently, I had an opportunity to visit Phnom Penh, Cambodia, for a four-day conference. Though there was limited opportunity to move around outside due to conference commitments, the city and its people still made quite an impression on me.
As soon as you land in Phnom Penh you realise you are in a country where the public space is shared by men and women almost equally. Women run and own businesses; they manage shops; they do almost all the jobs that are available; they drive cycles, motorcycles, scooters, cars and vans; and they do not have to worry about men staring at them. If you live in Pakistan and are quite used to what happens here, the change seems stark when you enter another country. Of course, for most of the world, it is just normal.
But it is not just that. The quality of service that is provided to you as a customer is quite impressive as well. Tourism is important for the economy, and is one of its larger income generators. The prevailing service orientation helps greatly. Shopkeepers are keen to provide what you are looking for. Hotel staff is courteous and responsive. English is an issue even in Phnom Penh, and most people just about make do, but whether in the tuk tuk (local rickshaw), small shops or in the big hotel where we were staying, I never felt that language was that big an issue. The courteous keenness with which you are listened to and addressed makes up for any language deficiencies quite easily.

Cambodia has focused a lot of resources on rebuilding schools.

Walking in the streets of Phnom Penh gives you an idea of an economy on the move. There is a thriving and expanding tourism industry, and local commerce is doing quite well too. Cambodia still relies a lot on agriculture and textiles (garments) but the economy is moving into industry well. Cambodia is attracting significant foreign direct investment. Investments in infrastructure have also gone up significantly. Recently, there has been talk of offshore oil and gas reserves too.
The picture you get, even with a brief exposure, is of an economy, which though still in the early stages of development, is keen to move forward and is investing in the human resource needed for development. It is starting to establish basic systems and infrastructure for more rapid development and is aiming high. It might well be that within a few years to a decade, people who are currently talking of Cambodia’s neighbours such as Vietnam and Thailand will be talking of Cambodia itself. Considering the energy that I witnessed, I would not be surprised at all if that happens. Cambodia has already had many years of 6pc to 8pc GDP growth over the last couple of decades, despite international financial crises, the Covid-19 pandemic, etc.
Do keep in mind where Cambodia is coming from. In 1975-79, when Cambodia had a population of about seven million people, it was in the throes of a genocide that, according to some estimates, killed about 2m Cambodians: almost a quarter to one-third of the total population of the country. And the killings focused on the educated and more well-off people in society. Some estimates say that almost 80pc of teachers were killed in the genocide. Phnom Penh was evacuated completely and city dwellers were moved to rural areas. All schools and universities were closed and destroyed. The intellectuals of the country were killed. For some time, being educated was held against you and could get you killed. Possessing paper and pens or a book was considered to be problematic.
Political instability continued for decades afterwards. It is only over the last 25 to 30 years that Cambodia has seen some political settlement and it is only recently that Cambodians have been able to shift their attention to rebuilding their country and economy.
 
 

Cambodia has focused a lot of resources on rebuilding schools. Literacy rates as well as primary level enrolment rates have improved a lot. Both are higher than what we have in Pakistan. But the rate of high school enrolment and completion and tertiary education enrolment is not very high in Cambodia, though they are comparable to Pakistan. There is a gender gap in enrolments and completion as well, but the gap is narrowing faster than it has been in Pakistan.
There is still a lot of work to do. Not all schools, especially those in the rural areas, have adequate infrastructure. There are many schools that still have high school graduates as teachers. The quality of instruction, especially at the high school level, is quite weak and uneven across schools. Tertiary education needs to be developed a lot more. But there are significant investments being made in education and human resource development.
There are still plenty of concerns about institutional stability, policy continuity, corruption and bureaucratic interference in Cambodia. But the country does give the look of an economy and society that is on the move. The people seem hopeful and want to work to do something about the country. The mood, in this sense, is quite different from that of young people in Pakistan. There is no despondency. There is no desire to leave the country in overwhelming numbers. The Cambodians see a future in the local economy. A lot of policy changes over the last 20 years or so have contributed to the creation of this mood and outlook. We, in Pakistan, seem to be moving in the opposite direction.

Published in Dawn, November 21st, 2025</p><small>2025-11-21 03:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956413/governance-failure' target='_blank'><strong>Governance failure</strong></a><br><p>THE IMF’s long-awaited Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment report on Pakistan is a grim analysis of the country’s persistent corruption challenges, rooted in systemic weaknesses and chronic governance failures across state institutions, which stifle economic goals. The report finds that institutional weaknesses, lack of transparency in state functions, preferential treatment for select businesses, and inefficiencies in public-sector transactions are major constraints to growth.
The document’s publication, a precondition for the IMF’s approval for disbursing the next $1.2bn loan tranche in December, also calls for a series of reforms spread across the next three to six months to help raise the growth rate to 5-6.5pc over the next five years. It provides a detailed diagnostic of Pakistan’s inefficient and opaque tax system, SOE mismanagement, a judiciary hampered by antiquated laws hindering contract enforcement and property rights, politically driven financial discretion, and weaknesses in anti-corruption regimes. It questions the lack of transparency in the functioning of the Special Investment Facilitation Council and the immunity granted to its officials. No wonder the government had been delaying its publication despite repeated reminders from the IMF.
At the core of the GCDA is the argument that our poor economic performance is closely linked to opaqueness and discretionary practices that shape governance and policy outcomes. Thus, the report’s contention that effective reforms must begin with expanding access to information to anchor transparency and accountability across policy formulation, implementation and monitoring, and enable both state and non-state actors to participate more effectively in economic decision-making, should not be ignored. Without a shift to rules-based governance, the weaknesses will continue to suppress growth.
 
 

The accompanying 15-point reform agenda reinforces this argument. Broadly, the reforms aim for improvements in governance, anti-corruption frameworks, business regulations and foreign trade oversight as prerequisites to unlocking growth potential. The recommendations directly target institutional arrangements that entrench discretion and weaken market and investor confidence. They are aimed at ending preferential treatment for powerful public-sector entities; bringing transparency to SIFC decision-making and its approval of concessions for select businesses; tightening controls on financial discretion through greater parliamentary oversight; mandating e-governance procurement for state transactions; and restructuring anti-corruption agencies.
In short, the GCDA underscores that the current governance model based on opacity, discretion, privilege, institutional and legal decay, and political patronage cannot serve the best economic interests of the people. The difficulty is that Pakistan’s power centres as well as policy and business elites do not yet appear ready to give up their privileges and embrace the change even though time is fast running out for crucial, make-or-break decisions. Will the IMF diagnostic change that? The jury is out.

The British-based charity urged this weekend’s summit of the powerful G20 group of major economies to back initiatives by the host, South Africa, to address massive global wealth inequality and the debt undermining developing countries.
Billionaires in the 19 countries that are part of the grouping made $2.2tr last year as their combined wealth grew to $15.6tr, it said, basing its figures on the Forbes list.
“The annual cost to lift up the 3.8 billion people who currently live below the poverty line is $1.65tr,” it said in a statement.

Calls for the wealthy to be ‘fairly taxed’ to help end poverty, fight climate breakdown

Oxfam backed a recommendation that South Africa will present to the November 22-23 summit for the establishment of an international panel to tackle inequality in the same way the UN’s IPCC works on the threat from global warming.
“If the South African G20 establishes a new International Panel on Inequality, it will be a tremendous step in addressing the inequality emergency,” executive director Amitabh Behar said in the statement.
Oxfam also called for the world’s wealthy to be “fairly taxed in order to help end poverty and fight the climate breakdown”. It singled out the United States as championing “destructive policies — from reckless tariffs to regressive tax breaks and cuts to life-saving aid” that increase inequality between the rich and poor.
Calling for action on debt, it said 3.4 billion people live in countries that spend more on interest repayments than on education or health.
The G20 includes 19 countries as well as the European Union and African Union, which together represent 85 per cent of global GDP and two-thirds of the world population.
South Africa hopes its summit, the first G20 in Africa, will advance issues facing the continent and developing countries in the “Global South” before the rotating presidency is handed to the United States for 2026.

The forum is expected to elevate a judge to the Supreme Court from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) as well as nominate the chief justices of the Sindh High Court (SHC) and the Balochistan High Court (BHC).
The meeting of the JCP will be convened at 2:30pm in the conference room of Islamabad’s SC building.
One of the agendas of the meeting is to consider appointment of a judge to the SC from the senior judges of the IHC. How­ever, the names of the judges and their seniority position will be disclosed at a later stage.
SC strength
With the establishment of the FCC, where four judges from the Supreme Court — Justices Aminuddin Khan, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi — have been appointed as well as the resignation of Justices Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah, the total strength of the SC has been reduced to 18 judges from the earlier 24.
Presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the JCP meeting will also be attended by FCC CJ Aminuddin Khan; Jus­tices Munib Akhtar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Aamer Farooq; Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan; Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar; Pakistan Bar Council representative Ahsan Bhoon; Sen­ators Farooq Hamid Naek and Syed Ali Zafar as well as MNAs Sheikh Aftab Ahmad and Gohar Ali Khan.
Likewise, the JCP during its meeting will also consider the appointment of SHC CJ from among the three senior-most judges of the high court.
Those who will be considered for the office are acting SHC Chief Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput and Justices Muhammad Iqbal Kalohoro and Justice Mahmood A. Khan.
Similarly, the JCP will also consider for the appointment of the BHC chief justice from among the three senior-most judges of the high court.
They include acting BHC Chief Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhai and Justices Iqbal Ahmed Kasi and Shaukat Ali Rakhshani. After the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment, changes were made to key constitutional and statutory judicial bodies.
Following these changes, SC’s Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail was included in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) and the Practice and Procedure Committee while FCC’s Justice Farooq was made a member of the JCP.
Among the three statutory bodies, the SJC is the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges, the Practice and Procedure Committee forms benches and fixes cases, and the JCP is responsible for appointing judges to the superior judiciary.

• Registry refuses to entertain plea, says SC original jurisdiction doesn’t exist anymore
• Judges asked to approach new Federal Constitutional Court, the very institution assailed in their draft petition
ISLAMABAD: Four judges of the Isla­mabad High Court (IHC) — who wanted to challenge the recently introduced 27th Amendment — were turned away by the Supreme Court and told to approach the newly-formed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), it emerged on Thursday.
The four judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rifat Imtiaz — had drafted a petition invoking the original jurisdiction of the top court under Article 184(3), and sent a representation to the apex court’s registry branch.
However, sources said the petition was not entertained on the grounds that Article 184(3), which used to be an inherent power of the Supreme Court to enforce fundamental rights, has been omitted from the Constitution.
The petitioner judges did not personally visit the Supreme Court to either file the petition or undergo biometric verification, the sources added.
Insiders told Dawn that the four judges had decided to move the Supreme Court after months of raising concerns over what they described as an “incremental but systematic dismantling” of judicial independence, beginning with the 26th Amendment and culminating in the latest constitutional changes.
 
 

As they declined to accept the application, court officials reportedly communicated to the petitioners that the petition may not fall within the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction because it relates to a constitutional amendment. The branch adv­i­sed that the matter might require review under procedures dealing specifically with challenges to constitutional amendments.
However, the petitioners maintained that only the Supreme Court — not the newly-formed FCC — could adjudicate the legality of the amendment because its very existence depends on the amendment being upheld.
 
 

As per the draft petition, a forum created by the disputed amendment cannot “judge its own birth”, and the Supreme Court’s inherent power to interpret the Constitution cannot be ousted.
Draft petition
The draft petition, seen by Dawn, argues that the fresh amendment violated articles 9, 10A and 25 of the Constitution, which guarantee the rights to due process, fair trial and equal protection, by subordinating the judiciary to the executive.
It also said the tweaks restructured the constitutional scheme of separation of powers and altered the terms of service of sitting judges in violation of the Constitution.
Ironically, the very forum the judges were advised to approach, i.e. the FCC, which now has exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters, is one of the main targets of the petition.
In it, the judges argue that the FCC chief justice was appointed by the president solely on the advice of the prime minister, without any consultation with the judiciary, in violation of established principles reiterated in landmark judgements such as Al-Jehad Trust and Sharaf Faridi.
The draft petition also assails the appointment of the first batch of the FCC judges, asserting that their selection was predetermined and “handpicked” by the executive, even before the amendment was enacted.
According to the draft, the structure and powers of the new court — which binds all other courts but is not bound by precedent itself — create a parallel judicial system unprecedented in common-law jurisdictions. It warned that the FCC’s unlimited discretion to withdraw cases from high courts raised the risk of executive control over constitutional adjudication.
The judges also challenged the amendments to Article 200, which allowed the transfer of high court judges without their consent. The petition further argued that such provisions exposed judges to pressure, fear of retaliation, and manipulation of court composition.
In addition, the petition challenges the altered composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), noting that both bodies now contain a majority of non-judicial members or judges appointed under the contested framework.
The petitioners argued that the appointment mechanism had been reduced to “an election by an executive-dominated electoral college”, replacing merit-based selection with political influence.

• Says NAB’s ‘political compromise’ hindering anti-corruption efforts
• Seeks autonomous oversight body to audit internal control processes
ISLAMABAD: With the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF) describing the country’s top anti-corruption agency, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), as a “political compromise”, the government has agreed to the publication of asset declarations of high-level public officials in 2026 and their risk-based verification to improve the country’s accountability and integrity standards against widespread corruption.
According to IMF’s Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), released by the Ministry of Finance as a structural benchmark of the ongoing $7 billion loan programme, the two sides have agreed under a short-term action plan to “strengthen accountability and integrity among high-level federal civil servants by initiating the publication of asset declarations in 2026, and introduce risk-based verification of asset declarations”.
In the longer term, the two sides agreed to “consider establishing a centralised authority to collect, digitise and publish asset declarations of high-level public officials with adequate powers and resources to conduct risk-based verification”, a vision that may remain elusive given the expiry of the IMF programme.
The lender also required the government in the medium term to enhance NAB’s independence and effectiveness in investigating high-level corruption by strengthening appointment procedures of its head, enhancing investigative capacities and establishing robust internal accountability.
The report noted with concern that disciplinary actions related to corruption in the government machinery, particularly senior revenue officials, were inadequate. Their investigative powers were limited to conducting interviews and checking asset declarations.
 
 

“Penalties imposed can range from minor (e.g. withholding a promotion) to major (e.g. dismissal from service), but do not include a proposal for criminal prosecution” as criminal prosecution is legally possible “but occurs only occasionally”, it said.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) could not provide data on the number of criminal prosecutions in recent years. While criminal prosecution can serve as a crucial deterrent in fighting corruption by imposing significant consequences on corrupt actions, “its effectiveness for the FBR is limited due to its limited application in practice and the de facto exclusion of high-ranked staff”.
In provinces, anti-corruption agencies require permission from the highest provincial authorities before investigations begin. “In the context of patronage politics in Pakistan, this creates risks that corruption investigations will not prosper against allies or supporters of the provincial governors. Investigative capacities and training are further hindered by their lack of access to databases, including on the national identification system, tax information, asset declarations and bank accounts,” the report said.
The report noted that the primary issue with asset declaration of government officials was that they were not subject to robust risk-based verification, “which also blunts its preventive impact”.
Moreover, the asset declaration system in Pakistan remained fragmented. The asset declaration requirements for “government servants” or “holders of public office”, active members of the armed forces and the judiciary are distinct.
Serving members of the armed forces are also subject to separate asset declaration rules, which do not include requirements for declarations to be made public. All public office-holders and government servants (federal as well as provincial), as taxpayers, are required to declare income returns and wealth statements annually to the FBR under the Income Tax Ordinance, but these are for tax compliance and not for anti-corruption purposes.
As for the judiciary, every judge is required to submit their asset declarations to the chief justice of the Supreme Court, but these are not made public.
Notably, asset declarations of the NAB chair and other senior officials cannot be disclosed due to privacy concerns. “It is critical, however, that there is a robust, independent and credible system for collecting and verifying asset declarations,” the report said.
To supplement verification efforts, procedures for lifestyle monitoring (investigating a public official’s standard of living and comparing it with their declared income and assets) would be another valuable tool to detect illicit enrichment and deter corruption.
The report said the current system for appointing the NAB chief was a political compromise. The “agreement between the administration and opposition on the candidate for the NAB chairman lends itself to political compromises rather than a merit-based, open and competitive selection process”, it said.
It advised that following global best anti-corruption practices, the selection process for the NAB chief should be strengthened by designating a multi-sectoral stakeholder commission with representatives from administration, opposition, judiciary, civil service, academia and civil society to conduct an open, rules-based, rigorous and transparent competition.
It also questioned the broader qualification criteria for prosecutors and the NAB chairman, which allowed only retired officials like former chief justice or a judge of the Supreme Court, chief justice of a high court, officer of the armed forces, or Grade 22 or equivalent federal government officer, which already limited the pool of candidates.
Finally, an autonomous and multi-stakeholder oversight body should be formed to audit the internal control processes for significantly improving transparency and legitimacy in NAB and minimise risks of politicisation, the IMF advised.

• Questions validity of judicial confessions used to convict accused; holds that appellants are entitled to benefit of doubt
ISLAMABAD: Former Supreme Court judge Justice Athar Minallah, in a recently uploaded judgement, expressed disappointment over the state of the criminal justice system, highlighting deficiencies in integrity, competence, and professionalism in investigations and prosecutions.
Justice Minallah headed a three-judge SC bench deciding an appeal filed by Said-ur-Rehman against a Peshawar High Court, Mingora Bench (Darul Qaza Swat) verdict dated June 9, 2021.
He observed that the case reflected the inability of investigating officers to effectively discharge their statutory duties.
The case was related to the murders of two young men, Shah Faisal, 18, and Shafi-ur-Rehman, 15, in a remote area of Chitral in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The complainant, Zulekha Bibi, and her husband Gul Zaman resided with a family in Jibraik village located on the bank of Chitral River.
A bridge connecting the village to Domel was hindered by Chitral Scouts, who restricted evening crossings unless permission was granted, the judgement recalled.
Zulekha Bibi reported to Sub-Inspector Paneen Nawaz on Feb 16, 2016, that her son, Shah Faisal, and her husband’s nephew, Shafi-ur-Rehman, had gone missing.
She named eight suspects, including the appellants, alleging abduction. The complaint was received on Feb 17, 2016.
Despite disclosing a cognisable offence, it was recorded in the daily diary rather than the register under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (CrPC).
An application for inquiry under Section 156(3) CrPC was submitted to a magistrate and allowed. After making the entry, SI Nawaz arrested both the appellants.
However, the events narrated in the complainant’s testimony during the trial differed from the version recorded in the official complaint.
The appellant, Said-ur-Rehman, was convicted under Section 201 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and sentenced to five years’ rigorous imprisonment, with an additional three years under Section 15(AA) PPC, to run concurrently with the benefit of Section 382-B CrPC.
The high court upheld the convictions and dismissed the appeals filed by the appellants through the impugned judgement of June 9, 2021.
The appellants challenged the decision before the SC, while the complainant also filed separate petitions against the acquittal of the co-accused.
Validity of judicial confessions
Justice Minallah observed that there was no last seen evidence except for the statements of the prosecution witnesses regarding the victims’ movement over the bridge, adding that the prosecution’s case rested mainly on the judicial confessions of the appellants under Section 164 CrPC.
He recalled that the SC had consistently held that a judicial confession might form the basis of a conviction if it was found to be true and made voluntarily.
Even a retracted confession retained evidentiary value if it was recorded in accordance with law and was corroborated by independent evidence.
Justice Minallah observed that the delay in recording a judicial confession, particularly while the accused remained in police custody, caste doubt on its voluntariness and necessitated heightened judicial scrutiny.
The judgement read that the prosecution’s case was in its entirety based on circumstantial evidence as there was no direct ocular testimony linking the appellants to the commission of the offence.
Therefore, their arrest was illegal, and the judicial confession, purportedly voluntary, was surrounded by serious doubts.
At the conclusion, the SC held that the appellants were entitled to the benefit of doubt and could not be convicted on the charges framed against them.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), in a statement released on Thursday, said that several countries also expressed interest in acquiring the battle-proven fighter aircraft.
The fighter has proved its combat capabilities during two conflicts with arch-rival India in 2019 and 2025. The biennial airshow is being held at Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport from November 17-21.
 






“Demonstrating increasing international confidence in Pakistan’s aviation industry, several countries expressed interest in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder. In a noteworthy development, an MoU was signed with a friendly country for the procurement of the JF-17 Thunder, marking another significant milestone in Pakistan’s expanding defence and industrial partnerships.”
A Pakistan Air Force (PAF) contingent arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to participate in the Dubai Airshow 2025. The contingent features the advanced JF-17 Thunder Block-III and the renowned Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, reflecting Pakistan’s growing expertise in indigenous military aviation.
 






The JF-17 Block-III is a 4.5-generation multi-role fighter jet equipped with an advanced radar and long-range, beyond-visual-range missiles capable of undertaking a wide variety of combat missions.
 
 

The ISPR further said Chief of the Air Staff Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu held a series of high-level engagements with air chiefs from friendly countries on the event’s sidelines.
He also held comprehensive discussions with UAE Defence Undersecretary Lieutenant General Pilot Ibrahim Nasser Al-Alawi and Air Force & Air Defence Commander Major General Rashid Mohammed Al-Shamsi on strengthening cooperation in advanced training, fostering collaboration in emerging aerospace technologies and enhancing the mechanisms for effective operational coordination.
“The UAE military leadership lauded PAF’s modernisation initiatives and growing indigenous capabilities with a shared resolve to further strengthen military engagement through joint exercises, professional exchanges and forward-looking partnerships,” the ISPR said.
During Pakistan’s conflict with India in May, the ISPR said the plane’s supersonic missiles destroyed the S-400 missile system in Adampur. It was also used to carry out strikes across the Line of Control from inside the Pakistani airspace, in response to the Indian strikes in Balakot in April 2019.
PAF’s Thunder
The JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter was jointly developed by China and Pakistan. Development on the aircraft started in 1999, and the maiden flight was conducted in 2003.
It is a single-engine multi-role fighter, capable of performing air superiority, interdiction, maritime strike, Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) and ground attack roles. The fighter was inducted as a replacement for the PAF’s ageing fleet A-5C, F-7P, Mirage 3 and Mirage 5 aircraft.
The initial Block 1 JF-17s were received in 2007, with production of the upgraded Block 2 JF-17s starting in 2013. The latest variant, Block 3s, were inducted in March 2023.
Armed with state-of-the-art weapons, the aircraft has emerged as an affordable and highly capable 4.5-generation fighter aircraft.
The JF-17 is flown by the air forces of Pakistan, Nigeria, Myanmar and Azerbaijan, which recently inducted Block 3s in the Azeri air force.</p><small>2025-11-20 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20234832c513908.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956319/hrcp-demands-inquiry-into-manhandling-of-imrans-sisters-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP demands inquiry into ‘manhandling’ of Imran’s sisters outside Adiala Jail</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan expressed concern and called for an inquiry into the alleged mistreatment of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters by police as the former were camped outside Adiala Jail.
In a post on X today, HRCP expressed concerns over the reports of Imran’s sisters being “manhandled” and noted that the rights of prisoners’ families to meet their relatives and the right to peaceful assembly are protected under national and international human rights law.
“Witness and media accounts indicate that family members and party representatives were engaged in a peaceful protest when police intervened, allegedly using physical force,” the statement read.
“HRCP calls for a transparent inquiry and urges authorities to ensure the rights, safety and dignity of all involved are fully respected,” it added.
 






The PTI had held a protest outside the jail on Tuesday, where Imran is currently incarcerated, but the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him.
Subsequently, the party held a sit-in outside the jail and criticised the prison administration for violating the court order in this regard. In a post on X, the party alleged that Aleema Khan, Noreen Niazi and Dr Uzma Khan, among others, were “subjected to violence and picked up by police”.

Two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that Washington had signalled to President Volodymyr Zelensky that Ukraine must accept a US-drafted framework to end the war, which includes territorial concessions and curbs to Ukraine’s armed forces.
The sources spoke on condition they not be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The acceleration in American diplomacy comes at an awkward juncture for Kyiv, with its troops on the back foot at the front and Zelensky’s government undermined by a corruption scandal. Parliament fired two cabinet ministers on Wednesday.

Moscow played down any new US initiative.
“Consultations are not currently underway. There are contacts, of course, but there is no process that could be called consultations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
He said Russia had nothing to add beyond the position President Vladimir Putin laid out at a summit with US President Donald Trump in August, adding that any peace deal must address the “root causes of the conflict”, a phrase Moscow has long used to refer to its demands.
‘Peace cannot be capitulation,’ says France
European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels were careful not to comment in too much detail about a US peace plan that has not been made public. But they made clear they would not accept demands for punishing concessions from Kyiv.
“Ukrainians want peace — a just peace that respects everyone’s sovereignty, a durable peace that can’t be called into question by future aggression,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. “But peace cannot be a capitulation.”
The White House has not commented on the reported proposals.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that Washington would “continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict”.
”Achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions,” Rubio wrote.
 






A US Army delegation, led by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll and the Army’s Chief of Staff Randy George, was in Kyiv and expected to meet Zelenskiy late on Thursday.
They met Ukraine’s top military commander Oleksandr Syrskyi late on Wednesday. Syrskyi said he told them the best way to secure a just peace was to defend Ukraine’s airspace, extend its ability to strike deep into Russia and stabilise the front line.
Fourth winter approaching
Russia has been pounding Ukrainian cities and infrastructure with nightly bombardments, killing civilians and causing power cuts as winter sets in.
Authorities said 22 people were still missing and 26 dead from airstrikes that destroyed an apartment block early on Wednesday, one of the worst attacks in months.
In Ternopil in western Ukraine, hundreds of miles from the front, smoke was still rising from smouldering masonry as crews on cranes tried to make nearby buildings safe and uncover more bodies.
Ihor Cherepanskyi was searching for the body of his great-grandmother, who had lived on the sixth floor. After the strike, he had run into the building to try to rescue her, but made it only as far as the fifth floor before the ceiling caved in.
“What kind of ‘strategic target’ is this?” he said.
With the fourth winter approaching of Europe’s deadliest war in eight decades, Russian troops have been inching forward and are poised to finally capture their first substantial city in nearly two years, the ruined eastern railway hub of Pokrovsk.
Ukraine said on Thursday it had received 1,000 bodies from Russia in the latest swap of human remains from the battlefield.

Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbour in 2022, occupies almost a fifth of Ukraine and says it will fight on unless Ukraine cedes additional land, accepts permanent neutrality and cuts its armed forces.
Ukraine says that would amount to capitulation and leave it unprotected should Russia attack again.
After the early months when Ukraine fended off Russia’s assault on Kyiv and recaptured swathes of territory, the war has settled for three years into a relentless grind along a 1,000-kilometre front line, with huge losses on both sides.
A Ukrainian counterattack stalled in 2023, and since then, Moscow has made slow but relentless progress, with the enemies separated across a charred no-man’s land, hunting each other’s forces down with drones.
Moscow says its expected capture of Pokrovsk will lead to further battlefield gains. Kyiv says Russia’s advances have only limited strategic significance, but it lacks the capability to halt them.
Trump, who returned to office this year vowing to swiftly end the war, has reoriented US policy away from staunchly supporting Ukraine towards accepting some of Moscow’s justifications for its invasion.
But he has also imposed sanctions on Russia’s two main oil companies, a step never taken by his more overtly pro-Ukrainian predecessor Joe Biden. November 21 is the deadline for foreign buyers of Russian oil to wind down their purchases.</p><small>2025-11-20 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634615-pakistans-jf-17-attracts-interest-at-dubai-airshow-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's JF-17 attracts interest at Dubai Airshow: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The by-election is scheduled for Sunday. The party claimed that campaigning began with state personnel tearing down the PTI candidate’s banners and posters, managing polling stations and then appointing subordinates of the PML-N candidate, who has served as chairman of the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) Board of Directors (BoD).
The PTI leaders allege that this amounts to an orchestrated attempt to tilt the electoral playing field in favour of the ruling party’s candidate, Muhammad Nauman.
The NA-129 seat, vacated after the death of Mian Muhammad Azhar, is being contested by his nephew, Chaudhry Arslan, who was nominated by Azhar’s son and former PTI Punjab acting president Hammad Azhar. The junior Azhar is absconding as he is wanted by the state in different cases.
The PTI is contesting the by-election only in Lahore, where the seat was vacated, while boycotting all by-elections in Sargodha, Mianwali, Sahiwal, Faisalabad, DG Khan and Muzaffargarh. The polls were scheduled after PTI MPAs were disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had strictly instructed the party leadership not to contest the by-elections as it would be tantamount to legitimising the disqualification of party legislators.
“The disqualified MPAs had believed in the PTI and didn’t desert it despite all kinds of hardships and these seats belonged to them. Our participation in the by-election will mean that the PTI is legitimising their act of disqualifying party legislators,” Imran was quoted as saying in a post published on his X account.
Before the election campaign could pick up, local police officials, caught on video footage, were seen removing banners of PTI candidate Chaudhry Arslan, who is contesting as an independent candidate on the ‘geyser’ election symbol.
The PTI leaders alleged the government had posted Lesco officials as presiding officers in the by-election.
“It is an interesting coincidence that the PML-N candidate is Lesco chairman and the presiding officers have also been picked from the same company,” Hammad wrote in a post on X.
He included four appointment orders of the polling staff in his post, showing that all four presiding officers were selected from Lesco.
 






Lesco CEO Ramzan Butt, however, rebutted Hammad’s post, stating that the appointment of some company officers as presiding officers for the by-election was the decision of the ECP and not Lesco or any other government organisation.
“We have not appointed our officers as presiding officers (POs) for performing election duty, but the ECP,“ the Lesco CEO told Dawn. “In previous elections, too, Lesco officers performed duties as POs. It is a routine matter.”
According to another senior Lesco officer, the company’s current chairman of the board was not the PML-N candidate, as he served as BoD head two years ago.
“The post of BoD chairman is honorary and the person who serves in this slot is not required to contest elections two to three years after leaving the job. So it’s ridiculous to say that Nauman is the current chairman of the Lesco BoD, as he left the position two years before,” the official maintained.
Hammad also alleged that the incumbent government was taking different administrative measures “due to public fear in NA-129”.
In his X post, Hammad alleged some POs were summoned to the Chief Minister’s House and issued threats, while the government was also employing other tactics to keep voters away, frustrated and afraid.
The PTI leader further claimed that the government relocated 51 polling stations several kilometres away from populated areas, transferred votes from one area to polling stations in another, removed PTI publicity material and arrested workers under police supervision, issued threats to local leaders over the phone, and prohibited Arslan from running his election campaign
The PTI leader further accused the authorities of moving the returning officer’s office even farther from the constituency and “presenting an administration tout as a fake PTI candidate”.
The latter comment referred to PTI leader Bajash Khan Niazi, who was issued a show-cause notice and eventually stripped of his basic party membership over a serious violation of party discipline.
The PTI issued a “public alert” on its letterhead stating that Niazi also ran a campaign against the PTI candidate and contested the election. It added that he was supporting the PML-N candidate.
Meanwhile, Opposition Leader in the Punjab Assembly Moeen Riaz Qureshi said that the “Form-47 Punjab government” had created a police state and was harassing the party candidate and workers.
“Our workers, after facing this government’s fascism, are standing tall and strong,” he wrote in a post on X, urging voters in NA-129 to come out in droves and vote for Arslan, while remembering the services of Mian Muhammad.

The PTI had formally requested Achakzai’s appointment to the position last month in the wake of the post being left vacant after Omar Ayub’s disqualification.
 
 

However, the National Assembly Secretariat maintains that Ayub’s disqualification is a sub-judice matter with Speaker Ayaz Sadiq making it clear that, in line with parliamentary practice, such announcements were made on the floor of the house to allow all members an equal opportunity to propose a candidate for the position and since he had not yet made any announcement regarding the schedule for submitting proposals, no request or nomination could be entertained at this stage.
A statement issued today by Dogar said that the PTI had nominated Achakzai for the role, after which the government had written a letter to him raising objections to the PkMAP chief’s name.
“PTI decided to stick with the name of Mahmood Khan Achakzai for the opposition leader,” the statement said, quoting Dogar as saying that the decision was “final”.
He added that Achakzai’s name was given after consulting PTI founder Imran Khan and would not be changed.
Dogar maintained that there would be no further consultation on the issue and he would discuss the letter with PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar before replying to it.
“The seat of the opposition leader has been vacant for the past two months, during which the 27th Amendment was passed. Mahmood Khan Achakzai is constitutionally part of the assembly; there is no justification for objection to his name. This is our constitutional right, the government should not delay it,” he said.
Barrister Gohar also said separately in a post on X that Imran nominated Achakzai for the role. “We can never review that decision. No meeting with anyone else is taking place.”
 






Along with Achakzai for the NA role, the PTI had nominated Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas for the Senate opposition leader slot, left vacant by Shibli Faraz’s disqualification.</p><small>2025-11-20 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/201551246378c48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956288/security-forces-kill-7-terrorists-in-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 7 terrorists in KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed seven terrorists during three operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media affairs wing said on Thursday.
According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij” were killed in operations conducted over two days, November 18 and 19.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
The ISPR said an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in KP’s Mohmand district on the reported presence of terrorists. “During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij’s location and after an intense fire exchange, four khawarij were sent to hell.”
Another IBO was conducted in the Lakki Marwat district. In the ensuing fire exchange, “two khawarij were effectively neutralised by the security forces,” the ISPR said.
It added that during the third encounter in the Tank district, security forces killed one more terrorist.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area,” ISPR the statement said, adding: “Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under the vision of ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the security forces for the successful operations.
A statement posted on the PM’s official X account quoted the premier as saying: “We will continue the fight against terrorism until it is eliminated from the country. The entire nation, including me, is standing shoulder to shoulder with the armed forces in our unwavering resolve to protect our dear homeland.”
 






The ISPR’s latest statement detailing the three operations in KP comes two days after it reported the killing of 38 terrorists in four IBOs conducted over a span of three days.
Of these operations, one was conducted in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, during which ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed.
Another operation was carried out Datta Khel in the North Waziristan district, where troops killed five more terrorists.
The remaining two IBOs took place between in Bajaur and Bannu districts, during which 11 and 12 terrorists were killed, respectively.
Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.
Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents follow the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged in the country over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-20 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20204534199ceee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956311/vibe-coding-is-enabling-a-completely-new-generation-of-founders-experts-say' target='_blank'><strong>‘Vibe coding’ is enabling a completely new generation of founders, experts say</strong></a><br><p>Amid Pakistan’s burgeoning but fragile entrepreneurial ecosystem, students at Karachi’s Institute of Business Administration (IBA) gathered on Thursday for an interactive session on venture creation and how artificial intelligence is speeding up the process of building and scaling startups.
The event, organised at the university’s main campus, featured Dr Jonathan Doerr, senior vice president at Disrupt.com (formerly Gaditek), who shared insights from 15 years of experience as an entrepreneur and investor.
“Who among you is using ChatGPT on a daily basis?” Dr Doerr asked, prompting (predictably) multiple hands to go up.
He highlighted that while the telephone took years to reach one million users, OpenAI’s ChatGPT achieved the same milestone in just five days, a fact confirmed by the company’s president and co-founder Greg Brockman.
 






“Open AI and other [large] language models enable a new wave of companies that are built,” Dr Doerr said, pointing out the example of the startup Lovable, which reached a $100 million annual recurring revenue (ARR) in eight to nine months.
ARR is a metric used to measure revenue an organisation generates over the course of one year. According to Dr Doerr, an ARR of $100m is a feat other companies have taken six or more years to achieve.
He explained how new ‘vibe coding’ tools allow even non-technical founders to generate fully functional websites and applications through simple prompts.
Vibe coding, a term coined by AI researcher Andrej Karpathy in early 2025, describes a workflow where the primary role shifts from writing code line-by-line to guiding an AI assistant to generate, refine, and debug an application through a more conversational process.
Dr Doerr said this shift is enabling “a completely new generation of founders” who no longer need large engineering teams to build prototypes or early-stage products. According to him, ‘big players’ like OpenAI, as well as competitors like Gemini, Meta, and Grok, provide the technological backbone allowing startups to accelerate much faster.
“We live in a time where everyone can very easily build things for the world; the barriers that maybe were there in the past are lower because of AI, because of the vibe coding platforms,” he told Dawn. “Is there a problem people have that you can solve? That’s the number one question you should ask yourself. And I don’t think there’s any limit to that.”
Dr Doerr showed a highly realistic AI-generated video, noting that while AI can dramatically speed up the creative process, “content expertise still needs to be there,” a point that sparked a broader discussion about the technology’s implications for the creative industry.
“It’s interesting because I said the video was generated by AI, right? That’s true. Nothing in that video is real. But what I didn’t say is that there was a creative person who understands video and music and content and he’s an expert. So, he knew, and it took him a few hours to build that,” he said.
On the subject of resistance and skepticism toward AI, Dr Doerr shared an anecdote about a founder of a company that helps restaurants and hotels place organised grocery orders. The founder discovered that a third of the orders coming in were actually generated by AI, manipulated by the company’s own employees.
“They’re manipulating the system because they believe they can stop AI,” he said. “There are a lot of people that obviously are afraid. We cannot stop that technology, none of us. So we need to kind of embrace it and see what it brings.”</p><small>2025-11-20 16:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20200340e2d888a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956308/customs-body-seizes-rs110m-in-jewellery-foreign-currency-from-alleged-smugglers-at-karachi-airport' target='_blank'><strong>Customs body seizes Rs110m in jewellery, foreign currency from alleged smugglers at Karachi airport</strong></a><br><p>Customs staff on Thursday seized around Rs110 million in gold jewellery and foreign currency from a pair of alleged smugglers at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, a statement from the Collectorate of Customs read.
According to the statement, two female passengers were stopped for inspection at the international departure hall, where customs staff unearthed $6,143 and two kilogrammes of gold from one passenger and $5,746 and 1.05kg of gold from the other.
“The total recovered gold jewellery and foreign currency is valued at approximately Rs110 million,” the statement read.
“The recovered items were taken into custody by Customs preventive staff [and] formal detention receipts were issued, and after completing initial legal proceedings, an FIR (first information report) has been lodged against the accused passengers for attempting to smuggle gold and foreign currency in violation of customs laws.”
Earlier this week, a man was stopped at Sialkot International Airport after he arrived from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for allegedly trying to smuggle mobile phones and foreign currency.
The suspect said he purchased mobile phones from the UAE and smuggled them to Pakistan. He travelled at least 19 times to the UAE from different airports in Pakistan this year.</p><small>2025-11-20 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634603-mqm-p-renews-push-for-new-province-in-sindh-warns-of-street-agitation' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P renews push for new province in Sindh, warns of street agitation</strong></a><br><p>

US outlet Bloomberg reported a day ago that PPL was reclaiming land from the sea to create a launchpad to ramp up oil and gas exploration. Citing PPL’s General Manager Exploration and Core Business Development, Arshad Palekar, Bloomberg reported that the artificial island would be created about 30 kilometres off the coast of Sindh, near Sujawal.
However, in a statement issued today, available with Dawn, PPL said: “We would like to clarify that the aforesaid media coverage is misleading and does not fully reflect the technical scope and design of the project.
“The activities underway relate to enabling safe drilling operations in a challenging marshy environment, rather than the development of a standalone offshore island. This is a technically complex and unique initiative, and is among the first projects in Pakistan to undertake drilling in such a marshy, tide-affected area.”
It said the project was located in the southern marshy region of the Sirani Block, which it said had previously remained unexplored due to significant operational and accessibility constraints. The company said the well’s initial drilling would be carried out in March 2026.
“PPL has already successfully acquired 2D and 3D seismic data in this area using specialised transition-zone equipment. Construction activities are currently in progress to support drilling operations, including development of loading/offloading jetties and an access road linking the offloading jetty to the well site. Due to the marshy subsoil conditions and tidal influence, both the access road and the well pad are being raised by approximately nine feet to ensure operational continuity and mitigate the effects of low and high tides.”
It added that the well’s location was approximately 30km from the mainland and a natural water channel of approximately 17km between the loading and offloading jetties would be used to transport rig equipment and materials via barges.
Pakistan’s drilling efforts are gaining fresh momentum after United States President Donald Trump indicated an interest in the country’s “massive oil reserves” in a social media post in July.
Since then, Islamabad has awarded offshore exploration licenses to local companies PPL, Mari Energies Ltd and Prime International Oil and Gas Company.</p><small>2025-11-20 14:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/201853328f18cce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956306/us-congress-report-validated-pakistans-triumph-in-may-conflict-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>US Congress report ‘validated Pakistan’s triumph’ in May conflict: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that a recent report submitted to the United States Congress had validated Pakistan’s triumph in the military confrontation with India in May.
“Pakistan’s military success over India in its four-day clash showcased Chinese weaponry,” said the report submitted by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission.
Following an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan, India launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
After laying the foundation stone for the Daanish School in Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) Bagh, the PM said in a speech that US President Donald Trump had also acknowledged multiple times that Pakistan downed seven Indian aircraft.
“The exemplary performance of the Pakistan Armed Forces brought the enemy to its knees, by the grace of God,” he said, crediting what he termed the leadership of Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
The prime minister added that on the economic front as well, the country was moving in the “right direction” and the government was fully focused on achieving sustainable development.
PM Shehbaz expressed hope that one day, India-occupied Kashmir would be freed and Daanish Schools would also be established there.
“Daanish Schools provide educational standards comparable with top institutions such as Aitchison College and Lawrence College, offering students access to modern technology, free uniforms, food, residence and qualified faculty preferably recruited from local communities,” he stated.
He directed the AJK education department to complete the project within the stipulated time, announcing that the Bagh school would be inaugurated on March 23, 2026.
The premier also announced that the foundation stone of another Daanish School would soon be laid in Neelum Valley.</p><small>2025-11-20 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20181713d517444.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956304/us-muslim-group-cair-says-texas-governor-stoking-anti-muslim-hysteria-vows-legal-action-against-terrorist-designation' target='_blank'><strong>US Muslim group CAIR says Texas governor ‘stoking anti-Muslim hysteria’, vows legal action against terrorist designation</strong></a><br><p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) has accused Texas Governor Greg Abbott of promoting “anti-Muslim hysteria” and advancing policies that serve the interests of Israel rather than Texans after the group was designated as a terrorist organisation in the American state.
“Greg Abbott is an Israel First politician who has spent months stoking anti-Muslim hysteria to smear American Muslims critical of the Israeli government. Although we are flattered by his obsession with our civil rights group, his defamatory proclamation has no basis in fact or law,” CAIR, the largest Muslim civil liberties organisation in the United States, said in a statement.
 






It came after Abbott designated the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR as “foreign terrorist and transnational criminal organisations”.
“Unlike Mr Abbott — who unleashed violence against Texas students protesting the Gaza genocide to satisfy his AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) donors — our civil rights organisation is an independent voice that answers to the American people, relies on support from the American people and opposes all forms of unjust violence, including hate crimes, ethnic cleansing, genocide and terrorism,” CAIR said.
It added that it had “successfully” sued Abbott three times for unconstitutional efforts to suppress pro-Palestinian speech and activism in the state. The organisation signalled it was prepared to challenge the governor again if he attempted to convert his latest criticisms into state policy.
“We are ready to sue him again if he attempts to turn this publicity stunt into real policy. See you in court again, Greg … if you dare,” it added.</p><small>2025-11-20 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20173336b1983d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956293/mqm-p-leadership-says-constitutional-provision-invokes-creation-of-new-provinces' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P leadership says constitutional provision invokes creation of new provinces</strong></a><br><p>The top leadership of the federal coalition partner Muttahida Qaumi Movement–Pakistan (MQM-P) pointed out on Thursday that constitutional provisions require the creation of new provinces after certain conditions are met, as politicking heats up ahead of a possible 28th constitutional amendment.
The party claimed on Monday that its proposed constitutional amendment, aimed at empowering local governments, would now be advanced as the 28th amendment, marking what the party called a “national, not merely Karachi-centric” reform initiative which would materialise in the coming months.
Speaking to reporters in Chiniot earlier, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah had also said that the 28th amendment, dealing with “public issues such as local bodies, population, the National Finance Commission … health-related issues”, could be introduced if there was political consensus.
The top leadership of MQM-P addressed a press conference in Karachi today, flanked by Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, in which it again raised issues regarding new provinces and local governments.
“A constitutional article also talks about and demands the formation of more provinces; it is not giving the authority but demands that whenever the population and the need increases”, hence, there should be increase in the number of districts, divisions, and even provinces as per Article 239, said Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
Article 239 controls the process of creating new provinces and requires a two-thirds majority in separate votes in the two houses of Parliament and then a further two-thirds majority in the provincial assembly of the affected province.
Siddiqui also questioned whether acting on a constitutional article could amount to treachery, instead stating that not acting through and implementing it would be a “betrayal”.
“This right of creating provinces in the Constitution is there since the time of Bhutto.”
 


He further said that “there is a lot of hue and cry over two of our demands and both of them are written in the Constitution. Only Pakistan’s rulers have this luxury in the whole world that they act on whichever constitutional provision they want and not on others”.
“Do rulers in other genuine democracies have this choice? We should accept that the democracy here is [made up] of landowners and feudals in Pakistan and where this [system] is present, democracy cannot exist.”
He added that education and progress could not be present in such a system.
Siddiqui added that the third tier of government was the most powerful and strengthened in the developed world and genuine democracies.
He said the party did not want anything for itself and only desired that the constitutional rights of the people be provided to them.
“No one has need for a democracy whose benefits can’t reach the common people.”
The MQM-P leader further said the party possessed no control of any rung of government and called for the Karachi mayor to be truly empowered in line with the mayors of other big metropolitan cities.</p><small>2025-11-20 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634580-us-lawmakers-praise-punjabs-brick-kiln-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>US lawmakers praise Punjab's brick kiln reforms</strong></a><br><p>

US President Donald Trump announced the sale this week, but officials said the Saudi aircraft will lack the superior features of Israel’s fleet, which include advanced weapons systems and electronic warfare equipment.
Israel enjoys unique permissions to modify its F-35s, including the ability to integrate its own weapons systems and add radar-jamming capabilities and other upgrades that do not require US approval.
Still, the Israeli Air Force opposed the planned sale, warning in a position paper to political leaders that it would undermine Israel’s air superiority in the region, The Times of Israel reported on Tuesday.
 
 

Even if Saudi Arabia gets the jets, it is unlikely to receive the AIM-260 Joint Advanced Tactical Missile (JATM), next-generation air-to-air missiles being developed for fifth-generation aircraft, according to Douglas Birkey, executive director of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies.
The 120-mile-plus range of the JATM represents the most sensitive missile technology associated with the F-35 platform. The missile would likely be offered to Israel.
The F-35 is customised to each country and pilot. The US has the most capable versions, with every other nation receiving a lesser fighter. It is possible to keep the Saudi jets, made by Lockheed Martin, technologically inferior to Israeli jets based on the software package permitted for the aircraft.
Beyond capability differences, Israel maintains a numerical advantage, currently operating two squadrons of F-35s with a third on order. Saudi Arabia would be limited to two squadrons that won’t be delivered for several years.
Israel has been the sole operator of F-35s in the region for roughly eight years, giving it significant experience in learning the aircraft’s systems and capabilities.
US officials said a formal qualitative military edge (QME) review will be required before the sale is finalised. Any sale to Saudi Arabia typically must be approved by Congress. One official had suggested Israel’s powerful support on Capitol Hill could hinder approval.
Officials also noted that Israel seeks to bring Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords to advance regional normalisation and to avoid straining ties with Trump.
Congressional opposition through a veto-proof joint resolution of disapproval would require a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override a presidential veto, a threshold considered difficult to reach.
The sale would put Saudi Arabia on equal footing with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, which have also been offered F-35s. Those deals remain stalled by disputes over delivery schedules, aircraft capabilities and concerns about Chinese access to the technology.</p><small>2025-11-20 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634572-forces-eliminate-30-terrorists-multiple-kp-operations' target='_blank'><strong>Forces eliminate 30 terrorists in multiple KP operations</strong></a><br><p>
