Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had met two key leaders from the province, ostensibly to get a handle on the political situation. The PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre believes that the PTI government in KP has failed to deliver for over a decade, and recent events have further cemented their conviction that the provincial government is failing to safeguard the lives of the people. Meanwhile, the PTI has warned against any attempt to topple the provincial government through constitutional means.
Addressing the matter at a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief said, “My advice would be that there should be a change in the province but if the PTI is in the majority, then the change should be from within the majority of the PTI. If the same people come together to bring a change in the provincial government, then it will be better.”
Fazl said he preferred this option rather than the opposition coming together and bringing a change in the government.
He added that it was his belief and that of his party that the majority of the province was “fake” and a product of rigging but it could not tolerate any political struggle or uncertainty, thus it would be better if there was a change from within the ruling PTI.
 


Speaking on the prevailing security situation in the province, Fazl said, “The common citizen’s life is insecure today.
“If the opposition parties contact us then will we talk to them and also try to hold an all party conference to discuss this issue and come up with a strategy to deal with it.”
Speaking about the merger of Fata with KP, he said, “We strongly opposed the merger when it was being done.”
Fazl said that the committee formed to bring reforms in ex-Fata did not have representation from KP.
“From all the parties, only we have been asked for representatives for the committee, but we haven’t given our representatives,” he added. The JUI-F chief said that the party would take its decision in consultation with tomorrow’s grand tribal jirga.
“Is this decision an admission of the failure of the previous decision (Fata merger) or another ploy to gain access to the minerals of the area?” he asked.

The fresh tariffs were announced in separate letters posted on Truth Social on Saturday.
Earlier this week, Trump issued new tariff announcements for a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, Canada and Brazil, as well as a 50pc tariff on copper.
The EU had hoped to reach a comprehensive trade agreement with the US for the 27-country bloc.
It had been bracing for the letter from Trump outlining his planned duties on the United States’ largest trade and investment partner after a broadening of his tariff war in recent days.
The EU initially hoped to strike a comprehensive trade agreement, including zero-for-zero tariffs on industrial goods, but months of difficult talks have led to the realisation that it will probably have to settle for an interim agreement and hope something better can still be negotiated.
The 27-country bloc is under conflicting pressures as powerhouse Germany urged a quick deal to safeguard its industry, while other EU members, such as France, have said EU negotiators should not cave into a one-sided deal on US terms.
Trump’s cascade of tariff orders since returning to the White House has begun generating tens of billions of dollars a month in new revenue for the US government. US customs duties revenue shot past $100 billion in the federal fiscal year through to June, according to US Treasury data on Friday.</p><small>2025-07-12 13:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613694-fazl-floats-change-in-kp-but-only-from-ptis-own-ranks' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl floats change in KP, but only from PTI's own ranks</strong></a><br><p>

Hussain was recently hospitalised in London due to “severe illness”, where he underwent multiple tests. London-based senior party leader Mustafa Azizabadi told Dawn.com that the MQM founder’s treatment was ongoing and “hopefully it’s not something serious”.
In a video message posted early on X today, Azizabadi stated that the MQM founder’s health had improved since yesterday.
“Altaf Hussain bhai (brother) has undergone some tests and blood transfusion has been given. The tests show that Altaf bhai’s health … has greatly improved,” Azizabadi said. “Doctors are treating him according to the test results.”
He highlighted that misinformation had spread about Hussain’s condition, calling it “upsetting”.
 






An update from MQM Coordination Committee Deputy Convener Qasim Ali said doctors conducted a detailed medical examination and agreed to continue treatment in light of the test reports from a day ago.
“Doctors have advised continuing blood transfusions for Altaf Hussain today as well due to a decrease in blood count.”
 






Previously known as the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, Hussain founded his party in 1984 to represent the Urdu-speaking community, which had migrated to Pakistan amid Partition.
 
 

Under Hussain’s leadership, MQM swept the 1988 election in Sindh’s urban areas, emerging as the third-largest party in the country.
The MQM under Hussain was accused of using violent tactics to attain and retain political power. On the contrary, Hussain maintained that the state and other political parties have targeted MQM and its workers ever since its formation.
Hussain currently lives in London, where he has been in self-imposed exile since 1992. He was later granted British citizenship. From London, Hussain played an active role in politics, regularly broadcasting political speeches to his followers in Karachi.</p><small>2025-07-12 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613688-sjc-rejects-proposal-to-release-names-of-judges-cleared-of-complaints' target='_blank'><strong>SJC 'rejects' proposal to release names of judges cleared of complaints</strong></a><br><p>

On June 27, PTI lawmakers protested in the house during CM Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s speech, where she highlighted her government’s achievements and budget priorities.
The proceedings broke into a disarray as lawmakers surrounded the speaker’s dais and raised slogans. In response, Speaker Malik Ahmed Khan suspended 26 opposition lawmakers for 15 sittings and fined 10 MPAs Rs200,000 each for “damaging public property”.
He then filed disqualification references with the Election Com­mission against the 26 PTI legislators over “unparliamentary conduct”.
 
 

The speaker’s move drew widespread condemnation for being “excessive”. Experts said the move was “disturbing” and set a “dangerous precedent”.

PA speaker meets penalised lawmakers; bipartisan committee to hold dialogue on deseating of members.

The speaker vehemently defended his neutrality and constitutional auth­ority to move against the opposition lawmakers, saying such powers had been exercised in the past and were legally valid.
However, a hint of rapprochement between the government and the opposition appeared on Thursday when Speaker Khan invited the 26 PTI MPAs to present their point of view on the disqualification references filed by treasury members.
The suspended MPAs, led by Opposition Leader Ahmed Khan Bhachar, reached the speaker’s chamber by noon on Friday.
They were also joined by Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman, PML-N’s chief whip Rana Arshad and others.
While formal hearings were held on applications submitted by the government members, discussions between the two sides continued for over an hour.
The two sides agreed to form a 15-member committee, headed by the speaker and having equal representation from the treasury and opposition, to sort out the issue.
The committee will meet at the assembly on Sunday to further the dialogue.
The speaker welcomed the move to find a “constitutional, legal, and parliamentary” solution to the issue.
“Dialogue and consultation are the essence of parliamentary democracy. Every disagreement can be resolved through a positive, dignified, and constitutional approach,” he said.
He termed the entire process a “positive parliamentary tradition” and hoped all parties would move forward with “wisdom, patience, and a commitment to democratic values”.
Talking to the media after the meeting, Mr Rehman said the speaker should make a decision in accordance with the Constitution and law and ruled out any leniency in penalising those who created a commotion in the house.

Earlier this week, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi called the SJC meeting to consider around two dozen pending complaints against superior court judges and a set of recommendations to streamline the process of handling complaints and to ensure transparency while probing allegations of misconduct against judges.
According to a press release dated today, seen by Dawn.com, the council examined 24 complaints under Article 209 of the Constitution. It said, “19 complaints were unanimously decided to be filed while five others were deferred for the time being.”
The meeting was chaired by CJP Afridi and attended by senior puisine judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice  Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.
The press release also said, “The proposed draft of SJC Secretariat Service Rules, 2025 was approved by the council,” adding that the Procedure of Enquiry, 2005 and amendments in the Code of Conduct “needed to be examined from legal and drafting point of view” which required further deliberation.
The SJC had appointed Justice Akhtar as head of a committee to propose amendments to the code of conduct.
In February, the SJC examined as many as 46 complaints against constitutional office-holders, disposed of 40 of them, sou­ght comments on five complaints and as­­ked for further information in one case.</p><small>2025-07-12 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613679-pakistan-bahrain-agree-to-deepen-security-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Bahrain agree to deepen security ties</strong></a><br><p>

Shiga’s Otsu police arrested the man, identified as a 24-year-old temporary worker, on Thursday on suspicion of assaulting and raping a teenage high school girl.
The man allegedly assaulted the “girl living in the prefecture, including by choking her, and then having sexual intercourse with her at a hotel in Otsu city”.
The incident took place in the early hours of June 21, according to the report, which was also carried by Tokyo Reporter.
It quoted the Otsu police as saying that the suspect and the girl did not know each other. The man had gone with her to the front of a hotel under the pretence of asking for directions, then forced her into a room, the police said.
The suspect denied the charges and was quoted as saying, “I did not force her.”
 
 

In May, Japanese police said they arrested a former taxi driver on suspicion of drugging and raping a female passenger, with media reports saying police found about 3,000 videos and images of him sexually assaulting around 50 women in his taxi or his home.
In India, a court jailed a 31-year-old man for life in February following the rape and murder of a young Irish woman in the tourist resort state of Goa, nearly eight years after the crime.
The month prior, a Kolkata court handed a life sentence to a police volunteer convicted of the rape and murder of a doctor, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and hospital strikes last year.
In March 2024, police in Dumka district of India’s Jharkhand state arrested eight men in connection with the gang rape of a Spanish tourist.
In 2016, five Indians who raped a Danish tourist after she asked for directions in New Delhi were sentenced to life in prison.</p><small>2025-07-12 10:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/12145306e3d7bc4.png?r=145801' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923712/pakistan-bahrain-pledge-to-boost-cooperation-in-counterterrorism-anti-human-trafficking' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Bahrain pledge to boost cooperation in counterterrorism, anti-human trafficking</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and his Bahraini counterpart Gen Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa have stressed the need to further boost collaboration in counterterrorism and anti-human trafficking efforts between their countries.
Pakistan and Bahrain share close fraternal ties based on shared culture and religion, with both countries having cooperation in security and economy.
Naqvi met with Gen Rashid in Manama on Thursday, according to the Bahrain News Agency (BNA). Both officials emphasised the need to “further strengthen their security collaboration”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported today.
 






The two sides held discussions on bilateral cooperation in counterterrorism, combating human trafficking and anti-narcotics efforts. They also mulled making the Pakistan-Bahrain Joint Security Committee more effective.
The Bahraini interior minister expressed his appreciation for cooperation and coordination between the two countries in various fields, including security, according to Radio Pakistan.
“We value the security cooperation with Pakistan,” he was quoted as saying.
On his part, Naqvi highlighted that enhancing cooperation in counter-narcotics and anti-human trafficking efforts was the “need of the hour”.
 
 

Naqvi was received by Gen Rashid upon his arrival at the Bahrain International Airport and was presented with a guard of honour at the Ministry of Interior headquarters, BNA reported.
Deputy Interior Minister Lt Gen Adel bin Khalifa Al-Fadhel, the chief of Public Security Forces, and senior ministry officials were also present during the meeting.
In February, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed a desire to increase the trade volume between the two countries in a meeting with a parliamentary delegation from Bahrain.
Speaking to the same delegation days before, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said Pakistan and Bahrain have vast opportunities to explore collaboration in investment, trade, information technology and tourism.
 
 

In December last year, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf met Bahrain’s top civil and military leadership during an official visit to the kingdom.
Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir met with King of Bahrain Sheikh Hamad bin Isa bin Salman Al-Khalifa in January 2024, and with Commander of the National Guard Gen Shaikh Mohamed bin Isa bin Salman Al-Khalifa in March that year.</p><small>2025-07-12 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/12120939a7b09e3.jpg?r=122638' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923700/worker-in-critical-condition-after-us-immigration-raid-on-california-farm' target='_blank'><strong>Worker in critical condition after US immigration raid on California farm</strong></a><br><p>A farm worker was in critical condition on Friday, his family said, after being injured during a raid by US immigration agents on a legal cannabis farm in California that resulted in the arrests of 200 undocumented migrants and clashes with protesters.
US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, called demonstrators involved in attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents “slimeballs” and said they should be arrested.
In another development, a district judge ordered a halt to “roving patrols” in Los Angeles by federal agents who were detaining suspected undocumented migrants without probable cause and denying them due process.
District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong ordered an end to the arrests, which she said were being made “based upon race alone”, on whether a person was speaking Spanish or English with an accent or because of their place of work.
Trump’s remarks and the court order come a day after a chaotic raid on a cannabis plantation in Ventura County, some 56 miles (90 kilometers) from Los Angeles, left one farm worker critically injured.
The United Farm Workers labour union had said in an X post that the worker had “died of injuries they sustained as a result of yesterday’s immigration enforcement action”. But the family on a GoFundMe page said he was in critical condition and unlikely to survive.
“He was chased by ICE agents, and we were told he fell 30ft (9 metres). My uncle’s life is in critical condition; doctors have told us he won’t make it.
His injuries are catastrophic. His heart is still beating.”
The Ventura County Medical Centre, which told ABC News that he was in critical condition, did not respond to AFP calls for more details.
 






Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman, said the man who died was never in custody.
“Although he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a greenhouse and fell 30 feet (10 metres),” McLaughlin said.
“[Customs and Border Patrol] immediately called a medivac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.”
The DHS said 200 undocumented migrants were arrested during raids on marijuana growing sites in Carpinteria and Camarillo on Thursday and 10 children were rescued “from potential exploitation, forced labour, and human trafficking”.
Glass House Brands, which owns the farms, said in a statement that it has “never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors”.
DHS said more than 500 “rioters” had attempted to disrupt the operation and four US citizens are facing charges for assaulting or resisting officers.
Tear gas was used against the protestors, some of whom were seen in television footage throwing projectiles at law enforcement vehicles.
The department said immigration agency vehicles were damaged and a $50,000 reward was being offered for the arrest of an individual who allegedly fired a gun at law enforcement officers.
Showdown
In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he had watched footage of “thugs” throwing rocks and bricks at ICE vehicles, causing “tremendous damage”.
Trump said he was authorising law enforcement officers who are “on the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these SLIMEBALLS, using whatever means is necessary to do so”.
“I am giving Total Authorisation for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public,” he said.
 






Trump, who campaigned on a pledge to deport millions of migrants, has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.
The Republican president sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month to quell protests against roundups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.
 
 

The cannabis farm in Camarillo was calm during a visit by an AFP reporter on Friday as workers waited in line to collect their belongings and paychecks.
“We’ve been here since six this morning asking questions but they’re not giving us any information,” said Saul Munoz, a 43-year-old Colombian whose son was detained on Thursday.
“I just want to know how he’s doing,” Munoz said. “Bring him back to me and if it’s time for us to leave, we’ll leave.

Speaking as the chief guest at the Sindh Energy Diversity Conference, Mr Shah described the province as the country’s “energy basket,” endowed with rich reserves of coal, natural gas, wind and solar energy.
However, Mr Shah pointed out that federal policies had created ongoing challenges that hindered energy sector development in the province. He also recounted historical setbacks, including investor reluctance after the 1996 government change and federal opposition to wind power projects in Sindh.
Mr Shah urged the gathering of stakeholders, experts and policymakers to discuss the province’s vast energy resources and the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions.
 






The event, organised by Energy Update and the Energy Department of the Government of Sindh, highlighted the province’s commitment to harnessing its rich mix of conventional and renewable energy sources to ensure energy security, sustainability and affordability for all citizens.
The chief minister said that over the past six years, 30 million tonnes of coal had been supplied from Thar to Independent Power Producers (IPPs), generating 31 gigawatts of electricity and serving three million homes.
He announced the construction of a 105-kilometre railway line to connect Thar coal to global markets, calling it a game-changing project.
The chief minister emphasised that Sindh was uniquely positioned with an abundance of natural gas and coal reserves, notably Thar coal, which had the potential to meet the country’s electricity needs for decades. “The province is also leading the way in renewable energy initiatives, including the operational wind corridor and several solar energy projects aimed at reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting clean energy,” he added.
Mr Shah reaffirmed the government’s vision of collaborating with the public and private sectors to develop robust energy policies, promote investments in hybrid solutions, and ensure that every household in Sindh has access to reliable and affordable electricity.
He highlighted the success of the Nooriabad project, which supplies 100 megawatts of electricity to Karachi.

The interest shown by children in AI tools has doubled during the past year, according to a report, with businesses also employing them on a wide scale. However, experts have warned that AI’s development should not be guided by market forces alone and stressed its regulation.
Khawaja met with Google’s Regional AI Developer Ecosystem and Communities team on Friday to explore strategic collaboration in advancing Pakistan’s AI landscape.
In the policy discussion, the minister emphasised the government’s strategic focus on AI training across three critical domains: mainstream education from kindergarten to university; workforce development, including freelancers; and industrial innovation.
 
 

According to Radio Pakistan, the minister also stressed the need for inclusive access to tools such as the AI Seekho programme, sandbox environments and cloud credits.
Meanwhile, the Google team provided an overview of their developer ecosystem in the region. It highlighted the contributions of Google Developer Groups, community-based AI initiatives, and impactful platforms like Taleemabad.
The minister called for deeper collaboration between Google and the Ministry of IT & Telecommunication, as well as for the effective integration of Pakistan into the global AI ecosystem, according to state-run PTV.
Islamabad is set to host Google I/O Extended, a global series of community-led tech meetups for developers, today and tomorrow. Lahore will hold the session on July 26.
Earlier this week, Pakistani platform SOCByte launched the country’s first AI-powered cybersecurity programme designed to provide critical information to professionals.
Last week, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal called for the integration of AI into the national development strategy and announced the establishment of a national AI fund to provide financial support for innovative ideas and pilot projects.
 
 

In June, the education ministry and Google announced a “strategic collaboration” to improve access to education and support the development of a digital ecosystem for learning.
In March, the Sindh government, in collaboration with Google and Tech Valley, announced more than 30,000 Google Career Certificate scholarships for public sector universities to empower youth with globally recognised digital skills across the province.</p><small>2025-07-12 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/121306582f64c21.jpg?r=131904' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923703/air-india-crash-report-shows-pilot-confusion-over-engine-switch-movement' target='_blank'><strong>Air India crash report shows pilot confusion over engine switch movement</strong></a><br><p>A preliminary report depicted confusion in the cockpit shortly before an Air India jetliner crashed and killed 260 people last month, after the plane’s engine fuel cutoff switches flipped almost simultaneously and starved the engines of fuel.
The Boeing 787 Dreamliner bound for London from the Indian city of Ahmedabad began to lose thrust and sink shortly after takeoff, according to the report on the world’s deadliest aviation accident in a decade released on Saturday by Indian accident investigators.
The report by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) about the June 12 crash raises fresh questions over the position of the critical engine fuel cutoff switches.
Almost immediately after the plane lifted off the ground, closed-circuit TV footage showed a backup energy source called a ram air turbine had deployed, indicating a loss of power from the engines.
In the flight’s final moments, one pilot was heard on the cockpit voice recorder asking the other why he cut off the fuel. “The other pilot responded that he did not do so,” the report said.
It did not identify which remarks were made by the flight’s captain and which by the first officer, nor which pilot transmitted “Mayday, Mayday, Mayday” just before the crash.
The commanding pilot of the Air India plane was Sumeet Sabharwal, 56, who had a total flying experience of 15,638 hours and, according to the Indian government, was also an Air India instructor. His co-pilot was Clive Kunder, 32, who had 3,403 hours of total experience.
 
 

The fuel switches had almost simultaneously flipped from run to cutoff just after takeoff. The preliminary report did not say how the switches could have flipped to the cutoff position during the flight.
The crash is a challenge for Tata Group’s ambitious campaign to restore Air India’s reputation and revamp its fleet, after taking the carrier over from the government in 2022.
Air India acknowledged the report in a statement. The carrier said it was cooperating with Indian authorities but declined further comment.
Fuel switches
Experts have said a pilot would not be able to accidentally move the fuel switches.
“If they were moved because of a pilot, why?” asked US aviation safety expert Anthony Brickhouse.
The switches flipped a second apart, the report said, roughly the time it would take to shift one and then the other, according to US aviation expert John Nance. He added that a pilot would normally never turn the switches off in flight, especially as the plane is starting to climb.
Flipping to the cutoff almost immediately cuts the engines. It is most often used to turn engines off once a plane has arrived at its airport gate and in certain emergency situations, such as an engine fire. The report does not indicate there was any emergency requiring an engine cutoff.
At the crash site, both fuel switches were found in the run position and there had been indications of both engines relighting before the low-altitude crash, said the report, which was released around 1:30am IST today (1:00am PKT).
Asked about the report, the father of first officer Kunder told reporters, “I am not from the airline”, declining to comment further during a prayer meeting held in the memory of the airline’s crew on Saturday in Mumbai, where emotional scenes played out among grieving relatives.
The US National Transportation Safety Board thanked Indian officials for their cooperation in a statement and noted that there were no recommended actions in the report aimed at operators of Boeing 787 jets or the GE engines.
The US Federal Aviation Administration said its priority was to follow the facts where they lead, and it was committed to promptly addressing any risks identified throughout the process.
Boeing said it continued to support the investigation and its customer, Air India. GE Aerospace did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Crash probe
The AAIB, an office under India’s civil aviation ministry, is leading the probe into the crash, which killed all but one of the 242 people on board and 19 others on the ground.
Most air crashes are caused by multiple factors, with a preliminary report due 30 days after the accident, according to international rules, and a final report expected within a year.
The plane’s black boxes, combined cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders, were recovered in the days following the crash and later downloaded in India.
The report said “all applicable airworthiness directives and alert service bulletins were complied [with] on the aircraft as well as engines.”
 
 

The airport closed-circuit TV recording from Ahmedabad had earlier shown the Air India plane rose to a height of 650 feet after it took off, but then suddenly lost altitude, crashing in a fireball into a nearby building.
The investigation report said as the Dreamliner lost altitude, it initially made contact with several trees and an incineration chimney, before hitting the building.
Air India has faced additional scrutiny on other fronts after the crash.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said last week it plans to investigate its budget airline, Air India Express, after Reuters reported the carrier did not follow a directive to change engine parts of an Airbus A320 in a timely manner and falsified records to show compliance.
India is banking on a boom in aviation to support wider development goals, with New Delhi saying it wants India to be a job-creating global aviation hub along the lines of Dubai.</p><small>2025-07-12 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613664-govt-opposition-form-negotiation-committees-over-punjab-lawmakers-disqualification' target='_blank'><strong>Govt, opposition form 'talks committees' over Punjab MPAs' disqualification</strong></a><br><p>

“EducationUSA at the United States Educational Foundation in Pakistan (USEFP) hosted these annual pre-departure orientations (PDOs) to prepare students for the educational and cultural journey ahead. Discussion topics included classroom and campus life, resources for international students, and adapting to new cultural experiences,” the statement read.
Parents, school counsellors and alumni of US institutions also joined the discussions to help ensure the students’ successful transition.
 
 

According to the Institute of International Education’s 2024 Open Doors report, nearly 11,000 Pakistanis were enrolled at US institutions last year—an all-time high for Pakistan and an 8.1 per cent increase over the previous year.
“Pakistan is home to thousands of alumni of US colleges and universities,” said US Embassy Islamabad Minister Counsellor for Public Diplomacy Lisa Swenarski.
“We are extremely proud to support students through EducationUSA’s advising services, which make it possible for smart and motivated Pakistani students to have life-changing educational experiences in the United States, enrich our campuses and culture, and return home to become the future leaders of their country,” she said.
The PDO is the final step in EducationUSA’s advising programme, which guides hundreds of Pakistani students each year through the application process for admission to US colleges and universities.
The event also serves as a celebration of the students’ achievements before they depart for campuses across the United States.
“We are committed to supporting and encouraging Pakistani students to realise their dream of higher education in the United States,” said USEFP Executive Director Dr Peter Moran.
 
 

“A US education has the power to change the trajectory of a student’s life. Our EducationUSA advisers, many of whom are US graduates themselves, help students prepare for their journeys with practical tools that will help make their endeavours successful. We look forward to seeing students thrive at US institutions and then contribute toward addressing local and global challenges following the completion of their programmes,” he said.
Education USA is the official US government source of information on US higher education.
“It offers accurate, comprehensive, and current information on accredited postsecondary institutions in the United States, as well as free guidance and assistance to students interested in applying to US colleges and universities.
“In Pakistan, EducationUSA is hosted at USEFP,” the statement read.

A strong contingent of force from several police stations responded to the emergency 15 call from the community when local residents were about to march towards their (Ahmadi) worship place.
“Six SHOs, a DSP, a divisional SP and an SSP rushed to the site along with armed policemen on the direction of Lahore Operations DIG Faisal Kamran to rescue members of the Ahmadi community at any cost,” a police officer told Dawn. He said some women and children were also among the worshippers.
As the mob tried to surround the worship place, the police launched a major operation and rescued women, children and other worshippers, shifted them to a secured area and increased security of the worship place.
Police high-ups also engaged known local figures, including religious leaders, to maintain peace.
An Ahmadi worshipper told Dawn his community had built a worship place on Poonch Road and got it registered with the relevant government department. He said during their prayers, they heard some slogans outside the worship place, which terrified the community.
“I also rushed out of the worship place using the backdoor, left my motorbike unattended and ran to avoid a possible attack.”
He said he witnessed many charged people gathering on the road, calling people to reach the site hurriedly. He said they seemed to be members of a religious party hurling some serious threats and demanding closure of the Ahmadi worship place.
 
 

“The Ahmadi community took a sigh of relief when a heavy contingent of the police reached the site, took many of them into custody and rescued the worshippers, shifting them to a safe place,” he said.
He said the protesters had accused the Ahmadi community of violating the time schedule of worship on Friday. However, he rejected the charge and said they were following the given schedule.
The Operations DIG said the police managed to thwart the possible mob attack on the Ahmadi worship place. He said those who gathered outside the Ahmadi worship place were members of a religious-cum-political party pressing for a change in Ahmadi worship timing.

Organised under the banner of Bara Siyasi Ittehad (BSI) at the Minara Jumaat Chowk, the peace rally, which later turned into an anti-military operation demonstration, was attended by thousands of people from all parts and corners of Bara and Tirah with parliamentarians, tribal elders, political parties’ representatives and civil society activists also in attendance.
Amid vociferous sloganeering, the BSI president Hashim Khan Afridi declared that people of Tirah and Bara would not submit to any pressure regarding the start of a new military operation, forced displacement or formation of armed lashkars (peace committees).
He called upon the government to reconsider its policy about Qabayal (residents of the seven merged districts) as it was a flawed policy and had thus failed. “The government has to explain to the people as to how many militants had been killed during the previous military operations and how much the local population suffered,” he said amid thumping response from the rally participants, who called for reversing the decision of launching a military operation in Tirah.

Participants threaten to block roads if residents forced to vacate houses

Mr Afridi warned that if the security forces tried to forcibly evict residents of Tirah from their houses, the people of Tirah and Bara would block the Sheen Kamar Road and would not allow any family to be shifted to camps.
“The displaced families of Tirah along with activists of BSI would establish protest camps in front of the Corps Commander’s House, Governor’s House and Chief Minister’s House in Peshawar till they were honourably sent back to their homes and the military operation halted.
He questioned the future of nearly 500 displaced families of Sipah, Kamarkhel, Kakakhel and Zakhakhel, who were forced to leave their houses in November 2023 but were still awaiting their return and were not even recognised as IDPs. “Why would we now agree to vacating our houses when we have such distressing examples of maltreatment of the displaced families before us,” he added.
MNA Iqbal Afridi, MPAs Suhail Afridi, Abdul Ghani, former MNA Hamidullah Jan Afridi, tehsil chairman Mufti Kafeel and Tirah elders Mulana Hazrat Khan, Sher Afzal, Zahidullah, Khan Wali and others also addressed the rally.
They threatened in their emotional outbursts that people of Tirah and Bara would physically resist any military operation and forced eviction. “We will not vacate our houses at any cost and instead we will force both the militants and the military to leave our soil,” they cautioned.
They alleged that armed groups were allowed to re-enter Tirah under a well-thought-out plan in order to capture Tirah and its natural wealth. “Our elders were eliminated in order to terrorise the local population and put pressure on them for the start of another military operation,” they said as emotionally charged crowd raised full-throated slogans against any possible operation.
They said that they might be having political or tribal disputes among themselves but they were united for the restoration of peace in Bara and Tirah and were opposed to military operation and forced displacement.
The participants of the Bara rally, which most in the region believed was the biggest so far in any part of Khyber, also condemned the martyrdom of Awami National Party’s Bajaur leader Maulana Khan Zeb, and demanded the arrest of his killers.
The rally participants through a resolution demanded the release of Malak Naseer Ahmad Kukikhel, MNA Ali Wazir, Samad Lala and other political prisoners without delay.

Dr Siddiqui, a neuroscientist, has been imprisoned in the United States since 2008 after being convicted on charges of attempted murder of US personnel in Afghanistan.
When the petition filed by her sister Dr Fawzia Siddiqui came up for hearing, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan grilled Additional Attorney General Rashid Hafeez over the delay in submission of the government’s response to the case.
The court noted that the government had been asked in June to submit a response but it did not file it till date.
 
 

“If the federal government’s report is not presented in my court, I will summon the entire cabinet. Why not initiate contempt of court proceedings against all ministers in the federal cabinet, including the prime minister?” he remarked.
However, the additional attorney general requested for five more days, assuring the court that government response would be placed before it after five working days.
Justice Khan noted that his annual leave would begin next week, but then reluctantly agreed to extend the deadline for response until next week.
When Advocate Imran Shafiq, representing the petitioner, informed the court of a miscellaneous application filed regarding a proposed meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Dr Fawzia, the judge questioned the rationale behind it.
 
 

“What will Fawzia Siddiqui do with the prime minister? Doesn’t the prime minister already know the situation?” he asked.
The court later adjourned the hearing till July 21, warning that government inaction would result in serious legalconsequences.

Briefing the committee, Mr Abbasi said that during a recent meeting with Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in Lahore, she showed interest in supporting the infrastructure initiative, which aligns with the broader goals of modernising Pakistan’s railway network.
The Main Line-1 (ML-1) project, being carried out under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), is a key part of this effort and aims to upgrade the country’s primary rail corridor from Karachi to Peshawar. With an estimated cost of $6.8bn, the project is expected to enhance transport efficiency, reduce travel time, and facilitate freight and passenger movement, particularly as part of Pakistan’s regional connectivity strategy with Central Asia.
Meanwhile, Mr Abbasi announced that Pakistan Railways had achieved a record earning of Rs93bn during the fiscal year 2024-25 — the highest in the organisation’s 78-year history. Of this, Rs47.5bn came from passenger services, while freight services generated Rs31.5bn. The earnings during FY24 stood at Rs88bn.

Minister says PR earned record Rs93bn in FY25

The minister also reiterated that if international funding for ML-1 does not materialise, the government is considering using its own resources to initiate the project. Pakistan continues to seek Chinese investment for the scheme.
ML-1 project
Separately, Pakistan Railways Chairman Syed Mazhar Ali Shah told the Senate Standing Committee on Railways that the ML-1 project would commence in the current fiscal year. The ministry, he said, had submitted a proposal to the federal government seeking Rs75bn in funding for the project under the 2025-26 budget.
 
 

Minister Abbasi informed the committee that PR had decided to outsource its freight services to the private sector, adding that several multinational companies had already shown interest in operating the service.
Responding to queries about freight operations, the PR chief executive officer told the committee that the organisation currently handles about 5-8 per cent of the country’s freight.
The committee stressed the need for improving freight services to meet growing domestic demand.
The railways minister said all PR rest houses are being outsourced to reputable companies to ensure better utilisation. Regarding the current status of the Royal Palm Golf and Country Club in Lahore, the Railways Board secretary informed the committee that 12 bids were expected and would be opened on July 22. The leasing process, he said, is being supervised by the Supreme Court.

Topline Securities attributed the gains to consistent inflows from mutual funds, as investors continue to shift from fixed-income to equity funds. Data from the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Ltd confirmed the trend.
Major positive contributions came from United Bank Ltd, Hub Power, Millat Tractors, Kohinoor Textile Mills, and Pakistan State Oil, which collectively added 430 points to the index.
Ali Najib, Deputy Head of Trading at Arif Habib Ltd, said the index traded both ways during the session but ended on a strong note, supported by healthy macroeconomic indicators and upbeat corporate earnings.
 
 

A key driver of Friday’s rally was UBL’s announcement of its highest-ever quarterly cash dividend of Rs8 per share (Rs20bn), alongside its second-quarter results. The bank posted earnings of Rs11.43 per share — up 93pc year-on-year. While earnings were in line with expectations, the dividend surpassed market forecasts of Rs5.5 per share, reflecting strong profitability and a focus on shareholder returns.
The overall mood was further lifted by the country’s foreign exchange reserves hitting a 36-month high of over $20bn and a strong performance by the auto sector, which grew 43pc in FY25, surpassing expectations.
However, profit-taking in some banking stocks slightly offset gains.
Market participation declined, with 764 million shares traded — down 18.75pc from the previous session — while the trading value increased 11.38pc to Rs40.16bn. The Bank of Punjab (BOP) led the volume chart with 94.1 million shares changing hands.
Investor sentiment remains upbeat, with support levels rising to 132,000 and 130,000, reflecting confidence in the sustainability of the current rally.
The ongoing earnings season, especially in the banking and cement sectors, along with improved macroeconomic indicators such as strong remittances, external financing inflows, and revised Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) spending of Rs1.05tr for FY25, are seen as key catalysts.

Built 52 years ago in Karachi with Russia’s support, the PSM is a state-owned company that has the capacity to produce long-rolled and heavy metal products in the country. The PSM ceased operations in 2015.
The agreement was signed at the Pakistan Embassy in Moscow by secretary of industries and production Saif Anjum and general director of Industries Engineering LLC of Russia, Vadim Velichko.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister, Haroon Akhtar Khan, witnessed the agreement signing at a ceremony together with Pakistan’s Am­­bassador to the Russian Fede­ration Muhammad Khalid Jamali.
Speaking on the occasion, the special assistant to the PM said that reviving the Pakistan Steel Mills with the support of Russia reflected “our shared history and commitment to a stronger industrial future”.

Islamabad, Moscow also agree to establish new mills in Karachi

The project aims to restart and expand the steel production in the country, marking a new chapter in bilateral cooperation.
Following the official closure of the PSM in 2024, the Sindh government sought Russia’s assistance in restoring the ageing infrastructure, which had been incurring losses for decades.
A high-powered delegation of Pakistan, led by Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Foreign Affairs, Tariq Fatemi, and Mr Haroon Akhtar Khan, who is also the focal person for the PSM project, held a meeting with Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk in Moscow on Wednesday.
During the talks, Mr Akhtar conveyed to the Russian side that Pakistan’s government attached high importance to the ongoing discussions on the new Steel Mills in Karachi, as the project carried an important legacy of Pakistan’s relations with Russia, that could serve as a leap forward symbol of future cooperation and partnership.
Pakistan and Russia have also agreed to establish new steel mills in Karachi.
The idea of new steel mills was discussed during a meeting between Russian Representative Denis Nazaroof and Special Assistant Haroon Akhtar Khan.
Several attempts were made in the recent past to sell the PSM to global private ownership under the government’s programme, but the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills is not on the privatisation programme agenda for 2024-2029 of the present government.
The PSM is the largest industrial mega-corporation in the country, having a production ca­­pacity of 1.1 to 5.0 million tonnes of steel and iron foundries.

• KP CM orders action against negligent officials
PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur has ordered action against officials of several government departments over their negligence, which led to the drowning of over a dozen people in a flooded river last month.
On June 27, at least 14 people, including 10 from the same family, died after being swept away in a flash flood triggered by heavy rains in the Swat River.
The committee, formed by CM Gandapur to fix responsibility, found negligence and shortcomings on the part of the district administration, irrigation and local government departments and Rescue 1122, which resulted in the tragedy.
 
 

The relevant departments will initiate action against officers found responsible and complete disciplinary proceedings within 60 days, read an official statement issued by the CM secretariat.
The 63-page report submitted by the Provincial Inspection Team (PIT) said weather advisories issued by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and district administration “were not effectively implemented”.
It also highlighted a lack of coordination among the police, revenue, irrigation, rescue, tourism police, and other departments.
The malfunctioning of early warning systems resulted in delayed communication about the flood. Moreover, hotel owners failed to alert tourists about the dangers in riverine areas.
The emergency response by Rescue 1122 after receiving information of the accident was delayed, while the organisation was also short on trained personnel and necessary rescue equipment.
There was no clear designation of responsibilities among departments and institutions for riverside safety, and no risk classification existed for tourist spots along rivers, it read.
 
 

The report also stated that at the district level, there were no organised SOPs to ensure public safety during the monsoon season. The enforcement of Section 144, which would have stopped the victims from going into the river, was lax.
The report also pointed out construction along the river in violation of the rules. It said the regulatory mechanisms for approving building plans and defining encroachments were “ambiguous and inconsistent”.
Recommendations
The PIT identified systemic shortcomings in dealing with such incidents and proposed measures to address these deficiencies.
It stressed the need for a special law to regulate construction activities along rivers effectively.
The report said the negligent departments and institutions identified in the inquiry report will have to take corrective measures, including the issuance of new protocols and regulatory frameworks, within 30 days.
During the same period, comprehensive regulatory frameworks for river safety and building regulations would be prepared, with immediate enforcement of new laws and rules, and strict implementation of existing ones.
 
 

To ensure the implementation of the PIT recommendations, an oversight committee, headed by the KP chief secretary, will be formed. It will also transform PIT’s recommendations into actionable key performance indicators.
The oversight committee will submit monthly progress reports to the chief minister. It will incorporate river safety modules into the upcoming monsoon contingency plan and ensure the swift execution of plans to enhance Rescue 1122’s capabilities.
To prevent such incidents during the monsoon season, the PIT said a large-scale public awareness campaign would be launched throughout the province by relevant departments, including information, relief and tourism.
The report also highlighted steps taken by the provincial government and local administration after the incident.
An operation was launched to demolish encroachments along rivers across the province, the report said, adding 127 illegal buildings were sealed and constructions on over 682 kanals of land were demolished.
A total of 1,874 kanals of encroached land was identified, out of which encroachments over 1,019 kanals were removed.
The demarcation of 609 kilometres of riverbeds was carried out, and 174 barriers were installed.

Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan, addressing a weekly press briefing, said Doval’s statements reflected “a deliberate attempt to mislead the public” and violated “the norms of responsible statecraft”.
“Boasting of military aggression against a sovereign nation is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and established principles of international law,” Mr Khan said.
“Rather than resorting to fictitious narratives, India should accept the downing of six fighter jets and severe damages to other military targets.”
 


Mr Khan also said it was public knowledge that the so-called terrorist targets attacked by India resulted in the deaths of civilians.
To a question, Mr Khan said: “Indian involvement in sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan is very clear, and the international community is now becoming more aware of it.”
He added: “Initially, the Indian state-sponsored terrorism was targeting Pakistan, but we have seen that in the recent past, it has gone global. If this Indian malign approach is not checked, we have seen the consequences of that.”
Mr Khan accused India of orchestrating a global assassination campaign, targeting individuals in Canada, the United States, and other countries.
 
 

Responding to questions about declassified US documents that revealed the US spent billions of dollars in Afghanistan to defeat the Soviet Union, with facilitation by Pakistan, Mr Khan said: “What is in the past is in the past and we look at the past to guide us to a better future, rather than to become its prisoners.”
Mr Khan declined to comment on US President Donald Trump’s reported threat to bomb Beijing if China invaded Taiwan, saying he would not speculate.
However, he reiterated Pakistan’s close ties with China, describing the country as a “close friend” and “iron brother,” and emphasised strategic cooperation and relations.
“We historically have very strong relations with the US and we are keen to continue these relations,” Mr Khan said. He also expressed hope that a trade agreement with the US would be signed soon.

An officially private effort, the GHF began operations on May 26 after Israel halted supplies into the Gaza Strip for more than two months, sparking warnings of imminent famine.
Since those operations began and through July 7, UN rights office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said the agency had recorded “615 killings in the vicinity of the GHF sites”.
Another 183 people had been killed “presumably on the routes of aid convoys” carried out by UN and other aid organisations, she told reporters in Geneva.
“This is nearly 800 people who have been killed while trying to access aid,” she said, adding that “most of the injuries are gunshot injuries”.
 



Israeli forces kill 30 more Palestinians in air, ground attacks

GHF operations, which effectively sidelined a vast UN aid delivery network in Gaza, have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations.
The GHF, which said Thursday it had distributed more than 69 million meals to date, has denied that fatal shootings have occurred in the immediate vicinity of its aid points.
 
 

The Israeli army said Friday it had issued instructions to Israel’s forces in the field “following lessons learned” after reports of deadly incidents at distribution facilities.
It explained that it “allows the American civilian organisation (GHF) to distribute aid to Gaza residents independently, and operates in proximity to the new distribution zones to enable the distribution alongside the continuation of IDF operational activities in the Gaza Strip”.
Shamdasani highlighted that the UN rights office had repeatedly raised “serious concerns about respect for international humanitarian law principles” in the war in Gaza.
“Where people are lining up for essential supplies such as food and medicine, and where they are being attacked, where… they have a choice between being shot or being fed, this is unacceptable,” she said.
Responding to the UN’s figures, Israel’s military said it had worked to minimise “possible friction between the population and the IDF forces as much as possible”.
“Following incidents in which harm to civilians who arrived at distribution facilities was reported, thorough examinations were conducted… and instructions were issued to forces in the field following lessons learned,” it added.
Fresh deaths
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 30 people on Friday, including 10 who were waiting for aid in the south of the war-ravaged territory.
Gaza civil defence official Mohammed al-Mughayyir said that 10 people were shot by Israeli forces on Friday while waiting for supplies in the Al-Shakoush area northwest of Rafah, where there have been repeated reports of deadly fire on aid seekers.
 


In an update, the civil defence agency reported a wave of Israeli air strikes, drone attacks and bombings across the densely populated territory, which has been devastated by 21 months of war.
A Palestinian speaking to AFP from southern Gaza on condition of anonymity reported ongoing attacks and widespread devastation, with Israeli tanks seen near Khan Yunis.
“The situation remains extremely difficult in the area — intense gunfire, intermittent air strikes, artillery shelling, and ongoing bulldozing and destruction of displacement camps and agricultural land to the south, west and north of Al-Maslakh,” an area to Khan Yunis’s south, the witness said.
The civil defence also reported five people killed in an Israeli strike the previous night on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians in Jabalia al-Nazla, in northern Gaza.
Nearly all of Gaza’s population has been displaced at least once during the war, which has created dire humanitarian conditions for the territory’s more than two million inhabitants.
Many have sought shelter in school buildings, but these have come under repeated Israeli attack, with the military often saying it was targeting Hamas fighters hiding among civilians.

• Kundi says no-confidence vote against KP govt possible ‘if numbers are complete’
ISLAMABAD: A delegation of senior PPP members met the top leadership of JUI-F on Friday, in a bid to garner support for the upcoming Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The PPP delegation, which included Syed Khursheed Shah, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and Zahir Shah, visited the residence of JUI-F emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman, where they discussed the political situation.
On the JUI-F side, Maulana Fazlur Rehman was accompanied by senior party leaders Akram Durrani, Maulana Lutfur Reh­man, Maulana Asad Mahmood, Zahid Durrani and Asjad Mahmood.
However, the meeting ended without any formal agreement regarding mutual support in the Senate elections.
 






Syed Khursheed Shah insisted that the PPP’s visit was driven by their long-standing relationship with Maulana Fazlur Rehman and stressed that each party’s mandate should be respected. “We have come because of our traditional relationship with Maulana sahib,” he added.
Governor Kundi highlighted that the PPP aims to secure five Senate seats in the upcoming elections, scheduled for July 21. Of the 12 available seats, one has been vacated by Sania Nishtar, while the remaining 11 seats are up for fresh election.
The breakdown of the 11 seats includes seven general seats and two each for women and technocrats. The deadline for submitting nomination papers expired on Friday, with scrutiny scheduled for July 16.
When asked about the possibility of ‘horse trading’ during the elections, Mr Kundi assured that the PPP is making efforts to prevent it, stressing that the key reason for the visit was to explore the potential for contesting the Senate elections together.
 
 

Questioned about the likelihood of a vote of no confidence against the KP government, Mr Kundi replied, “The no-confidence motion can be brought if the numbers are complete.”
On security concerns, the KP governor accused India of backing  terrorist networks in Balochistan.
He added that Afghanistan’s land should not be used for Israel and India. “If our neighbour allows Israel and India to use its land, how will there be better relations with them?” he questioned.

Following the expiration of the temporary no-objection certificate (NOC) for Starlink in March, all foreign satellite operators are now required to submit new applications under the newly drafted Satellite Communications Regula­tions.
These regulations are being finalised by the Pak­is­tan Space Activities Reg­ulatory Board (PSARB), based on industry feedback gathered during a recent roundtable discussion.
In addition to Starlink, two other Low Earth Orbit (LEO) operators, OneWeb and Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST), have expressed interest in starting operations in Pakistan.
Once registered under the new regulations, satellite internet providers will need to obtain operational licences from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).
 
 

A PTA official said that all companies, including Starlink, can launch their services by the end of this year. Meanwhile, sources told Dawn that Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, is also likely to attend the launch ceremony.
Starlink was the first company to submit a formal application for registration, but delays in licensing have occurred due to the absence of regulations. The company has already been granted approval to provide satellite internet services in India.
A senior official from the Ministry of IT and Telecom emphasised the need for stringent regulations to ensure security, particularly in light of recent conflicts.
“The new regulations will include important security clauses that may have been overlooked if the recent wars had not occurred,” the official said. “Besides, Pakistan needs more than one satellite internet provider, and two more companies have expressed interest.”
The LEO satellite network operates at an altitude of less than 2,000km from the Earth’s surface, offering high-speed data connectivity in all weather conditions at a relatively low cost, with a latency delay of only 25 milliseconds.
Pakistan’s state-owned company, PakSat, a subsidiary of Suparco, currently provides satellite internet through Satellite Multi-Mission-1 (MM-1), the country’s second telecommunication satellite, launched in August 2024.
Unlike LEO satellites, the MM-1 is a geostationary satellite positioned at an altitude of around 37,500km above the Earth’s surface, with a latency delay of about 600 milliseconds.
PakSat currently serves around 300 clients, with a capacity to accommodate up to 5,000 users. The service is primarily sold to the corporate sector, armed forces and telecom providers for remote regions.

South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza said, “The police constable Waseem Ahmed Abro, 30, posted at Gulshan-i-Maymar police was shot dead allegedly by Rangers sepoy Mohammed Noman, while he (Noman) was also shot in the foot by the deceased constable.”
“Initially, the injured Rangers sepoy claimed that the policeman was engaged in a roadside robbery with a passerby, but later on, it transpired that the incident was an outcome of some ‘personal grudge’ between them,” he added.
The DIG said during the initial probe, it transpired that both the deceased and the injured, dressed in civvies and riding separate motorcycles, reached the crime scene near Habib Bank Chowk in Site at around 10:45am.
Quoting witnesses, the senior officer said that after an exchange of abusive language and a scuffle, they fired upon each other. As a result, policeman Waseem sustained two bullet wounds on his abdomen and right forefinger and died on the spot.
While the Rangers sepoy Mohammed Noman posted at 34 Wing sustained a bullet wound to his thigh.
“The police immediately responded and shifted the deceased to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital,” the DIG added.
One 9mm pistol bearing number 193 MFAC (empty) and one 9mm pistol without a number, along with eight rounds and two motorcycles, both without number plates as per Citizen-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) record, were confiscated.
“The injured Rangers man on his own reached the Rangers Hospital in North Nazimabad,” the official said.
“The Crime Scene Unit, along with investigation officials, also reached the spot and seized material evidence from the crime scene.”
Keamari Senior Superintendent of Police Captain (retired) Faizan Ali also visited the crime scene. The CCTV footage near the crime scene has been collected and examined.
“The state of affairs and CCTV footage confirmed that Constable Waseem Ahmed and Rangers sepoy Mohammed Noman fired upon each other on a personal grudge,” said the DIG South.
“It was not an incident of robbery or other crime, added the senior officer. “We are registering a first information report on the complaint of the father of the slain police official, who is also a sub-inspector at Landhi police station,” said the DIG.
The DIG said the injured paramilitary officer was “stable” and in Rangers custody.
The official further said the initial investigation suggests that the personal grudge between the policeman and the Rangers sepoy could have been over a woman.
A first information report (FIR), available with Dawn.com, was filed at Site A Police Station under Section 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code upon the complaint of the victim’s father, himself a policeman.
According to the complainant, he received a phone call informing him that information about his son’s death was circulating in a WhatsApp group. “When I called my son’s phone, it was answered by Site A SHO Imran Afridi,” the complainant said, adding that he was instructed to go to Abbasi Shaheed hospital immediately.
The complainant identified his son’s body at the hospital morgue and was informed about the nature of the incident. “I found out through the media that the suspect identified himself as Rangers personnel,” the complainant stated, adding that the Rangers man had killed his son for unknown reasons and legal action should be taken.
Last year in May, A man, abducted by the Sindh Counter-Terrorism Department soon after his return from Iraq a couple of days ago, was recovered, and three policemen were arrested in a Rangers raid on the premises of the CTD’s Civil Lines office.
The Rangers’ action had caused the Sindh police a major embarrassment and led to the sacking of at least three officials from their posts.
In December of last year, the Sindh government extended the deployment of Rangers in Karachi for a period of one year.</p><small>2025-07-11 18:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613594-minister-aun-chaudhry-attends-srebrenica-genocide-anniversary-ceremony' target='_blank'><strong>Minister Aun Chaudhry attends Srebrenica genocide anniversary ceremony</strong></a><br><p>
