Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc took second, with Piastri completing the podium in the eighth race of the season.
Norris closed to within three points of Piastri after adding the jewel in the F1 calendar to his season-opening win in Australia.
Four-time reigning world champion Max Verstappen took fourth with Lewis Hamilton in the other Ferrari rounding out the top five.
“Monaco, baby! It’s a dream,” Norris exclaimed over the team radio, after becoming the first McLaren driver to win on the sinuous streets of the Principality since Hamilton in 2008.
“It feels amazing, it’s a long, gruelling race. An amazing weekend with pole, with today. This is what we dream of, this is what I did dream of as a kid,” beamed the 25-year-old.
He was pushed hard to the end of the gruelling and at times chaotic afternoon in the Monaco sunshine by Leclerc, who took second, 3.131 seconds behind.
“Lando did a better job and he deserves to win. It is above our expectations here, I thought we would struggle to be in the top 10, so it has been a good weekend, but I wish I’d won,” said the Monaco-born Leclerc.
Piastri rued a tricky time in qualifying on Saturday.
“I got close but not close enough, and you run around here where you started,” said the Australian.</p><small>2025-05-25 15:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25193848c323447.jpg?r=194417' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913237/pm-shehbaz-arrives-in-istanbul-will-meet-turkish-president-erdogan-today-pmo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz arrives in Istanbul, will meet Turkish President Erdogan today: PMO</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday arrived in Istanbul on a two-day visit to Turkiye, the first leg of his four-nation tour to friendly countries, to express his gratitude for supporting Pakistan during the recent conflict with India.
According to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office, upon arrival at the Istanbul Airport, the prime minister was received by Turkish Minister for National Defence Yasar Guler, Governor Istanbul Davut Gul, President of Pakistan-Turkiye Cultural Association Burhan Kayaturk, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Turkiye Yousaf Junaid, Consul General Istanbul Nouman Aslam, senior officials of the Turkish government and Pakistani diplomats posted in Turkiye.
 






“PM Shehbaz Sharif will meet Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan today,” the statement said. “The two leaders will discuss further expanding cooperation between Turkiye and Pakistan in diverse fields, including defence, economy, tourism and culture.”
The statement added that the purpose of the prime minister’s visit was to “thank the people of Turkiye, particularly President Erdogan, for supporting Pakistan’s principled stand in the recent Pakistan-India tension.”
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Minister of Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi also accompanied the premier.
This is the first leg of the premier’s four-nation visit aimed at strengthening ties with the friendly countries. Apart from Turkiye, he will also visit Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan from May 25-30, according to the Foreign Office.
The tour follows diplomatic support voiced by three of these countries for Pakistan during the recent military confrontation with India.
 






During the visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance,” the Foreign Office said.
“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.
Fahrettin Altun, Erdogan’s head of communications said on X said, “During the meeting, bilateral relations, regional and international issues, including the fight against terrorism, will be discussed.”
Altun said “various aspects of bilateral relations between Turkiye and Pakistan will be evaluated”, according to a Google translation of his post.
Joint steps taken within the scope of the Pakistan-Turkiye High Level Strategic Cooperation Council as per the two leaders’ last meeting in February will be reviewed, the Turkish official said.
While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.
As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had conveyed his solidarity to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.
Following the tit-for-tat airbase attacks and a US-brokered ceasefire between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had “warmly congratulated PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.
Iran had also offered to mediate during the escalation and paid a visit to both Islamabad and New Delhi in peace efforts, which were appreciated by PM Shehbaz and the military’s spokesperson.
 
 

The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people cancelled their holidays in popular resorts in the two countries.
The moves intensified as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.
Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a boycott of Turkish products ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.
PM Shehbaz’s tour adds to Pakistan’s spree of diplomatic engagement amid tensions with New Delhi.
Earlier today, Dar held a telephonic conversation with Uzbekistan Foreign Minister Bakhtiyor Saidov, where views were “exchanged on current regional situation”.
The two leaders discussed existing bilateral relations, particularly the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project, the FO said.
They expressed the hope that the framework agreement for the regional connectivity project would be finalised soon.
 






A high-level diplomatic delegation is also set to visit important world capitals to counter Indian propaganda related to the escalation and the deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” Radio Pakistan had said.</p><small>2025-05-25 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606154-nine-indian-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-separate-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Nine Indian-sponsored terrorists killed in separate KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The suspected strike took place in Mir Ali’s Hurmuz village on May 19 during the daytime, leaving four children of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman. The police have held talks with tribal elders, which have so far remained inconclusive.
Earlier this week, the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), had clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the local elders, the sit-in near the Mir Ali cantonment area continued for the seventh day as authorities allegedly blocked all network and internet systems in the district.
The local elders threatened to cut internet cables providing connectivity to the cantonment area if the internet system and mobile signals were not restored in the rest of the district by Sunday evening.
The organisers of the sit-in issued a statement, seen by Dawn.com,  seeking justice for the children who lost their lives in the incident.
“The people of Waziristan will not remain silent and will launch a long march towards Islamabad on May 26, 2025 (tomorrow), if our demands are not fulfilled,” the statement, issued by the Mir Ali sit-in committee, said.
“The long march will commence from the venue of the protest sit-in in Mir Ali, pass through Bannu Bazaar and Township Chowk, and reach Domel Highway Chowk where locals will join them. It will then march toward Karak and Kohat and others will join the procession,” the statement said.
It added that the long march will reach Peshawar where the protesters will stay the night and will be joined by people from other districts.
“The next morning, the participants will march toward Islamabad, after passing through Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan and Swabi where other processions will join them,” it said.
The protests also laid out their demands, including “a judicial inquiry into the Mir Ali incident and punishment of the culprits; justice, protection, and state assistance to the families of the victims; and a complete end to drone attacks”, among other stipulations, according to the statement.
The statement further said that after reaching Islamabad, protesters will hold a peaceful demonstration for their demands in front of government offices and state institutions.
“We believe in peaceful protests and this long march will mark a milestone in the struggle against oppression, injustice, and silence and awaken the nation’s conscience,” the statement said.
In its statement on Wednesday, the ISPR said initial findings had established that this “heinous act has been orchestrated and executed by Indian-sponsored Fitnah Al Khwarij,” using the term the state uses to refer to the TTP.
“Following a tragic incident on May 19, 2025, in the general area of Mir Ali, North Waziristan district, which regrettably resulted in civilian casualties, unfounded and misleading allegations have been circulated by certain quarters, falsely implicating Pakistan’s security forces,” it added.
“These claims are entirely baseless and are part of a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at discrediting the security forces’ steadfast efforts in the ongoing counterterrorism operations.”
It said that a “comprehensive investigation was promptly initiated” in response to the accusations.
“It is evident that these elements — acting at the behest of their Indian masters — continue to exploit civilian areas and vulnerable populations as shields to conduct their reprehensible acts of terrorism. Such tactics aim to unsuccessfully sow discord between the local population and the security forces, who together remain resolute to uproot the menace of terrorism.”
It further said that security forces reaffirmed “their commitment to ensuring that the perpetrators of this inhuman act are brought to justice.”</p><small>2025-05-25 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/250841352986fc4.png?r=184114' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913138/pakistan-wants-oic-backed-gaza-plan-operational' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan wants OIC-backed Gaza plan operational</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has called for operationalising the Gaza Reconstruction Plan endorsed by the OIC and Arab Group.
As diplomats met in New York to prepare for an international conference in June, aimed at advancing global efforts towards achieving a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, Pakistan called for addressing the root cause: Israel’s prolonged occupation.
“Only by ending the occupation can we secure a just and lasting peace,” Amb­assador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the preparatory session that brought together UN member states to finalise arrangements for eight roundtables.
“This conference is both timely and essential,” he said, pointing out that Palestinian people’s continued suffering, the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and the systematic erosion of the two-state solution through illegal settlements and unilateral measures by the occupying power demand a resolute international response.
 



Amb Iftikhar spells out steps at preparatory session for June conference to preserve Palestinian statehood viability

The conference will take place at the UN headquarters in New York from June 17 to 20. It stems from a resolution approved by the UN General Assembly in December 2024 and will be co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France.
In his remarks, he said in the lead-up to the June conference, it was imperative to restore and fully implement a ceasefire in Gaza, lift the blockade, ensure unimpeded humanitarian access, including through UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and protect civilians and aid workers.
“Any attempt to forcibly displace Palestinians, annex territory, or impose militarised aid mechanisms must be firmly rejected,” he said.
Mechanism, transit corridor
To preserve the viability of Palestinian statehood, he said that, among other steps, the conference “must establish a mechanism to monitor and promote enforcement of relevant UNSC resolutions, including those which term settlements illegal and efforts made to secure Palestine’s admission as a full UN member state; and, operationalise the Gaza Reconstruction Plan endorsed by the OIC and Arab Group. Projects such as a Gaza-West Bank transit corridor, seaport reconstruction, and industrial zones are vital for territorial contiguity and Palestinian unity.”
 






He reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for a just, lasting, and comprehensive solution to the Palestinian Question, rooted in international law and relevant UN resolutions, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds as the capital of Palestine.
“This conference must serve a turning point, and deliver tangible outcomes,” he told delegates. “Pakistan stands ready to support this conference and contribute to a credible political horizon, for a two-state solution — one that upholds Palestinian rights, ends occupation and delivers durable peace through a viable, sovereign Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital,” he added.
Earlier, UN General Assembly President Philemon Yang urged countries to seize the crucial opportunity to finally make progress.
 
 

“The horrors we have witnessed in Gaza for over 19 months should spur us to urgent action to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The devastating cycles of death, destruction, and displacement cannot be allowed to continue,” he said.
“This conflict cannot be resolved through permanent war, nor through endless occupation or annexation. It will only end when Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in their own sovereign, independent states, in peace, security and dignity.”

The majority judgements were authored by Justices Munib Akhtar and Ayesha Malik. Even in the darkest of times, the court affirmed, fundamental rights must remain in every part of our territory. On May 7, the Constitutional Bench overturned this decision, and sanctioned the military trials of civilians. The verdict is a surrender of fundamental rights, and a defeat for the Constitution. A law first introduced by Ayub Khan in 1967 has been restored. This means civilians can be court-martialled going forward.
The law allowing the court martial of civilians was part of a series of oppressive Ayub-era laws. Under the Defence of Pakistan Ordinance, 1965, and the rules made thereunder, citizens could be preventatively detained on vague grounds including “suspicion” that a person was likely to act in a manner prejudicial to “peaceful conditions”.
 
 

In the ‘Malik Ghulam Jilani’ case, Justice Cornelius held that there must be a ground stronger than mere suspicion, an objective satisfaction test would be applied, and preventative action was for exceptional cases.
In his diaries, Ayub wrote “the DPR has been destroyed by the Supreme Court on [the] behest of Cornelius”, and elsewhere would go on to call Cornelius a “fraud”. In Ayub’s words, there was a clear contempt for independent civilian judges and the civilian justice system as a whole.

Courts have a duty to strike down laws incompatible with rights.

The people of Pakistan continue to be subjected to laws that are creatures of dictatorships. By allowing the court martial of civilians, civilian judges have revived an Ayub-era law that was introduced at a time when there was a proclamation of emergency. The highest court of the land has displayed a complete lack of faith in the civilian justice system.
Post-18th Amendment, by virtue of Article 10-A, the right to a fair trial and due process is enshrined as a constitutionally secured fundamental right. “By way of Article 10A of the Constitution, the right to fair trial has been raised to a higher pedestal,” held Justice Malik.
 
 

In her detailed judgement declaring military trials for civilians unconstitutional, she explained how military courts do not comply with fair trial and due process standards: members of the executive act as judges, there is no reasoned judgement, trials take place behind closed doors, and even the right to prepare a defence can be suspended on grounds of military exigencies.
In overturning this decision, the Constitutional Bench found that the right to a fair trial is “fully protected” under the Army Act. At the same time, it held that the matter is referred to parliament for “considering and making” a law granting an independent right to appeal to the high court for civilians convicted by military courts.
This finding is contradictory. If the right to a fair trial is secured under the Army Act, why is an independent right to appeal required? This is a concession by the Bench that the law, as it stands, is incompatible with fair trial standards.
In the original decision, Justice Akhtar held that the very “offer” by the government of certain additional rights to civilians made clear that fundamental rights are transitory and not guaranteed in military courts.
Similarly, Justice Malik held that: “The attorney general for Pakistan again sought time to seek instructions of whether the right of appeal could be given before an independent forum. These assurances and statements by the AGP in themselves reflect the fact that the concept of fair trial and due process being a fundamental right is not inherent in the proceedings for the benefit of civilians before a military court.”
 
 

It is not for the government to “offer” fundamental rights to citizens. If these are dependent on the government offering and denying them at whim, they lose all meaning. Courts have a duty to strike down laws incompatible with fundamental rights; not to make referrals to parliament.
Post-26th Amendment, the judiciary faces a credibility crisis. Judges who are nominated by government members to the Constitutional Bench are judging the lawfulness of the government’s actions. The AG is on the Judicial Commission that nominates judges to the Constitutional Bench, and the AG appears before the same bench to defend the government’s actions.
Meanwhile, the challenges to the 26th Amendment are yet to be determined.
In 2023, our Supreme Court spoke for fundamental rights and the Constitution. The Constitutional Bench did not stand by the brave decision of their colleagues. Ultimately, history will judge the judges that endorsed the militarisation of justice.

The court in the capital Dhaka accepted a formal charge against eight police officials in connection with the killing of six protesters on August 5 last year, the day Hasina fled the country as the protesters stormed her palace.
The eight men are charged with crimes against humanity. Four are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.
“The formal trial has begun,” Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh’s domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), told reporters. “The prosecution believes that this prosecution will be able to prove the crimes done by the accused.”
It is the first formal charge in any case related to the killings during last year’s student-led uprising, which ended Hasina’s iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.
The list of those facing trial includes Dhaka’s former police commissioner, Habibur Rahman, who is among those being tried in absentia.
Hasina also fled by helicopter to India, her old ally. She remains in self-imposed exile, defying Dhaka’s extradition request to face charges of crimes against humanity.
‘Command responsibility’
The launch of the trials of senior figures from Hasina’s government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power as the South Asian nation awaits elections that the interim government has vowed will take place before June 2026.
Islam said the eight men were accused of “different responsibilities”, including the most senior for “superior command responsibility, some for direct orders … [and] some for participation”.
He said he was confident of a successful prosecution.
“We have submitted as much evidence as required to prove crimes against humanity, both at a national and an international standard,” he said.
Among that evidence, he said, was video footage of the violence, as well as voice recordings of Hasina in “conversations with different people where she ordered the killing of the protesters using force and lethal weapons”.
The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009. It sentenced numerous prominent political opponents to death over the following years and became widely seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate rivals.</p><small>2025-05-25 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606123-nation-and-army-have-always-stood-united-will-remain-so-says-ispr-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Nation and army have always stood united, will remain so, says ISPR chief</strong></a><br><p>

“Why isn’t Harvard saying that almost 31 [per cent] of their students are from foreign lands, and yet those countries, some not at all friendly to the United States, pay nothing toward their student’s education, nor do they ever intend to,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
“We want to know who those foreign students are, a reasonable request since we give Harvard billions of dollars, but Harvard isn’t exactly forthcoming.”
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Thursday revoked Harvard’s ability to enrol foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt.
She had threatened last month to block international students at the school unless it turned over records on visa holders’ “illegal and violent activities”.
But a judge quickly suspended the move after the university sued to “stop the government’s arbitrary, capricious, unlawful and unconstitutional action”.
The White House is cracking down on US universities on several fronts, justified as a reaction to what the administration says is uncontrolled anti-Semitism and a need to reverse diversity programmes aimed at addressing historical oppression of minorities.
It has also moved to revoke visas and deport foreign students involved in protests against Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, accusing them of supporting Palestinian group Hamas.
At Harvard, the government has threatened to put $9 billion of funding under review, then went on to freeze a first tranche of $2.2bn of grants and $60 million of official contracts. It has also targeted a Harvard Medical School researcher for deportation.
The loss of foreign nationals — more than a quarter of its student body —could prove costly to Harvard, which charges tens of thousands of dollars a year in tuition.
Harvard is the wealthiest US university with an endowment valued at $53.2bn in 2024.</p><small>2025-05-25 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/251541567b603f5.jpg?r=154754' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913250/crew-rescued-as-container-ship-sinks-off-indias-south-coast-with-hazardous-cargo' target='_blank'><strong>Crew rescued as container ship sinks off India’s south coast with hazardous cargo</strong></a><br><p>A Liberian-flagged container ship with hazardous cargo has sunk off the coast of Kerala in India’s south, the navy said on Sunday after rescuing all 24 crew members safely.
India’s navy said the MSC ELSA 3, listed as a 184-metre-long freight ship, which was sailing from the Indian port of Vizhinjam to Kochi, ran into trouble on Saturday and issued a distress call.
Navy aircraft scrambled to the area and spotted two life rafts, with the container ship listing at a dangerous angle, some 38 nautical miles southwest of Kochi.
“All 24 crew members on board were rescued,” the Ministry of Defence said in a statement, with the Indian Coast Guard (ICG) and a navy patrol boat collecting the sailors, who were from Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, and the Philippines.
“The vessel went down with 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo and 12 containing calcium carbide,” the statement said.
 






The Defence Ministry did not specify what was inside the containers it said were hazardous. Calcium carbide is used in the chemical industry, including for fertiliser production and steelmaking.
“Given the sensitive marine ecosystem along Kerala’s coast, ICG has activated full pollution response preparedness,” the navy said.
The vessel also contained some 370 tonnes of fuel and oil but while the coast guard had deployed “detection systems”, it said that “so far, no oil spill has been reported”.</p><small>2025-05-25 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/25134931d8b2573.jpg?r=135003' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913238/govt-allocates-2000mw-for-bitcoin-mining-and-ai-data-centres' target='_blank'><strong>Govt allocates 2,000MW for Bitcoin mining and AI data centres</strong></a><br><p>In a groundbreaking move to transform Pakistan into a global leader in digital innovation, the government has announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres.
The government recently decided to legalise cryptocurrency to lure international investment in Pakistan. The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) was launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
The federal government appointed entrepreneur Bilal Bin Saqib as the chief adviser to the finance minister on the council.
A statement by the Finance Division says this ambitious initiative is spearheaded by the PCC — a government-backed body under the Ministry of Finance — as part of a broader strategy to “monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment, and generate billions of dollars for the government”.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that this strategic allocation marks a pivotal moment in Pakistan’s digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.
“Pakistan is uniquely positioned — both geographically and economically — to become a global hub for data centres. As a digital bridge between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, Pakistan offers the most strategic location in the world for data flow and digital infrastructure,” the statement says.
It said that since the inception of the PCC, there has been tremendous interest from global Bitcoin miners and data infrastructure companies. Several international firms have already visited the country for exploratory discussions, and following this landmark announcement, more global players are expected to visit in the coming weeks.
“Pakistan’s underutilised power generation capacity is now being repurposed into a high-value digital asset. AI data centres and Bitcoin mining operations, known for their consistent and heavy energy usage, provide an ideal use case for this surplus.
“Redirecting idle energy, especially from plants operating below capacity, allows Pakistan to convert a long-standing financial liability into a sustainable, revenue-generating opportunity,” the statement added.
PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib emphasised the transformative nature of this initiative and explained that with proper regulation, transparency, and international collaboration, Pakistan can become a global crypto and AI powerhouse.
Saqib said that this energy-backed digital transformation not only unlocks high-value investment but enables the government to generate foreign exchange in US dollars through Bitcoin mining.
Additionally, as regulations evolve, Pakistan can accumulate Bitcoin directly into a national wallet — marking a monumental shift from selling power in Pakistani rupees to leveraging digital assets for economic stability.
By offering stable and affordable energy, the statement said Pakistan presents a highly competitive environment compared to regional counterparts like India and Singapore, where rising power costs and land scarcity limit scalability.
Pakistan’s strategic advantage is further underscored by the global context as while AI data centre demand has soared to over 100 gigawatts (GW), the global supply remains around 15GW. This massive shortfall creates an unprecedented opportunity for countries like Pakistan with surplus power, land and an emerging regulatory framework, it added.
The statement further said the country’s digital connectivity has also been significantly strengthened by the landing of the world’s largest submarine internet cable. The Africa-2 Cable Project, a 45,000-kilometre global network connecting 33 countries through 46 landing stations, has now landed in Pakistan.
This milestone enhances Pakistan’s internet bandwidth, latency and resilience through redundant fiber routes — key for ensuring high availability and operational continuity for AI data centres.
With more than 40 million crypto users, Pakistan holds immense potential as a regional leader in digital services. Establishing local AI data centres will not only address growing concerns around data sovereignty but will also enhance cybersecurity, improve digital service delivery, and empower national capabilities in AI and cloud infrastructure.
These centres are expected to create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, catalysing the development of a skilled workforce in engineering, IT, and data sciences.
The statement adds that this announcement marks only the first phase of a broader, multi-stage digital infrastructure rollout. Future developments are expected to include renewable energy-powered facilities — leveraging Pakistan’s immense wind (50,000MW potential in the Gharo-Keti Bandar corridor), solar, and hydropower resources — as well as strategic international partnerships with leading blockchain and AI companies, and the establishment of fintech and innovation hubs.
These efforts will be complemented by proposed incentives such as tax holidays, customs duty exemptions on equipment, and reduced taxes for AI infrastructure developers, it added.
“Pakistan’s combination of surplus power, geographic advantage, advanced subsea cable connectivity, renewable energy potential, and a large, digitally engaged population creates a compelling case for becoming a regional epicentre of Web3, AI, and digital innovation.
“With the right incentives, strategic investments, and collaborative partnerships, Pakistan is positioning itself not only as a destination for global digital infrastructure but also as a sovereign economy that can accumulate digital assets, export digital services, and lead in the next generation of technological transformation.”</p><small>2025-05-25 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/6831f161c4429.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913086/the-night-bitten-dawn-of-the-fata-merger' target='_blank'><strong>THE NIGHT-BITTEN DAWN OF THE FATA MERGER</strong></a><br><p>For Najibullah Wazir, a resident of North Waziristan, May 28, 2018, marked a historic turning point. On that day, Pakistan’s Parliament passed the 25th Constitutional Amendment, formally abolishing the colonial-era Frontier Crimes Regulation (FCR) and merging the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) with Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The decision was hailed as a watershed moment — an end to more than a century of legal and political exclusion for the region’s residents.
The merger held out the promise of equal rights, access to courts, regular policing, improved infrastructure, and civic inclusion. For young voices such as Wazir, who had long advocated for the mainstreaming of Fata, it signified the dawn of a new chapter. “We believed we would finally be treated as citizens, not subjects,” he recalls. “They promised us development, peace and justice.”
Seven years later, those promises remain largely unfulfilled. Despite legislative success, the implementation has faltered, undermined by bureaucratic inertia, political ambiguity and chronic funding shortfalls.
“We were betrayed,” Wazir says flatly. “Forget roads and hospitals. Our only demand now is security. We cannot survive being caught between Taliban militants and another military operation.”
Field observations and local interviews reveal a growing sense of frustration and abandonment. The hopes of rapid development have been eclipsed by rising insecurity, especially since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, which revitalised cross-border militancy. Incomplete infrastructure, poorly resourced courts and police, and stalled public services underscore the state’s limited presence.

The May 28, 2018 merger of the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas into Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa was meant to herald the abolition of colonial-era governance, and provide equal rights to their citizens, as well as access to courts, regular policing, improved infrastructure and civic inclusion. Seven years on,  many of those promises remain unfulfilled. Eos looks at the reasons why discontent is rising…

Exacerbating the crisis, international aid cuts, especially following the Trump administration’s reorientation of US foreign policy, have disrupted critical stabilisation projects.
This piece evaluates the outcomes of the 2018 Fata-KP merger, questioning whether the legal victory has translated into substantive change. It situates the issue within broader historical and geopolitical contexts, highlighting the urgent need for structural reform and sustained engagement.
COLONIAL LEGACY AND TRANSITION
The roar of trucks bound for Afghanistan echoing through the Khyber Pass marks a route that has been a corridor of trade, migration and imperial ambition for centuries. This vital artery slices through the Khyber, one of the seven former tribal districts that had made the erstwhile Fata a region steeped in history. 
British colonial engagement with the region began in the 19th century, culminating in the establishment of the Khyber Agency in the 1870s, the first formal administrative unit in what later became Fata. Situated at the crossroads of British India, Afghanistan and the Russian Empire, the region was treated by colonial authorities as a buffer zone rather than an integral part of the state. The demarcation of the 19th-century Durand Line institutionalised this strategic ambiguity, by creating a semi-autonomous tribal belt.
 
 

Initially, the British established four agencies — Khyber, Kurram, South Waziristan and North Waziristan. The Fata region expanded after Pakistan gained independence, with the addition of Mohmand in 1951, Bajaur in 1971 and Orakzai in 1973, the latter being the only agency not bordering Afghanistan. 
Following the merger in 2018, these seven agencies were merged into KP and re-designated as the Newly Merged Districts (NMDs) of KP for administrative purposes, alongside six Frontier Regions (FRs) that were incorporated into adjacent districts of KP.
Covering roughly 27,000 square kilometres — less than five percent of Pakistan’s territory — the former Fata area is home to over five million people. However, this figure remains contested, with significant displacement caused by conflict and military operations, leading to widespread migration to urban centres.
GOVERNED WITHOUT RIGHTS
For Muhammad Shoaib, a construction material trader from Mohmand, an incident in 2002 remains vivid. “A man was killed near our farmland and, under the FCR’s collective responsibility clause, 30 of our men — including my father and brothers — were detained,” he recalls. “We were punished until the culprits were produced. It’s a long story — how much we suffered, how long we were imprisoned and how many homes were demolished.”
Shoaib’s experience is a powerful illustration of the arbitrary and punitive governance under the FCR, a colonial-era legal framework introduced by the British in the late 19th century. Enacted to control the strategically sensitive Pakhtun frontier and quell tribal resistance, the FCR institutionalised collective punishment, allowing entire communities to be penalised for the actions of a single individual. Suspects were denied access to formal courts, with tribal jirgas replacing due process.
The British emphasised control over inclusion, granting sweeping powers to Political Agents (PAs) and tribal elites (Maliks), who operated with near-total impunity. Legal rights and civil liberties were systematically curtailed.
In a recent scholarly article, Dr Adeel Malik, an academic at the University of Oxford, alongside Rinchan Ali Mirza and Faiz Ur Rehman, critiques the enduring legacy of colonial governance. They reference Sir Olaf Caroe, a former colonial administrator, who observed that “the line of administration stopped like a tide almost at the first contour” of the frontier. They argue that this “rule of difference” created a profound institutional discontinuity, legally disenfranchising the frontier population and excluding them from the broader judicial and electoral frameworks of the state.
Following Independence in 1947, successive Pakistani governments maintained this colonial structure. The constitutions of 1956, 1962 and 1973 all preserved Fata’s exceptional status. Though the FCR underwent amendments, its coercive core persisted.
THE COLD WAR’S GEOPOLITICAL LEGACY
During a 2022 visit to Tari Mangal, a Sunni-majority village near the Gavi border crossing near Parachinar in Kurram, I encountered an unsettling silence. Once a vibrant market town, it now stood in quiet ruin, with shuttered shops and dilapidated buildings marking the passage of time. In 2023, the village once again made headlines when seven Shia teachers were killed in a sectarian attack, underscoring the persistent sectarian tensions in the region.
Tari Mangal’s strategic location made it a key transit point during the Cold War. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the village became a vital corridor for Afghan mujahideen fighters backed by the US, Pakistan and Arab states. This shift turned the village into a target for Soviet and Afghan retaliatory strikes.
The broader Fata region became the epicentre of Cold War covert operations. Hundreds of madressahs [religious seminaries] and training camps were established, channelling fighters into Afghanistan. “Fata had transformed into a launch pad for one of the largest covert operations in modern history,” noted a former Pakistani diplomat.
In From Muhajir to Mujahid, Dr Fazal-ur-Rahim Marwat, a Peshawar-based academic, records that the number of Afghan refugees in Pakistan rose from 400,000 within days of the Soviet invasion to over 3.2 million by 1990. Though Pakistan was not party to international refugee conventions, it managed the crisis independently. The Afghan Cell and Commissionerate categorised refugees into ‘muhajireen’ [refugees] and ‘mujahideen’ [freedom fighters], though this distinction was often blurred. Publicly, it was claimed that refugees resided in settled areas, while the mujahideen were based in tribal regions. In practice, however, these distinctions were often blurred, according to Marwat. 
Niyaz Ahmed Karbalai, a community elder from Parachinar, recalls how Afghan refugees settled on Shia-owned land in the 1980s. “Gulbuddin Hekmatyar’s Hizb-i-Islami set up a training centre there,” he says. “Not only were attacks launched into Afghanistan, but sectarian harmony in Kurram also began to unravel.”
Following the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, Afghanistan plunged into civil war among rival mujahideen factions. Pakistan continued backing the ‘Peshawar Seven’, a coalition of Sunni Afghan groups, which established further camps in Fata.
As the Taliban rose in the 1990s, recruits from Pakistani madressahs and tribal areas once again flowed into Afghanistan, reinforcing Pakistan’s influence in shaping its neighbour’s future. Meanwhile, Fata itself descended into lawlessness, becoming a breeding ground for arms smuggling, kidnappings and criminal networks — legacies of a Cold War fought on its soil.

FATA POST-9/11
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Fata region underwent profound transformations that redefined both its internal dynamics and its geopolitical significance. Located along the porous border with Afghanistan, Fata’s rugged terrain and minimal state presence rendered it an ideal sanctuary for Al-Qaeda operatives and Afghan Taliban fighters escaping US-led military offensives in Afghanistan. As American forces dismantled Taliban strongholds across the Durand Line, waves of militants infiltrated Fata, often welcomed by sympathetic local elements. 
The influx of foreign and local militants began to reshape the socio-political order of the region. With the central government largely absent and traditional tribal structures already weakened, these groups filled the power vacuum. The situation reached a critical juncture after the Lal Masjid operation in Islamabad in July 2007, which sparked a nationwide radicalisation and served as a rallying point for militant factions. In December that year, Baitullah Mehsud consolidated various insurgent outfits under the banner of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), formalising a militant umbrella organisation that entrenched itself across Fata.
The TTP’s ascendancy marked the collapse of the traditional tribal governance model. Tribal elders, or maliks, who once mediated conflicts and upheld customary law, became prime targets of assassination campaigns aimed at dismantling any alternative authority. Fata quickly became emblematic of global jihadist activity. By 2009, then-US President Barack Obama famously referred to the region as “the most dangerous place in the world.”
Efforts by the Pakistani state to regain control alternated between military operations and peace deals, often with limited success. It was not until Operation Zarb-i-Azb in 2014, following the TTP’s attack on Karachi airport, that a concerted and sustained military campaign began to roll back insurgent strongholds, signalling a critical shift in Pakistan’s counterterrorism strategy.
By 2018, the Pakistani government declared a significant victory over the TTP, characterising the outcome as a transformation from being “victims of terrorism” to emerging as “victors” in the fight against militancy. 
PUSH FOR REFORM IN FATA
In a modest hall in Islamabad on a cold winter day in 2016, an NGO convened a rare gathering to address one of Pakistan’s most intricate political questions: the future of Fata.
The event brought together a diverse array of voices from the tribal areas — Pakhtun nationalists, maliks, federal and religious party leaders, civil society representatives and youth activists. I was present, covering the event as a journalist, closely observing the discussions — tense, impassioned, yet filled with cautious optimism.
The dialogue was part of a broader momentum that began after the federal government, led by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), established a Sartaj Aziz-led committee in 2015. Tasked with exploring political, legal and economic integration options for Fata, the committee worked against the backdrop of ongoing military operations, particularly Operation Zarb-i-Azb.
The relative stability that followed the military offensive created space for reform-oriented dialogue. Pressure mounted both domestically and internationally. Western diplomats viewed administrative reforms in Fata as critical to long-term counterterrorism efforts and regional stability.
Consensus on the need for reform was evident at the meeting, yet the visions for that reform diverged sharply. Pakhtun nationalist parties, particularly the Awami National Party, strongly supported a full merger with KP, arguing that tribal communities were already deeply linked to KP’s urban centres for education, healthcare and employment.
Opposing them were tribal politicians advocating for a separate Fata province. “Why should we tie ourselves to KP, which has struggled with its own governance challenges for decades?” said one tribal leader. Many of these figures had long operated outside party structures, securing influence through tribal networks and financial means.
A third group favoured establishing a semi-autonomous Fata Council, modelled after Gilgit-Baltistan’s governance system. They believed a locally elected council could preserve tribal identity while initiating incremental reform.
Yet, a fourth segment resisted any form of structural change. Comprising political agents, select bureaucrats and traditional maliks, this group benefitted from the status quo and saw in its continuity the preservation of their power and privilege.
Following extensive consultations with stakeholders, the Sartaj Aziz-led committee submitted its report in August 2016, recommending the full integration of Fata with KP. The proposal aimed to dismantle the colonial-era FCR and bring Fata under Pakistan’s constitutional and administrative framework.

MERGER WITH KP
The culmination of this reform initiative came on May 24, 2018, when the 25th Constitutional Amendment Bill was introduced in the National Assembly. It received overwhelming parliamentary support, though two political parties — the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) — opposed the bill.
The following day, the Senate endorsed the bill and, shortly thereafter, the KP Provincial Assembly approved it as well. On May 31, 2018, then-President Mamnoon Hussain signed the amendment bill into law, formally merging Fata with KP and ending its distinct legal status rooted in British colonial rule.
In the aftermath of the merger, significant administrative changes were implemented. The traditional role of PAs was abolished, with these officials re-designated as deputy commissioners (DCs), and their subordinates as assistant commissioners — aligning the administrative hierarchy with the rest of the country. Moreover, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the Peshawar High Court was extended to the region. District and sessions courts began to be established, gradually integrating the judicial framework.
To support this transition, the federal government announced a phased integration strategy. A five-year plan was introduced to mainstream the tribal districts, anchored by a Rs 1 trillion, 10-year development package. The National Economic Council approved this in principle, and provincial governments, though initially reluctant, agreed to contribute according to their National Finance Commission (NFC) shares.
The merger marked a historic milestone, offering the long-marginalised population of Fata access to political representation, constitutional rights, and a pathway to socio-economic development within the national mainstream.
UNFULFILLED PROMISES
Despite the historic merger, many of the commitments made to the people of the former Fata remain unfulfilled. 
In late March 2025, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur addressed a letter to President Asif Ali Zardari, urging the immediate convening of the long overdue 10th NFC meeting. He cited constitutional obligations and fiscal disparities that emerged following the merger, stressing the need for an equitable redistribution of national resources.
 
 

This demand reflects a broader discontent over the slow and uneven implementation of the federal government’s post-merger promises. Although the 2018 reform package included a five-year mainstreaming plan and a 10-year development program worth Rs one trillion, actual disbursements and outcomes have lagged. For many residents, the merger’s promise of full political, legal and economic inclusion remains elusive.
This month, Muzammil Aslam, adviser on finance to the KP chief minister, said that KP was facing a Rs 42 billion shortfall in federal divisible pool receipts during February to May of the current fiscal year. Discussing the NMDs, he noted that, although Rs 69 billion was allocated under the Accelerated Implementation Programme and Annual Development Programme, only Rs 22.5 billion had been released. Despite this, KP spent Rs 31 billion on development projects in the region.
Aslam criticised disparities in federal allocations, pointing out that, while Azad Jammu and Kashmir received a 50 percent budget increase and Gilgit-Baltistan 36 percent, the NMDs were allocated only Rs66 billion — far below the Rs 104 billion in actual expenditures. He also noted that, although police, judiciary and administrative services have been extended to the NMDs, the area remains understaffed. He called for ending the grant-in-aid system and including NMDs in the NFC Award.
Mohsin Dawar, a former MNA from North Waziristan, attributes the slow progress of the ex-Fata merger to a lack of prioritisation by the authorities and blamed both federal and provincial governments. 
“The central government has failed to release the promised share for the NMDs under the NFC Award for the KP province,” he says. “Meanwhile, the provincial government has not fully utilised the funds it received for the development of NMDs.” Dawar adds that residents widely demand a separate, transparently managed account for development funds, to ensure allocations are used exclusively for the uplift of the NMDs.
LONG ROAD TO INTEGRATION
“We inherited a region with no modern offices, no trained staff, and no systems,” recalled a KP official who once served as DC in an NMD. “Building governance from scratch while managing expectations has been overwhelming.”
Seven years after the FATA merger, progress remains painfully slow. Despite formal integration, the region continues to suffer from inadequate infrastructure, substandard public services and a fragile governance system.
The transition from the colonial-era FCR to Pakistan’s formal legal system promised justice and equality. Yet, due to insufficient judicial infrastructure and a lack of trained legal professionals, thousands of cases remain unresolved. “People don’t trust the new system,” says Malik Khanzeb Khan, a tribal elder from Khyber. “It’s slow, costly and distant.”
District courts have been established in select areas, but access to justice remains limited. Security concerns often hinder the functioning of courts, while the traditional jirga system continues to serve as the preferred dispute resolution mechanism, due to its familiarity and swiftness.
More than half the population lives below the poverty line. Health and education services remain underdeveloped, and roads linking these areas to the rest of the province are either damaged or incomplete.
Administrative reforms have also faltered. While political agents were formally rebranded as deputy commissioners, many residents claim their bureaucratic behavior remains unchanged. “They operate from outside and are barely accessible,” a local from Khyber laments. 
For many in the tribal belt, the promise of integration has yet to materialise into tangible change. “The merger was supposed to bring progress,” said one teacher in Kurram, “but our lives remain stuck in the past.”
RESURGENCE OF MILITANCY
In mid-April, amid growing unrest, a group of Mehsud tribesmen held a protest in South Waziristan against curfews and fears of renewed military operations. “We’ve already endured decades of war,” one speaker said. “Now we fear another operation is looming.”
Following the success of military operations such as Zarb-i-Azb, relative calm had returned. However, recent years have seen a resurgence in militancy, which now threatens both tribal and neighbouring settled districts of KP. Analysts attribute this escalation in part to the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021. Militant groups such as the TTP and the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction have found renewed momentum and safe havens across the border. 
In Bajaur, the so-called Islamic State’s local affiliates pose a growing threat, while in Kurram, Shia neighbourhoods remain cut off from the rest of the country since November due to sectarian violence linked to unresolved land disputes, highlighting the fragile security landscape in the region. Compounding the issue is the fragile writ of the state and limited access to basic governance and services in these regions.
 
 

Militant attacks on security personnel, including soldiers and police officers, have increased. The integration of traditional paramilitary forces — Levies and Khasadars — into a formal police structure faces critical hurdles, particularly in terms of training and operational capacity.
These challenges have left the force ill-equipped to counter modern security threats. “In this environment,” the KP official admitted, “development in the NMDs has effectively stalled.”
DEMANDS FOR A REVERSAL
Frustration with slow reforms and deteriorating security has led to growing calls for reversing the merger. Some tribal elders and Islamist parties have demanded the restoration of the previous administrative system, a position echoed by the TTP during its negotiations with the government in 2021.
“Residents never demanded police, courts, or bureaucratic systems,” says Bismillah Afridi, a tribal elder leading the reversal campaign. “They only wanted reforms within the existing framework, by removing oppressive colonial laws.” 
However, experts warn that any reversal could jeopardise national security. “Reversing the merger would recreate ungoverned spaces,” says Naveed Ahmed Shinwari, author of Political and Social Change in Pakistan’s Tribal Areas. “These spaces have historically served as sanctuaries for militants, such as the TTP, and could seriously undermine counterterrorism efforts.”
Seven years after the merger, the NMDs represent a paradox of promise and paralysis. The constitutional shift was historic, but implementation has been marred by administrative delays, underfunded development and a lack of political will. The recent rise in militancy has only deepened public disillusionment.
Law enforcement remains underprepared, and promised development funds have either been delayed or mismanaged. For many residents, the transformative potential of the merger has yet to be realised. The state’s writ remains fragile in several areas, and public frustration is mounting. The future of the merger — and the stability of the region — hinges on the state’s ability to deliver on its promises. Without substantial, inclusive reforms and sustained development efforts, the risk of renewed unrest remains dangerously high.
As one university student from Kurram regretfully says, “We were promised a new dawn, but it still feels like the same long night.”

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
Earlier this week, two new cases of polio were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, taking the tally for the current year to 10.
“The Pakistan Polio Programme today launched its third National Immunisation Days (NIDs) campaign of the year at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad,” a statement from the Centre read.
The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.
“To mark the launch, Farooq administered oral polio vaccine and Vitamin A drops to children under five, reinforcing the government’s unwavering commitment to eradicating the crippling disease from every corner of the country,” the NEOC continued.
Scheduled to begin on May 26, the weeklong campaign aims to vaccinate over 45 million children under five, the statement noted, adding, “making [the drive] a critical intervention in Pakistan’s final push to interrupt poliovirus transmission and achieve eradication by the end of 2025”.
“Polio eradication is not just a health goal — it is a national imperative and a matter of immense pride for our country,” the statement quoted Farooq as saying.
“This third campaign of 2025 marks a decisive milestone in our 2-4-6 roadmap. These back-to-back rounds from September 2024 to May 2025 represent our most strategic opportunity to close immunity gaps and halt virus circulation before the high transmission season begins,” she added.
Farooq acknowledged that the persistent challenges in key reservoirs such as Karachi, South Khyber Pakhtunkwa, and Quetta Block, but noted encouraging progress in reaching previously underserved populations.
She also extended heartfelt appreciation to the 400,000 frontline workers powering the campaign — including 225,000 women vaccinators — and recognised the critical role of civil and military law enforcement in ensuring safe access to children.
“Despite major gains, wild poliovirus continues to pose a threat. Pakistan has confirmed 10 cases so far this year. Environmental surveillance has detected the virus in 272 sewage samples from 127 testing sites, across 68 districts, signalling continued circulation,” it added.
Speaking at the event, UNICEF Representative in Pakistan Abdullah Fadil expressed confidence in the programme’s direction. As he concluded his tenure in Pakistan, Fadil commended the national leadership and Farooq for their tireless dedication to polio eradication.
“Pakistan is closer than ever to making history. With continued political will, community engagement, and coordinated action by all partners, I believe this country can soon achieve a polio-free future,” he said.
“The public is strongly encouraged to cooperate with vaccination teams and report any missed children via the Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline 1166 or the WhatsApp,” the statement concluded.
Polio is a paralysing disease that has no cure. Multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine and completion of the routine vaccination schedule for all children under the age of five are essential to provide children with high immunity against this terrible disease.
Pakistan has pledged to eradicate polio by the end of this year, Federal Minister for Health Syed Mustafa Kamal said earlier in the week during a meeting with the President of Global Development at the Gates Foundation Dr Chris Elias.
Attributing the recent progress to successful immunisation campaigns and better community outreach, Kamal reaffirmed his commitment, noting a significant decrease in parental vaccine refusal.
“The fight against polio has required a tremendous sacrifice from all stakeholders, including law enforcement personnel who have rendered invaluable services,” Kamal had said. “This mission will continue until we reach complete eradication [of the poliovirus].”</p><small>2025-05-25 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/251127456f21b8f.jpg?r=112826' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913141/punjab-govt-plans-law-to-rein-in-goondas' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt plans law to rein in goondas</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government has plans to enact a law to control criminal and anti-social persons commonly known as “goondas”, who make life difficult for the people, in the province.
The new law, The Punjab Control of Goondas and Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2025, will serve as a modern, effective legal tool to tackle organised and habitual crime, protect public safety, and deter anti-social behaviour. The Act, after enactment, will repeal The Punjab Control of Goondas Ordinance, 1959.
The Punjab home department has drafted the new law that provides a comprehensive legal framework for identifying, monitoring and restraining individuals commonly known as “goondas” who pose a threat to public order. The act provides the legal definition of goonda as “a person habitually involved in disorderly conduct, criminal activity, or anti-social behaviour that endangers peace or creates public nuisance”.
The district intelligence committees (DICs) have been empowered to declare an individual a ‘goonda’ based on credible reports from police officers, assistant commissioners, intelligence agencies, or written complaints. There has to be a comprehensive grounds for declaration of `goonda’ which includes involvement in drug trafficking, gambling, extortion, cyber crimes, harassment, organised criminal activity, use of forged documents, display of weapons, running brothel house, impersonation of public officials and other listed offences.

Act provides for empowering dist intelligence committees to declare a person ‘goonda’ and impose penalties; all offences to be non-bailable

Upon declaration, the DIC may impose various restrictions on goondas including, requiring a bond for good behaviour in future, placing the individual on no-fly list, blocking of CNIC and passport, confiscation of digital devices and data, freezing of bank accounts. It also includes observing the community service orders and restriction from visiting sensitive public places.
The Act allows for technical surveillance, including digital monitoring and biometric data collection, to ensure compliance and detect further criminal conduct. The act also provides an appeal mechanism to the aggrieved individuals, who can submit representations to the divisional, provincial, and appellate committees. A dedicated Tribunal, led by a retired district and sessions judge, will hear final appeals.
The proposed Act also gives strict penalties for violating the orders of DIC. The punishment includes imprisonment from three to five years and a fine of up to Rs1.5 million. Furthermore, the repeat offenders will face harsher penalties, including up to seven years’ imprisonment and fine up to Rs2m. All offences under the new Act are declared cognisable and non-bailable, ensuring swift police action and legal proceedings. The government will designate magistrates with Section 30 powers under the Code of Criminal Procedure to try offences under this Act. The proposed Act will be presented before the provincial cabinet for approval.

Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said civil defence crews retrieved “the bodies of nine child martyrs, some of them charred, from the home of Dr Hamdi al-Najjar and his wife, Dr Alaa al-Najjar, all of whom were their children”.
He added that Hamdi al-Najjar and another son, Adam, were also seriously wounded in the strike on Friday. A medical source at Nasser Hospital, where Alaa al-Najjar works, gave Adam’s age as 10 years old.
Footage of the aftermath released by the civil defence agency showed rescuers recovering badly burned remains from the damaged home. Asked about the incident, the Israeli military said it had “struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure” near its troops.
“The Khan Yunis area is a dangerous warzone,” it added. “The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.” The army had issued an evacuation warning for Khan Yunis on Monday. The children’s funeral took place at Nasser Hospital, a footage showed.
Muneer Alboursh, director general of the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, said on X that the strike happened shortly after Hamdi Al-Najjar drove his wife to work. “Just minutes after returning home, a missile struck their house,” he said, adding the father was “in intensive care”.
“This is the reality our medical staff in Gaza endure. Words fall short in describing the pain,” he said. “In Gaza, it is not only healthcare workers who are targeted — Israel’s aggression goes further, wiping out entire families.”

• Journalist bodies condemn killing, demand justice
QUETTA: A journalist, Abdul Latif Baloch, who worked for a Quetta-based newspaper as a correspondent, was gunned down by unknown assailants in the Mashkey area of Awaran district on Saturday, police said.
The gunmen barged into the journalist’s house in the wee hours of Saturday morning and tried to take him away. When he offered resistance, the intruders opened fire, killing him on the spot.
The killers fled the scene and could not be arrested till late into the night.
Police have launched an investigation into the incident.
According to police officials, Mr Baloch was also working in the Levies force department.
They said that a few years ago, the body of Mr Baloch’s kidnapped son was found in Mashkey.
Journalist organisations strongly condemned the killing of Mr Baloch, who was working for Daily Intikhab.
 
 

While the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) expressed its deepest shock and outrage over the brutal killing, the Balochistan Union of Journalists (BUJ) termed the incident part of a broader conspiracy to silence independent voices in Balochistan.
PFUJ acting President Khalid Khokhar and Secretary General Arshad Ansari said this senseless act of violence is a stark reminder of the risks journalists face while performing their duties.
“We demand that the authorities take immediate and concrete actions to investigate this crime, identify the perpetrators, and bring them to justice,” they demanded in a statement.
The PFUJ also called for enhanced security measures to protect journalists and ensure their safety while reporting.
It condemned the threats Mr Baloch received prior to his murder. Such acts of intimidation create a climate of fear, undermining press freedom and democracy, it added.
“We stand in solidarity with Abdul Latif Baloch’s family, colleagues, and the Baluchistan journalist community, and pledge to continue advocating for journalists’ rights and safety,” they urged
The PFUJ leadership called upon the government to take concrete steps to address the deteriorating security situation for journalists and media workers across Pakistan.
In a separate statement, BUJ President Khalil Ahmed and General Secretary Abdul Ghani Kakar described Mr Baloch as a dedicated and honest journalist, adding that his targeted killing raises serious concerns about press freedom in Balochistan. The union demanded a high-level inquiry into the murder.
“Journalists in a sensitive region like Balochistan already face grave threats, and such attacks highlight the government’s failure to ensure their safety,” the statement said. “If immediate action is not taken, this dangerous trend could escalate further.”
The BUJ urged the Balochistan government to swiftly arrest the perpetrators and ensure that justice is served.

The event was organised by Arooj Azhar Kiyani, the Chief Executive Officer of the Kingsgate Equine and the first female captain of a tent-pegging team in the country, in collaboration with the Punjab government.
A large number of people, including families, gathered to watch the cultural sport, while over 70 tent-pegging teams participated in the event.
Talking to Dawn during the event, Ms Kiyani said she felt proud to be the first female tent-pegger in Pakistan, adding that it was not easy for her to make her debut in a male-dominated sport.
Speaking of the challenges faced by women in becoming horse riders, especially tent-peggers, the KingsGate CEO said that there was a scarcity of good trainers in the field who could coach young girls to pursue their passion.
“Luckily, I found a good coach who helped me through this journey of becoming a professional tent-pegger,” she said, adding that she regularly participates in championships throughout the country.
She said that separate arrangements were made for families to attend the championship and that positive feedback was received from young women and girls.
 
 

Ms Kiyani said that holding the event at the women’s college campus was aimed at encouraging women to be bold enough to cross barriers in sports and professions that are generally, and mistakenly, considered a domain of masculine superiority.
She said that the participation of women in horse riding and in the wars of Islamic history was well documented, and she was inspired by Islamic history.
She added that horse riding and tent-pegging were not limited to men, and she felt proud to be the first female player in the sport, as it is a game of valour and passion.
Meanwhile, Adviser to the Punjab Chief Minister, retired General Azhar Kiyani, who also attended the championship, said that it was the Punjab government’s priority to promote cultural sports in the province, and such events were being regularly held in almost all cities.
He said that the event was also aimed at celebrating the recent defining victory of Pakistan against India, adding that the whole nation stood shoulder to shoulder with the brave soldiers of Pakistan.
The event was also attended by Deputy Commissioner Jhelum, Syed Meesam Abbas, and District Police Officer (DPO) Tariq Aziz Sindhu, while the prize distribution was postponed due to a thunderstorm on Saturday afternoon.

It was explained by PIIA chairperson Dr Masuma Hasan there was a need to hear different voices, especially the voices of the youth, regarding the recent conflict. Therefore, they decided to call on their research assistants to talk about the different themes of the conflict, as identified by them, for the audience to then take it from there.
Taking the audience through the events of the past month or so, she also reminded how India, out of the blue, with no credible evidence, held Pakistan responsible for April 22’s Pahalgam attack, which was an intelligence failure on the part of India.
“Then India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960 and Pakistan suspended the Simla Agreement of 1972,” she said.
“Then on May 7, India launched Operation Sindoor against Pakistan. While defending the country very well, Pakistan retaliated on May 10, which was followed by a ceasefire after US president Donald Trump’s intervention,” she added.
 
 

Research assistant Mohammad Usman presented a paper on ‘Water Assets and Resources’. He said that if India were to stop the water flow to Pakistan, it would risk flooding its own upper regions. “But if they stopped our water during the dry seasons, it could be a concern for us because the flow of water is lower and storage matters the most. It can affect our farmers, which could result in lower yields,” he said.
“But if India blocked our water, it would require significant infrastructure, which will take years to build and would also require billions of dollars,” he said.

In war with India, Pakistan reasserts itself through controlled display of sophisticated force, say experts

“As for the weaponisation of water, or the water bomb, a concept when the upper riparian state blocks the flow of water and then suddenly releases a significant amount of water without notifying the lower riparian state, you have a big flood. Here in the case of Pakistan and India, Pakistan is the lower riparian state and India the upper riparian state. But in the case of China and India, China is the upper riparian state and India the lower riparian state, especially in Brahmaputra. China can also block India’s water,” he pointed out.
 
 

Research assistant Syeda Maliha Sehar read a paper on the theme of ‘Political and Military Interests’. “We saw a maturity of new capabilities developed through the Pakistan-China military partnership,” she said.
“By deploying Chinese-origin systems designed to destruct Indian surveillance and communications, Pakistan directly challenged the technological dominance of both Indian and Western-aligned platforms. Pakistan’s response served to dismantle long-standing perceptions of asymmetry, re-framing Pakistan, not as a reactive or inferior actor, but as one capable of leading with precision, restraint and strategic innovation. In doing so, Pakistan reasserted itself in the region’s power dynamics not through escalation but through controlled exhibition of a sophisticated force,” Maliha added.
Another young researcher Safa Rehmat spoke about ‘Cyber Warfare and Digital Espionage’. “Cyber warfare in this conflict involves hacking, data breaches and misinformation campaigns. Both the Indian Research and Analysis Wing [RAW] and the Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI], as well as the people of both countries, have developed sophisticated cyber capabilities,” she said.
Speaking about the ‘War of Narratives’, Research Assistant Syed Shahryar Shah said that perceptions came to be just as important as the conflict. “The actual conflict lasted a few days but we are carrying on with the narratives,” he said. “What matters now is not what happened but what people believe happened,” he added.
 
 

Another Research Assistant, Asif Ali, spoke of ‘The Kashmir Flashpoint’. “The Indian authorities have already begun a crackdown in Kashmir. Following the Pahalgam incident around 2,800 Kashmiris have either been questioned or detained by the Indian authorities and this is something that is likely to continue,” he pointed out.
Another paper was presented on ‘Media, Misinformation and Public Opinion’ where Safa Rehmat, again, spoke of the things reported wrongly in the media on both sides such as India attacking the Karachi port while showing old pictures of Philadelphia and also reporting that Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff had been captured. Pakistan also chipped in by reporting the capture of Indian female air force pilot Shivani Singh and the raising of white flags of truce from the Indian side.
Saad Asad Brohi spoke of ‘Regional and Global Responses’.
 
 

The discussion, which followed included a comment about it being easy to blame someone else for one’s own internal problems, which is what India did after the Pahalgam attack.
Someone also pointed out that war was not one-dimensional. There are also dimensions such as economy, diplomacy, politics, etc, to think about. It was also mentioned that the armed forces of Pakistan certainly deserve accolades, but there was also a need for good governance in this country.
One person in the audience then got up to thank Indian PM Narendra Modi for providing an opportunity for unity in Pakistan.

After opting to bat first in the decider, Stars posted 135-5 thanks to opener Sana Urooj’s brisk 37-ball 44 before they bundled the Conquerers out for 93 with two balls to spare with Anosha Nasir taking 3-14.
Sana and Anosha were jointly awarded the player-of-the-final.
 


Sana set the tone for her side, striking seven fours and being involved in key partnerships: 33 for the first wicket with with Huraina Sajjad (23) and 47 for the third with Kaynat Hafeez (21).
Kaynat provided the anchor, striking just one six in her 35-ball knock with their partnership being broken when Nashra Sandhu (2-21) cleaned up Sana.
Sidra Amin and Sidra Nawaz provided the late flourish, the skipper striking four four fours in her 13-ball 18 while the latter faced 11 deliveries for 15.
The Conquerers lost half their side with 80 on the board in the chase and their last five batters couldn’t offer any resistance as Anosha and Waheeda Akhtar (2-17) ripped through their line-up.
Dua Majid (29), Najiha Alvi (21) and Syeda Aroob Shah (14) were the only batters to enter double figures — the last two sharing a 30-run stand for the fifth wicket.
Sidra Amin, with 346 runs in 10 matches, and Sidra Nawaz, with 15 dismissals and 150 runs, were named the best batter and wicket-keeper respectively for the tournament.
Anosha was jointly-awarded the best bowler with Challengers’ Rameen Shamim, who picked up a tournament-leading 16 wickets.

The Effects of Taxes and Transfers on Inequality and Poverty in Pakis­tan says the GST has the largest ne­­g­ative impact on the poverty headco­unt; the Benazir Income Support Programme has the largest positive impact on inequality reduction.
Estimations of the marginal contributions of individual fiscal instruments — or the additional impact that individual fiscal instruments have on poverty or inequality when all other fiscal instruments are included — demonstrate that GST has the largest marginal contribution to the national poverty increase.
GST is allocated roughly in proportion to consumption expenditure and, therefore, is neither strongly regressive nor strongly progressive. The BISP cash transfer meanwhile de­­­monstrates the largest marginal contribution to inequality reduction. The second-largest impact on inequ­ality comes from pre-primary and pri­­ma­­ry education expenditures, it says.

Vulnerable households get smaller benefits than taxes paid

The study suggests that, while moving forward, Pakistan should improve its domestic revenue mobilisation and public expenditure efficiency to generate greater fiscal spa­ce.  The additional fiscal space shou­­ld be prioritized to expand social expenditure and targeted transfers and to improve fiscal equity.
 
 

Fiscal sustainability could go together with fiscal equity if additional revenues collected from GST harmonisation are used to compensate poor and vulnerable households through well-targeted cash transfers. Expenditure reforms to improve the accessibility and quality of public health and education services in Pakistan could have long-term impacts in terms of poverty and inequality reduction, the study says.
The report says fiscal policy in Pakistan emphasized revenue collection from more frequently-impoverishing indirect taxes as well as regressive and inefficient subsidy expenditures to provide benefits while de-prioritizing progressive direct taxation which can shield poor and vulnerable households from further impoverishment, direct, targeted transfers to poor and vulnerable households, and the investments in social infrastructure which help poor and middle-income households participate productively in social, civic, and economic life.
According to the report, richer households capture a larger share of the subsidy and in-kind benefits available and pay more of total revenues collected from direct and indirect taxes. In Pakistan in fiscal year 2019, the two richest deciles capture 34pc of total subsidy expenditure, 29pc of in-kind education benefits, and 27pc of in-kind health benefits, and pay 40pc of total revenues from indirect taxes.
Most poor and vulnerable households are net payers into the fiscal system meaning that benefits received are smaller in magnitude than taxes paid. Only individuals from the poorest ten per cent of the population can expect to be net recipients — or can expect to receive more in benefits than they will pay in taxes — with a net cash gain estimated 1.2pc of pre-fiscal income. All other individuals can expect to be net payers in cash terms, with cash losses ranging from -1.8 per cent in decile 2 to -5.5pc in decile 10 (the richest decile).
Over the past two decades, Pakistan has struggled with low and volatile economic growth.

In it, she expressed anger towards US President Donald Trump for not coming to India’s aid during its recent war against Pakistan. The post was accompanied by a photo of a battle-clad Ranaut, fiercely riding a white horse into some mythical battle. 
In the post, she called Trump an “alpha male”, but then asked whether Trump was “jealous” of the Indian PM Narendra Modi because Modi was the “father of all alpha males” [“our PM is sab alpha males ka baap“]. She then grudgingly deleted the post because, according to her, her party Bharatiya Janata Party’s  (BJP) national president requested her to do so. 
Ranaut’s original post had in it something that can be quite telling for those wanting to understand the political and cultural fallout of Hindu nationalism in India. Ranaut admires ‘alpha males’ and perceives Modi as the ultimate male of this kind. But her outburst wasn’t just the product of a sophomoric fan-girl. It was actually rooted in what began to be shaped — in the 1920s — as Hindu nationalism and/or ‘Hindutva’. Hindutva seeks to establish Hinduism as the dominant/hegemonic system of belief and culture in India. 
Ranaut has been a fervent supporter of Modi’s ruling BJP, which is also India’s largest Hindu nationalist outfit. It is especially popular among India’s growing middle classes that benefitted greatly from the ‘opening up’ of the Indian economy from the late 1980s onwards. 

Indian social media posts babbling about alpha males, and the larger confusion in the country’s polity, are the result of a crumbling of the sense of security that was seeded by the BJP and Modi’s ‘masculinised nationalism’

The BJP was formed in 1980. A large part of it emerged from a now defunct Hindu nationalist party, the Akhil Bharatiya Jana Sangh. Like Jana Sangh in the past, BJP too has roots in militant Hindu nationalist groups, such as the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The RSS has been around since 1925. It was formed to politically and culturally manifest the ideas of one of Hindu nationalism’s pioneering ideologists, Vinayak D. Savarkar.
 
 

From the late 1980s, BJP began to enjoy increasing popularity in India. A lot of this popularity was mustered by the party’s willingness to act in an iconoclastic manner. It openly challenged the supposedly pacifist/‘Gandhian’ ethos of India’s politics and society, established by the country’s founding party, the Indian National Congress (INC). BJP also confronted Indian secularism, which it accused of being tilted in favour of India’s non-Hindu groups, especially Muslims. BJP also moved to popularise and bring into the mainstream a particular take on Hindu mythology. 
The INC had interpreted Hindu mythology as symbolic of Hinduism’s tolerant, pluralistic and even secular nature. But INC did not treat this mythology as substantiated history. BJP does. It understands this mythology in a literalist manner. BJP’s aggressive push in this regard managed to find traction among India’s upper and middle classes when they had begun to fully enjoy the fruits of economic liberalisation and deregulation. 
During the INC’s multiple stints in power from the 1950s till the mid-1980s, Indian ‘gurus’ preaching spiritual calm and warning about the psychic ills brought on by materialism were a dime a dozen in India and in the ‘spiritually bankrupt’ West. In the early 1970s, Uxi Mufti, son of the Pakistani intellectual Mumtaz Mufti, wrote that India was exporting ‘Indian spiritualism’ to the West and that Pakistan, to counter this, should export Sufism there.
Uxi viewed the Indian export as a ploy by India to portray itself as a spiritually rich and peaceful country compared to its more militaristic neighbour, Pakistan. 
But the economic and political rise of the Indian middle classes saw the decline of the INC’s portrayals of India and Hinduism. According to the Indian political scientist Sabyasachi Chaudhury, India’s post-1980s’ neo-liberal economic policies won the endorsement of the country’s new middle class and dominant upper castes. This became the primary ingredient of the formula for establishing a “muscular Indian nation state.” This then saw Indian democracy taking an illiberal turn. 
 


Gradually, the once sidelined musings of early Hindu nationalists began being mainstreamed. In a 2019 essay, the political scientist Jyotirmaya Sharma wrote that “loss of manliness” was a major theme in early Hindu nationalist discourse. The discourse lamented that Hindus had become feeble and soft, incapable of either retaliating or defending themselves. Hence, they suffered humiliation and perpetual subjugation, first at the hands of Muslim invaders and then by the British. Therefore, Hindu nationalist ideologues took upon themselves the responsibility of ‘making men’ out of the Hindus.
Demolishing ancient mosques, insulting Mahatma Gandhi (by calling him a eunuch), beating up Muslims and lower caste Indians, recreating on film and TV mythical stories of war in an imaginary ancient India, wishing the complete annihilation of “terrorist Pakistan”, attacking Christian missionaries, lynching beef-eaters etc — all these can be seen today in India as manifestations of a ‘Hindu society’ apparently being masculinised by the “baap of all alpha males.” 
But what’s the role of the Hindu women in all this? In her book Make Me A Man, the professor of gender studies Sikata Banerjee writes, “Women enter this masculine environment through roles such as heroic mother, chaste wife and celibate warrior.” 
According to the American political theorist Cynthia Enloe, nationalist ideologies tend to stem from masculinised memory, masculinised humiliation and masculinised hope. Indeed, but — as we have seen — Indian nationalism began as a secular and a rather feminised understanding of Hinduism and India. However, from the 1990s onwards, the once sidelined masculinised variant pushed out the earlier variant because economic prosperity among the middle classes shaped a mindset that was a combination of confidence and insecurity. The insecurity leads to the feeling that endorsed masculinised nationalism is a better protector of one’s economic gains. 
A prime minister boasting of having a 56-inch chest (as Modi once claimed) may be an effective way to make middle class India feel secure. But that same prime minister taking the country to an actual war is something entirely different — especially when he loses the war. 
Today, the commotion on Indian media, the confusion in the country’s polity and in X posts babbling about alpha males, are the result of the crumbling of that sense of security, seeded by masculinised nationalism. 
Remarkably, this nationalism started to come apart immediately after the military and diplomatic losses India suffered in its latest war against Pakistan. The 56-inch chest shrank, throwing middle-class India into an existentialist and identity crisis.

• Officials spar over India’s targeting of civilian areas
UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan has warned the United Nations that India’s unilateral decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) represents a dangerous escalation that violates international law and threatens the survival of more than 240 million people.
Speaking at a UN meeting on protecting water in armed conflict on Friday evening, Pakistan urged the world community to act before such actions triggered a humanitarian catastrophe or destabilised the region.
“This is a grave violation of international law, including human rights law, the treaty law and customary international law,” said Ambassador Usman Jadoon, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, at the Arria Formula meeting convened by Slovenia.
“We strongly condemn India’s unlawful announcement to hold the Treaty in abeyance and call upon India to strictly abide by its legal obligations and refrain from stopping, diverting or restricting rivers that are a lifeline for 240 million people of Pakistan. We will never accept any such moves,” Ambassador Jadoon said.
 






He also drew attention to Indian leaders’ alarming statements, noting that “troubling pronouncements by the Indian leadership to ‘starve the people of Pakistan’ depict a highly dangerous and perverse thinking.
Pakistan used the UN forum to appeal for international consensus against the weaponisation of water.
Ambassador Jadoon urged the Security Council to monitor such developments closely and take pre-emptive action where necessary:
“The Council must play a role by identifying situations where violations of international law, including IHL (International Humanitarian Law) principles, could jeopardise peace and security or lead to catastrophic humanitarian crisis.”
 






Pakistan’s statement highlighted three key points, legal prohibitions, obligations of warring parties and weaponisation of water. International law, including human rights law and IHL, prohibits attacks on water resources and related infrastructure. Den­ying access to water violates established norms and UN Security Council resolutions. Similarly, all parties in a conflict are bound by the IHL and must avoid actions that result in severe humanitarian consequences. Besides, using water as a tool of coercion or warfare is unacceptable and destabilising.
“It is regrettable that one country, exhibiting malevolent designs, has chosen to weaponise water in addition to using it as a bargain chip,” the diplomat said.
Pakistan’s statement comes amid growing concern in Islamabad over India’s recent efforts to bypass treaty mechanisms and undermine the role of international mediators, particularly the World Bank, which had brokered the Treaty 1960. Officials in Pakistan view these actions as part of a broader pattern aimed at eroding cooperative frameworks and applying pressure on Islamabad through non-military means.
Ambassador Jadoon reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for global efforts to ensure the protection of water resources during conflicts and emphasised the need for a “resolute, principled and united stand” against any attempts to politicise or militarise water.
Terror charge rejected
At a separate meeting, delegates from Delhi and Islamabad engaged in a sharp verbal duel at the UN, after Pakistani Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad denounced the Indian military for targeting civilian areas during the recent clash.
The exchange took place at the Security Council during its debate on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict on Friday.
Indian Ambassador Parvathaneni Harish reacted to his Pakistani counterpart’s tough statement, and while repeating Delhi’s usual allegations said that Pakistan had no justification to talk about civilians when it is using terrorism as a policy.
Pakistani delegate Saima Saleem hit back, accusing the Indian envoy of relying on “disinformation, deflection and denial” as she said India was itself involved in acts of terrorism.
“No amount of obfuscation can hide the facts. India brazenly kills and maims civilians in occupied Jammu and Kashmir, carries out blatant aggression against Pakistan by targeting civilians and sponsors terrorism and assassinations in my country and across the globe,” Ms Saleem, a counsellor at the Pakistan Mission, told the 15-member Council.
India, she said, had even stooped to a new low of impeding the flow of rivers that serve as a lifeline for the 240 million people of Pakistan.
She pointed out that Pakistan, together with the international community, had condemned the Pahalgam incident.
“If India had nothing to hide, it should have agreed to credible, impartial and independent investigations into the incident,” the delegate said. “On the contrary,” she added, “India continues to subject people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir to state-sponsored terrorism to suppress their legitimate freedom struggle.”
Blatant aggression
Earlier this month, she recalled, India committed blatant aggression against Pakistan, launching unprovoked attacks on innocent civilians, killing 40 people including seven women and 15 children and injuring 121 others, including 10 women and 27 children.
“India certainly has no credibility to lecture others on the protection of civilians,” Ms Saleem told delegates.
Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts and sacrifices, she pointed out, were well-known and acknowledged globally and Islamabad remains steadfast in its commitment to combat this menace.
On the other hand, she said, India continues to actively fund and support terror proxies that include Fitna Al Khawarij —the term used by the government for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, Balochistan Liberation Army and its Majeed Brigade group — to kill innocent civilians in Pakistan.
She drew the delegates’ attention to the recent savage attack on a school bus in Khuzdar that took the lives of innocent school-going children and left dozens injured.
“If India is genuinely committed to peace and security and good neighbourliness, it should end its state-sponsored terrorism, cease its oppression of Kashmiris, comply with its obligations under international law, UN Charter and bilateral treaties, and engage in meaningful dialogue for the peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” Ms Saleem added.

ISLA­M­ABAD / LAHORE /PES­H­­­­­A­WAR: At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains battered several parts of the country on Saturday, paralysing road and air traffic, damaging infrastructure and triggering widespread power outages.
Heavy rainfall accompanied by gusty winds and hail also struck Islamabad, leading to water accumulation in several low-lying areas and trees falling at multiple spots.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, strong winds and hailstorms caused extensive damage to crops and power lines but no fatalities were reported. Over 113 power feeders tripped across the province, with areas like Peshawar, Mardan, Khyber, Swabi, Swat and Abbottabad worst affected.
Meanwhile, a private airline from Karachi to Lahore narrowly avoided a disaster when it was caught in severe turbulence while landing at Allama Iqbal International Airport.
 


According to the data provided by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of Punjab and Rescue 1122, three people died each in Lahore and Jhelum, two each in Sialkot and Muzaffargarh and one person each in Sheikhupura, Nankana Sahib, Attock, Multan, Rajanpur, Hafi­zabad, Mianwali, Jhang and Layyah as the walls and roofs of the houses collapsed and trees fell on them.
About two dozen incidents of the fall of solar panels and billboards were also reported.
A PDMA tally issued at 10pm on Saturday put fatalities at 13 and injuries at 92. Separate incidents reported by Rescue 1122 and other sources added more deaths, pushing the toll higher.
The authority had earlier urged citizens and provincial authorities to remain on high alert, according to a . report.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed deputy commissioners and rescue agencies across Punjab to remain alert amid reports of wind and rain in various districts of the province, the authority said in a statement.
 
 

Motorway Police closed several motorways, including sections of M2, M3 and the Lahore-Sialkot route, due to safety concerns. Severe weather and low visibility were reported on parts of the M4 and M5, while thunderstorms disrupted travel across highways linking Lahore to Multan and beyond.
Power infrastructure was also hit hard, with Multan’s power utility Mepco confirming faults across south Punjab’s grid, leading to temporary blackouts in Multan, Khanewal, Vehari and Sahiwal.
The Water and Sanitation Agency in Lahore reported full mobilisation of machinery and pumps to clear underpasses.
Deaths, injuries
According to the PDMA report, most deaths in Punjab occurred due to the collapse of dilapidated houses and being in unsafe locations.
In Sheikhupura, the roof of a factory collapsed due to strong wind, killing a worker from Sadiqabad and seriously injuring five others, the state-run Pakistan Television reported.
Several mud and dilapidated houses were also damaged due to the storm. There were also incidents of falling trees and damage to solar panels in Lahore.
District Officer Rescue 1122 Sibghatullah told Dawn that a labourer died after a wall of an under-construction house in Sood Gangal on Kallar Syedan Road collapsed due to the strong winds. The deceased was identified as Imtiaz Yaqoob, 52.
Scores of people were also injured in Taxila, Lahore High Court Road, Adiala Road, Peshawar Road, Chakri Road, Kotha Kalan, Rawat, Gujar Khan and Chakri near the motorway, he said.
In another incident, a man died after the wall of his house in Fauji Colony, Pirwadhai, collapsed. Naseebullah, 60, was seriously injured in the incident and was shifted to the hospital but could not survive.
In Attock, a child was killed and six others, including a woman and her daughter, were injured.
According to Rescue 1122, the Grade 2 student, identified as Mohammad Hassan Shahbaz, was killed when the wall of his house collapsed in the Mithial village, within the limits of Jand Police Station.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed announced that medical assistance would be provided to the injured people, the PDMA said.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has forecast more rain and thunderstorms across Punjab and KP on Sunday, including in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Peshawar and Mardan.
Damage in KP
Strong winds and hailstorms also caused extensive damage to crops and power lines in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but no deaths were reported.
The Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) said that more than 113 feeders across the province tripped due to the windstorm. The power utility said that the 19 feeders tripped each in Peshawar and Mardan, 13 in Khyber, 30 in Swabi, 13 in Swat, 15 in Abbottabad and four in Mansehra.
The Peshawar cantonment experienced power outages spanning several hours after the windstorm. Sources told Dawn that the cantonment power supply was underground and Pesco staff had to seek permission from military authorities to start rehabilitation work.
Other severely affected areas included Mingora, Amankot, Rahimabad and Qambar, where residents faced immense difficulty commuting and accessing essential services. Citizens called upon the authorities to expedite drainage and relief efforts to prevent further damage.
In Mingora, Swat, flash floods from overflowing drains inundated homes and disrupted daily life, forcing students to sit exams in complete darkness due to outages.
According to the Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature in the Swat valley dropped to 20 degrees Celsius due to the rain and hailstorm.
Rain and hailstorms in the Ambar and Pandiali tehsils of Mohmand district damaged crops, causing losses to the farmers.
According to initial reports, several slum houses were damaged and trees were uprooted in remote localities; however, no loss of life was immediately reported, official sources confirmed.
Moreover, a heavy windstorm followed by light rain disrupted proceedings on Saturday, the second day of the ongoing Tablighi Ijtema in the Baffa area.
The congregation, which began on Friday, has attracted hundreds of thousands of participants from across Hazara, Gilgit-Baltistan and other parts of the country. The organisers expect an even larger turnout on Sunday, the final day when special prayers will be offered.
Meanwhile, a windstorm followed by light rain also affected life in other parts of the Hazara division.
Flight faces turbulence
Meanwhile, a private airline flight FL-842 from Karachi to Lahore narrowly avoided a disaster when it was caught in severe turbulence while landing at Allama Iqbal International Airport. The pilot aborted landing and safely returned to Karachi following air traffic control instructions, Geo News reported.
Passengers, shaken by repeated jolts, refused to re-board after landing in Karachi. Airport sources said 57 passengers cancelled their travel plans, delaying the flight’s re-departure.
At least two other flights to Lahore were diverted to Karachi due to poor visibility, while departures were delayed until weather conditions stabilised.
As the storm subsided, operations at Lahore airport resumed, with flights PK-305 and PA-405 eventually departing for Karachi.

The juice industry is calling for a substantial reduction in the Federal Excise Duty (FED), which was introduced in 2023 at a rate of 20 per cent, compounded by an existing 18pc General Sales Tax (GST). According to a spokesperson for the Fruit Juice Council, this combined burden is severely impacting the documented sector and leading to serious economic repercussions.
The sector, which was expecting sales exceeding Rs72 billion in FY23,  witnessed a 45pc plunge to Rs42bn. This has stalled industry growth and resulted in a considerable shortfall in the government’s revenue projections for the current fiscal year.
 
 

The exorbitant tax burden, effectively pushing the tax component on a pack of juice to around 42pc of its price, has fundamentally impacted consumer affordability.
This has inadvertently fuelled an alarming surge in the undocumented sector, which offers cheaper, low-quality, and potentially unsafe alternatives that evade all tax obligations, it says.
The industry claims that the repercussions extend beyond the industry’s bottom line. The drastic reduction in demand from the formal sector has severely impacted the rural economy, particularly fruit farmers. At its peak, the industry procured over 100,000 tonnes of fruit annually from local growers.

Additional District & Sessions Judge (AD&SJ) Yalmaz Ghani conducted the hearing on the suit, while PM Shehbaz and his counsel Mustafa Ramday joined via a video link.
At the outset of the hearing, the prime minister congratulated all attendees on winning the battle against India.
In response, the judge also said, “Congratulations to you as well.”
Advocate Muhammad Hussain Chotia, the counsel for the PTI founder, said this was indeed a matter of joy and it was a victory for the whole nation.
During cross-examination, the defendant’s counsel asked the plaintiff whether the alleged defamatory statement had been made in writing.
The prime minister said the allegations had been repeatedly made on television.
The lawyer then asked PM Shehbaz whether he himself ever made such accusations in politics.
However, the prime minister claimed that he had never made any allegation without evidence.
The lawyer asked the  plaintiff what could be the motive behind the PTI founder’s speeches and statements.
At this, PM Shehbaz said this question should be asked from the defendant.
The judge also objected to the question posed by the defendant’s lawyer, terming it irrelevant.
Asked about the outcome of the Panama Papers case, PM Shehbaz said it was not against him and he was not aware of the ruling.
Responding to a follow-up question, the prime minister reiterated that he was not a party to the Panama Papers case and that this fact was part of the record.
The PM stated that he had been subjected to a serious and dishonest accusation by the defendant.
The cross-examination was in progress when the judge adjourned further hearing till June 2.
In his defamation suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran Khan levelled baseless allegations on him.
He sought a decree for recovery of Rs10bn as compensation from the defendant for publication of defamatory content.
Imran Khan had filed his reply to the suit with a delay of four years in 2021, saying one of his friends told him that someone known to him and also the Sharif family had approached him with an offer to pay billions of rupees if he could convince him (Mr Khan) to stop pursuing the Panama Papers case.
The former prime minister said he disclosed the incident for the consumption of the public at large, and an act in the interest of the public good does not constitute any defamation.
The reply maintained that Mr Khan did not specifically attribute any statement to the plaintiff (PM Shehbaz) while narrating the incident.

Downdetector, which mon­itors internet outages in real time, showed a spike in users’ complaints after 5pm. The tally pea­ked with 372 complaints at 5:36pm, with more than 600 complaints in total reported by late evening.
Users said they were unable to log in to their accounts and send tweets.
However, the number of complaints reduced by 8pm, indicating the restoration of services.
The Pakistan Telec­ommunications Authority (PTA) noted that social media platform X was facing a mass global outage, including in Pakistan, but stated that the country’s internet services “remain fully functional”.
“PTA’s investigation into the matter has confirmed that there are no technical issues at Pakistan’s internet gateways.”
“All other internet services across the country remain fully functional,” PTA said.
X was blocked in Pakistan on Feb 17, 2024, after allegations of widespread rigging during the general elections by a former bureaucrat. However, the platform was discreetly restored on May 7 after India fired missiles into Pakistan, resulting in a days-long conflict.
Prolonged disruption
The global internet observer NetBlocks has also confirmed the disruptions were global but not related to any country-level internet filtering.
Earlier today, X said that it was working to resolve issues with various services that continued for a second day.
 






“We’re still experiencing issues from yesterday’s data centre outage. Login and signup services are unavailable for some users, and there may be delays in notifications and Premium features,” the engineering department of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s platform said on X.
The disruption came two days after a previous global outage, which affected the services of X for several hours on Thursday.
A fire broke out on Thursday morning at the data centre leased by X, forcing an extended response from emergency crews, Wired reported, citing multiple sources.
The sources required anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the company, it added.
According to the report, firefighters arrived at the Hillsboro Technology Park and found a “room with batteries that were deemed to be involved in the fire”.
Hillsboro Fire and Rescue spokesperson Piseth Pich told Wired that the fire had “not spread to other parts of the building, but said the room in question was heavy with smoke”.
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Wired. “It could not be learned whether server operations at the data centre had been affected by the incident,” the outlet noted.

He further said that the treaty still exists despite New Delhi holding it in abeyance “unilaterally and illegally”.
“The words ‘holding in abeyance’ used by India doesn’t exist anywhere in the law. Therefore, the Indus Water Treaty exist as it is, as these words cannot abolish it,” Mr Wattoo said while speaking at a seminar on Saturday.
“Holding the treaty in abeyance is absolutely illegal immoral. It is a violation of all international agreements,” the minister added.

Ex-Indus water commissioner warns China and other upstream countries may block flow of water to India

Talking about the background of the issue, the federal minister said the correspondence between the two countries were underway since 2024.
India wrote a letter to Pakistan, seeking some modification in the treaty under the Article 12 (3) of the treaty. Under the treaty, the minor issues related to water can be discussed and resolved on the level of commissioner of Indus waters representing Pakistan and India under Articles 8 to 11. But if the issues are more important, these can be discussed and resolved by both the parties, Pakistan and India.
“In its April 8 letter, they [India] sought us to tell the place where parties can sit and discuss the issue [related to modification]. In the letter, they also asked us to respond till May 8. But on April 24, India unilaterally suspended it,” he revealed, adding that holding treaty in abeyance doesn’t have any legal cover.
“The treaty cannot be held in abeyance or suspended unilaterally by anyone. It cannot be changed, modified, amended or cancelled by anyone. The treaty still exists.”
Mr Wattoo said Pakistan also wrote in response to India’s letter, stating to sit and discuss.
“We told them for holding negotiations on this, saying to reach results if we reach mutual understandings. But the aggression India did by taking action unilaterally is equal to act of war. The water is our lifeline and on this issue, we can neither compromise nor show any flexibility,” the minister warned.
“Currently, Pakistan is receiving normal flow of water from Indian side,” he said.
Talking about the canals issue in the country, Mr Wattoo said he wrote to all provinces to come forward and devise an action plan in this regard. “We have told the provinces to constitute a committee of independent experts and take a final decision mutually. In this way, the misunderstandings on the part of provinces would also be no more,” he maintained.
Former Indus water commissioner Asif Baig said that India had transboundary agreements on water with China, Nepal, Bangladesh and other neighbours. “Because China is sitting on upstream level from where water flows down to Indian located at downstream position. Similarly, in Pakistan case, India is on upstream location which is being bragged by Indian government. If India dubbing its upstream status as authority to stop water follow to Pakistan transgressing treaty, then what will happen if China and other upstream country block flow of water to India,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, former Indus Water commissioner,   Sheraz Memon said that even if India tried to block water flow toward Pakistan, it would be an exercise in futility due to the country’s insufficient capacity to water maneuverability.
“IWT survived in Pak-India two wars and barrage of terrorism allegations,” he said and suggested that sagacity demanded that treaty should go unaffected in all worst scenarios.
Former Punjab irrigation minister Mohsin Laghari categorically ruled out any one-sided suspension of IWT. He said if India was given liberty to do so, none of international treaties would stand exist and will lose their holistic merits.
“If India remains hell-bent on [stopping the flow of water coming to Pakistan], it will cost billions of dollars to build the infrastructure on rivers,” he added.

• Next review likely in second half of 2025
• Mission thanks federal, provincial authorities for constructive engagement
ISLAMABAD: In a significant development, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistani authorities have reached a preliminary agreement on a comprehensive financial framework, paving the way for continued negotiations on the budget for fiscal year 2025-26.
Officials in the finance ministry indicate that discussions are set to advance in the coming days, with the goal of finalising crucial fiscal policies, including the revenue collection target for FY26, development outlay, defence expenditure, and the highly debated tariff rationalisation plan for the industry.
The areas where agreements remain pending include tax concessions for the salaried class, an increase in defence budget and policies related to real estate. The discussions will also focus on reducing expenditures, as well as continuing reforms, including the privatisation of state-owned enterprises.
 
 

According to an IMF announcement, the Fund mission, led by Nathan Porter, has concluded its staff visit to Islamabad. The staff visit focused on recent economic developments, programme implementation and the budget strategy for FY26.
The IMF delegation arrived in Islamabad on May 19 to review Pakistan’s recent economic developments, assess progress under the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the 2025 Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), and initiate discussions on the next federal budget.
“We held constructive discussions with the authorities on their FY26 budget proposals and broader economic policy and reform agenda, supported by the 2024 EFF and the 2025 RSF,” Mr Nathan said.
The next mission, associated with the upcoming EFF and RSF reviews, is expected in the second half of 2025.
Finance ministry officials reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of gross domestic product in FY26.
It was stated that during the mission visit, discussions focused on actions to enhance revenue — including bolstering compliance and expanding the tax base — and on prioritising expenditures.
 
 

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is facing significant shortfalls in the current fiscal year.
“We will discuss a realistic revenue target for the FBR while keeping in view real GDP growth and inflation,” tax officials said, adding that next year’s target will be based on actual revenue potential rather than setting an unrealistic goal.
“We will continue discussions towards agreeing on the authorities’ FY26 budget over the coming days,” Mr Nathan said.
He added that the discussions also covered ongoing energy sector reforms aimed at improving financial viability and reducing the high-cost structure of Pakistan’s power sector, along with other structural reforms to foster sustainable growth and promote a more level playing field for business and investment.
Mr Nathan also said that Pakistani authorities emphasised their commitment to ensuring sound macroeconomic policymaking and building financial buffers. In this context, maintaining an appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy remains a priority to anchor inflation within the central bank’s medium-term target range of 5-7pc.
At the same time, rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, preserving a fully functioning forex market, and allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility are considered critical to strengthening resilience against external shocks.
The mission thanked the federal and provincial authorities for their hospitality, constructive discussions and strong collaboration and commitment to sound policies. The announcement said the IMF team will remain engaged and continue its close dialogue with the authorities.

The launch took place during the National Consu­ltative Workshop on the Power Sector Indig­eni­sation Roadmap, organised by the National Grid Company of Pakistan (NGC) — formerly known as the National Tran­smission and Despatch Company (NTDC) — in collaboration with the LUMS Energy Institute.
Speaking via video link, Energy Minister Awais Leghari said the government was finalising a plan to supply 7,000-megawatt electricity to Pakistan’s export industry at the most competitive tariff in the region. “We are working on providing electricity at a marginal cost to boost exports,” the minister said. He added that power sector indigenisation was vital to shifting the country from an import-dependent to an export-led economy.
The event brought together experts from the power sector, manufacturing industry, regulatory bodies, policymakers and academia to chart a cohesive national strategy for accelerating the localisation of Pakistan’s electrical power equipment manufacturing ecosystem.
Mr Leghari said the NGC was the first national entity to implement an approved Indigenisation Policy, and its strategic procurement model was already delivering tangible results.
He urged the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), power distribution companies (Discos), K-Electric and state-owned and private power generation plants to adopt indigenisation as a strategic imperative — not as Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), but as a core procurement principle aligned with the National Electricity Plan 2023-27.
 
 

The minister said the government was striving for an export-oriented economy instead of imports, and power sector indigenisation was the need of the hour. The power sector reforms were going on, the Independent System and Market Operator had been fully functional, and the Energy Infrastructure Development and Management Company would also be made functional soon, he said.
The Power Equipment Manufacturing Dashboard — developed by the Lums Energy Institute with input from key stakeholders — was jointly inaugurated by NGC board Chairman Dr Fiaz Ahmad Chaudhry, Pakistan Engineering Council chairman Engr Waseem Nazir, NGC Managing Director Engr Muhammad Waseem Younas, K-Electric CEO Syed Monis Abdullah Alvi, and others.
Commenting on the dashboard, the federal minister said its launch would help indigenise the power sector.
On the occasion, Dr Fiaz stated that the NGC’s indigenisation strategy — anchored in policy reform and targeted educational orders — has already saved over $10 million in foreign exchange through import substitution.
Dr Fiaz, also a senior adviser at the Lums Energy Institute, reaffirmed that Lums would continue supporting policy design, digital innovation and institutional transformation in the energy sector.
He said that under the 10-year Integrated Generation Capacity Expansion Plan and the Transmission System Expansion Plan, investment of $8 billion would be needed in the transmission sector. “We want this equipment and material to be manufactured in Pakistan, which will save valuable foreign exchange,” he said.
Mr Younas outlined the tangible progress under the Indigenisation Policy.
He said that since 2022, the NGC had placed over Rs2bn in local orders, including Rs781m in educational orders aimed at building industrial capacity.
Additionally, NGC’s revision of its Type Test Policy in 2023 to align with international benchmarks has opened the door for local manufacturers to compete globally.
The workshop concluded with consensus on actionable steps to align procurement practices with national localisation goals, foster technology partnerships, and create a clear roadmap for import substitution.

According to the Indian publication, the cancellation closely follows India’s recent move to withdraw the transhipment facility previously extended to Bangladesh to export its cargo to third countries — a development that analysts interpret as signalling strain in bilateral relations.
In a regulatory disclosure submitted to the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd and BSE Ltd under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Require­ments) Regulations, 2015, GRSE confirmed that the government of Bangladesh had cancelled the order, originally placed in July 2024.
The cancellation adds to a series of geopolitical developments since the change in political leadership in Bangladesh following the fall of prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s government in August 2024. Observers note that ties between the two neighbours have become increasingly tense in recent months.
