KARACHI: While the Sindh government appears to be overzealous about strict implementation of e-challans, the responsibility of traffic engineering remains scattered among multiple entities, hindering the development of a seamless and efficient transportation network in Karachi.
Sources told Dawn that the absence of a unified traffic engineering authority was a significant obstacle to designing and implementing solutions — from road design to traffic signal timing — leaving the city’s traffic stuck in multiple gridlocks.
They said that the challenging task of traffic engineering and management was at present shared among multiple entities, including the Traffic Engineering Bureau (TEB) of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA), Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) and cantonment boards, leading to lack of clear accountability and coordination.
Primarily the complex task of traffic engineering, including installation of traffic signals and signs, is the responsibility of the TEB, which has been barely able to maintain the already installed signals due to “constant financial constraints”, they said.
The KDA said that its TEB maintained 90 out of total 130 traffic signals across the city, while 40 by different cantonment boards.
However, the sources said that TEB maintained only 50 out of 90 signals under its domain and remaining were out of order and required extensive repair works.
KDA Director General Asif Jan Siddiqui said that the authority was barely maintaining the traffic signals due to financial constraints.
Plan to set up traffic management company
The sources said that the provincial government was considering setting up a new company, to be called the Karachi Traffic Management Company (KTMC), for managing traffic engineering responsibilities of the entire city.
The sources said that the company would be responsible for installation of new signals, repair of signals, road and lane markings, U turns and zebra crossings.
Confiding this to Dawn, the sources said that different proposals for setting up a regular body for improving traffic flow and reducing congestion were discussed at high-level meetings.
They said that the proposed company would be headed by the Karachi mayor as its chairman, with commissioner and experts from the private sector as its members.
They said that that the TEB would be merged into the proposed company.
Recently, DIG Traffic Pir Muhammad Shah had also informed industrialists belonging to the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry about the proposal, saying it had already been submitted to the government and the proposed company would receive a share of challan revenue to fund improvements in road infrastructure.
When contacted, the Karachi commissioner said that the proposal was still at a “conceptual stage”.
The sources said that there was another proposal under discussion to bring TEB altogether under the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.
SMTA installing signals
While the installation of traffic signals is still the responsibility of the TEB, the SMTA has apparently taken over the task as it said that it had installed 11 new traffic signals in different parts of the city, including Model Colony, Gulberg, Tipu Sultan Road, Gurumandir, Kamran Chowrangi and Munawar Chowrangi in Gulistan-i-Jauhar and Steel Township Crossing.
SMTA Managing Director Kanwal Nizam Bhutto told Dawn that besides installation of 18 new traffic signals, the authority had also upgraded 24 out of 27 signals in the city under an Annual Development Plan scheme.
Moreover, the SMTA has also installed as many as 243 traffic sign boards on different locations on Shahrah-i-Quaideen, Shaheed-i-Millat Road, Rashid Minhas Road, Shahrah-i-Pakistan, Shahrah-i-Pakistan and Saddar.

Zafar Umar

ZAFAR Umar was a writer and police officer in British India. He is sometimes credited with writing Urdu’s first-ever detective novel Neeli Chhatri (the blue umbrella). But some critics say Neeli Chhatri was not an original work and, being a translation, it cannot be considered Urdu’s first detective novel. Other writers often mentioned as pioneers of detective novels in Urdu are Teerath Ram Ferozpuri (1885-1954) and Ibn-i-Safi (1928-1980).
As mentioned by C. M. Naim (1936-2025) in his article included in his book Muntakhab Mazaameen, Neeli Chhatri first appeared in 1916 from Badayun and instantly became so popular that it had to be reprinted many times over within a short span of time. For the next 50 years or so, the novel remained popular. Naim says that Neeli Chhatri was a translation of The Hollow Needle, a thriller by Maurice Leblanc (1846-1941), the French novelist.
In other words, Neeli Chhatri was an Urdu translation of an English novel, which itself was a translation from French. Zafar Umar had made so many changes in the novel that it was a kind of creative translation, often called transcreation, retaining the main theme and tone but adapting the norms and cultural atmosphere to suit the local tastes and sensitivities.
The main character in the original was named Arsene Lupin, a “noble thief” and detective. Zafar Umar named him Behraam and the heroine Ramonde was renamed as Feroza, making them sound local but not Muslim as these were common names among Parsees in the subcontinent.
This made the romance in the novel a little more acceptable as Parsees were considered comparatively more modern by the standards of the yore.
One of the factors that had made the French and English versions very popular in the West was the setting of the story: the historic royal residences and magnificent treasures in and around Paris. Zafar Umar localised it and set the story in Delhi’s historical buildings of the Mughal era, hence making it more relatable to the readers in the subcontinent. This was one of the reasons why Neeli Chhatri’s subtitle was Shahan-i-Dehli Ka Posheeda Khazana, or the hidden treasure of Delhi kings. Zafar Umar adapted the novel to the local cultural environment so well that readers never felt they were reading the translation of a European novel. Neeli Chhatri was a smashing success by all accounts. When Zafar Umar got his own house constructed, he named it Neeli Chhatri. Behraam’s character was so popular that to cash in on its popularity, many imitated and wrote detective novels based on a main character named Behraam.
Zafar Umar was born in Muzaffarnagar, UP, on April 27, 1883. He graduated from M.A.O. College, Aligarh, in 1902 and worked as private secretary, first to Nawab Mohsinul Mulk and then Begum Bhopal. Zafar Umar passed competitive exams and joined Indian Police Service. He translated, with permission from the author, the last chapter of Western Culture in Eastern Lands, a book by Armin Vambery (1832-1913), under the title Mustaqbil-i-Islam, or the future of Islam. In 1911, Zafar Umar published Policeman, a pioneering work in Urdu, a manual for the training of police constables. The book became quite popular. He himself translated it into English and soon it was made a part of Punjab Police’s curriculum.
In 1913, Zafar Umar published a few short stories in Urdu magazines, notably Al-‘Asr, published from Lucknow. These were abridged versions of English novels by Henry Augustus Hering (1864-1945), a popular writer in those days. Translating these thrillers was helpful for Zafar Umar in honing his skills for translating and adapting English works into Urdu at a novel length. Then Zafar Umar found Leblanc’s The Hollow Needle and he turned it into a creative work by modifying the main character and naming him Behraam. In 1919, Zafar Umar published Behraam Ki Giriftaari, a translation of another novel by Leblanc. Choron Ka Club was a collection of stories and appeared in 1922. The book contained four of Hering’s stories that Zafar Umar had published earlier.
Zafar Umar published Laal Kathor, his last work, in 1929, and as put by Naim, despite the absence of any acknowledgement we know it was a translation of The Three Just Men, an adventure by Edgar Wallace (1875-1932).
Some believed Zafar Umar was born in 1884, died in Aligarh and never migrated to Pakistan. But Prof Muhammad Aslam disagreed and wrote in his article on the topic, published in the October 1994 issue of Qaumi Zaban, that he was able to find Zafar Umar’s grave in Lahore’s Miani Sahib Graveyard. The tombstone, according to Prof Aslam, read “born April 27, 1883, Muzaffarnagar, died Dec 4, 1949, Lahore”.

According to the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB) Stability Report 2025, the sector experienced double-digit expansion across its major segments, including banking and takaful, with Islamic insurance assets rising by nearly 17 per cent in 2024.
The Islamic Finance Development Indicator (IFDI) Report 2025 — jointly issued by the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and the Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector (ICD) — projects that global Islamic finance assets will reach $9.7 trillion by 2029, reflecting consistent global momentum.
Islamic banking remains the industry’s dominant component, constituting nearly 72pc of total global Islamic finance assets, with Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Malaysia collectively accounting for almost three-quarters of the global share. The sukuk market continues to grow steadily as well, crossing $1tr in outstanding value, while new issuances reached approximately $254 billion in 2024, marking an 11pc year-on-year increase.
These indicators reflect the rapid institutionalisation of Islamic finance —supported by stronger regulatory frameworks, broader geographical adoption (including in non-Muslim jurisdictions), the integration of fintech and environmental, social, and governance principles, and expanding global recognition of Islamic finance’s contribution to sustainable and inclusive economic development.

The future of Shariah-compliant finance will not be shaped in boardrooms alone; it will be built in classrooms and research centres

As the industry approaches its 50-year milestone — tracing back to the establishment of Dubai Islamic Bank in 1975 — it continues to expand rather than mature into stagnation. By 2024, Islamic finance had extended its presence to 140 countries, illustrating the sector’s transformation from a niche idea to a mainstream global financial discipline.
This worldwide expansion has naturally propelled Islamic finance into an important academic field. Universities, research centres, and policy institutes across the world are offering structured programs to develop talent for the growing industry.

 

Malaysia remains a global leader in Islamic finance education. The International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) sets international standards through its MSc, MBA, and PhD programs, which are closely aligned with regulators and the financial sector. The International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) offers advanced degrees in Islamic banking, finance, and Shariah law, integrating jurisprudence with contemporary financial studies.
In the Middle East, Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU) in Qatar provides interdisciplinary programmes combining Islamic finance, law, and public policy. In Europe, universities such as Durham University, Aston University, and the University of Dundee run specialised MSc degrees in Islamic finance and banking, often with strong industry partnerships.
Even non-Muslim countries now recognise Islamic finance as a critical component of ethical, sustainable, and alternative finance education.
These developments reflect a growing global trend: as the Islamic finance industry matures, educational ecosystems are evolving in parallel.
Research centres, think tanks, and executive education programmes are helping to bridge theory and practice, equipping professionals to apply Islamic principles in modern finance, fintech, and risk management.
Within this global context, Pakistan’s financial system is undergoing a profound and historic transformation. Following the Federal Shariat Court’s 2022 judgment mandating the elimination of riba (interest) from the economy — and the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) commitment to a full transition by 2027 — the shift from conventional to Islamic banking has accelerated significantly.
According to SBP’s latest data, Islamic banking deposits now account for over 25pc of total deposits, crossing Rs9.5tr, while Islamic banks’ share in financing has reached 30.5pc. Dedicated Islamic banks such as Meezan Bank, Faysal Bank, Dubai Islamic Bank, and Bank Islami continue expanding their networks, while major conventional banks — HBL, UBL, and Bank Alfalah — have substantially grown their Islamic windows.
However, this transition is not only a regulatory or operational reform; it is fundamentally an intellectual and structural challenge. Shariah-compliant finance requires expertise in Islamic jurisprudence, accounting, law, economics, financial engineering, and technology. Without a trained workforce capable of designing, structuring, auditing, and managing Islamic financial products, the shift risks becoming symbolic rather than substantive.
Thus, Pakistan’s Islamic finance education ecosystem becomes the central pillar of the country’s transformation. To support the emerging financial landscape, universities must produce graduates who understand both Shariah foundations and modern financial systems.
Although progress has been made, significant gaps remain. In 2015, SBP supported the establishment of three Centres of Excellence in Islamic Finance (CEIF) at IBA Karachi, Lahore University of Management Sciences, Lahore, and Institute of Management Sciences, Peshawar.
Some universities — including Bahauddin Zakaria University Multan, COMSATS, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Institute of Business Management Karachi, Hailey College Lahore, and NED University Karachi — have set up Islamic finance programmes or dedicated centres.
Yet, across most higher education institutions, Islamic finance remains limited to one or two elective courses at the undergraduate or graduate level. This leaves business, accounting, and finance graduates at a significant disadvantage in the rapidly changing job market.
The Higher Education Commission (HEC) has attempted to introduce a national curriculum for Islamic finance, but implementation has been inconsistent. A major barrier remains the shortage of qualified faculty capable of integrating classical jurisprudence with contemporary financial technologies, quantitative methods, and regulatory practices.
To build a coherent and sustainable Islamic finance education ecosystem, Pakistan requires a coherent national strategy. To form the foundation for such a roadmap, academia-industry collaboration needs to be strengthened with banks, regulators, and financial institutions partnering with universities to establish Islamic finance centres, sponsor research, develop case studies, and offer structured internships and apprenticeship programmes.
Islamic finance must become a core component of business, accounting, finance, economics, law, and fintech programs and not be limited to elective courses. Professional certification and continuous learning programmes for industry and existing bankers need to be encouraged.
Research and innovation funds dedicated to Islamic finance research, fintech innovation, case studies, and PhD scholarships can help Pakistan develop its own intellectual capital.
Islamic finance is more than an alternative banking system — it represents a values-based approach grounded in justice, equity, risk-sharing, and real-sector economic activity. For a country grappling with rising inequality, unsustainable debt, and speculative financial cycles, Islamic finance offers both moral direction and economic renewal.
But no financial transformation can succeed without intellectual infrastructure. Embedding Islamic finance into Pakistan’s higher education system will cultivate a new generation of professionals who view finance not merely as a means of profit, but as a tool for social welfare and sustainable development.
As Pakistan moves decisively toward interest-free banking, universities and policymakers must take the lead. The future of Islamic finance will not be shaped in boardrooms alone — it will be built in classrooms, libraries, and research centres across the country.

While the findings may not be new, the report marks a departure from the IMF’s conventional focus on monetary and fiscal policies, traditionally seen as the “intensive care” phase for economic stability.
Instead, the report delves into the deeper, systemic flaws rooted in the manipulation of power and resources by influential public and private actors for personal gain. The IMF, however, remains silent on the impact that measures imposed at its behest have on the formalisation of the economy and in controlling theft of energy.
The GCDA examines several critical domains: rule of law, regulatory constraints, fiscal policy and tax regime, public procurement, and state-owned enterprises. Collectively, these domains reveal a governance system characterised by political patronage, fragmented institutions, and weak accountability mechanisms.
Elite capture and policy distortion
One of the report’s central findings is the widespread elite capture that distorts policymaking and diminishes genuine competition. In vital sectors such as real estate, energy, agriculture, and sugar (and one could think of several others not cited in the report), individuals and groups with strong connections exert disproportionate influence over policy and regulatory decisions.

IMF’s diagnostic assessment exposes how entrenched elite capture and weak institutions continue to undermine Pakistan’s governance and economic reform efforts

Rather than promoting productivity and serving millions of Pakistanis, incentives are crafted to safeguard the interests of a few elites. The report surprisingly omits a discussion on long-term tariff protection that restricts exports and limits choice for domestic consumers. Tariff reforms are traditionally a cornerstone of IMF and World Bank recommendations. The government has declared its intent in this direction, but has faced strong pushback from protected sectors.
Economic consequences of governance failures
The report emphasises that governance distortions result in significant economic losses. The IMF estimates that implementing governance reforms alone could boost Pakistan’s GDP by 5–6.5 per cent over five years. The consequences of inefficiency, resource leakage, and arbitrary decision-making are borne not by the privileged elite, but by ordinary citizens who face inadequate public services, rising inflation, and diminishing opportunities.

 

Fiscal governance emerges as a particularly vulnerable area in the assessment. The report identifies considerable discrepancies between budgeted allocations and actual expenditures, as well as non-transparent reallocation methods. Internal controls within government ministries are weak, and procurement processes remain highly discretionary. The limited implementation of modern e-procurement systems further hampers transparency and increases the scope for human intervention.
Tax regime vulnerabilities
Significant vulnerabilities are also present within the tax regime. However, the report does not discuss the IMF’s own role in imposing elevated tax rates on those already participating in the formal economy, which unintentionally encourages individuals and businesses to seek ways to avoid taxation.
It also undermines scale and growth in the formal sector and encourages taxpayers to seek investment and jobs abroad. This omission in the report highlights a critical gap in the IMF’s analysis of how external policy prescriptions contribute to persistent issues within Pakistan’s fiscal governance structure. The Federal Board of Revenue’s audit and enforcement systems are found to be susceptible to interference, enabling both evasion and selective enforcement.
SOEs and the rule of law
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are identified as a major risk. The IMF highlights ongoing political interference in SOE operations, weak governance at the board level, and a lack of financial and operational transparency. Many SOEs, particularly in the energy sector, continue to drain fiscal resources, with circular debt remaining a persistent issue. The report omits a discussion on the impact of high energy tariffs imposed by the IMF on theft and distribution efficiency.
The assessment of the rule of law is equally troubling. Pakistan’s judicial system grapples with extensive backlogs, outdated legislation, and procedural delays, making contract enforcement unpredictable. This unpredictability acts as a major deterrent for both local and foreign investors.
The political will to reform
To address these challenges, the IMF proposes a 15-point reform agenda. While these recommendations reflect long-standing advice from experts, rather than introducing radically new concepts, key recommendations include digitising federal procurement processes, simplifying and rationalising taxes, strengthening internal audits, enhancing parliamentary oversight, and resolving overlapping regulatory responsibilities. It also calls for better co-ordination among anti-corruption agencies and enhanced anti-money laundering and countering financial terrorism.
The report identifies a lack of political will as the most significant barrier to reform. Implementing these recommendations requires confronting entrenched interests that benefit from the status quo.
Historically, attempts at reform that threaten established networks have faced both overt and covert resistance. Consequently, governance reform in Pakistan will demand more than technical adjustments. Dismissing this diagnosis as merely an external conditionality or for its lack of originality would be a grave mistake. Addressing these gaps must be embraced as a national imperative.

Speaking at a news conference, the minister expected the federal and provincial stakeholders of the national finance commission (NFC) would lead to an outcome in the spirit of “Pakistan First” like they had delivered National Fiscal Pact and introduced agriculture income tax (AIT) through provincial legislations. “I look forward to good and constructive discussions with provincial finance ministers and chief ministers” on Dec 4, he said.







He said the nature of NFC was to have consensus mainly on revenue, expenditure and governance and there was no dispute that as a nation the country required not only structural but institutional reforms as also highlighted in the IMF’s governance and corruption diagnostic assessment (GCDA) on the request of Pakistan government.

 

He said it was a separate discussion if there would be AIT collection but it was a fact that for the first time in history, the provinces have legislated AIT. Likewise, expenditures are also required to be made collectively on the pattern of KYC (know your customer) in the banking sector and in line with Anti-Money Laundering Act as Pakistan had only recent graduated out of Financial Action Task Force watch list and could not afford slipping back.

Warns against gold rush to economic growth

That was why the ToRs for the NFC meeting were set in a manner that all the provinces would present their positions and the centre would do the same and listen to each other and take the process forward in an appropriate manner. He said both the federation and the provinces would have to contribute to enhance revenue mobilisation to run the country sustainably. “You cannot run the country on 8-10pc tax-to-GDP ratio,” he said.
“We don’t have to go into gold rush. We have to make economic growth sustainable and for that we have to keep a close eye on balance of payments and current account,” otherwise which finance minister would not like such a key performance indicator, the minister said.
“It is very easy to pump liquidity and have consumption led growth but we would like to have export-led growth,” he said. It was in this direction that the government was making a decisive shift tow­ards an inclusive, private-sector-driven and export-led growth model, he asserted, adding that the PM had set up seven to eight working groups of private sector leaders. He said the abolition of 0.25pc Export Development Surcharge (EDS) after almost four decades was a key demonstration of this commitment.
He said one of the working group had recommended transferring operations of export development fund (EDF) to the private sector and till addressing its governance-related issues, suggested suspending the EDS. But the premier abolished the levy imposed in 1991, he said, adding that a summary had already been moved to the cabinet for formal approval to abolish the EDS.
Shortfall
However, the minister sidestepped a question about the trigger points for contingency measures in the wake of revenue shortfall of about Rs580bn in first five months, saying the revenues should not be seen in the context of targets but a healthy 11pc growth.
About GCD report, the minister said it was part of the government’s broader agenda of institutional strengthening. He said the report had been requested by and developed in consultation with the government through more than 100 meetings. He said the report prioritised 15 key reforms many of which relating to taxation, governance, public financial management, and procurement were already under implementation phase.
He insisted the report’s findings should be viewed in the context of long-standing structural challenges and said the government was strongly determined to advance the remaining recommendations as structural reforms without institutional refo­rms were meaningless and unsustainable. “This is why the government considers the report a catalyst for accelerating reforms rather than a criticism of current policy direction,” he said.
The minister said export performance had strengthened, with overall exports rising 5pc and IT services exports growing by over 20pc year-on-year. He said the IT sector had recorded back-to-back monthly records in September and October, establishing itself as a critical pillar of the “new economy”.
He said the announcement of US Exim Bank joining the $3.5bn Reko Diq syndication, led by IFC had helped achieve financial close for the project following an end to US-government shutdown. He said the financial close will represent a transformational investment that will generate an estimated $2.8-$2.9bn in annual exports once production commences.
Also, the inaugural panda bond in the Chinese market would be issued in December, but no later than Chinese New year. Besides, remittance would be surpassing $41bn this year from $38bn last year, he added.
Responding to questions, he said the government would get out of commodity business sooner the better.

According to a notification from the Petroleum Division, the new HSD price is Rs279.65 per litre, while the new rate for petrol is Rs263.45. The prices will come into effect on December 1.
“The government has revised the prices of the petroleum products based on recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority),” a notification from the Petroleum Division stated.
Most of the transport sec­tor runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
The government charges about Rs99 per litre on both petrol and diesel. Although the general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government charges Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products on account of the petrol levy and climate support levy.
It also charges about Rs17-18 per litre customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre of distribution and sales margins are going to oil companies and their dealers. Petrol and HSD dominate consumption at 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes a month compared to about 10,000 tonnes for kerosene.
Petroleum levy collections reached Rs1.161 trillion in FY25 and are budgeted to rise about 27pc to Rs1.47tr in the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-12-01 03:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/01080248f47e717.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958453/pti-to-stay-calm-despite-being-pushed-towards-conflict-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>PTI to stay calm despite being pushed towards conflict: KP CM</strong></a><br><p>• Afridi announces weekly protests outside IHC, Adiala jail• Claims Imran kept in isolation and visitors denied access• Alleges KP kept deprived of NFC share since 2018• Special assistant says provincial cabinet to meet every Friday
PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said on Sunday that the powers-that-be wanted to push the PTI into a conflict, but the party would remain peaceful and not opt for confrontation.
“However, the PTI will never hesitate to offer sacrifice,” Mr Afridi added while addressing a news conference at the Chief Minister’s House.
He maintained that efforts were being made to corner the PTI, but his party would continue to hold peaceful protests.
“Persistent efforts have been made to isolate the PTI, and peaceful protesters were even shot at,” the chief minister said.
‘Imran in isolation’
He continued that PTI founder Imran Khan was being kept in isolation and solitary confinement, and that all his visitors, including the chief minister himself and Mr Khan’s sisters, were being denied meetings with the incarcerated former prime minister.
Mr Afirdi said that after some unfortunate news was reported by international media, he went to Adiala jail to inquire about Mr Khan’s health, but even after spe­nding an entire night outside the facility, he was refused a meeting.
He added that they then went to the Islamabad High Court (IHC), but the judges also declined to meet them.
Weekly protests
The chief minister said the PTI had decided all its parliamentarians would hold peaceful protests outside the IHC every Tuesday, and accompany Mr Khan’s sisters to Adiala jail.
He added that the KP government would follow the directions issued by the PTI leadership.
“All the parliamentarians, including National and provincial assembly members as well as senators, will protest outside the IHC over delayed case hearings. They will all proceed to Adiala, accompanying Khan sahib’s sisters,” Mr Afridi told reporters.
He said he decided to hold a sit-in outside Adiala jail because his party was being mistreated.
The KP CM stated that while some chief ministers were offered official jets by the Pakistan Air Force and facilitated during travel, he was placed on the Passport Control List.
Responding to questions, the chief minister said no part of KP was under the control of militants. However, without naming anyone, he added that the entire country was being controlled by a single individual.
He said the Centre should consider the provincial government’s suggestions for maintaining lasting peace in KP, adding that decisions taken behind closed doors had harmed the province.
“If the federal government implements what the provincial government has been suggesting, it will be our responsibility to carry out those decisions and maintain law and order,” he said.
He added that the KP government wanted all stakeholders to be taken on board for any decision regarding peace in the province.
NFC share
Mr Afridi said the provincial government would participate in the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting scheduled for Dec 4 and would fight for the province’s rights.
He added that the tribal areas were merged administratively with KP in 2018 but had yet to be merged financially.
He maintained that the NFC share for the merged districts had not been paid to KP since 2018, describing it as a “constitutional violation”.
The chief minister also announced that from Monday (today), awareness sessions would be held for students in universities so they could understand how the federal government had treated the KP government.
Responding to another question, the chief minister said that while he personally did not own any property in Tirah, his family did. He added that the recent documentary against him was an attempt to divert public attention, but people did not believe those who produced it.
“People know everything. They know who is lying, and we want them to do their job… only then will the country move forward,” the chief minister said.
‘Good governance’
Separately, Special Assistant to the KP CM Shafiullah Jan issued a statement expressing similar concerns about the PTI founder’s health. He criticised the PML-N leadership, saying the party had “forgotten its own past”, recalling how its workers met their “convicted leader” in London and sought guidance from him during his stay abroad.
“Today, they are fearful of Imran Khan’s statements and even his photographs,” he said, adding that the PTI founder remained the most popular political leader in the country and that attempts were being made to “block his voice”. Mr Jan said that the KP chief minister had declared emergencies in the education and health sectors and had decided that the provincial cabinet would meet every Friday. “Good governance is among the top priorities of Chief Minister Sohail Afridi,” he added.

The difficult but necessary process of building consensus on the vertical and horizontal distribution of resources under the new National Finance Commission (NFC) framework is set to begin this week. Given the contentious nature of the subject, along with technical and legal complexities involved, the exercise is not expected to conclude anytime soon.
The launch of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) was delayed multiple times after its constitution in August. The inaugural meeting, to be presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, will be attended by the finance ministers of Punjab and Balochistan, as well as the chief ministers of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), who also hold the finance portfolios, along with technical members. The meeting will deliberate on the future strategy after participants share their respective fiscal positions.
No one expects the process to be smooth or swift, given the clash of interests, entrenched positions, and deep sensitivities surrounding the technical, financial and legal dimensions of both vertical and horizontal resource distribution.
The federal government aims to reduce the provinces’ share in the federal divisible pool from the current 57.5 per cent in the next award, either by cutting the percentage outright, or by shifting additional expenditure responsibilities to the provinces, or even a combination of both. The provinces, however, are expected to strongly resist any such move on legal grounds. Under the 18th Amendment of the Constitution, any downward revision of provincial share is explicitly barred in the subsequent NFC awards.

‘Under Article 160, the NFC strictly deals with revenue sharing, not expenditure decisions or efficiency’

The last agreed formula for the horizontal distribution among the provinces will also need to be revisited in light of the 2023 Population Census. While the smaller provinces are likely to push for an enhanced share, Punjab may resist any further adjustment after having accepted a downward revision in its share in the previous two awards, citing its expanding fiscal and development needs.
The longstanding dispute between Sindh and Punjab over the taxation rights of service firms registered in one province but operating in the other may also be addressed to arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution.
The 7th NFC Award took four years to finalise and another year to implement. It was constituted in 2005, announced in 2009 and enforced in 2010. While the current fiscal and macroeconomic pressures may be more compelling, most experts believe that even with the best of intentions and sustained effort, reaching a fresh consensus will remain an arduous and long drawn process.
“Even with sustained effort and collaboration, the 11th NFC Award is unlikely to materialise in less than a year,” observed an expert involved in earlier negotiations. “The process will test the resolve, trust and patience of all stakeholders. Any attempt to rush, pressure or manipulate weaker partners risks undermining the hard-won gains of the 7th NFC Award, which marked a milestone in advancing fiscal federalism, crucial for inclusivity, efficiency and improved inter-provincial harmony in Pakistan.”
Key achievements of the 7th NFC Award include breaking the decade-long deadlock on resource distribution, significantly increasing the provinces’ share of the federal divisible pool, and introducing a multiple-criteria formula for horizontal distribution that favoured less-populated and poorer provinces. It also reduced the federal government’s tax collection charges from 5pc to 1pc and allocated an additional 1pc of the divisible pool to KP to address heightened security challenges.
Some have proposed linking provincial shares to the quality of fund utilisation since the 7th NFC Award in 2010. However, economists from Sindh with experience in the process strongly oppose this idea, calling it illegal and unfair.
Two senior commentators, founders of leading service firms, called for accountability before initiating fresh talks on resource sharing. “Governance remains dismally poor across all tiers. Our limited resources are largely squandered,” said one. Citing the International Monetary Fund’s Governance and Corruption Diag­nostic Report that exposed federal inefficiencies, he added, “A similar diagnostic is urgently needed at the provincial level.”
The other commentator focused on Sindh, arguing that provinces now have ample funds under the current NFC framework, supported by a rise in revenue collection. “The real issue in Sindh is not lack of money, but the intent of its rulers. They know what needs to be done, especially in Karachi, but choose not to, or skew development to serve vested interests,” he said.
Karachi, he argued, is being systematically shortchanged. “The KMC [Karachi Metropolitan Corporation] is powerless, and whatever it receives disappears into bottomless pit.” He called for a comparative study of per capita revenues and public spending in Sindh and Punjab, and how effectively they translate into development outcomes.
Dr Asad Saeed and Dr Kaiser Bengali pushed back against the misconception that the NFC forum governs expenditure decisions. “Under Article 160, the NFC strictly deals with revenue sharing, not expenditure decisions or efficiency,” Dr Saeed clarified.
While acknowledging provinces have varied performance across sectors, Dr Saeed noted that Sindh has done well in primary and tertiary healthcare, leads in public-private partnerships, and is implementing the largest public rural housing project. However, education remains an area of concern. He stressed that expenditure scrutiny is needed nationwide, including at the federal level. But it remains distinct from provincial revenue rights.
Responding to a query on Sindh’s stance, Dr Bengali remarked, “How the provincial government handles federal pressure on NFC remains to be seen. If it refuses to concede, a deadlock is likely.” He added that local government and social indicators have “absolutely no connection” to the NFC, emphasising that such issues must be addressed within each province’s internal political framework.

And if they see no light at the end of the tunnel, their frustration morphs into deep despair, leading them to engage in a range of undesirable behaviours, including begging, theft, forming gangs, or becoming an instrument of anti-state elements.
That said, let’s look at the findings of the Labour Force Survey 2024-25: 1.4 million more people became jobless in the last four years, and the unemployment rate hit a 21-year high of 7.1 per cent. This means 5.9m men and women remain unemployed in our country, whose 250m population continues to grow at more than 2pc per year.
What is alarming is that the unemployment rate is higher among the 15–24 age group — 12.8pc in 2024–25, up from 11.1pc in 2020–21. Little wonder then, we see hordes of frustrated, despairing, disillusioned, and even violent youth roaming around the streets aimlessly — some resorting to petty crimes, and some being discreetly recruited by anti-state networks. This is not to suggest that all young men and women without a job fall under this category; not at all.
The majority of them work in the informal sector on half the national minimum wage to make both ends meet. This is a dangerous situation and needs to be handled carefully. While continuing the ongoing drive against foreign-sponsored and local militants and terrorists, the hybrid regime must also focus on the socio-economic caveats of this problem. These require economic wisdom and political will to free the economy from elite capture and redistribute resources justly and fairly; easier said than done.

If domestic and foreign investment doesn’t flow into agriculture and manufacturing in a big way, how on earth will new jobs be created?

During the first quarter of this century, Pakistanis have endured a lot — under military rule, under weak and dysfunctional democracies, and under hybrid regimes. It is time for serious soul-searching. This country cannot prosper unless the state delivers for the people and makes them feel respected, enjoying their basic rights as enshrined in the original 1973 Constitution.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has attributed the rise in unemployment to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes (due to their stabilising nature) and climate disasters. He is partly right. Each government blames the previous one for fiscal and governance issues that produce large deficits. But each, in turn, fails to address these issues sustainably during its tenure.
As a result, foreign and domestic debt stocks keep piling up, requiring ever-increasing allocations from fiscal resources for debt servicing, leaving little for development expenditure after defence expenses. Lower-than-required development spending keeps Pakistan’s economy in survival mode instead of providing the impetus needed for sustained high growth.
The absence of sustained high growth gives birth to stubborn unemployment, worsened by widespread and deep-rooted corruption, which further reduces actual net spending on health, education, skill-building, provision of affordable utilities, roads and transport infrastructure, and innovation.
Moreover, the high population growth rate — above 2pc — makes the task of creating enough jobs even more difficult, as millions of youngsters become employable every year.
Massive job creation is not possible without unleashing the power of the private sector. But due to structural politico-economic issues, such as blurred lines between the private sector and commercial enterprises run by army-backed institutions, state-owned enterprises being in the red for decades, and political and financial over-pampering of some sub-sectors, this is too difficult.

 

Jobs will keep coming up if the private sector invests more and foreign direct investment flows freely into job-intensive industries. Can the domestic private sector come forward and invest at a time when the political system is fractured? Can foreign direct investment flow freely into Pakistan without eradicating unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and without making Karachi — the industrial and commercial hub of the country — a more liveable city?
And if domestic and foreign investment doesn’t flow into agriculture and goods manufacturing in a big way, how on earth will new jobs be created? In the services sector? Can one even think of a thriving services sector without agriculture and industry providing a solid base? These are serious points to ponder. Policymakers cannot wish them away with slogans and fancy presentations.
The speed with which automation, machine learning and generative and agentic artificial intelligence (AI) are spreading in the developed world and devouring human jobs offers new lessons in distributional economics. Policymakers will have to take this into account as well. In the future, creating jobs for humans would be even more challenging due to automation and AI, particularly if top-tier domestic investors go for them at an accelerated pace.

AFGHAN refugees return to Afghanistan after deportation.—Dawn/file

ISLAMABAD: Afghan refugees, awaiting resettlement in the US, have urged the Trump administration to resume the programme, saying that they were living in Pakistan under extreme hardship and constant fear of deportation.
The statement from the Afghan P1/P2 case holders came days after the US administration abruptly halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghan nationals indefinitely after the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House.
“We, the Afghan allies and partners of the United States with completed P1/P2 cases, express our deep concern and urgent plea for assistance. Our cases were fully processed, and we were awaiting our flight dates when, on January 20, 2025, the programme was suspended without explanation,” the statement shared with the media said.
“For more than three years, we have been living in Pakistan under extreme hardship and constant fear,” it said, while also condemning the Washington attack.
“This was the act of a single individual, and it must never be used to collectively punish thousands of loyal Afghan allies who served the United States honourably and at great personal risk. Individual crime is not a reflection of an entire group, and we respectfully ask that this principle of justice be upheld,” the statement added.
As Pakistan and Afghanistan’s relationship deteriorates due to the terrorist outfits operating from the Afghan soil, Islamabad has stepped up the deportation of Afghan refugees, including those who have valid documents. The statement also reflected this concern, saying the authorities continued to arrest and deport Afghan nationals, including “documented US allies”.

 

“Even official letters from the US Embassy carry no protection, and many with valid documents are still detained and deported. If we are forced back to Afghanistan, we will be immediately identified and killed by the Taliban for our service to the United States,” the statement said, adding that thousands of cases that had already been processed were now in a state of uncertainty.
“We urgently request that the United States uphold its commitments, protect its allies, and resume the evacuation process before more innocent lives are lost,” it added. “We are not criminals. We are the allies who stood with America. Now, we ask America to stand with us,” said the statement issued on behalf of the P1/P2 case holders in Pakistan.
In a recent statement posted on its website, the UN refugee agency had also urged Pakistan to ensure that Afghans with specific protection needs are exempted from the provisions of the ‘Illegal Foreigner Repatriation Plan’ and allowed to remain safely in the country.
The UNHCR confirmed that more than one million Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan in 2025. “In the right circumstances, this would be something to celebrate,” said Philippa Candler, UNHCR representative in Pakistan. “But under the current conditions, it raises more concerns than solutions.”

Many commentators have rushed to frame it as a harsh judgment on the sitting government. This interpretation misrepresents the very purpose of the report.
As the document itself makes clear, the exercise was undertaken at the explicit request of the Government of Pakistan and completed with its full cooperation. It is neither an audit of the current administration nor a verdict on its performance over the past year.
Instead, the report examines governance practices that have evolved over decades, across multiple governments, and that now constrain Pakistan’s economic potential. Its purpose is to identify systemic weaknesses and recommend reforms that can help the country unlock long-delayed improvements in governance and economic management. It is meant to support reform, not to assign blame, and to guide IMF monitoring and programme execution going forward.
The report covers five broad areas: fiscal governance, market regulation, financial-sector oversight, anti-money laundering frameworks, and the rule of law. This article focuses on market regulation and, in particular, on tariff policy, which the IMF describes as a particularly important and costly example of current issues.

The IMF diagnostic report is neither an audit of the current administration nor a verdict on its performance over the past year

According to the diagnostic, reforming this area alone could “increase growth by approximately two per cent over a five-year period while having a meaningfully positive impact on reducing inequality”.
Importantly, the IMF acknowledges that Pakistan has already begun taking meaningful steps to realign tariff policy with an export-oriented growth strategy. After years where protectionist lobbies shaped tariff decisions, policy is now moving toward greater discipline and transparency.
The report highlights two reforms of particular significance. The first is the shift of tariff-setting powers away from the revenue-driven Federal Board of Revenue to the National Tariff Commission. This transition established a whole-of-government structure through the National Tariff Board and the technical Tariff Policy Centre, giving tariff policy a coherent institutional anchor.
The second is the recent approval of the National Tariff Policy 2025–2030. Building on earlier efforts, the new policy outlines a more ambitious and time-bound plan for tariff rationalisation and gradual liberalisation. If implemented faithfully, the IMF notes, these reforms could help Pakistan break from a cycle of ad hoc tariff changes and move toward a trade policy that strengthens productivity, investment, and export competitiveness.
For the IMF, the sustainability of this progress will depend on the government’s willingness to resist the pressures that have historically derailed reform. Still, the overall trajectory is unmistakably positive. A predictable, rules-based tariff regime is essential for a country that seeks export-led growth rather than reliance on protectionism and special interests. Pakistan has taken several important steps in that direction. It must now stay the course.
Looking ahead, the IMF stresses the need to strengthen the National Tariff Commission (NTC), which now has a much wider mandate of not only enforcing trade remedy measures but also tariff setting.
It remains severely understaffed and short of the specialist expertise required to carry out its mandate. Without such capacity, tariff policy remains vulnerable to ad hoc decision-making and rent-seeking pressures. The diagnostic makes clear that if Pakistan is committed to developing a credible, modern tariff regime, expanding and professionalising the NTC is indispensable.
Fortunately, the government has already launched a comprehensive review of the commission’s performance, identified key gaps, and begun evaluating options for meaningful reform. The Prime Minister’s Office is steering this effort by drawing on the experience of leading trade-remedy authorities and successful domestic institutional reforms, such as the setting up of Pakistan Single Window, a time-bound plan to restructure the NTC along similar modern lines is now in its final stages of approval.
All in all, the IMF’s diagnostic report provides a practical roadmap across five core areas that capture much of the government’s most critical work and where reform is urgently needed. What Pakistan now requires is the same disciplined and predictable approach that is beginning to take shape in tariff reforms. The IMF estimates that if these broader reforms are pursued with seriousness and continuity, Pakistan could secure a cumulative GDP gain of 5–6.5pc over five years, an opportunity the economy can ill afford to miss.
If the government follows this path with real commitment, it can significantly improve governance, rebuild confidence among domestic and foreign investors, and bring Pakistan’s economic management closer to international best practice.
Opportunities where there is clarity about the problems and broad agreement on the solutions do not come very often. This is one of those moments. Ignoring it would not only waste a valuable chance but could set the country back at a time when it cannot afford further mistakes.

ISLAMABAD: As the country’s development agenda continues to lack focus on population planning, the ‘Pakistan Population Summit’ — a national dialogue on restoring balance and building sustainable futures — opens today (Monday) to emphasise the need to recognise population planning as an investment in the country’s development.
Pakistan, with a population of over 241 million, is the fifth most populous country in the world, adding four to five million people every year. It’s population growth rate of 2.40 per cent is the highest in South Asia. The rapid increase is outpacing employment opportunities, with official statistics show the country will require 104m jobs by 2040. Pakistan will not be able to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 if the current trajectory of population growth does not slow down.

 

Thirteen of the 17 SDGs are directly or indirectly linked to population growth. For a bright future for the people of Pakistan, especially the youth, which form the majority of the population, it is important to achieve a balance between population growth and available reso­urces.
Sustainable population growth is a prerequisite for sustainable development. Young people are driving change, yet they face major challenges such as economic insecurity, gender inequality, limited access to health­care and education, climate disruption, and conflict.
Rapid population growth in Pakistan poses a serious challenge to socio-economic development. Unsustainable population pressures are depleting natural resources and adversely affecting socio-economic indicators, ultimately impacting the over well-being of the population.
The two-day summit will bring toge­ther politicians, economists, development specialists, private sector leaders, and experts to develop a shared vision as the rising population continues to place pressure on health systems, food and water security, and employment.
Organised by DawnMedia, the summit will feature twelve sessions that will discuss issues such as: restoring population balance by 2050; accelerating economic growth towards a more optimal balance; translating political resolve into action on the ‘tawazan’ narrative; regional reviews of population and economic growth; the human development crisis; heightened responsibility to restore the balance between the centre and the provinces; the ideology of population balance; population challenges in a highly urbanised Pakistan of 2050; empowering women and their choices; abilities of information ministries to influence Pakistan’s optimum population narrative; and reports of provinces in balancing population and economic growth.

 

The sessions will be chaired by Finance Minister Senator Muh­ammad Aurangzeb, Plan­ning and Development Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Minister of State for National Health Services, Regulations and Coord­ination Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmed Bharath, Infor­mation Minister Attaullah Tarar, National Comm­ission on the Status of Women Chairperson Umm-e-Laila Azhar, and Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab. Provincial government leaders will also address various sessions.
British High Comm­issioner Jane Marriott and World Bank Country Director for Pakistan Dr Bolormaa Amgaabazar will speak during a session focused on accelerating economic growth towards a more optimal balance.
United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Country Representative Dr Luay Shabaneh will chair the session on regional review of population and economic growth. Former senator Raza Rabbani will chair the session on human development crisis, which will feature a keynote address by former permanent representative of Pakistan to the United Nations Dr Maleeha Lodhi.

 

The rising population poses a challenge to sustainable development. In this backdrop, strong political commitment and effective governance on population policy is required to make population policy a national priority and integrate it across all development initiatives.
Development specialists have emphasised the need for investment in human capital, particularly in women and girls, who face stark educational disadvantages compared to men, with significant gap in educational attainment across all levels of education.
There is a need to increase public financing up to 2 per cent of GDP and efficient spending for population planning throughout Pakistan. Revisiting the criteria of the National Finance Award has been emphasised since 84 per cent of the award is based on population size.
According to the Population Council, effective implementation of population policy with the goal to achieve the Council of Common Interests (CCI) targets of a total fertility rate of 2.2 children per woman and lowering the population growth rate to 1.2pc per annum by 2030 would mean 50m fewer people by 2050.
The council has called that population growth reduction be included in the Charter of the Economy. A lower population growth rate of 1.2pc by 2030 can lead to a transformation in the economic outlook, it said.

• Banned BLA claims responsibility for both assaults              
QUETTA: Security forces foiled an armed attack on the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in the Nokundi area of the district, killing three attackers late on Sunday night. An FC South spokesman said a group of terrorists targeted the FC headquarters in Nokundi town.
“A suicide bomber detonated himself at the main gate of the headquarters, and after the blast, at least half a dozen armed terrorists attempted to force their way into the camp,” the spokesman said, adding that the FC Quick Response Force immediately retaliated and killed three terrorists who had entered the FC fort along with others.
Sources said heavy gunfire and multiple blasts were heard from inside the fort. Security forces, however, successfully foiled the attack, according to the FC spokesman. “A clearance operation is under way inside the fort,” he said, adding that the situation was under control.
On the other hand, some sources claimed six terrorists had been killed in the operation.
Panjgur ambush
Meanwhile, armed terrorists also launched an attack on an FC checkpost in the Gurmakan area of Panjgur district late in the evening. Reports indicated heavy gunfire between security forces and the attackers. Officials said several terrorists were killed in the exchange of fire, which continued until late night.
The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for both attacks.

Abdelatty arrived in Islamabad last night for a two-day official visit and also met President Asif Ali Zardari and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar earlier today.
The FO statement said during his meeting with Field Marshal Munir, “both sides reaffirmed the importance of continued high-level engagement between the armed forces of the two countries”.







Egyptian FM meets Zardari
Abdelatty also called on President Zardari at Aiwan-i-Sadr today.
A statement by the President’s Secretariat said Zardari told the Egyptian FM that “Pakistan values its longstanding ties with Egypt, which are rooted in shared faith and mutual respect, and looks forward to advancing the relationship in a more structured and forward-looking direction”.
He also conveyed warm greetings for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi.







According to the statement, the president noted that “this year marks 77 years of diplomatic relations between the two countries and expressed the hope that both sides will reinvigorate cooperation in trade, investment and people-to-people exchanges”.
He encouraged greater Egyptian investment in sectors where opportunities are expanding, including energy, logistics, construction, agriculture, mining and IT, the statement said.
For his part, Abdelatty delivered a message from the Egyptian president and expressed “Egypt’s keen interest in expanding its partnership with Pakistan in various fields”, it added.
The two sides also exchanged views on key regional and international issues, reaffirming their resolve to work together for peace, stability, and prosperity.
The statement said earlier, the two leaders also held a one-on-one meeting and exchanged views on key issues of mutual interest.
Separately, the FO statement said the two exchanged views on matters of bilateral cooperation, regional stability, and the humanitarian situation in Gaza. “The president appreciated Egypt’s leadership and constructive diplomatic engagement on issues of regional importance,” it added.
Pakistan to share list of 250 business houses
Before meeting with Zardari, Abdelatty also met Dar separately, and the two addressed a joint press conference.
Dar said during the press conference that he and Abdelatty had a “very, very focused discussion” today on how their nations could contribute to elevating the business-to-business upscaling of the bilateral activities, which the deputy PM termed as “surely not commensurate”, with around $300 million.
“With the depth and the affection the two countries have, […] Pakistan will share with Egypt a comprehensive list of 250 Pakistani business houses representing key sectors of the economy,” Dar announced.
“These businesses will be facilitated and supported to enhance bilateral commercial engagement,” the deputy premier highlighted.



The deputy PM detailed that the business houses will be chosen from “across the board” and through due consultation.
The list of businesses “representing each sector of the economy” will be initially prepared by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FPCCI) in collaboration with the other chambers of commerce. Dar asserted there would be a “very transparent selection of those who really deserve and are willing to work and cooperate, and enhance the business”.
The businesses, after “due diligence in Egypt”, would be declared as the “white list”, Dar said. Noting that the foreign ministry was receiving complaints of waiting too long to obtain a business visa “very frequently”, the minister said those concerns will “cease at least to the extent of these top 250” businesses.
Dar further said that in the three-month period after three months have passed since the first list, Islamabad would select another 250 businesses to take the original list to 500.
He added that the Egyptian FM had also agreed to “process the list and that would again be added to the existing white list at that time from 250 to 500”.
The deputy PM went on to announce that a Pakistan-Egypt Business Council will be established after that to institutionalise private sector cooperation and to promote mutually beneficial commercial partnership and B2B business promotion between Pakistan and Egypt.
“Once these two steps are done, Pakistan and Egyptian Business Forum will also be established,” Dar stated, adding that it would be co-chaired by the two foreign ministers.
Its first meeting would be convened in Cairo in the second quarter of 2026, to advance trade, investment and economic collaboration.
Dar also acknowledged with “little embarrassment” that the Pakistan-Egypt Joint Ministerial Commission had not met since 2010, and neither had the two countries held bilateral political consultations.
Therefore, it was decided that the political consultations would be held in the first quarter of 2026, with Egypt nominating an assistant minister to head its delegation, while the Pakistani team would be led by the foreign secretary.
“They will do the entire preparatory work and agenda for the Joint Ministerial Commission meeting, which has not taken place in 15 years, to be held in the second quarter of 2026,” Dar explained.
“Discussions today reaffirm the strength of Pakistan-Egypt relations, and our shared commitment to further enhance bilateral cooperation across political, economic, defence, cultural and people-to-people domains,” Dar said.
“We agreed to work towards a more structured framework of cooperation and to explore new avenues of partnership,” the deputy premier noted, adding he was confident that the visit would “open new avenues of practical cooperation” between the two countries.
Dar noted that the two leaders also assessed the regional developments, with “particular focus on the grave situation in Gaza”.
“Pakistan appreciates Egypt’s vital role in humanitarian support, mediation efforts and diplomatic engagement to uphold the ceasefire and safeguard the rights of the Palestinian people.”
“Pakistan values Egypt as a key partner in the Muslim world and looks forward to continued engagement at all levels,” Dar affirmed.
The two ministers also discussed India-occupied Kashmir, Afghanistan and cooperation at multilateral fora.
Dar noted Abdelatty’s visit reflected the “longstanding friendship” between the brotherly countries of Pakistan and Egypt.

 

The foreign minister said his Egyptian counterpart also announced the doubling of scholarships this year for Pakistani scholars who wish to study in Al Azhar University.
“While staying in the religious domain, Al Azhar University [offers] courses on how to eliminate terrorism,” Dar pointed out, adding that scholars would learn how to tackle the menace as per religious teachings.
The deputy premier went on to mention that he and Abdelatty met frequently on the sidelines of various global moots this year: “This year, we have met at least half a dozen times if I’m not wrong.”
Islamabad, Cairo agree to intensify coordination to counter cross-border terrorism
At the outset of his remarks, Abdelatty conveyed Egypt’s condolences over the “tragic loss of lives and injuries” in the recent terrorist attacks in Islamabad and Peshawar.
“We stand in full solidarity with Pakistan in the fight against violent extremism and terrorism,” the Egyptian top diplomat affirmed.
“The issue of fighting terrorism is extremely important and we stand ready to share with our brothers and sisters here in Pakistan our very successful experience in fighting terrorism through a holistic approach focusing not only on the security dimension, but also socio-economic dimensions, as well as fighting extremist ideology through the very moderate religious institutions in Egypt, notably the Al-Azhar al-Sharif, Dar Al Ifta and the Ministry of Waqf.”

 

The Egyptian FM said, “In the security domain, we have agreed to intensify our coordination to counter cross-border terrorism and extremism.
“Furthermore, we are eager to leverage this spiritual and intellectual leadership of Al-Azhar al-Sharif to strengthen our joint efforts in promoting moderate discourse and combatting extremist ideology,” he added.
Terming the discussions “extensive and constructive”, Abdelatty said they focused on how to “enhance the partnership that exists between Egypt and Pakistan, and reaffirm our commitment to further strengthen and deepen bilateral cooperation across all areas, including political dialogue, economic partnership, trade, investment, security and defence cooperation, and cultural and educational exchanges”.
‘Agreed to intensify coordination on the Palestinian cause’
The two ministers also exchanged views on regional and international developments, stressing the “importance of peaceful resolution of conflicts, respect for sovereignty, and adherence to the principles of international law and the UN charter”.
“This visit comes at a pivotal moment of our region,” Abdelatty said, recalling that Egypt, alongside Pakistan and other countries, “mediated and voted” on the Gaza ceasefire agreement that was signed in Sharm El-Sheikh.

 

“Egypt will continue uncompromising efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict according to international law and UN Security Council resolutions, and we are working very hard with Pakistan on that.“
The Egyptian FM asserted that the two-state solution was the “only viable path towards genuine and lasting regional stability, which could only be achieved through the creation of a sovereign, viable and independent Palestinian state based on the UN pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital”.
“It is within this context we agreed to intensify our coordination and consultations on the Palestinian cause, particularly the situation in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip,” he added, appreciating Pakistan’s “unwavering solidarity and support for Egypt’s efforts to achieve a just and lasting solution to the Palestinian cause”.
Abdelatty went on to invite Pakistan to an upcoming conference on the reconstruction of Gaza.
“I reiterated Egypt’s willingness to work closely with Pakistan to address global challenges, from countering terrorism to climate change to food security,” the diplomat said.
Abdelatty appreciated Pakistan’s “steadfast support in various multilateral forums”, affirming that Cairo remained committed to close coordination on issues of mutual concern.
Sky’s the limit for our cooperation: Egypt FM
Addressing the media prior to his meeting with Dar, FM Abdelatty termed Pakistan his “second home country”.
“I would also like to convey our deep appreciation of our very cordial relation with Pakistan,” he said, acknowledging “common challenges” on the economic, political and security levels.
“That, of course, encourages us to work together and to cooperate in terms of exchange of best practices and expertise to help each other, and to confirm that stability and peace and development are the main pillars of our strategic partnership,” Abdelatty said.
“We would like to elevate our relationship to the strategic level,” the minister added.

Noting that President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi had instructed him to further enhance bilateral cooperation with Islamabad, Abdelatty said, “Sky’s the limit for our cooperation.”
He expressed Egypt’s willingness to “reinvigorate the existing institutional mechanism of dialogue and cooperation” between Pakistan and Egypt, especially the JMC.
“So it’s timely now to convene the upcoming joint committee meeting. We would also like to agree on a roadmap for our cooperation, which will cover all areas of cooperation — political, economic, investment, trade, security, religious and cultural dimensions.”
“Pakistan holds its relations with Egypt in very high regard and we view this visit as an important opportunity to advance our common objective,” the deputy premier highlighted.
“I appreciate the positive momentum in our recent engagements at different levels, including our interactions on the margins of regional and multilateral fora around the globe,” he added.

“Egyptian and Pakistani brotherhood is broadly known all over the world,” he said, adding that both he and Abdelatty had a great responsibility to take their countries’ diplomatic, economic, trade, business, security, and defence relations to a “much higher level”.
Earlier today, Dar received FM Abdelatty upon his arrival at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Foreign Office said on social media platform X.







Abdelatty held a tete-a-tete meeting followed by delegation-level talks with Dar, during which the two sides reviewed full spectrum of Pakistan–Egypt bilateral relations including political, economic, trade and defence relations; cultural and educational cooperation, and collaboration in the health sector, including Egypt’s support to Pakistan’s national Hepatitis C elimination efforts.
According to the FO statement, Abdelatty also interacted with members of Pakistan’s business community during his engagements in Islamabad, highlighting the potential for expanding trade and investment partnerships.
“The visit of the foreign minister of Egypt contributed to further strengthening the longstanding Pakistan–Egypt relationship and provided an important opportunity to deepen cooperation across all areas of mutual interest.
“Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to continue working together for regional peace, stability, and shared prosperity,” the FO statement said.</p><small>2025-11-30 20:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/30143643614bbb0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958323/ecp-terms-allegations-of-rigging-in-november-by-elections-as-baseless' target='_blank'><strong>ECP terms allegations of rigging in November by-elections as ‘baseless’</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Sunday termed the allegations of rigging in November 23 by-elections, particularly in NA-18 Haripur, as “baseless”.
By-elections were held for six National Assembly and seven Punjab Assembly seats earlier this month. The PML-N fielded its candidates on all seats except a provincial one in Muzaffargarh, and secured victory on all 12 of them. However, opposition party PTI alleged rigging with leader Asad Qaiser rejecting the results.
“As usual, certain specific elements are levelling baseless allegations to make the recent by-elections (particularly NA-18 Haripur) controversial. These allegations include portraying the appointment of the district returning officer (DRO) and returning officer (RO) in NA-18 Haripur as a conspiracy,” the election regulator said in a statement.
Terming such claims “entirely contrary to the facts”, the ECP explained that due to a shortage of staff during general elections, it was not possible for the Commission to appoint ROs and DROs itself. However, in by-elections, such appointments were made as needed.
“In this by-election as well, officers of the Commission already posted in the same area were appointed as DRO and RO,” said the ECP.
“Under the Elections Act, 2017, this is the Commission’s fully legal authority, and the Election Commission has always appointed DROs and ROs using this authority,” it added.
The appointments of DROs and ROs are made well before polling day, and no objection was raised from any side until the day of the election, according to the ECP. “These allegations are being made only after losing the election.”
Furthermore, the ECP said that various forums existed for resolving disputes once the election was completed. “If the RO had refused to receive any application, the concerned party should have approached the Election Commission, but this was not done.”
Similarly, the statement added, “for stopping consolidation or requesting recounting after the election, the first forum is the RO, and if the RO does not act, the Commission should be approached within the prescribed time, but this was also not done”.
The Commission detailed that the allegation of Form-45 being prepared in advance is also incorrect, because “all presiding officers and support staff were taken from the provincial administration”.
“Had the Election Commission desired, it could have appointed employees of federal institutions posted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as presiding officers,” ECP said. “The staff provided by the provincial administration submitted the polling bags and results to the RO’s office after the election, and the security personnel were also from the provincial government.”
The purpose of repeating the same baseless accusations after every election, ECP claimed in its statement, “is only to cast doubt on the electoral process”.
“If any party has objections to the results, the proper forum is the Election Tribunal (which is already functional) where an election petition may be filed, instead of making allegations in the media,” ECP stated, adding that the Commission, including in these by-elections, “has taken actions strictly in accordance with the Constitution and the law and will continue to do so”.
Later, Special Assistant to the KP Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations Shafi Jan said that the provincial government had decided to initiate a formal inquiry into the NA-18 Haripur by-election amid allegations of irregularities.
He added that a reference regarding the alleged rigging was also being sent to the ECP.

Last week, Imran’s sisters had camped outside Adiala Jail, where the PTI founder is currently incarcerated, along with other PTI members after being denied a meeting. According to the PTI, Aleema Khan, Dr Uzma Khan and Noreen were “sitting peacefully” outside the jail when they were manhandled and “violently detained” by police.
After repeatedly being barred from meeting their brother, Noreen and another sister of Imran, Aleema Khan, gave separate interviews to the Indian media on the matter.
“These three sisters of Imran Ahmed Niazi sahib, on May 9 they were also present at the Core Commander’s House,” he said, but added that until now they had not been told not to “cry victimisation”.
“If you ask my legal opinion, their presence is proof … They were there on May 9, they brought groups there and it is visible in the cameras that all three are present there,” Tarar said.
“The drama being made today — there is a reason for that.”
He said that the foreign policy success after Marka-i- Haq was not being digested well by the PTI.
“In their era the economy had dipped; it is (now) moving towards an economy of stability. They are not able to digest this.”
“Why are these sisters going on Indian channels and Afghanistan’s channels and crying for their brother?” Tarar stressed. “In the interview that Noreen Khan Niazi gave to an Indian channel, did she say that she condemns Modi? Those innocent children that were martyred, did she talk about Irtaza Abbas? Did she talk about those citizens that were martyred in Muridke and Bahawalpur? Did she talk about those soldiers and young officers who were martyred? Did she pay tribute to them?”
He slammed the sisters’ actions, saying:
“Those who go on Indian channels and defame Pakistan should be ashamed of themselves.”
He added that Indian channels were providing their platform because they knew that “this family, and this party’s mindset is against Pakistan”.
He further slammed Noreen for not condemning the Hindutva ideology on the Indian channel, the cruelty against Muslims in India, or talking about the issue of India-occupied Kashmir.
“Shame on you!” the minister said with emphasis. “That you go on Indian channels and don’t talk about occupied Kashmir, Marka-i-Haq, martyrs, and you go and cry about victimisation about a prisoner who is involved in a corruption case?”
He said that the family was building “hype” in foreign media about the danger to Imran’s health, saying, “Let me assure you: he’s hale and hearty. There’s no issue. He runs every day on a treadmill for an hour.
“This kind of privileged prisoner — this kind of VVIP prisoner who enjoys five-star hotel facilities — you will not find anywhere in the world,” he said.
He added, “If only, Noreen Khan sahiba, you had gone there and talked about your martyred, about that child Irtiza Abbas. About the victory in Marka-i-Haq … if only you had paid tribute to your prime minister and chief of army staff, and condemned Modi … but for you, politics is important, defaming Pakistan is important, and personal matters are important.”
Noreen Niazi rebukes PML-N
Meanwhile, Noreen Khan criticised the ruling party, PML-N, for what she called “double standards”.
“PML-N’s double standards are staggering. They attack me for giving an interview to Indian media, yet Nawaz Sharif, a former prime minister, has himself used Indian platforms to malign Pakistan’s own military leadership,” she alleged, adding that today, “he and his family sit comfortably in power on the back of a blatantly manipulated mandate”.
“His brother, his daughter, and his party enjoy the perks of authority while lecturing others on ‘principles’.”
She further alleged that “elements aligned with this same power structure shamelessly doctored portions of my interview using AI, a deliberate attempt to distort my words and mislead public opinion.
“These are the same actors who have kept Imran Khan in unlawful, inhumane isolation for four weeks cut off from family, lawyers, and basic rights,” she continued her accusation, adding: “I have never held public office. My only purpose in speaking publicly is to expose the injustice of my brother’s imprisonment and to urge the human rights organisations and judiciary to recognise the systematic denial of his legal, political, and humanitarian rights.”
‘Political-terror-crime nexus’
Tarar also accused Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and his team of having “ties with enemies of the state”, saying it was now “out in the open”.
“Over 4,000 cases have been registered regarding the infiltration of terrorists, who are sheltered [in KP’s] areas, in three years. But, the rate of punishment is nonexistent,” he alleged. “This prosecution system is under the provincial government, which is supposed to bring in legal reforms and make it stronger.”
The minister said the KP government had been “unable to form a system to prosecute terrorists in its 12-and-a-half years in power”.
Continuing his accusations, he said: “The border is being guarded, but due to the weaknesses and failures of the district administration and provincial govt, infiltration has increased.”
Moreover, “there is a political-terror-crime nexus. The CM and his people are involved in drug trade in KP, they maintain close ties with drug lords”, Tarar alleged. “Within 12-and-a-half years, whose responsibility was it to stop drug money being used to finance terrorism?”
He claimed that the KP government’s performance was “negligible because of the political-terror-crime nexus”, under which “drug smuggling is promoted and drug money is used”.
“They (KP government) don’t punish terrorists, and of the over 10,000 cases of drug trafficking from January-August 2025, only 679 cases have been decided,” Tarar added.
“If the KP government knows of such a large drug cartel operating in its territory and cannot take action against it, that means there is a political-terror-crime nexus,” he reiterated the accusation.
Tarar further alleged that “terrorists attack state institutions but not those involved in KP’s drug trade, because doing so, they’d lose their source of financing”.</p><small>2025-11-30 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/3021480870cdb54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958342/israels-netanyahu-seeks-pardon-in-years-long-corruption-trial' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s Netanyahu seeks pardon in years-long corruption trial</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked the country’s president on Sunday for a pardon in his long-running corruption trial, arguing that criminal proceedings were hindering his ability to govern and a pardon would be good for Israel.
Netanyahu, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, denies the bribery, fraud, and breach of trust charges. His lawyers said in a letter to the president’s office that the prime minister still believes the legal proceedings would result in a complete acquittal.
“My lawyers sent a request for pardon to the president of the country today. I expect that anyone who wishes for the good of the country [will] support this step,” Netanyahu said in a brief video statement released by his political party, the Likud.
Neither the prime minister, who has been on trial for five years, nor his lawyers made any admission of guilt.
Opposition leader Yair Lapid said Netanyahu should not be pardoned without admitting guilt, expressing remorse, and immediately retiring from political life.







Pardons in Israel have typically been granted only after legal proceedings have concluded and the accused has been convicted. Netanyahu’s lawyers argued that the president can intervene when public interest is at stake, as in this case, with a view to healing divisions and strengthening national unity.
Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s office described the request as “extraordinary” with “significant implications”. The president “will responsibly and sincerely consider the request” after receiving relevant opinions, his office said.
US President Donald Trump wrote to Herzog this month, urging him to consider granting the prime minister a pardon, saying the case against him was “a political, unjustified prosecution”.
Herzog’s office said the request would be forwarded to the pardons department in the justice ministry, as is standard practice, to collect opinions, which would be submitted to the president’s legal adviser, who will formulate a recommendation for the president.
Israel’s Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, is a member of Netanyahu’s Likud party and a close ally of the prime minister.
In the letter, Netanyahu’s lawyers argued that criminal proceedings against him had deepened societal divisions and that ending the trial was necessary for national reconciliation. They also wrote that increasingly frequent court hearings were burdensome while the prime minister was attempting to govern.
“I am required to testify three times a week … that is an impossible demand that is not made of any other citizen,” Netanyahu said in the video statement, emphasising that he had received the public’s trust by repeatedly winning elections.







Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in three separate but related cases that centre around accusations that he granted favours to prominent business figures in exchange for gifts and sympathetic media coverage.
The prime minister has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
Coalition allies issued statements supporting Netanyahu’s request for a pardon, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
Opposition politician Yair Golan, a former deputy chief of the military, called on the prime minister to resign, urging the president not to grant a pardon.
Netanyahu is one of the country’s most polarising political figures, who was first elected prime minister in 1996. He has since served in government and opposition and returned to the prime minister’s office following the 2022 election.
The next election is due by October 2026, and many polls indicate that his coalition, the most right-wing in Israel’s history, would struggle to win enough seats to form a government.
Throughout his career, Netanyahu has cultivated a reputation for prioritising security and economic issues, but he has also been dogged by corruption charges.
He was prime minister on October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack on Israel. Since then, he has overseen the devastating war in Gaza, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and levelled much of the territory, drawing broad international criticism and condemnation.
Israel has severely weakened Hamas and Hezbollah, and this year launched a war against Iran that destroyed critical military infrastructure.</p><small>2025-11-30 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/302125550bf8e3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958336/imposition-of-governors-rule-in-kp-being-seriously-considered-state-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Imposition of governor’s rule in KP being ‘seriously considered’: state minister</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said on Sunday that the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was being “seriously considered”, linking the need for this potential move to the “security and governance issues” in the province.
Malik said this on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’ where he was asked about the possibility of this move and the government’s plans in this regard.
He said KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and his team had “badly failed in having any sort of a workable situation”. Neither do they want to have any kind of coordination or cohesion with the Centre, nor do they take any action in areas where it was needed, he added.
Given the situation, the governor’s rule was now being “seriously considered”, he said, adding that it was a “constitutional measure”, which was undertaken in case of an “absolute necessity”.
“And I think, the situation in KP itself calls for a step to be taken in this regard so that the presence of an administrative structure is ensured there.”
Asked whether the government had finalised the decision to impose the governor’s rule in KP, Malik said the president had the authority on this based on the prime minister’s advice under Articles 232 and 234 of the Constitution. “And the federal government is pondering [this option].”
However, when it was pointed out that under Article 234 a governor could recommend the move to the president while the federal government had little to do with it, the state minister said the governor’s recommendation was just one option.
“The president can take this step on his own as well […] the approval for which will later have to be taken by a joint sitting of [Parliament],” he said, adding that under the Constitution, governor’s rule could be imposed initially for two months, and it could later be extended further if required.
When asked whether the governor’s rule would be imposed after replacing incumbent KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Malik replied that the matter was at a “very nascent” stage.
Citing “reports”, he also accused the KP government of “planning to block routes and cut off the province” from the rest of the country.
Kundi unaware of reports about potential removal
Earlier today, KP Governor Kundi expressed ignorance about reports of him potentially being replaced and said he would “accept” his party’s decision in case of such a scenario.
The KP governor made this statement while speaking to journalists, who sought his comments on his potential replacement.
When one of them said that “total six names” had surfaced in connection with the matter, Kundi asked: “Where have they surfaced?”
To that, the journalist said they were being reported in the media.
“Now if the media will appoint the governor, then may God have mercy on us,” replied Kundi.
To a question about a possible scenario of his removal, the governor said he would “accept whatever the party’s decision will be”.
Media reports about Kundi’s potential removal have been circulating lately, which the KP governor had previously denied. Back then, too, he said he would “accept whatever decision will be taken by the leadership of Pakistan Peoples Party”.
Amid these reports, Kundi also called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last week to discuss matters concerning KP, including the imposition of governor’s rule.
At the time, a source in the PM Office said the prime minister expressed full confidence in Kundi and gave signals that the government had no intention of removing him.
The discussion on the occasion covered key administrative issues concerning KP and the country’s overall political situation, during which Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Engineer Amir Muqam and Federal Minister for Public Affairs Unit Rana Mubashir Iqbal were also present.
Among them, the issue of imposing governor’s rule in KP was discussed reportedly due to a rigid stance by Chief Minister Sohail Afridi towards the Centre, armed forces and bureaucracy.
Governor Kundi also requested that the prime minister on the occasion to provide KP’s due share in the forthcoming National Finance Commission award.</p><small>2025-11-30 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636583-human-potential-fund-for-pakistan-unveiled-at-oxford-university' target='_blank'><strong>Human Potential Fund for Pakistan unveiled at Oxford University</strong></a><br><p>

“Please be informed that the process has been initiated. PM is returning shortly. Notification will be issued in due course of time,” Asif said in a post on social media platform X.







The CDF position, created under the 27th Constitutional Ame­nd­ment, replaced the now-abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC), which formally ended on Nov 27. It will be a dual-hatted position combined with the office of the army chief.

 

Officials and observers had expected the new notification to coincide with the abolition of the CJCSC post, but November 29 was seen as a critical marker, being the date on which the original three-year tenure of the incumbent Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Field Marshal Asim Munir, was set to expire.
Asif’s statement came as the November 29 date passed without any notification being issued to formally appoint the country’s first CDF.
His statement implies that the notification will be issued upon Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s return to the country, who is currently visiting London. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told Dawn that the PM would return to Pakistan on Monday.
Need for notification
Some legal experts had argued that without a new notification, Field Marshal Munir’s tenure could be interpreted as having lapsed.
However, a 2024 amendment to the Pakistan Army Act extended the tenure of the service chiefs to five years. That change included a “deeming” clause stating that the amendment “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act”, a formulation that legal minds say removed the requirement for a fresh notification extending the COAS tenure from three to five years.
Still, there is near consensus among security and legal officials that the creation of the CDF post, a new assignment rather than a continuation, does require a formal notification. Under the 27th Ame­ndment and subsequent changes to the Army Act, the army chief will simultaneously serve as the CDF for a five-year term.
Therefore, several security sources, when contacted by Dawn earlier, said the government would have to issue a new, public notification assigning the CDF role to Field Marshal Munir.
Unresolved debates
The delay in the issuance of the notification has also been widely seen as a sign of unresolved debates within the highest levels of government. According to individuals with insight into the discussions, one point that has been under consideration is which date will be taken as the start of the COAS’s five-year tenure: November 2022 when Field Marshal Munir originally took command or November 2025 as had been broadly speculated after passage of the new legislation.
Another sensitive question that has been raised pertains to the extent of operational and command authority the CDF would exercise over the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy.
The government rapidly pushed the 27th Amendment through parliament earlier this month, but the notification setback has left top military leadership embarrassed and has complicated the transition to the restructured higher-defence framework, which military planners had hoped would be seamless.
Another pending decision has been the appointment of the commander of the National Strategic Command, a new four-star position created to assume the nuclear manager role previously exercised by the CJCSC. Officials believe this appointment will be made only after the CDF notification is issued.

Bilawal made the remarks in a video address to mark the PPP’s 58th foundation day, with his speech being live-streamed in “more than 100 districts” across the country, as per the party.
Bilawal recalled that the ruling PML-N had also proposed constitutional tweaks related to the provinces’ financial rights under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, which were then rejected by the PPP and did not make it to the final version of the 27th Amendment.
“The PPP considers that there were a lot of faultlines in this country and remain,” Bilawal said, adding that the PPP had tried to address those by giving provinces their rights and due representation, and restoring democracy in the past.
“Those people who are trying to play with the NFC Award or the 18th Amendment or other such matters, or are thinking of doing so, it is as if they are playing with fire,” Bilawal warned.







Noting that the government “could see” that the Indian defence minister made aggressive statements about Sindh and that tensions were being created on the Afghan border, Bilawal affirmed: “We will try our best that the internal faultlines in Pakistan are addressed, instead of providing any forces the chance to misuse or take advantage of our faultlines.”
The PPP chairman said that if united, the country had the ability to face any adversary, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and “all sorts of conspiracies”.
Bilawal praised his party for “saving the constitutional guarantee of the provinces’ financial share”.

 

“They (PML-N) wanted to bring back the system of executive magistry; they wanted back the subjects of education and population control that had been devolved to provinces in the 18th Amendment. […] Similarly, the government had other wishes,” he noted.
“I have been protecting your rights and God-willing, will keep doing so,” the PPP scion vowed, adding that his party was ready to support any decision that would strengthen the federation.
“But the PPP can never back a decision that would weaken the federation or through which province’s rights would be usurped,” he asserted.
‘FCC will prove wrong those trying to make it controversial’
During his address, Bilawal also spoke about the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) established under the 27th Amendment — a move the PPP had long advocated for, but was omitted in the 26th Amendment.
“Some people are trying to make this constitutional court controversial,” he noted, adding that he hoped the FCC would “prove all those wrong through its character”.







In a message to those “political forces who wanted to make a parliamentary move controversial”, the PPP chief stressed that it was the parliament’s and the public representatives’ power to enact legislation.
“If someone is demanding that a court or a judge decide on whether the Amendment can remain or not, it is not their authority, and neither will we allow that any other institution interferes in the parliament,” Bilawal warned.
The 27th Amendment and the FCC created through it have been at the centre of a heated debate. The FCC has dethroned the Supreme Court as the country’s top judicial forum, with international experts and judges having raised concerns over judicial independence.

 

“[The FCC], that institution and its judges have a major responsibility on their shoulders. While representing the Centre, they have to oversee our constitutional issues and judicial independence,” Bilawal said.
He expressed the hope that the FCC would try to “restore people’s trust [in the judiciary] and become a court that will prioritise the Constitution, the law and do justice”.
The PPP scion said it was “definitely his wish” that a Constitutional Amendment be passed through a consensus. However, he highlighted: “If not with consensus, then this work was done through a majority and by the parliament, so only the parliament has the power to review that decision or not.”
“We hope that the constitutional court will look at this country’s biggest constitutional and political issues, and our older Supreme Court of Pakistan will look at all criminal matters,” Bilawal said.
Taking a jibe at what his party deemed judicial activism, Bilawal said he hoped the FCC would not be a court that would “head out to build dams, destroy poor people’s homes, decide the prices of tomato and samosas, send democratic governments home, or disqualify prime ministers for not writing a letter”.

 

“We are about to address a major judicial faultline in the form of the constitutional court,” Bilawal asserted.
He added that this new set-up would enable the ordinary citizens to get “immediate relief” in criminal cases, as they will be focused on by the SC.
“We not only fulfilled the [promise] of creating a constitutional court but also assured the equal representation of provinces in that court,” he highlighted.</p><small>2025-11-30 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636556-kp-cm-alleges-imran-khan-held-in-isolation-since-nov-4' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM alleges Imran Khan held in isolation since Nov 4</strong></a><br><p>

Shadab last featured for the national side back in June during the T20I series against Bangladesh before an injury ruled him out.
Since then, Pakistan have found their main all-rounder in Mohammad Nawaz, who has starred with both bat and ball across past six months as the team won a tri-series in the UAE before making it to the Asia Cup final.
On Saturday, Pakistan won another tri-series, this time at home, after beating Sri Lanka clinically in Rawalpindi — the match seeing Nawaz take three wickets to turn the game around for the hosts.
Apart from Nawaz, opener Saim Ayub has also consolidated his role as Pakistan’s impactful spin option while Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq have announced themselves as worthy specialists.
Salman, however, didn’t rule out the possibility of Shadab’s return when the teams flies out to Sri Lanka — the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup along with India — in the first week of February.
“He was the team’s vice-captain when he got injured unfortunately,” Salman said of Shadab in the post-match press conference.
“And when you have a player available who has played so many World Cups, who has experience, who can bat at number 5-6 and give you a spin option—if we feel he fits, then of course, why not?”
The growing depth in Pakistan’s spin department has been one of the defining themes of their white-ball resurgence in recent months.
With Saim providing regular breakthroughs in the powerplay, and the pairing of Abrar and Usman offering variety through the middle overs, Salman said the management was now confident of tailoring combinations according to conditions in Sri Lanka, where spin is expected to dominate.
“If conditions allow us to play two specialist spinners, or even more, we won’t hesitate,” he said.
“We have Nawaz, Saim, Abrar and Usman — four very different options. Our job is simply to field whatever combination is best for Pakistan. If the pitches support spinners, you may see all of them.”
Pakistan’s opponents at the World Cup will likely face surfaces that demand nuance rather than brute force, a factor that Salman believes could neutralise the trend of high-scoring T20Is elsewhere.
Asked whether Pakistan possess the batting strength to chase scores beyond 200 — a benchmark that has increasingly become common in the format — he was measured.
“For that, conditions have to allow 200 runs to be scored,” he said. “In Sri Lanka, you generally don’t get pitches where such totals are common.
“But if the surface demands it, we have the capability to both score and chase big totals. The players have shown that over the past few months.”
The captain also reflected on Pakistan’s overall progress this year, noting that the side had grown significantly since their disappointing start in January.
He pointed out that despite early setbacks, the team had stitched together a consistent run across white-ball cricket in the build-up to the World Cup cycle.
“Our start wasn’t good,” he admitted. “But we finished the year strongly. In the last two or three months, we have won almost all our white-ball series.
“Now the challenge is to carry this momentum into next year. We have no matches in December, so the next phase begins immediately in January. We want 2026 to be a year people remember — by winning the World Cup.”
With Pakistan currently employing different captains across formats, Salman acknowledged the added responsibility on his shoulders but insisted he had grown into the role after an initial period of adjustment.
“If you’re leading Pakistan, there will always be pressure,” he said. “Responsibility comes with the job. Maybe at the start I struggled to balance my batting with captaincy, but over the last five or six months I have understood how to manage both. I feel far more settled now.”</p><small>2025-11-30 12:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636534-speculation-irresponsible-cdf-notification-to-be-issued-in-due-time-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Speculation 'irresponsible', CDF notification to be issued in due time: defence minister</strong></a><br><p>

Despite the declaration of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on October 9, Israel has continued to bombard the territory while a long-term plan for peace is discussed.
The defence minister posted today on social media platform X that the ceasefire agreement had been criticised for being one-sided and that Israeli forces “continue to violate the truce, killing Palestinians including children”.
“The agreement, signed in Sharm el-Sheikh, was meant to bring stability to the region, but Israel’s actions have raised concerns about its commitment to the deal,” Asif said.
The defence minister added, “Muslim countries that supported the treaty, including Turkiye, Egypt, and Qatar, may need to reassess their stance given the ongoing violence.
“Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has already expressed concerns, stating that the ceasefire agreement shouldn’t be mistaken for a final settlement to the Palestinian issue,” he said.
Asif pointed out that since the ceasefire took effect on October 10, at least 352 Palestinians had been killed, while over 70,000 people had lost their lives in Gaza since the start of the conflict.
He added that Amnesty International had warned that “Israel’s genocide is not over, and the international community especially western governments must keep pressuring Israel to abide by international law”.







A cornerstone of the United States-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. However, countries that had previously supported the plan have since expressed reservations.
Yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said that Pakistan was willing to commit troops to the Gaza peace force, but “not ready” to participate in the disarming of Hamas.
“We are not ready for that. This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement,” he said.</p><small>2025-11-30 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636523-information-ministers-lambasts-imran-khans-sisters-for-appearing-on-indian-channels' target='_blank'><strong>Information minister lambasts Imran Khan's sisters for appearing on Indian channels</strong></a><br><p>

The shooting took place inside a banquet hall in Stockton, northeast of San Francisco, just before 6pm (7am Sunday PKT), San Joaquin County Sheriff’s office spokesperson Heather Brent told reporters in a news briefing.
The victims, who range from “juveniles to adults”, were taken to local hospitals, Brent said, adding that information on the shooting was limited.
“What we have confirmed at this time is that there was a banquet hall where a family was celebrating. We have 14 victims of this shooting. Four of those are deceased,” Brent said.
“Early indications suggest that this may be a targeted incident. Investigators are exploring all possibilities at this time.”
The sheriff’s office said in a post on social media that detectives were “working to determine the circumstances leading up to this tragedy”.
“We are urging anyone with information, video footage, or who may have witnessed any part of this incident to contact the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Office immediately,” it said.
No suspect has been identified so far.
California Governor Gavin Newsom had been briefed on the shooting, his office said in a post on social media.







There have been 504 mass shootings in the US so far this year — including the Stockton incident — according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot.</p><small>2025-11-30 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636503-all-three-peshawar-fc-hq-suicide-attackers-were-afghan-nationals-confirms-nadra' target='_blank'><strong>All three Peshawar FC HQ suicide attackers identified as Afghan nationals</strong></a><br><p>

Data compiled by research organisation Population Council, UK Aid and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) shows the average annual growth rate in Pakistan — based on data from 2017 to 2023 — is 2.55 per cent, resulting in a population of 241.5 million, making it the fifth most populous country in the world.
The country is on course to cross 300 million within the next five years and edge towards 400 million by 2050.
According to a DawnMedia press release, the two-day event will take place at the Serena Hotel.
The event will take stock of the situation in Pakistan, as it faces the challenges of rising population growth outpacing available resources.

 

“Urgent and serious action is required to bridge the growing gap between demographic increase and sustainable resource management. Recognising the crucial implications of a high population growth rate on Pakistan’s economy, social infrastructure, education, health, food and water security, and employment is critical,” it said.
The summit is aimed at bringing together politicians, economists, development specialists, and private-sector leaders to establish a practical pathway to long-term growth.
Notable speakers exp­ected to address the event include Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb, among others.
The summit is being organised by DawnMedia in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning, De­­v­­elopment and Special Ini­tiatives; the Ministry of Na­­tional Health Services, Regulations and Coordi­nation; the Sindh government, the KP government, UK International Deve­lopment and the World Bank Group as principal partners.
It is supported by the Karachi Water and Sewe­rage Corporation, while the Population Council and FCDO serve as strategic partners, while Pathfinder International, Population Services International, QZ Catalyst, and UNFPA contribute as knowledge partners. Ipsos and Repu Media-Acumen Media Intel­ligence also support the initiative as research partners.

Jhang Satellite Town police said the attackers managed to flee after the shooting.
Munir Sadhana was on the way to Jhang District Courts Complex when his car was attacked near Bilqees Hospital. As a result of firing, his driver Mumtaz Ahmad died instantly while Sadhana himself, shopkeeper and passer-by Mushtaq were shifted to Jhang District Headquarters Hospital where Sadhana and passer-by also succumbed to their injuries.
The lawyer was a close aide of former federal interior minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat, who was present at the hospital to receive the body of his friend along with relatives of the deceased.
Deputy Commissioner Ali Akbar Bhinder and DPO Bilal Kiani were also present. As soon as news of attack reached the courts, the lawyers started their strike.
In a press release, DBA President Mehr Muhammad Fareed Nawaz Naul has announced three working days of mourning over the assassination of Sadhana. He demanded the immediate arrest of the killers.
Till the filing of this report, no FIR was registered and the police said they had not received a complaint for registration of the case yet.
A large number of people, including lawyers, judges and government officers, attended the funeral prayers for Sadhana at Church Ground.
ACCIDENT: A motorcycle rider died and his two pillions were injured critically after a speeding car hit their two-wheeler near the FDA City gate on the Sargodha Road.
Nishatabad police identified the deceased as Ahmad Ali (19) of Chak 46-JB and injured as Naveed (18) and Nawaz (21). Both the injured were shifted to Allied Hospital. The car driver fled after the accident.
Meanwhile, a 22-year-old unidentified man died at Allied Hospital after being hit by a train near the graveyard of Chak Bhaiwala in Millat Town police area. He was crossing the track when he was hit by the train.
APPROVAL: The Provincial Development Working Party (PWDP) has approved the establishment of a landfill site for waste management in Faisalabad.
The landfill site, which will be established on 150 acres, at the locality of Lakwana located on the Makkuana-Khurianwala Road will have a capacity to dump 1,100 tonnes of waste every day while a plan for recycling waste/garbage is also included in it.
Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar said there was a dire need for a landfill site in Faisalabad and the approval of funds for it by the PWDP was a significant step. He said the work on this project would start soon.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Con­stitutional Court (FCC), the country’s newly-established apex forum for constitutional interpretation, apparently acting under the proviso of Article 208 of the Constitution made certain appointments in which some employees have been placed in the federal government’s Special Professional Pay Scale (SPPS) policy.
A notification issued by FCC earlier this week, and approved by Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, created eight senior posts — including one in BS-22 and seven in BS-21 — all placed in SPPS. Under SPPS-I, the pay package ranges from Rs1.5 million to Rs2m, almost equivalent to the salary of a high court judge.
However, senior federal officials familiar with service laws say the FCC administration has thus far not framed any rules under Article 208 and therefore, under the proviso to the said article, can only follow the Supreme Court Rules relating to the appointment of officers and servants of the SC.
Assigning the pay scales of SPPS to certain officers, without there being a similar provision in the related Supreme Court Rules, may raise issues as to the legality of the settled terms and conditions of officers and servants of FCC.
At present there are four types of pay packages for those being paid from the exchequer.
It includes the Basic Pay Scale, which applies to all the government sector; the Project Pay Scale, which covers the salaries of those working on specific projects of the government; the Management Pay Scale, also called the MP Scale for highly trained professionals; and SPPS, which was introduced to attract the highly paid experts of the private sector.
According to the FCC notification — issued under Article 208 of the Constitution — the court has created administrative posts, including: registrar (SPPS-I/BS-22) – one post, secretary to the chief justice (SPPS/BS-21) — one post, additional registrar (SPPS/BS-21) — six posts, deputy registrars (BS-20) — six posts, assistant registrars (BS-19) — 10 posts, senior private secretaries (BS-20) — five posts , research and reference officers (BS-19–20) — six posts, and a range of other positions from BS-16 to BS-2, including senior assistants, clerks, dri­­­vers, daftaris, qasids and sweepers.
The notification states that the expenditure will be met from FCC’s allocated budget for FY 2025-26.
‘Not permitted under SC Rules’
A senior court official told Dawn that the SPPS pay scales were incorporated into the notification without fully understanding the legal prerequisites, adding that a review was now under consideration.
The 27th Constitutional Amen­dment, which created FCC, amended Article 208 to clarify that till the court frames its own rules, the rules governing officers and servants of the Supreme Court shall apply mutatis mutandis.
The proviso read: “…till such time rules are made in this regard, the rules providing for the appointment of officers and servants of the Supreme Court and for their terms and conditions of employment shall mutatis mutandis apply to the officers and servants of the Federal Constitutional Court.”
A senior SC official confirmed that the court’s rules contained no provis­ion for SPPS appointments and did not permit high-salary contractual expert hiring structures of this nature.
The SPPS framework — detailed in the Establishment Division’s office memorandum of April 9, 2024 — lays out strict conditions for creating and filling the SPPS positions.
They include that the SPPS posts are for technical specialists, not regular bureaucracy. This means they require “highly skilled and specialised professional experts” in specific technical fields.
“It cannot be used to appoint registrars, secretaries, additional registrars or routine judicial administrators, who fall under regular service rules,” a senior official of the Establishment Division told Dawn.
Mandatory steps
As per the SPPS policy, before creating any posts, the sponsoring division must: establish that no equivalent expertise exists within sanctioned strength; prepare detailed terms of reference, job descriptions, job specifications, deliverables and timelines; and provide justification for hiring technical specialists under SPPS instead of management or regular service scales.
There is no indication that FCC conducted such a need assessment as it was not mentioned in the notification.
The SPPS recruitment must be competitive and widely advertised. The policy requires: national advertisement of vacancies; scrutiny by an internal committee; selection by a special selection board, which includes ministry officials and outside experts; and approval from the relevant minister or secretary depending on scale.
These steps are mandatory, but the FCC notification simply created the SPPS posts without initiating any recruitment process.
The SPPS appointments are contractual, not permanent, the policy read. It added that SPPS was strictly for two-year contracts, extendable only after performance evaluation. The FCC notification creates the posts as regular establishment positions, contradicting the SPPS structure.
FCC Registrar Mohammad Hafeezullah Khan told Dawn that the SPPS packages were “in accordance with the law”.
He argued that Article 208 empowered FCC to determine its own staffing structure.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin of the Department of Homeland Security said in a post on X that the suspect, Mohammad Dawood Alokozay, had uploaded a TikTok video showing himself assembling what he suggested was an explosive device. She said the video indicated that the Fort Worth area was his intended target.







Alokozay was arrested on Tuesday by the Texas Department of Public Safety and the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and charged with making terroristic threats.
The arrest came less than 24 hours before the violent attack in Washington in which another Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, shot and critically wounded two members of the US National Guard. Lakanwal, who had been in the United States for more than a year, opened fire during a routine patrol near a residential neighborhood not far from the Capitol. Authorities described the shooting as a deliberate act of terror. He was taken into custody shortly afterward.

Suspect uploaded video on social media showing himself assembling ‘explosive device’

The two back-to-back incidents involving Afghan nationals have added urgency to President Donald Trump’s new immigration actions. The president has already announced a “reverse migration” initiative aimed at removing immigrants who “do not belong here or do not add benefit to our country”. He has also ordered federal agencies to conduct heightened security reviews of Afghans who entered the United States under Operation Allies Welcome, calling for a case-by-case reassessment of their status.
Trump has vowed a permanent halt to migration from all third world countries and directed his administration to reexamine every refugee, parole, and humanitarian program created during the Biden years. More directives are expected as agencies expand their scrutiny of recent arrivals.

In a statement issued in Geneva on Friday, the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society. He added that the “hastily adopted” amendments undermined judicial independence and raised concerns about military accountability.
A press release issued by the FO said that Pakistan rejected the “baseless” statement.
“Pakistan notes with deep concern the ungrounded and misplaced apprehensions aired on behalf of the UN high commissioner for human rights regarding the 27th Constitutional Amendment adopted by the two-third majority of the parliament of Pakistan,” the press release by the FO said.
“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the Constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan,” it added.
The FO said that democracy and democratic methods “form the bedrock of civil and political rights, and therefore must be respected”.
“The constitutional amendments adopted by the parliament of Pakistan followed due procedures as enshrined in Pakistan’s Constitution,” it said.
It added that Pakistan remained “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law” as enshrined in the Constitution.
“While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan’s views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the FO said.
“We urge the high commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan’s parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation.”
The recent 27th Amendment was pushed through Parliament at top speed earlier this month amid widespread outcry. Among the top concerns are its overhaul of the judicial system via the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court, and changes to Article 243 positioning the army chief as the new Chief of Defence Forces at the top of Pakistan’s armed services.</p><small>2025-11-30 05:32</small></div><hr>
