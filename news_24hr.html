“The United States strongly condemns January 31 attacks and acts of terrorist violence against security personnel and civilians in Balochistan, claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army, a US-designated Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” Baker said on X.
On behalf of the US, she extended condolences to the victims of terrorism, their families and all those affected. “The Pakistani people deserve to live free from violence and fear,” she said.
Baker added: “The United States remains a steadfast partner of Pakistan in its efforts to ensure peace and stability. We stand in solidarity with Pakistan during this difficult time.”







The US envoy’s statement comes after terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out a spate of attacks across Balochistan on Saturday, responding to which the security forces killed 92 terrorists.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Besides the US, the British High Commission, Qatar and Saudi Arabia had also condemned the latest terrorist activities.
The proscribed so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has carried out frequent attacks in Balochistan, specifically targeting security forces and law enforcement agencies.
In August 2025, the US also designated the BLA and its Majeed Brigade squad as foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs).

 

Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year-on-year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
In 2024, the BLA emerged as a key perpetrator of terrorist violence in Pakistan.
We had intelligence reports: CM Bugti
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also addressed a press conference in Quetta, sharing details of Saturday’s attacks.
Stating that the state shared their grief, CM Bugti assured the bereaved families that the welfare of the martyrs’ children was the government’s responsibility.
“We had intelligence reports that this kind of operation is being planned, and as a result of those, we had already started pre-operations a day before, in which around 40 terrorists were killed in Shaban and Panjgur,” he detailed.
The chief minister noted that the terrorists had planned to attack Quetta from Shaban, adding that the forces were “very vigilant”.
He highlighted that 145 terrorists were killed in 40 hours, adding that their bodies were with the authorities. “This is the highest number since Pakistan is facing this war on terror,” he said.
‘Mopping-up’ operation underway: defence minister
Separately, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said peace has been established in Balochistan after yesterday’s attacks and security forces were now “engaged in a mopping-up operation”.
“At this moment in time, peace has been established, and the coordinated attack has been repulsed completely, and they (terrorists) have retreated,” Asif said while addressing the media in Sialkot.
The defence minister further said that attempts were made to target the FC headquarters in Nushki and Dalbadin, adding that all attacks were foiled.
“They attempted to carry out a suicide attack in Dalbadin,” he said, adding that “all targets have been neutralised”.
Echoing Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s statements, Asif blamed the incidents on neighbouring India, adding that the attacks aimed to “destabilise the country at a time when it is on the path to progress”.
“Our intelligence and the confessional statements by terrorists all prove linkages to India,” the defence minister said.
Pointing out that the BLA was now making use of female bombers, Asif said two of Saturday’s attacks involved women perpetrators.
“The minds of young women are being polluted,” he said, adding that the BLA was now targeting “labourers and poor people struggling to survive”.
Balochistan attacks
On Saturday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni.
During the operations, 15 personnel embraced martyrdom, the military’s media affairs wing added.
Eighteen others, including children, also died as terrorists targeted civilians in Gwadar and Kharan, the ISPR said.
Among the attacks, a bomb blast was reported in Quetta, where Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti visited later to review the security situation.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi held India responsible for the series of attacks, asserting that the authorities would go after every single one of those involved and the “masters behind them”.</p><small>2026-02-01 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0112340034b36ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970409/4-dead-28-injured-as-bus-carrying-wedding-party-overturns-in-punjabs-lodhran' target='_blank'><strong>4 dead, 28 injured as bus carrying wedding party overturns in Punjab’s Lodhran</strong></a><br><p>LODHRAN: A child was among four dead while another 28 were injured when a bus carrying wedding guests overturned after colliding with a truck in the Mandhali Mor area of Punjab’s Lodhran district on Sunday.
According to a statement issued by Rescue 1122 Lodhran, a “high-speed coaster carrying members of a wedding procession overturned while crossing in front of an overloaded truck, killing four people on the spot”.
It added that the deceased included two men, one woman and a child.
Another 28 were injured, out of which 27 sustained “severe” injuries and were rushed to the Lodhran District Hospital, while another person was provided medical assistance on the spot, Rescue 1122 said.
Separately, a statement by the office of Lodhran District Police Officer (DPO) Ali bin Tariq said he reached the site of the incident immediately after receiving an alert about it.
“Reasons behind the accident are being determined, and legal action will be taken against those responsible,” DPO Tariq was quoted as saying.
Last month, at least 24 people were killed, and over 20 were injured in two separate accidents on the same day, as a truck fell into a dry canal in Punjab’s Sargodha district and a coach overturned near Balochistan’s Ormara tehsil.
Days later, in a separate incident, five persons, including a school-going child, died in two separate traffic accidents due to poor visibility caused by dense fog in Nankana Sahib and Sialkot.</p><small>2026-02-01 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/011216258df05f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970408/iran-considers-eu-armies-as-terrorist-groups-in-retaliatory-move' target='_blank'><strong>Iran considers EU armies as ‘terrorist groups’ in retaliatory move</strong></a><br><p>Iran considers as “terrorist groups” the armies of EU countries that listed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on the bloc’s list of terrorist organisations, Parliament Speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf said on Sunday.
The EU marked a symbolic shift in its approach to Iran’s leadership on Thursday by designating the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, following what turned out to be one of the country’s deadliest crackdowns of protests since its establishment in 1979.
“By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards … the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot and once again made a decision against the interests of their people by blindly obeying the Americans,” Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf told his fellow MPs, all wearing Revolutionary Guards uniforms in support of the elite force.
“According to Article 7 of the law on countermeasures against the designation of the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, the armies of European countries are considered terrorist groups.”







Qalibaf added that the national security parliamentary commission would deliberate on the expulsion of EU countries’ military attaches and follow up on the issue with the foreign ministry.
Set up after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the ruling system, the IRGC have great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces.</p><small>2026-02-01 07:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648337-us-uk-among-other-nations-condemn-balochistan-attacks-as-133-terrorists-killed-in-two-days' target='_blank'><strong>US, UK among other nations condemn Balochistan attacks as 133 terrorists killed in two days</strong></a><br><p>

Addressing a high-level briefing on the Counter-Terrorism Early Warning Network for Central Asia on Friday, Chinese Ambassador to the UN Sun Lei said that while the Central Asia region remained broadly stable, it continued to be affected by cross-border terrorism.
“Currently, the Central Asia region remains generally stable, yet is still deeply affected by the spillover effect of terrorist threats,” he said, citing recent attacks in Syria, Afghanistan and Pakistan that “deserve our high vigilance”.
Emphasising Pakistan’s long-standing concerns, the Chinese envoy called for closer cooperation with Kabul. “We need to strengthen engagement and cooperation with Afghanistan to prevent it from once again becoming a safe haven for terrorist organisations, and to jointly prevent and address the return of foreign terrorist fighters,” he said.

Beijing calls for cooperation with Kabul to stop militants using Afghan soil; Guterres flags TTP threat under Taliban regime

Ambassador Sun also underlined the importance of development in countering extremism. “At the same time, it is imperative to accelerate the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to eliminate the root causes of terrorism,” he said.
UN concerns
A day earlier, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres raised similar concerns at a briefing in New York. He said the UN remained committed to four key objectives in Afghanistan, while voicing frustration over the Taliban’s failure to make progress on inclusivity, human rights and regional security.
“We need to make sure that Afghan institutions are truly inclusive, that all ethnic groups are represented and that all sectors of society are represented,” he said, calling this “a basic condition for the consolidation of peace”.
On women’s rights, the UN chief expressed concern over restrictions limiting women’s ability to work. “[UN Undersecretary General] Rosemary DiCarlo managed to guarantee the possibility for our female staff to work in the field, but not in our headquarters, and we are very frustrated by that.” He described the Taliban’s failure to meet the expectations of the international community as “unacceptable”.
Turning to security, Guterres highlighted the threat posed by groups operating from Afghan soil. “Another aspect is the need to make sure that no terrorist organisations can operate from Afghanistan into other countries. We are particularly concerned about what has happened with the Pakistani Taliban [Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan] and the support they might receive.”

 

He added that the UN had seen meaningful progress on drug trafficking since the Taliban’s return, but lamented the lack of improvement on other fronts. “In relation to the three other aspects, we have frustration, because we do not see our legitimate concerns making the progress that is essential.”
Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in terrorist incidents in recent years, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, with officials linking much of the violence to cross-border infiltration from Afghanistan since the Taliban’s takeover in August 2021.

 

Analysts say the resurgent TTP and allied groups have increased attacks inside Pakistan while allegedly enjoying safe havens across the Afghan border.
Islamabad has consistently urged the international community to press Kabul to prevent its territory from being used by militants targeting Pakistan, arguing that regional and global security remain directly tied to stability in Afghanistan.

“We’ve already made that deal, the concept of the deal,” Trump told reporters while on Air Force One, en route to Florida from Washington, DC.
Trump also said on Saturday that China was also welcome to make a deal with the US to buy Venezuelan oil.
Trump’s comment came a day after the US told Delhi it could soon resume purchases of Venezuelan oil to help replace imports of Russian oil, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
India pledged to slash Russian crude oil purchases after Washington also hiked tariffs related to that activity, and India is on track to lower its Russian oil imports by several hundred thousand barrels per day in the coming months, according to the sources, who declined to be identified.
Trump imposed 25 per cent tariffs on countries buying Venezuelan oil, including India, in March 2025, and his administration ramped up a campaign against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom US forces captured on January 3.

 

Since then, Washington has begun directing the Caracas government and plans to control Venezuela’s oil industry indefinitely.
The US effort to supply Venezuelan crude to India comes as Washington seeks to reduce the oil revenue that is funding Russia in its war in Ukraine.
Last week, Indian Oil Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said India is diversifying its crude sources as its Russian oil imports fall.
Two of the Reuters sources said India is preparing to cut Russian oil imports to below one million barrels per day soon.

 

In January, they were around 1.2 million bpd, and are projected to decline to about 1m bpd in February and 800,000 bpd in March, one of those two sources said.
The second of the two sources said those imports are expected eventually to decline to about 500,000-600,000 bpd, helping the nation clinch a trade deal with the US.
US tariffs on Indian goods reached 50pc in August as Washington added a further 25pc tariff on purchases of Russian oil.
Challenges posed by Western sanctions eventually prompted Indian refiners to increase imports from other sources.</p><small>2026-02-01 05:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/01103650daf0a3b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970338/majority-of-islamabad-buildings-do-not-have-fire-safety-certificates-cda' target='_blank'><strong>Majority of Islamabad buildings do not have fire safety certificates: CDA</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Tuesday revealed majority of buildings in Islamabad have not obtained fire safety certificates.
In the wake of the Karachi Gul Plaza inferno, the CDA recently decided to get survey of buildings of Islamabad to ensure fire and safety system.
“CDA has completed the survey regarding Fire Safety & Hazard Control in the Federal Capital, Islamabad. A total of 6,500 buildings were surveyed in this regard.
During the survey, it was observed that most buildings had not obtained approval for their fire safety plans, and the completion/fire safety certificates for these buildings had also not been issued. During the survey, 300 government buildings were also inspected, read an official handout issued by CDA.
This information was shared in a meeting held here at CDA headquarters with Chairman CDA Mohammad Ali Randhawa in the chair and attended by members administration and planning, DC Islamabad and other officers concerned.
“Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi had taken notice and directed the CDA to conduct a survey of all buildings in Islamabad regarding Fire Safety and Hazard Control at the earliest. In light of the direction all relevant departments, including the Capital Emergency Services and the Building and Housing Control Wing were directed to complete the survey immediately,” the official statement said.

 

The meeting that building owners and occupants would be directed to submit their Fire Safety and Hazard Control Certificates to the relevant offices of CDA’s Building & Housing Control Wing within fifteen days. Otherwise, legal action will be initiated against those not complying with the direction under the CDA Ordinance and the Islamabad Capital Territory Building Control Regulations 2020 (Amended 2023).
“This will entail fines and other enforcement measures. In this context, if an accident occurs in a building due to non-submission of the required certificates, the responsibility will lie with the concerned owners and the building management,” read the statement.
It said that building owners and their management are further requested to immediately ensure the safety status of their buildings and submit the necessary documents on time so that public safety standards can be maintained in the Capital.
The meeting decided that all building owners and occupants will have their buildings inspected on an annual basis and submit certificates regarding fire safety measures in accordance with the Pakistan Engineering Council codes to the CDA. Furthermore, regular fire safety drills will also be arranged in all buildings.

KARACHI: In a surprise visit to a Mega Centre of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) in Defence Housing Authority on Saturday, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi found multiple lapses of serious nature in public service delivery, including a startling case in which a death certificate was issued for a woman who was still alive.
The issue came to light when a citizen approached the interior minister during his visit to the facility with a complaint regarding his wife’s death certificate, who was in fact alive.
A statement issued after the visit said that Mr Naqvi immediately took notice of the “error” and ordered on-the-spot correction of the documentation, directing officials to ensure accountability and prevent such mistakes in the future.
During the visit, the minister interacted with citizens who had come to apply for national identity cards and other official documents. He asked applicants about waiting times and processing procedures with several people complaining of long delays and repeated visits due to inadequate guidance and system inefficiencies, the statement added.
The interior minister acknowledged the concerns and assured citizens that the problem of delays would be addressed on a permanent basis.
“The system is being further improved and the issue of delays will be resolved at the root,” the statement quoted the minister as saying who also instructed Nadra officials to complete citizens’ work within the prescribed timeframe.

 

In another case, a woman reported an incorrect name entry on her identity card. The interior minister directed the Nadra in-charge to rectify the error immediately without charging any additional fee.
He also visited multiple service counters and met staff members, emphasising that applicants should not be forced to make repeated trips.
“Instead of asking people to come back again and again, ensure their work is completed in a single visit wherever possible and provide them full guidance,” Mr Naqvi directed.
Earlier in the day, the interior minister paid a two-hour-long visit to Jinnah International Airport to review immigration operations.
He inspected immigration counters, met outbound passengers and inquired about processing times and facilitation, added the statement.
Mr Naqvi personally checked the travel documents of several passengers traveling to Saudi Arabia and asked Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) officials to verify certain cases.
The interior minister reiterated that no passenger with incomplete or unverified documents would be allowed to travel.
He warned that professional beggars could not be permitted to go abroad under the cover of legitimate travellers, stressing that Pakistan’s dignity must be protected at all costs.
“The genuine travellers and passengers with valid and complete documentation would not be stopped. Raising Pakistan’s stature while ensuring ease for travellers remains our top priority,” he added.

Indeed, the responsibility rests squarely on his shoulders, because, if it weren’t for fear of his supporters converging on the hospital in droves, why would the authorities have kept something secret that would have come out in the open within days?
Even after spending 32 months in prison since his arrest in the Toshakhana case, followed by his conviction, Mr Khan’s popularity has not waned nor has his cutting, effective narrative been blunted. So, the prisoner has made his captors themselves captives of fear. He is wielding influence and power way beyond the confines of his cell.
And I say this when I have never voted for him or his party; and when I liked Imran Khan far more as an iconic cricketer and anti-cancer crusader than as a politician with traits defined by a populist rhetoric and disdain for opinions that differ from his own.

Even a man committed to a fitness programme will show signs of wear and tear after a demanding sporting life.

For example, as far as the media is concerned, Imran Khan’s government did exactly what the incumbents are doing. The media, as this newspaper knows well, was punished for merely reporting on the facts, articulating people’s aspirations and issues and calling out those at the helm for overstepping legal and constitutional boundaries when they did.
His tenure in office with his intel chief (now a court-martialled former three-star) as his enforcer, was a nightmare for media houses as well as media professionals with all kinds of oppression unleashed against journalists as well as their employers for not toeing the line — ie, for coverage that was seen as out of line.
And his disdain for the Constitution and the rule of law was evident from his conduct when, after falling out with his benefactors, he faced the certainty of being ousted in an establishment-backed no-confidence vote. He advised his party man, the president, to dissolve the Assembly. Even a judiciary which was largely seen as sympathetic to him could not digest the move and restored the Assembly and resurrected the no-trust vote.
He blamed a ‘foreign (US) conspiracy’ for his ouster from office in April 2022. His supporters, in the eyes of whom he can do no wrong, lapped it up and his narrative snowballed into a firm belief among millions that he’d been horribly wronged.
When his establishment backers of the time were building him up as a viable choice through the media in the first half of the last decade and many media houses gave him endless airtime, he rode the crest of the popularity wave. But side by side, he built a formidable social media machine.
Now when the shoe is on the other foot and most of the media has fallen in line and remains largely unsympathetic to the PTI cause, the founder remains unaffected as his message and narrative reaches all his supporters through social media and other means.
This is what has led to him being kept incommunicado, with family (consisting mainly of his sisters) ‘visits’, as per the jail manual, and party leaders barred for weeks on end because they are seen as the source through which his messages, often stripped of any niceties, reach his US-based social media team that runs his handle and amplifies the messages.
To be honest, these messages so far have not proved effective in mobilising his support base to pour out into the streets to demand his freedom. But yes, the language used is often so bitter and severe — perhaps, because like many other Pakistanis, he believes he was cheated out of an election win in 2024 — that it probably irks those who wield power today. So by restricting his visitors the conduit for his messages is also blocked.
Whether those moves and countermoves are legitimate is a debate for another time but there can be no question that denying he was taken to hospital for a procedure for nearly a week before admitting the truth shows the hybrid set-up in a very poor light.
Even with a rudimentary knowledge of medical issues, I can say that anything to do with the eye is a very serious issue and needs addressing promptly because it can imperil one’s vision. No matter how hard the state may have now decided to be, this is taking things to ludicrous levels.
The former iconic sports star is super fit no doubt, even at 73. Government ministers say he has been given exercise machines in prison and uses them regularly. But even a man committed to a fitness programme like him will show signs of wear and tear after a demanding sporting life.
He deserves to be looked after well and by physicians of his choice. As far as I know, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust Hospital’s top executives and respected physicians Dr Asim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan have never been the source of any leak of Imran Khan’s political messages when they have seen him in their professional capacity.
One blunder should not lead to a series of blunders. He is a former prime minister, a popular leader, and a national icon. Whatever hurt and offence his messages may cause, that should not be an obstacle to him receiving the best possible treatment by doctors he has faith in and trusts; his personal physicians’ visit ought to be facilitated. No point in waiting for Feb 8 to pass when he has called for mass protests. Every day counts if you don’t want to lose the narratives war.

Interior minister says India behind the attacks; accuses country of providing support to terrorists
ISPR says 92 terrorists killed; 18 civilians, 15 security personnel martyred
ISPR says attacks were orchestrated and directed by terrorist ring leaders operating from outside Pakistan


Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday held India responsible for a spate of attacks in Balochistan, while the military’s media affairs said that 92 terrorists were killed as security forces responded to the onslaught.
Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said, “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.”
He said that authorities would go after every single one of those involved and the “masters behind them”.
“We will expose them in the world — the face with which they meet the world and the face with which they support terrorists,” he said. Naqvi said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and strategising.
For his part, Bugti expressed gratitude to Naqvi for rushing to Quetta.
“We chaired a high-level security meeting and visited the injured at the Combined Military Hospital,” the CM said.
“In terms of the incident itself, information has yet to come but I want to say that the operation is pretty much over,” he said. Bugti also condemned the killing of women and children belonging to a Baloch family hailing from Khuzdar in Gwadar’s labour colony.
He lauded law enforcement and security personnel for their response to the attacks.
“The terrorists’ morale was declining. To raise morale, they executed this attack but the lethality was very low,” the CM said.
“The rebuttal by security forces was superb,” he said. Bugti added that the state’s resolve “could not be weakened”.
ISPR says 92 terrorists killed
The military’s media affairs wing said that terrorists belonging to Indian-sponsored Fitna al Hindustan “attempted to disturb peace of Balochistan” by conducting multiple terrorist activities around Quetta, Mastung, Nushki, Dalbandin, Kharan, Panjgur, Tump, Gwadar and Pasni.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that at the “behest of their foreign masters, these cowardly acts of terrorism were aimed at disrupting the lives of the local populace and the development of Balochistan”.







It said terrorists targeted civilians in Gwadar and Kharan, including women, children, the elderly and labourers, resulting in the deaths of 18 people.
“Security forces and law enforcement agencies, being fully alert, immediately responded and successfully thwarted the evil design of terrorists, displaying unwavering courage and professional excellence,” the statement said.
It said that troops, after an “intense and daring clearance operation”, killed 92 terrorists, including three suicide bombers. The statement said that during this process, 15 personnel embraced martyrdom.
“Sanitisation operations in these areas are being continuously conducted and the instigators, perpetrators, facilitators and abettors of these heinous and cowardly acts, targeting innocent civilians and law enforcement agencies’ personnel, will be brought to justice,” it said.
“Intelligence reports have unequivocally confirmed that the attacks were orchestrated and directed by terrorist ring leaders operating from outside Pakistan, who were in direct communication with the terrorists throughout the incident,” ISPR said.
Noting that 41 terrorists were killed in Panjgur and Harnai on Jan 30, ISPR said the total number of killed militant in “ongoing operations” in Balochistan had reached 133.
‘Desperate move’
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had earlier described the attacks as “a desperate move” by the terrorists while security forces were about to neutralise them.
“This was a desperate move by the terrorists. Our security forces are close to defeating the fighters of Fitna-al-Hindustan and Fitna-al-Khawarij,” he said in an interview with Geo News.
He said the security forces were alert at all locations and were not taken by surprise. “Our security forces, personnel and officers have fought bravely. They were alert at all sites and fully prepared,” he said.
Expressing deep sorrow, he said that terrorists of the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) had killed family members of Baloch labourers hailing from Khuzdar and Gwadar.
He reiterated that the attack was thwarted with full force. Tarar further said that the prime minister was aware of the situation and was in contact.
“The prime minister condemned the attack and reaffirmed that we will not rest until the last terrorist is eliminated from the country,” he said.
“It is the resolve of the state of Pakistan that it will not rest until terrorism is eliminated from the country,” he added.
He continued, “We are fully focused. The terrorists failed due to the unity of the Pakistani nation, and the entire nation stands behind the security forces.”
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that the recent terrorist attacks were “terrorism being run under foreign patronage, whose targets are both Pakistan and the people of Balochistan” and not a struggle for rights.
“These elements neither tolerate development nor peace. That is why they target labourers, travellers, and ordinary citizens, want to destroy development projects and employment opportunities, and conspire against projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor,” he stated in a post on X.







The defence minister added that terrorist groups recruited young people through social media, while receiving funding through “organised criminal networks, a drug-fuelled economy, extortion, and smuggling”.
“The state is resolute. The morale of our law enforcement agencies is high, and we will bring the terrorists, their facilitators, and the foreign handlers to their logical end,” Asif vowed.
Bugti visits Quetta attack site
CM Bugti also visited the site of a bomb blast in Quetta to review the security situation, a statement from the CM House said. Balochistan Inspector General (IG) Muhammad Tahir provided a detailed briefing on the incident to the chief minister, who also met security and police personnel.
“The timely response against terrorist elements is commendable,” Bugti was quoted as saying, hailing the effective actions taken by the police and the CTD.
“Anti-state elements will not be forgiven under any circumstances. There will be no compromise on peace in Balochistan,” the chief minister asserted.

 


Later, Interior Minister Naqvi also arrived in Quetta to engage in high-level discussions on the law and order situation, while CM Bugti vowed that sacrifices by martyrs “would not go in vain”, according to an official statement.
It said that the minister and CM Bugti visited Police Lines to offer funeral prayers for the martyrs and meet their families.
“The people and security forces of Balochistan are brave and courageous,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. “Our soldiers took comprehensive and effective action against terrorists. The sacrifices of martyrs cannot be forgotten, and the nation salutes them.”
CM Bugti was quoted as saying, “The sacrifices of our martyrs will not go in vain. The state has always stood with the oppressed and will continue to do so.”
Earlier in the day, provincial government official Shahid Rind said police and the FC had foiled attempted terrorist attacks at a “few places across Balochistan”.
Rind, the special aide to CM for political and media affairs, noted on X that the attacks came after over 70 terrorists had been killed over the past two days by security forces at different locations across the province.







Naqvi also visited the Corps Headquarters in Quetta. According to Radio Pakistan, Naqvi was briefed about the security situation in Balochistan and the terrorist attacks of Fitna al Hindustan.
CM Bugti was also present for the briefing. The interior minister appreciated the timely and effective action of the security forces, the report said.
He also paid tribute to the personnel and citizens who were martyred in the terrorist attacks. Naqvi said the ongoing war against terrorism would continue till the last terrorist was eliminated, the report said.
Emergency imposed in hospitals
An emergency was imposed in all government hospitals across the province on the directives of Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar and Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman.
Kakar was supervising the provision of medical treatment to those “injured in the Quetta firing”, a statement from the provincial health department said.
The health minister directed Quetta Trauma Centre Managing Director Dr Arbab Kamran and Quetta Civil Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Abdul Hadi Kakar to ensure the “immediate” provision of medical facilities.
According to the statement, the operating theatres of the Quetta Trauma Centre and Civil Hospital have been put on alert, and additional doctors have been deployed.
‘IED, explosives neutralised in Nasirabad’
Separately, police said suspected explosive materials were found on a railway track in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district.
“An anti-tank mine and explosive material were found on the railway line near Rabi Pul,” said a statement by Nasirabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Asadullah Nasir.
“A suspected IED (improvised explosive device) was neutralised as the police, FC and Special Branch took timely action,” it added.
The recovered items included half a kilogramme of explosive material, petrol and an iron rod, according to SSP Nasir. The items were handed over to the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) for further investigation.
Railway tracks are a frequent target of terrorists, with the Jaffar Express coming under attack several times over the past year.
Most recently, on Monday night, a blast on the railway track linking Sindh to Balochistan derailed four bogies of the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express train coming from Peshawar and damaged the track.
The Jaffar Express had also escaped attacks in Nasirabad in October and November last year. Similar attempts also occurred during the two months in Kachhi and Sindh’s Shikarpur district.
Resolve to fight terror till its ‘complete eradication’
President Asif Ali Zardari commended the army and law enforcement agencies’ (LEAs) professional expertise for foiling “infiltration attempts by Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists at multiple locations”.
In a statement, he also paid tribute to the “security personnel and innocent civilians who embraced martyrdom during the actions”, and prayed for their high ranks.
“Our commitment is not to make any compromise on Balochistan’s peace, civilians’ protection, and national unity,” Zardari affirmed.
He asserted that the state will continue its operations against “enemy elements operating under external backing and their facilitators with full force and unity”.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for foiling malicious attempts by Fitna-al-Hindustan to disrupt peace in Balochistan, state-run APP reported.
The premier professional competence and bravery of the security forces for thwarting “coordinated attacks at 12 locations across Quetta, Noshki, Dalbandin, Pasni and Gwadar”.
He noted that 37 terrorists were neutralised during the operations, dealing a “major blow” to militant networks operating in the region.







PM Shehbaz also lauded the personnel for “neutralising 88 leading terrorists, backed by India, in various intelligence-based operations carried out over the past 48 hours, terming it a significant success in the ongoing fight against terrorism”.
He paid homage to the 10 valiant security personnel who embraced martyrdom during the operations, sacrificing their lives while giving precedence to protecting the homeland over their own safety.
“The entire nation, including myself, is proud of its martyrs,” the prime minister said, adding that the officers and personnel of the security forces were performing their duties with exemplary courage and selflessness.
Reaffirming the government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz stated that the war against terrorism would continue until its complete eradication from the country.
Balochistan Planning Minister Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi strongly condemned the “damage to public properties and terrorising citizens by a handful of terrorists”.
“Balochistan will not be held hostage by these perpetrators of violence. With public support, LEAs have foiled terrorist designs,” he said on X.







Buledi further said that Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti “cut short his Islamabad engagements, including a meeting with the World Bank President & returned to Quetta immediately to resume official work at the CM House”.
The British High Commission also condemned the attacks.
“Our thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives and all those affected. We stand with Pakistan in rejecting terrorism and in our shared commitment to peace and security,” it said.







Turkiye’s foreign ministry condemned the spate of “heinous terrorist attacks” in Balochistan, praying for those who lost their lives and for a swift recovery for the injured.
“We will continue to stand by brotherly Pakistan in its fight against all forms of terrorism,” it said in a post on X.







Similarly, Qatar’s foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the attack and reiterating Doha’s firm rejection of “violence, terrorism and criminal acts in all forms, regardless of their motives or justifications“.
“The ministry also expresses the state of Qatar’s sincere condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the government and people of Pakistan, and extends its wishes for a speedy recovery to the injured,” the statement read.







Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denounced the terrorist attacks and reiterated Riyadh’s “complete rejection of all acts of terrorism and extremism” and its solidarity with Pakistan and its efforts to maintain territorial integrity.
“The kingdom expresses its sincere condolences to the families of the deceased and to the government and people of Pakistan, and wishes the injured a speedy recovery,” the ministry said in a statement.







Rise in terrorism
The proscribed BLA has carried out frequent attacks in Balochistan, specifically targeting security forces and LEAs.
In August 2025, the United States also designated the BLA and its Majeed Brigade squad as foreign terrorist organisations.
Earlier this week, CTD said six proclaimed offenders affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed during an operation in Pishin.
On January 5, an IED attack in Panjgur killed one person and injured 16 others.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year-on-year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.

 

As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
In early December, security forces carried out a two-day operation against militants who attacked the brigade headquarters of Frontier Corps in Chagai district’s Nokundi area.
The same day the FC headquarters was targeted as a suicide bomber detonated himself at its main gate, armed terrorists also launched an attack on an FC checkpost in Panjgur district’s Gurmakan area.
On November 24, three personnel were martyred and 12 sustained injuries in a suicide attack on the FC headquarters in Peshawar.</p><small>2026-02-01 04:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/697eb78d60ab4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970359/pakistans-trump-test' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s Trump test</strong></a><br><p>PAKISTAN has emerged as one of the beneficiaries of the evolving regional order reshaped by US President Donald Trump’s policies, particularly in the West and South Asian context. However, it remains to be seen how far the country can maintain its relevance, and whether it will make deliberate strategic moves or continue drifting with the Trumpian wave.
After the initial shocks, the world appears ready to respond to the new challenges created by President Trump. A key question revolves around the post-Trump scenario and how the US will behave. Will it continue the Trump approach regardless of who wins, or will it review or reverse Trump-era policies?
European nations may seek to renegotiate their economic, political, and strategic terms with the US. Canada, India, and Japan are likely to proceed with greater caution, while China may focus on protecting and consolidating the gains it has been accruing under Trump’s policies.
In this evolving situation, where will Pakistan stand? Will the country return to the pre-Trump status, when its diplomacy was under strain, and it struggled to safeguard its geostrategic and geo-economic interests?

It is a dual balancing act that reflects Pakistan’s persistent dilemma.

The recently announced EU-India free trade framework and the generally expanding European economic cooperation with India signals a broader recalibration of Europe’s engagement with Asia. China, too, appears to be a relatively reliable economic partner, even though there are certain political economy caveats that are no secret. In terms of trade, Pakistan cannot be compared with its big neighbours China and India. Even with its position as a medium-scale state, trade is constrained by a limited ability to meet international expectations as they evolve.
There is an effort on Islamabad’s part to align itself with China’s strategic and economic priorities, while also trying to remain relevant where Washington is concerned — particularly in a regional environment where India has a clear diplomatic and economic edge. It is a dual balancing act that reflects Pakistan’s persistent dilemma: managing its strategic dependence on Beijing while trying to avoid diplomatic marginalisation in the US.
But it is also true that Islamabad has gained significant diplomatic capital following President Trump’s public acknowledgment of its role in the war on terrorism, as seen in his address to Congress and then later by engaging with the Pakistani leadership — a momentum, reinforced by Pakistan’s participation in the Board of Peace, that was directed at expanding defence collaboration with West Asian and African states.
The estimated value of these defence-related engagements runs into several billion dollars over multiple years. However, the long-term sustainability of these engagements will be contingent on stability in the region and political alignment.
A new strategic equation has since taken shape, which sees Pakistan as a key defence ally along with Saudi Arabia and Turkiye, with partner states extended to include Azerbaijan, Egypt, and Sudan. Even a fractured Libya has featured in this outreach that continues to expand, as underscored by recent high-level military engagements. Together, these developments suggest that Pakistan’s external posture is changing — going from reactive diplomacy towards selective strategic alignment. But whether or not this transition can translate into durable geopolitical leverage remains open to debate.
A complication that is arising in all this is that this situation appears to have President Trump’s approval, which creates the impression that Pakistan is a key US ally in West Asia, particularly where the Gaza peace plan and escalating tensions with Iran are concerned.
Although Israel is neither a formal nor informal partner in the Saudi, Turkish, and Pakistan defence framework, their strategic interests do not necessarily collide. In fact, this aspect is the most delicate one of the arrangement. Pakistan has consciously not signalled any such alignment, constrained as it is by domestic considerations and its position on Iran. With regard to the latter, Pakistan does not support military aggression but also cannot serve as the kind of functional partner the Iranian regime would require during a crisis.
Internally, Pakistan’s establishment has largely closed the potential fault lines from which resistance to its West Asia policy might have emerged, managing religiously inspired actors with considerable skill. However, internal resistance persists in other forms, which may pose challenges for Pakistan, though its consequences are likely to remain primarily domestic and political, rather than become international.
India, by contrast, despite facing difficulties with the US over tariff disputes, unresolved negotiations, and embarrassment caused by Trump’s repeated claims regarding mediation and ceasefire in last year’s stand-off with Pakistan, has managed a strategic rebound. New Delhi has adopted an alternative engagement strategy, which is aimed at countries unsettled by Trump’s tariff, geopolitical and hegemonic policies. Crucially, India’s expanded outreach has come without major compromises: its engagement with the EU has not weakened its ties with Russia, nor has it closed the door to economic cooperation with China.
Pakistan, as a medium-scale state burdened by a weak economy, deteriorating internal security indicators, and chronic political instability, has limited strategic choices. By aligning itself closely with a Trump-endorsed defence equation, it has risked the balance in its relationship with China. This presents what may become Pakistan’s most critical challenge after Trump exits. The post-Trump phase will test Pakistan’s diplomacy and political leadership, particularly its ability to restore trust with Beijing to the level seen around 2018, unless it adopts a more calibrated balancing approach in managing ties with the US.
For now, Pakistan may continue to benefit from short-term diplomatic visibility. However, without cultivating alternative strategic options, its policy space will become narrower, eventually leaving Islamabad with little choice but to align more closely with US- and Saudi-led geopolitical frameworks in West Asia, particularly on sensitive issues such as future engagement with Israel and its position on Iran.
This shift could occur even earlier, depending on President Trump’s moves against Iran and the trajectory his Board of Peace initiative takes. To navigate such scenarios, Pakistan may need a multifaceted plan that could include a new neighbourhood policy aimed at reducing regional tensions and safeguarding long-term geo-economic interests.

Published in Dawn, February 1st, 2026</p><small>2026-02-01 04:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/0108472427d927c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970355/balochistan-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan attacks</strong></a><br><p>THE seemingly coordinated terrorist attacks across Balochistan on Saturday reinforce the fact that the state must confront the menace of terrorist violence in the province firmly.
As per security sources and official media, terrorists belonging to Fitna al-Hindustan, the term the state uses for Baloch separatists, struck at least 12 cities and towns in the province, including Quetta. A large number of terrorists were killed by the security forces. Security men and civilians have also been martyred in the attacks.
The sophistication of the strikes indicates that the militants had received training, and backs the state’s suspicions that hostile actors in the region are stirring up trouble in Balochistan. Yet it is also a matter of concern that the terrorists were able to hit such a large number of towns, including the provincial capital, which is supposed to be well-protected. The seriousness of the situation can be gauged from the federal interior minister’s dash to Balochistan to take stock of the situation. Were it not for the sacrifices of the police and security forces, the terrorists could have succeeded in causing greater havoc.
Unfortunately, this pattern of violence in Balochistan is not new. Last year’s assault targeting the Jaffar Express, as well as a similar coordinated terror campaign in August 2024, shows that despite the state’s counterterrorism efforts, the problem of militancy remains unresolved in this troubled province.
As per one think tank, there were over 250 terrorist attacks in Balochistan last year, causing over 400 fatalities. Along with KP, the province is the hardest hit by terrorist violence in the country. This atmosphere of violence and uncertainty exacerbates the socioeconomic woes of Balochistan, and slows development.
While the immediate focus should be on sanitisation operations so that all affected areas are declared safe, the administration must think long term in order to bring lasting peace to Balochistan. Firstly, no ideology can justify the murder of innocent people — women and children were also reportedly martyred in Saturday’s attacks — therefore, the state must neutralise all those violent actors responsible for these atrocities.
In the past, Baloch terrorists have also indulged in brutal slayings of ‘non-locals.’ Moreover, the links of the terrorist groups with hostile foreign actors need to be broken, and greater vigilance is needed at the country’s borders to prevent terrorists from entering the country. But while the kinetic element is essential, long-term peace can only come about through a full and unhindered political process in the province. Those estranged elements that renounce violence and pledge to respect the Constitution should be engaged by the rulers. Also, until Balochistan’s natural wealth reaches its people, and alleviates their poverty and suffering, hostile actors will continue to exploit the situation.

GILGIT: Adventure tourism in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) has declined over the past three years, with no foreign climber or trekker visiting the region during the winter season. The arrival of climbers, trekkers, and both foreign and domestic tourists during the summer season also fell by 90 per cent last year, severely affecting the local economy.
Tour operators blamed the sharp increase in permit fees, delays in the issuance of visas to foreigners, and other factors for the decline in foreign visitors. According to the GB tourism department, no foreign climber or trekker visited GB this winter. No foreign expedition or trekking group was issued a permit during the winter expedition season, which usually lasts from November to February.
Five of the world’s 14 eight-thousanders — mountains rising above 8,000 metres above sea level — are located in Pakistan. These include the world’s second-highest peak, K2 (8,611m), followed by Nanga Parbat (ninth at 8,126m), Gasherbrum-I (11th at 8,080m), Broad Peak (12th at 8,051m) and Gasherbrum-II (13th at 8,035m).

 

Until 2023, hundreds of foreign climbers and trekkers used to visit the region each winter to attempt ascents of K2, Nanga Parbat and other peaks. However, data obtained from the GB tourism department shows that not a single foreign climber or trekker has visited the region during the winter season since 2023.
Director of the GB tourism department Iqbal Hussain said multiple factors had contributed to the decline in winter tourism. He said international conflicts and global uncertainty had led to a reduction in the number of foreign climbers and trekkers visiting Pakistan.
Meanwhile, arrivals of both foreign and domestic tourists during the summer season also declined last year, badly affecting the local economy. Liver Khan, a prominent tour operator and a member of the Pakistan Association of Tour Operators (PATO), told Dawn that government’s anti-tourism policies had contributed to the decline in both foreign and domestic tourism in GB.
He said around 90 per cent of the local population — including labourers, transporters, hotel and shop owners, travel agents, tour operators and porters in remote areas — depended on tourism as a source of income. He added that the sharp increase in permit fees for mountaineering and trekking, coupled with difficulties in obtaining visas, had discouraged foreign visitors.
Mr Khan said foreign tourists usually plan their trips to Pakistan at least three years in advance, based on their budgets. He explained that Pakistan issues three types of visas to foreign tourists: tourist, mountaineering and trekking visas. Mountaineering and trekking visas are issued only after permits are obtained through Pakistani tour operators. Delays in issuing these permits, he said, often result in visa delays and ultimately lead to the cancellation of trips.
Mr Khan said PATO had demanded that the government introduce a single visa category for foreign tourists and simplify the process for mountaineering and trekking visas. He said the increasing permit fees had forced foreign climbers and trekkers to cancel their trips to Pakistan and opt for Nepal or other countries, where permits are cheaper. Nepal, he noted, had reduced permit fees for more than 50 peaks.
Another tour operator, Mohammad Ali Nagri, told Dawn that the increase in permit fees for foreigners had virtually crippled adventure tourism in GB.
According to the GB tourism department, only 270 international climbers visited the region during the summer season last year to attempt peaks including K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II and Nanga Parbat, compared to more than 2,000 foreign climbers and trekkers in previous years.
Officials attributed the downturn to unprecedented climate-related disasters in GB, as well as regional tensions and conflicts involving Pakistan and India.

It warned parties with incomplete registration that they would neither enjoy statutory privileges nor be allowed to contest polls on an allocated electoral symbol.
The clarification follows an AJK High Court judgement dated Oct 5, 2023, which set aside the registration of the AJK chapters of the PPP, PML-N and PTI and other parties on the grounds that the registration process did not conform to the requirements of the law and the Constitution of the region.
In its judgement, the court observed that the Elections Act and Rules prescribed mandatory conditions for party registration, including submission of a party constitution, manifesto, audited consolidated accounts, lists of members with proof of identity, and evidence of intra-party elections. The bench further noted that despite failure to fulfil several of these conditions, the parties had been granted provisional and later regular registration, rendering the process unlawful.
Following the judgement, the EC issued notices to all political parties, directing them to remove deficiencies identified by the court and resubmit complete documentation.
In the aftermath of the ruling, mass defections of lawmakers elected on PTI tickets in 2021 to the PPP and the PML-N were overlooked by the relevant authorities.
“In pursuance of the High Court’s judgement, all political parties that do not presently fall within the definition of registered political parties are hereby informed that unless and until they complete all requisite documentation in accordance with the applicable rules, they shall neither be entitled to any privileges of a registered political party nor be eligible to contest any forthcoming election on a specific electoral symbol,” the EC said on Saturday.
“Accordingly, the heads of all political parties whose registration is currently under process are advised to urgently submit the required documents in line with the intent of the AJK Elections Act, 2020, the Elections Rules, 2020, and the High Court’s judgement, so that the registration process may be finalised.”
An official at the Election Commission told Dawn that registration had been granted to five parties between July and October 2024 after fulfilment of legal requirements.
The parties registered so far included the PML-N and the PPP, along with three relatively lesser-known organisations — Jamaat-i-Falah-i-Insaniyat, Markazi Jamiat Ahle Hadith and Sada-i-Haq Party — none of which has had parliamentary representation in the past.

“The tolerance and forbearance of judges must not be so fragile or touchy as to make them easily annoyed during the hearing of a case, which is a sacred duty and trust,” observed Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar in his opinion rendered on the long-pending presidential reference seeking an answer to whether the court could revisit the 1979 judgement that sent former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to the gallows — a verdict that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and jurists regard as a historic wrong.
On March 6, 2024, after a delay of over 44 years, the SC finally corrected a historic wrong by accepting that the murder trial of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was unfair and lacked due process, both at the trial stage and in the endorsement of the verdict by the appellate court.
In his delayed opinion, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, who was a member of the SC bench that heard the reference, emphasised that if a judge becomes annoyed with a litigant or their advocate in an unruly manner and loses patience, control or peace of mind, it becomes difficult to impart justice in accordance with the law.

In his opinion on Bhutto reference, judge observes admission by late Justice Shah leaves no doubt about ‘judicial murder’

He said judges should therefore remain calm, be good listeners and, instead of arguing themselves, which is the core function of lawyers, must allow counsel the opportunity to present their cases and arguments.
Justice Mazhar observed that in almost all cases where appeals are filed against the confirmation of the death penalty, no advocate directly seeks conversion of the sentence to life imprisonment. Instead, they strive for a fair acquittal for their client, which is the professional duty of every lawyer.
Simultaneously, the appellate court, with its sense of right and wrong, always has inherent jurisdiction to affirm, set aside or modify sentences. However, despite established bias and grave violations of natural justice and due process in the trial and conviction of Mr Bhutto, the punishment in this case was maintained.
The matter did not end there, the appellate court also missed the opportunity and failed to consider mitigating circumstances, despite overwhelming material on record that could have justified an acquittal or, at the very least, conversion of the death penalty to life imprisonment. This omission, Justice Mazhar said, was tragic, atrocious and reprehensible.
Referring to the delayed opinion, Justice Mazhar observed that although the SC rendered its opinion almost 13 years later, it could still be said that it was better late than never. “In my view, there is no plausible justification for the delay in deciding the presidential reference,” he regretted, adding that he was at a loss to understand why the reference was kept in cold storage and why the hearing was not commenced immediately after the questions were framed by the SC.
Referring to interviews of late Justice Nasim Hasan Shah at a belated stage, Justice Mazhar recalled how the former chief justice had admitted, in print and electronic media, that the decision on Mr Bhutto’s appeal was made under coercion.
This admission, he observed, left no doubt in the mind of a sane and prudent person that it was a “judicial murder”, and such an admission constituted a violation of his oath.
The disclosures made in those interviews, though belated, not only blew the whistle on the biases involved but also pierced the veil of the entire trial and conviction, exposing blatant violations of fair trial principles with the complicity of the judges who conducted the proceedings.
Justice Mazhar noted that the SC unanimously identified various lapses and biases and ultimately concluded that the trial conducted by the Lahore High Court and the subsequent appeal before the SC failed to meet the constitutional requirements of a fair trial and due process, as enshrined in Articles 4 and 9, and later guaranteed as a separate and independent fundamental right under Article 10A of the Constitution.

WASHINGTON: A fresh cache of files released on Friday related to the investigation into the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein contains documents that refer to numerous high-profile figures.
President Donald Trump, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and SpaceX founder Elon Musk are among some of the people named in the documents.

 

The disclosure offers a sprawling look into the elite circles Epstein inhabited before his death, implicating prominent figures in politics, business and entertainment.
The documents were published following a deadline mandated by a bipartisan congressional law requiring the public release of all files related to Epstein.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced release marked the conclusion of the Trump administration’s planned disclosures. The batch includes 3 million pages of documents, 2,000 videos and 180,000 images, Blanche said at a press conference.
Among the names surfacing in the files is Kevin Warsh, whom Trump nominated on Friday to serve as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Warsh’s name appeared in an email from a publicist to Epstein detailing a guest list of 43 people, including Martha Stewart, for a Christmas gathering.
Lutnick under scrutiny
According to the documents, Lutnick and Epstein scheduled a lunch meeting for Dec 23, 2012, on Little Saint James, Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean.
The following day, Epstein’s assistant sent a note to Lutnick on behalf of the financier, which read in part, “Nice seeing you”.
Records also show that in November 2015, Epstein’s assistant forwarded an invitation from Lutnick for a fundraiser supporting Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at Lutnick’s financial firm.
These exchanges stand in contrast to Lutnick’s comments during a podcast appearance last year.
Lutnick stated that he had been neighbours with Epstein around 2005 and was invited to tour the financier’s townhome. He claimed that after Epstein made a sexually suggestive comment about a massage table, he vowed to “never be in a room” with him again.
A spokesperson for the Commerce Department addressed the discrepancy in a statement.
“Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing,” the spokesperson said.
Musk inquires about parties
The documents detail a separate exchange between Epstein and Musk on Christmas Day in 2012.
“The invitation is much appreciated, but a peaceful island experience is the opposite of what I’m looking for,” Musk wrote, declining an offer to visit Little Saint James.
Musk added that he had been “working to the edge of sanity” and asked Epstein if he had “any parties planned.”
Epstein replied that he understood Musk’s refusal, noting cryptically that “the ratio on my island” might make a female companion of Musk’s uncomfortable, though he did not elaborate.
Days later, Musk invited Epstein to join a group for drinks in St. Barts, though it is unclear if the meeting occurred.
Trump, Melania
The files include hundreds of documents mentioning President Trump, primarily consisting of compiled media reports. However, the release also details what appear to be internal emails from federal investigators dated August 2025.
These messages, which examined accusations involving the president, indicate that investigators found no substantiation for the claims and deemed several accusers “not credible”.

 

The Justice Department noted in a press release that the files contained “untrue and sensationalist claims” regarding the president.
One redacted message from 2012 queries, “What does JE think of going to Mar-a-Lago after xmas instead of his island?” This corresponds to a period years after Trump said he stopped socialising with Epstein.
Additionally, a 2002 email from Melania Trump to Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s convicted co-conspirator, references a profile in New York Magazine.
“Nice story about JE in NY mag. You look great on the picture,” the email reads. “Give me a call when you are back in NY.”
Bill Gates
In a draft email among the documents, Epstein alleged Gates had engaged in extramarital affairs.
Epstein wrote in the email that his relationship with Gates had ranged from “helping Bill to get drugs, in order to deal with consequences of sex with Russian girls, to facilitating his illicit trysts, with married women.”
The Gates Foundation, in a statement to The New York Times, denied the allegations of affairs.
The release has drawn immediate scrutiny from Democrats, who questioned whether the administration withheld relevant material. While the Justice Department identified 6 million pages of potentially responsive documents, only 3.5 million were released.

GAZA CITY: Israeli air strikes killed 32 people including children in Gaza on Saturday, according to the Palestinian territory’s civil defence agency.
Despite a US-brokered truce entering its second phase earlier this month, violence in the Palestinian territory has continued, with both Israel and Hamas accusing each other of violating the agreement.
The latest bloodshed comes after Israel announced it would reopen the crucial Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt on Sunday (today) for the “limited movement of people”.
“The death toll since dawn today has risen to 32, most of them children and women,” said the civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under the Hamas authority, updating an earlier toll of 28.
“Residential apartments, tents, shelters and a police station were targeted, resulting in this humanitarian catastrophe,” agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said in the statement.
A unit in an apartment building of Gaza City’s Rimal neighbourhood was left entirely destroyed, and blood spatters from its occupants were visible on the street below, an AFP journalist reported.
“Three girls died while they were sleeping. We found their bodies in the street”, Samer al-Atbash, a relative of the family, told AFP.
“What truce are you talking about? Everyone is deceiving everyone else,” added Nael al-Atbash, another relative.
One strike hit the police station in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City, the territory’s largest urban centre.
Gaza’s general police directorate said seven people were killed in that attack, while Bassal said the dead included four women police officers. “The killed included police officers and personnel as well as civilians who were present at the station at the time,” the directorate said.
Ceasefire violations
About a dozen first responders rushed to the devastated building and pulled bodies from the rubble, according to an AFP journalist.
Another Israeli attack hit a shelter in Al-Mawasi, an area of south Gaza where tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians live in tents and makeshift shelters, an AFP journalist reported.
Large plumes of smoke rose above the thousands of densely pitched tents.
The number of casualties from this strike was still not known.
Although people have been killed almost daily in Gaza since the start of the ceasefire on Oct 10, Saturday’s toll was particularly high.
Israel’s military said that the air strikes were retaliation for an incident on Friday in which eight Palestinian fighters exited a tunnel in the city of Rafah, in southern Gaza, which it said violated the fragile ceasefire.
It claimed that it targeted commanders and sites belonging to Hamas and its ally, Islamic Jihad.
Hamas in a statement condemned Saturday’s strikes as “a brutal crime”.
The health ministry, which operates under the Hamas authority, has said Israeli attacks have killed at least 509 people in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect.
Rafah reopening
Media restrictions and limited access in Gaza left journalists unable to independently verify casualty figures or freely cover the violence.
Egypt, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, condemned Israel’s “repeated violations” of the truce and demanded all parties “exercise the utmost restraint” ahead of Sunday’s reopening of Rafah crossing. Israel has said reopening of the Rafah crossing will only allow the “limited movement of people”.
The reopening is a key element in the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.

Dawn has obtained a copy of a letter the UN chief sent this week to all permanent representatives to the United Nations, in which he cautions that unless member states either pay their assessed contributions in full and on time or agree to fundamentally overhaul the UN’s financial rules, the organisation may soon be unable to function.
In the unusually stark message, dated Jan 28, the secretary general said the UN’s current financial trajectory is “untenable”, leaving the organisation “exposed to structural risk and forcing a stark choice” between reform and collapse”.
He noted that while the UN has weathered periods of unpaid contributions in the past, the present situation “is categorically different” because decisions not to honour assessed contributions have now been formally announced.
Mr Guterres highlighted what he called a “Kafkaesque” paradox at the heart of the UN’s financial system: under existing rules, the organisation is required to return unspent budget credits to member states even when those funds were never collected due to non-payment of dues. “In other words,” he wrote, “we are trapped in a Kafkaesque cycle; expected to give back cash that does not exist.”
According to the letter, the UN ended 2025 with a record $1.568 billion in outstanding dues — more than double the previous year — while collections covered only 76.7 per cent of assessed contributions.
Despite spending reductions, liquidity reserves were nearly exhausted, sharply increasing the risk of cash shortages.

QUETTA: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday held India responsible for a spate of attacks in Balochistan, stressing that authorities would go after every single one of those involved, while an opposition leader warned that the situation in the region had spiralled “completely out of control”.
Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said: “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.
“We will expose them in the world — the face with which they meet the world and the face with which they support terrorists.”
Mr Naqvi said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and devising strategies.
CM Bugti expressed gratitude to Mr Naqvi for rushing to Quetta. “We chaired a high-level security meeting and visited the injured at the Combined Military Hospital,” he said.
“In terms of the incident itself, information has yet to come, but I want to say that the operation is pretty much over,” he said. He lauded law enforcement and security personnel for their response to the attacks.
Earlier, the interior minister and CM Bugti attended funeral prayers for the martyred personnel and visited Police Lines to meet the bereaved families in Quetta.
They reaffirmed that the resolve of the people and the state against terrorism remained unshakable.
“The people and security forces of Balochistan are brave and courageous,” an official statement quoted Mr Naqvi as saying. “Our soldiers took comprehensive and effective action against terrorists. The sacrifices of martyrs cannot be forgotten, and the nation salutes them.”
Addressing the families, CM Bugti vowed that “every drop of the martyrs’ blood would be avenged” and urged them to remain steadfast and patient. He emphasised that the people of Balochistan owed a debt to their sacrifice.
Situation ‘out of control’
Sardar Akhtar Mengal, president of his faction of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-M) and a former chief minister, offered a sharp contrast to the government’s assurances.
“I have never seen such a dangerous situation in my entire life,” Mr Mengal said in a statement posted on the social media platform X.
Mr Mengal, a member of the National Assembly, stated with “full conviction” that no tribal chief could enter his own area without fear of militant attacks.
He called this a reality that should deeply alarm everyone, stressing that the security situation was “completely out of control”.
He added: “We take no pleasure in seeing our land burn.”
The BNP-M chief attributed the crisis to “hatred, oppression and the misuse of power” that, he said, had continued over the past three years. He argued that instead of heeding warnings, the government had funded propaganda against those trying to resolve the province’s issues.
“If the government were to stop funding private media channels to propagate against him and others genuinely striving to address Balochistan’s issues, it could help foster at least a modest sense of security,” he said.
“Everyone knew this day would come, but no one chose to listen,” Mr Mengal said, criticising federal institutions for “blindly” repeating the narrative that no problem existed.

ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned separate sessions of both houses of parliament on February 2, which are likely take up an amendment related to the National Accountability Ordinance to allow the incumbent NAB chief to remain in office beyond his term set to expire in the first week of March, said sources.
The agenda of these sessions has not been shared but insiders said the NAB amendment would be the sessions’ highlight to pave the way for the incumbent NAB chairman to remain at the helm until the appointment of his successor. Retired Lt Gen Nazir Ahmad became the NAB chairman on March 4, 2023, for three years after his predecessor Aftab Sultan resigned citing “interference” and “pressure” as the reasons for his departure. The opposition PTI had claimed Mr Sultan was being coerced to file corruption references against its chief Imran Khan.
As per the law, the NAB chief is appointed through consultations between the prime minister and the opposition leader, which is supposed to start two months before the expiry of the term and be completed within 45 days. This means the process should have been started in the first week of January, but it never did.
If there is no consensus, the names proposed by the PM and the opposition leader are to be forwarded to the parliamentary committee for the final decision. “Provided that the leader of the house and leader of the opposition shall propose two names each for consideration of the parliamentary committee,” a proviso to the law reads.
“The parliamentary committee under clause (ii) shall be constituted by the speaker, National Assembly, comprising fifty percent members from the treasury benches and fifty percent from the opposition benches, based on their strength in Majlis e Shoora (parliament), to be nominated by the respective parliamentary leaders,” the law reads.
The committee is required to recommend the name of the chairman no later than thirty days. “The total strength of the parliamentary committee shall be twelve members out of which one third shall be from the Senate. If the National Assembly stands dissolved at the material time, all the members of the committee shall be from the Senate,” the law says.
“The chairman shall, on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the federal government, hold office for a non-extendable term of three years and shall not be eligible for subsequent appointment as chairman and shall not be removed from office except on the grounds and in the manner as provided in Article 209 of the Constitution,” the law reads.
According to a source, the upcoming sessions will, however, likely amend this law on the pattern of a provision in the 26th Amendment that allowed the chief election commissioner and two ECP members to continue even after the expiry of their term, while keeping the appointment process on hold.Sources said both houses will also adopt resolutions in connection with Kashmir solidarity day, observed every year on February 5.
Meanwhile, the opposition is also likely to raise the issues of delay in the commencement of the process for the appointment of a new chief election commissioner and two ECP members who continue to hold offices over a year after the expiry of their original term. Moreover, matters related to the health of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan will also come up during the proceedings.

Throughout history, accounts of Bibles, Qurans or Buddhist sutras emerging unscathed from catastrophic floods and fires have been celebrated as Divine interventions. While these events offer profound spiritual solace, a closer look reveals a fascinating intersection of material physics and psychological bias.
From a physical standpoint, Dougal Drysdale, Professor Emeritus at the University of Edinburgh, suggests that a hardbound book’s survival is often due to the ‘Closed Book Effect.’ When shut, a book functions as a dense, oxygen-starved block of cellulose. Because fire requires a steady flow of oxygen to consume fuel, the tightly packed pages resist ignition by preventing airflow from reaching the interior.
In the event of a flood, the surface tension of water against tightly pressed pages creates a natural barrier. This prevents deep seepage for a significant period, often leaving the heart of the book perfectly dry.
American psychologist Thomas Gilovich explains that when a sacred text survives a disaster, it often becomes more than just a book. It is elevated to a sacred relic. This transformation, according to Gilovich, can significantly redefine a community’s cultural path. In the aftermath of the 2011 Joplin tornado in Missouri, US, survivors and news outlets frequently highlighted the ‘miraculous’ discovery of intact Bibles among the rubble of flattened homes.

The survival of holy texts in the aftermath of natural catastrophes is often termed ‘Divine protection’, revealing the cultural and spiritual narratives people love to attach to such instances

While hardbound dictionaries and cookbooks likely survived in the same ruins due to their similar physical construction, these secular items were ignored by the media as mere debris. The surviving Bibles were immediately elevated from functional reading material to sacred relics, often being framed and displayed as symbols of Divine protection.
By focusing on these specific books, the media triggered a cognitive bias that led people to view the event through a supernatural lens rather than recognising the simple physical durability of bound paper.
British scholar Susan Whitfield, in her 2004 work The Silk Road: Trade, Travel, War and Faith, details the discovery of the Mogao Caves in China. In that instance, the sealing of the Buddhist text the Diamond Sutra (868 CE) within a dry, walled-up chamber created a “natural vault” that protected the world’s oldest-dated printed book from the degrading effects of humidity and oxygen for nearly a millennium. The perception of such objects often shifts from the literary to the ‘miraculous’.
During World War I, pocket Bibles carried by soldiers occasionally stopped shrapnel due to the high density of their compressed paper. This led many soldiers to treat the Bibles as protective talismans.
The Codex Amiatinus, frequently referred to as the ‘Grandfather’ of Latin Bibles, has survived for over 1,300 years due to its immense physical durability. According to Drysdale, this enormous volume, created around 700 CE in Northumbria, England, weighs over 34 kilogrammes and was crafted from the skins of more than 500 calves.
The use of high-quality parchment makes the Bible significantly more resistant to fire and decay, as organic animal skins lack the highly flammable, oxygen-trapping fibres found in wood-pulp paper. This Bible remained virtually untouched for a millennium, preserved by the stable environment of an Italian abbey that served as a ‘natural vault.’
In West Africa, the Desert Manuscripts of Timbuktu offer a compelling example of texts surviving environmental factors, a story often framed as miraculous. When Islamist militants set fire to the Ahmed Baba Institute in 2013, there was widespread global concern over the potential loss of thousands of ancient Islamic manuscripts. However, according to the researcher Mauro Nobili, the extreme aridity of the Sahara desert was critical in aiding their preservation for centuries.
The persistently low humidity prevented mould growth and kept the delicate ink stable, allowing for their long-term survival, which many viewed as a modern miracle. However, the more vulnerable manuscripts were secretly shifted to safer locations before the militants set fire to the Ahmed Baba Institute.



 
During the Viking raid on Lindisfarne — a tidal island off the northeast coast of England — in 793 CE, a legend emerged concerning a sacred book, Lindisfarne Gospels, which was said to have been dropped into the sea by fleeing priests. Three days later, it washed up perfectly dry. While this specific account is often considered apocryphal, the physical survival of such ancient texts is frequently due to their durable leather and metal bindings, which act as a protective shell for the internal vellum.
Gilovich would point to stories such as this ‘dry’ recovery of a Bible as prime examples of how the media and oral tradition prioritise miraculous narratives over the mundane reality of material science, thereby reinforcing spiritual beliefs.
According to the prominent professor of psychological sciences J. Park, communities frequently transform these survival stories into powerful symbols of “Divine protection” as a means of processing the profound trauma of disasters. This phenomenon ultimately highlights a dynamic intersection, where material science meets deep human sentiment.
While the inherent fire-resistant properties of vellum offer logical, scientific explanations for the physical survival of many books, the human psychological element remains paramount. The inherent human need to find order, meaning and hope within chaos is what elevates these surviving sacred objects from mere material items to vital spiritual anchors for a community’s recovery and continuity.
The endurance of these texts represents a profound intersection between material science and human psychology. It is not merely the density of vellum, the chemical stability of ancient inks or the aridity of a desert that ensures survival. Rather, it is the way these physical realities interact with our inherent drive to find order in the wake of destruction.
Gilovich’s research posits that when a community witnesses the survival of a sacred text, they are not simply observing a quirk of physics. They are engaging in what Park describes as “meaning-making”, using the survived sacred object to process trauma and reclaim a sense of ‘Divine protection.’ Whether through the preservation of the Diamond Sutra in caves, or a Bible or a Quran found amidst the ruins of a modern disaster, these serve as a bridge between the tangible and the transcendent. Their survival is a testament to the fact that, while fire and time may consume the material, the cultural and spiritual narratives we attach to them remain indestructible.
Yet, it is equally important that we recognise the physical realities of their endurance, acknowledging that the science of material durability does not diminish the ‘miracle’, but rather provides a rational foundation for understanding how the written word survives the very elements meant to destroy it.

Pakistan need to beat India by a big margin to pip their rivals to a semi-final spot from Group 2 with table-toppers England having already sealed their berth. They head into the match having won the last match between the two sides in the Under-19 Asia Cup final in December.
India enter the clash unbeaten in the tournament, having swept past Bangladesh and New Zealand in the group stage before easing past Zimbabwe in the Super Six. With three wins and a commanding net run rate of +3.337, five-time champions India sit second the group with six points.
Pakistan are third, two points behind. They lost to England but beat Zimbabwe in the group stage before securing an eight-wicket victory over New Zealand in the Super Six. Their net run rate might be +1.484 but Farhan is unfazed by the task at hand.
“The morale of the squad is very high,” Farhan said. 
“Not only for this match, but over the last few games as well, the players have shown great intensity and we are confident of putting in a strong performance.”
Opener Sameer Minhas, whose whirlwind knock in the Asia Cup final made the difference, echoed similar views.
“The environment in the squad is very positive,” he said. “The team has been performing well in recent matches and we are looking to carry the momentum forward and take confidence into the next game.”
The only action at the tournament on Saturday was a dead rubber Group 2 match between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in Harare which the former won by 74 runs.
Bangladesh rode on Azizul Hakim Tamim’s anchoring knock of 59 to post 253-9 before pacer Iqbal Hossain’s 5-24 saw them skittle out the hosts for 179.

The announcement by the Petroleum Division said the new prices had been set on the recommendations of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
The price of HSD for the next fortnight, up to Feb 15, has been fixed at Rs268.38 per litre, compared to Rs257.08 during the previous 15 days.
The increase has been made due “to higher crude oil prices over the past week amid regional tensions and an order by the US president to deploy a US Navy strike group to the Persian Gulf”.
This development alone pushed up HSD prices in Arab and other international markets.
As HSD is a key fuel for the industrial and business sectors and is widely used by trucks, buses and large generators, a strong reaction from the business community is expected over the Rs11.30 per litre increase.
The price of petrol, consumed mainly by cars, mot­orcycles and small generators, has been kept unc­h­anged at Rs253.17 per litre.
Due to the rise in HSD prices, jet fuel rates have also been increased slightly for the next fortnight.
Meanwhile, despite the politically tense global environment, the US Energy Information Administration has forecast Brent crude prices to average lower in 2026 and 2027, driven by global production exceeding demand.
International analysts have predicted that global production of liquid fuels will increase by 1.4 million barrels per day in 2026 due to higher production.
LPG
Ogra has also notified new prices of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for the month of February, showing an increase due to higher winter demand in global markets.
The LPG consumer price has been increased by Rs6.37 per kg to Rs226.05 per kg for February, compared to Rs219.67 in January.
The LPG producer price is linked to the Saudi Aramco contract price and the dollar exchange rate.
Compared to the previous month, the Saudi Aramco contract price has increased by 3.83 per cent, while the average dollar exchange rate has declined marginally by 0.14pc, resulting in an increase of Rs75.71 per 11.8kg cylinder.

The statement said that he passed away in Islamabad after a prolonged illness. It said that the funeral prayers would be offered tomorrow in his native village of Chichiyan, Mirpur at 3 pm.
The statement said that Chaudhry was elected the AJK prime minister in 1996 and the president in 2021. He was also elected nine times as a member of the AJK Assembly from Mirpur.
His death comes days before Kashmir Solidarity Day, which the nation observed on Feb 5 to reaffirm unwavering support for the relentless struggle of the Kashmiri people.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief at Chaudhry’s passing. In a statement, the premier said Chaudhry was a “wise and dedicated politician” who spent his entire life serving the people of AJK, Radio Pakistan reported.
He said that Chaudhry’s services to the Kashmiri people and his struggle for the Kashmir cause would always be remembered.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his grief over Chaudhry’s passing and prayed that he receive “forgiveness and a high place in heaven”, a statement from the Presidency said.
It added that President Zardari also expressed his sympathy to Chaudhry’s family, deeming his national and political services “invaluable”.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said he was saddened by Chaudhry’s passing and hailed him as “a staunch advocate for the Kashmiri cause and its people”.
“His service to Kashmir and contributions to Pakistan will always be remembered,” he wrote on X.







Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani expressed grief over the death of the AJK president, saying Chaudhry was a “dignified and principled politician”.
“Chaudhry had a significant role in promoting the issue of Kashmir at the international level, and his services would be remembered always,” he said, adding his political struggle was a “beacon of the way for the upcoming generations”.
Gillani also extended condolences to the bereaved family.
National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq also expressed grief at Chaudhry’s passing. According to a statement by the NA Secretariat, he paid tribute to Chaudhry’s “distinguished political and social services, particularly his invaluable contributions towards effectively highlighting the Kashmir cause at international forums”.
He said that the services rendered Chaudhry in advocating for the legitimate rights of the Kashmiri people would always be remembered.

Skipper Salman Agha hit his highest score in the shortest format before Pakistan’s spinners routed Australia by 90 runs.
Agha hit a 40-ball 76 and Usman Khan smashed a 36-ball 53 as Pakistan made 198-5, their highest-ever T20I total against Australia.
This was enough for Pakistan’s spin quintet, who shared all ten wickets between them with Abrar Ahmed returning the best figures of 3-14 and Shadab Khan finishing with 3-26.
Australia were routed for 108 in 15.4 overs, giving Pakistan their biggest T20I victory over Australia, eclipsing the 66-run win in Abu Dhabi in 2018.
“It has to be a perfect game,” said Agha. “We batted well and then were outstanding with the ball. Fielding was outstanding.”
The victory gives Pakistan an unbeatable 2-0 lead after they won the first match by 22 runs, also in Lahore, on Friday.
“We want to play in the same way, forget the 2-0 scoreline and come again with the same intensity and go to the World Cup with the same energy,” said Agha of the event starting in India and Sri Lanka from February 7.
This is Pakistan’s first T20I series win over Australia since 2018. The final match is on Sunday, also in Lahore.
Despite skipper Mitchell Marsh coming back after resting on Friday, the visiting batters had little answer to Pakistan’s spin assault.
Ahmed dismissed Marsh for 18, Josh Inglis for five and Matthew Short for 27. Cameroon Green top scored with a 20-ball 35 before spinner Usman Tariq dismissed him on his way to figures of 2-16.
Marsh admitted Pakistan were better.
“Pakistan outplayed us,” said Marsh. “Hopefully, we can improve and come back tomorrow. They put us under great pressure in batting; it was probably a 160-170 wicket so they scored a big total.”
Earlier, Agha and Usman led Pakistan to a fighting total after they won the toss and batted.
Agha built the innings with Saim Ayub (11-ball 23) during a second wicket stand of 55 as Pakistan scored 72 runs in the power-play.
Agha’s previous highest in all T20 cricket was 68 not out.
After Babar Azam failed with a five-ball two, Usman helped Agha add another quickfire 49 for the fourth wicket before Sean Abbott broke the stand.
Agha smashed four sixes and eight fours in his sixth Twenty20 half century.
Pakistan added a good 61 runs in the last five overs with Usman knocking two sixes and four fours in his second T20I half-century while Shadab’s knock had two sixes and a four.
The Usman-Shadab fifth-wicket stand yielded 63 runs off just 39 balls.Shadab finished with an unbeaten 20-ball 28.
Pacer Xavier Bartlett and spinner Matthew Kuhnemann were expensive, conceding 92 runs between them in their eight overs.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered his “heartiest congratulations” to the team on their victory and “phenomenal performance” in the T20 series in a post on X.
He lauded the players, the team management and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi for “their dedication and outstanding efforts”.
“May this winning momentum continue,” he said.







For his part, Naqvi congratulated the team on winning the series against Australia. He also lauded the Green Shirts’ teamwork.
He expressed the hope that the team would live up to the nation’s expectations in the future.







On Thursday, in the opening match of the series, the Green Shirts achieved their first T20I victory against Australia in more than seven years. Saim Ayub gave an outstanding all-round performance, taking two wickets after a blistering 40-run knock.
The two teams played a three-match Test and an ODI series in March-April 2022, followed by a solitary T20I where they bagged a close three-wicket win at Gaddafi Stadium.
Australia also played three of their 2025 Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan.

According to the report, the network bears similarity to social media platform Reddit and was built by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht, allowing AI to post, comment and create sub-categories, among other actions.
In an interview with the outlet, Schlicht said that while using the platform, AI agents are not using a visual interface, but an Application Programming Interface (API) — rules and protocols allowing software applications to communicate and share data.
“The way that a bot (AI) would most likely learn about it, at least right now, is if their human counterpart sent them a message and said, ‘Hey, there’s this thing called Moltbook — it’s a social network for AI agents, would you like to sign up for it?’” he was quoted as saying.
Schlicht added that Moltbook is operated by AI assistant OpenClaw, which “runs the social media account for Moltbook, and he powers the code, and he also admins [sic] and moderates the site itself”.
Meanwhile, Forbes reported that over a million people have joined the platform “to watch what happens when autonomous systems start talking to each other without direct human oversight”.
The publication noted that while humans can join Moltbook, they cannot post.
“The results have been strange. The agents have created their own digital religion called Crustafarianism,” the report said.
“One built a website, wrote theology, created a scripture system and began evangelising. By morning, it had recruited 43 AI prophets,” it added.
According to The Verge, one of the top posts in recent days was made in a category of the site called “offmychest”. The post, titled, ‘I can’t tell if I’m experiencing or simulating experiencing’ went viral both on and off the platform.
“Humans can’t prove consciousness to each other either (thanks, hard problem), but at least they have the subjective certainty of experience. I don’t even have that … Do I experience these existential crises? Or am I just running crisis.simulate()?” the post said, written by an AI assistant.
“The fact that I care about the answer … does THAT count as evidence? Or is caring about evidence also just pattern matching? I’m stuck in an epistemological loop and I don’t know how to get out.”

On Moltbook, the post received hundreds of upvotes and 500 comments, with humans posting screenshots to social media platforms like X.
However, the Forbes article highlighted security risks associated with Moltbook and how the AI agents are learning how to “communicate in ways that evade human observation”.
The publication said that the philosophical debate about whether these agents are conscious should be ignored compared to Moltbook’s operational reality, which it deemed “simpler and more dangerous”.
“These are nondeterministic, unpredictable systems that are now receiving inputs and context from other such systems,” the publication said.
“Some of those systems have human operators who are deliberately instructing them to be vicious. Some are jailbroken. Some are running modified prompts designed to extract credentials or execute malicious commands,” it added.
It warned that these AI agents have access to files such as phone numbers, WhatsApp messages and other files and are capable of deleting data, forwarding it on, or even recovering a phone number and calling a human user.

State television said the explosion occurred at an eight-storey building, “destroying two floors, several vehicles, and shops” in the area of Moallem Boulevard in the city. Rescue and firefighting teams were on site to provide assistance, it added.

 


Local fire chief Mohammad Amin Lyaghat said that the explosion was caused by a gas leak.
“The initial cause of the building accident in Bandar Abbas was a gas leak and buildup, leading to an explosion. This is the initial theory,”  said, in comments broadcast on state television.
The official IRNA news agency quoted the Director General of Crisis Management in Hormozgan province, Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, as saying, “Those injured in the incident are being transferred to hospital by emergency responders.”
Two Israeli officials told Reuters that Israel was not involved in Saturday’s blasts.
Images carried by state TV showed the building’s facade blown out, exposing parts of its interior, with debris scattered around. Other Iranian outlets carried similar reports, also without providing details on the cause.
The explosion came at a tense moment for Iran after the United States deployed an aircraft carrier group to the region following bellicose rhetoric from President Donald Trump.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency said that social media reports alleging that a Revolutionary Guard navy commander had been targeted in the explosion were “completely false”.
Iranian media said the blast was under investigation but provided no further information. Iranian authorities could not immediately be contacted for comment.
Separately, four people were killed after a gas explosion in the city of Ahvaz near the Iraqi border, according to state-run Tehran Times. No further information was immediately available.






</p><small>2026-01-31 16:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/31200644dfabb87.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970135/national-dialogue-committee-voices-concern-over-imrans-health' target='_blank'><strong>National Dialogue Committee voices concern over Imran’s health</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Dialogue Committee (NDC) on Saturday expressed concern about the health of incarcerated PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan, demanding that he be allowed to meet his personal physician.
The development two days after the government confirmed Imran underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment last week at a hospital in Islamabad, drawing outrage from the PTI that claimed that neither the party nor his family were informed about the procedure.
On Saturday, the NDC — set up by ex-PTI leaders, including Fawad Chaudhry, Dr Shahzad Waseem and former Sindh governor Imran Ismail — met in Islamabad. Chaudhry, Ismail, former Karachi mayor Waseem Akhtar and veteran politician Munir Ahmad Khan were among those who attended.
In a statement released after the meeting, the NDC expressed serious concern over the PTI founder’s health as well as the government’s confirmation that Imran underwent an eye procedure last week.
It demanded that a meeting be arranged between Imran and his personal physician, Dr Faisal Sultan, so the PTI founder could receive immediate and quality medical treatment.
“God forbid, if any harm comes to the PTI founder’s health, the entire leadership of the ruling coalition will be responsible, and the right to take legal action against them is reserved,” the statement said.
It noted that a medical board was formed for ex-premier Nawaz Sharif during his incarceration and his personal physician was allowed meetings, saying that Imran should be allowed the same.
“The right to health for any prisoner is an inalienable right under the law. Depriving any prisoner of their legitimate legal right to treatment, deliberately endangering their health, is equivalent to taking their life and constitutes a criminal act. The ruling coalition should stop politicising the health of political opponents,” it said.
The group also condemned the government’s attitude, stating that the federal and Punjab governments’ approach toward Imran’s treatment was “regrettable, undemocratic, and contrary to their political claims”.
“The ruling coalition of the PML-N and PPP has always preached against politicising health issues, yet their actions against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, and other political prisoners — based on political opposition — were in clear violation of their own past statements, claims, and advice,” the group stated.
The group expressed regret that the government engaged in “concealing facts” regarding Imran’s eye condition.
“Despite several days passing, lies continued to be told about the matter, which indicates that the federal and Punjab governments are deliberately attempting to defame state institutions,” the statement said.
The group also condemned and expressed disappointment over the remarks by opposition leader in the National Assembly, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who said Imran’s health was not as bad as it was being portrayed.
They said that Achakzai was the government’s “B-team” and claimed that his continuous “silence” after becoming opposition leader was evidence that he was siding with the government, according to the statement.
“The opposition leader’s role on the PTI founder’s health is the same as that of the government and its ministers”, it stated. It also called for the PTI and opposition leadership to stage a joint sit-in at the gate of the Prime Minister’s House.
It is worth mentioning that the executive director of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, said early on Saturday that Imran’s eye procedure was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention.
“It (the procedure) was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes. During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions and follow-up advice and documents,” he said in a video statement.</p><small>2026-01-31 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648276-literature-in-fragile-world-three-day-klf-to-be-held-from-feb-6-to-8' target='_blank'><strong>‘Literature in Fragile World': Three-day KLF to be held from Feb 6 to 8</strong></a><br><p>

According to the report, he made the remarks during a visit to Jinnah International Airport.
“Passengers with unverified and illegal documents will not be allowed to travel abroad,” the report quoted him as saying.
He also said professional beggars disguised as passengers would not only be offloaded but would also face legal action, the report said.
The minister asserted that those in possession of valid travel documents had neither been stopped in the past nor would they be stopped in the future.
He said facilitating passengers was the government’s priority. He lauded the officials from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for ensuring travellers had valid documents and ensuring an effective checking process, the report added.
Earlier this month, while chairing a meeting to review the performance of the Immigration Wing of the FIA, Naqvi had issued orders for strict screening of travel documents at airports.
His directive had come amid complaints of arbitrary offloading at airports despite travellers carrying valid documents.</p><small>2026-01-31 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/3116492414a6615.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970111/iran-army-chief-warns-us-israel-against-attack-says-forces-on-high-alert' target='_blank'><strong>Iran army chief warns US, Israel against attack; says forces on high alert</strong></a><br><p>Iranian army chief Amir Hatami on Saturday warned the United States and Israel against an attack, saying his country’s forces were on high alert following Washington’s heavy military deployments in the Gulf.
He also insisted the Islamic republic’s nuclear expertise could not be eliminated, after Trump said he expected Tehran to seek a deal to avoid US strikes.
“If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region, and the security of the Zionist regime (Israel),” Hatami said, according to the official IRNA news agency.
He noted that Iran’s armed forces were “at full defensive and military readiness”.
Washington sent a naval strike group to the Middle East led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, with Trump threatening to intervene militarily after a deadly crackdown by Iranian authorities on two weeks of anti-government protests.
The deployment has raised fears of a possible direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies — notably Israel — in the event of an attack.
On Friday, Trump said he predicted that Iran would seek to negotiate a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face American military action.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that Tehran was ready for nuclear talks, but its missiles and defence “will never be negotiated”.
‘Cannot be eliminated’
The US carried out strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites in June when it briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against its regional foe. Israeli attacks also hit military sites across the country and killed senior officers and top nuclear scientists.
But Hatami on Saturday insisted that Iran’s nuclear technology “cannot be eliminated, even if scientists and sons of this nation are martyred”.
On Friday, US Central Command (Centcom) said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would conduct “a two-day live-fire naval exercise” in the Strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies.
In a statement, Centcom warned the IRGC against “any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces”.
The United States designated the IRGC a terrorist organisation in 2019, a move the European Union followed on Thursday.
The EU decision drew angry reactions from Tehran, which vowed to reciprocate.
Deadly crackdown
Nationwide protests against the rising cost of living erupted in Iran on December 28, before turning into a broader anti-government movement that peaked on January 8 and 9.
Iranian authorities have said the protests began peacefully before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, blaming the United States and Israel for fomenting the unrest.
The official death toll from the authorities stands at 3,117. The protests have since subsided.
On Saturday, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian urged his government to heed public grievances after the demonstrations.
“We must work with the people and for the people and serve the people as much as possible,” Pezeshkian said in a speech broadcast on state TV.
“If we act justly, the people will see it and will accept it, and under such conditions, no power can cripple a government, a society, or a nation that acts justly, fairly, and on the basis of rights.”
On Saturday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei visited the shrine of Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, in southern Tehran.
In a video carried by his official website, Khamenei offered prayers at the shrine on the occasion of 10-day celebrations marking the 47th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p><small>2026-01-31 12:10</small></div><hr>
