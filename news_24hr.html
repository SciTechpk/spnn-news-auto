<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68d0ac99a455f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943803/ties-that-bind' target='_blank'><strong>Ties that bind</strong></a><br><p>BEFORE we move on to actually discussing the ramifications of the Pakistan-Saudi mutual defence agreement let’s first thank the two men who helped make it possible, starting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose strategic blunder in May this year — fuelled by hubris, rabid nationalism and a gross overestimation of India’s capabilities — continues to be a gift that keeps on giving. For Pakistan, that is.
In launching his unprovoked attack on Pakistan and getting a bloody nose in return, he not only succeeded in puncturing India’s aura but also, crucially, showed the world that Pakistan’s military is very much capable of taking on a much larger adversary armed with the latest military tech from around the world. No one was more surprised by this than Pakistanis themselves.
Next, we should also thank Modi’s ally and ideological twin, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who — deep in the throes of an unquenchable bloodlust and feeling absolutely invincible — conducted air strikes in the capital of Qatar, purportedly to assassinate Hamas leaders who were meeting there.
 
 

While he did not achieve his stated objectives, he has almost certainly succeeded in making the Gulf states consider exactly what a US defence shield is worth, when it is ineffective in curbing Israeli aggression.
It has also certainly caused those states to consider that Israel’s expansionist agenda encompasses the entire region and not ‘just’ Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Here we see a perfect example of the application of the law of unintended consequences.

The pact reverses the drift between Islamabad and Riyadh.

This then starts a serious conversation about how to hedge against uncertainty in a world that is, and will remain, in serious strategic flux. And one way to do that is by means of bilateral, and perhaps even eventually multilateral and regional, security pacts.
The deal signed between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia can thus be correctly seen in that context, and while it is in many ways a culmination of the decades-long relationship between the two states and was certainly in the works for some time, I have little doubt that the Israeli attacks on Doha added a very real sense of urgency.
 
 

What this pact also does is to reverse what had been a clear drift between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. We would do well to recall that Pakistan had previously resisted Saudi entreaties to join in their war against Yemen, and the refusal to do so had indeed soured relations to a considerable extent. This period also saw Saudi Arabia, along with other Gulf states, move closer to India, to Pakistan’s detriment.
That this trend seems to be halting may also have to do with India’s very clear alliance with Israel — recently the Gaza genocide’s poster boy, Israeli minister Bezalel Smotrich, was in India to sign a bilateral treaty and Modi took over 24 hours to condemn the attacks on Doha, without once even naming Israel. While this does not entail any sort of actual break between the Gulf states and India, it should provoke a rethink.
 
 

Naturally there are some very real questions and concerns in Pakistan as to what this pact would actually entail. If India were to attack Pakistan again, would Saudi Arabia deploy its troops in defence of Pakistan?
To be frank, this is unlikely at best, and would not even be something Pakistan needs. What this pact will do, however, is raise the costs of any future aggression by India and complicate their strategic calculations. If the details of the pact are ambiguous, then that is by design.
Other voices in Pakistan are (habi­tually) asking whe­ther this means that the country will once again become embroiled in ‘some-one else’s war’ and concerns are being raised as to whe­ther the true target of this pact is Iran. Now, had this pact been signed a few years or even a few months ago, then this would have been a valid concern.
 
 

But with Iran no longer the existential threat it was considered to be by the Gulf states pre-Oct 7, 2023, and very clear signals of rapprochement between Riyadh and Tehran, this sort of thinking should be considered the concerns of a by­­gone era. It is worth noting that a few days before this pact was signed, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman hosted Iran’s Ali Larijani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council, in Riyadh.
As for the rest of the Gulf states, the pact provides a template for similar agreements. Qatar, given its close relations with Turkiye, could opt for a similar arrangement with Ankara, which then could also be extended to Pakistan.
Here, the real wild card is the UAE, which, with its destabilising tentacles spread as far afield as Libya and Sudan, will likely remain aloof, trusting in its close relations with Israel to keep the peace.

Speaking at a gathering of overseas Pakistanis in London, the prime minister said that Pakistan wanted to hold dialogue with India on contentious issues like Kashmir, terrorism, water and trade on the basis of equality.
The prime minister said that without the resolution of the Kashmir issue, which was the key to the regional peace, bilateral ties between the two countries could not be established.
“Anyone who is thinking otherwise is akin to living in a fool’s paradise,” he said, adding that Kashmiris would get their right to self-determination and freedom.

Expresses grief over 64,000 deaths, grave humanitarian situation in Gaza

“I have made this offer so many times in the past. We want to discuss Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism issues, not because of any weakness but on the basis of equal terms,” the prime minister said.
After visiting Saudi Arabia, PM Shehbaz made a stopover in London for four days and then he will proceed to the US on Monday to attend United Nations General Assembly conference.
He said that as the ceasefire between Pakistan and India had been achieved, Pakistan wanted peace, progress and prosperity and an end to unemployment and poverty.
Underlining the significance of unity and solidarity which led to triumph in the recent armed conflict with India, PM Shehbaz pledged to guide the country on the path of progress and prosperity.
The prime minister said that after India’s baseless allegations over Pah­algam incident, he had offered, during his visit to Kakul, a probe by an international committee into the incident in a fair, impartial and transparent manner, but India did not respond to his offer.
On May 6, aggression was unleashed against the innocent civilians and civilian assets were attacked inside Pakistan, leading to causalities, he said, adding that Pakistan in its right of defence, downed six enemy’s fighter jets in one go which made the enemy realise its precarious position.
 
 

Expressing his grief over 64,000 deaths and grave humanitarian situation in Gaza, he said the world had not witnessed such heart-wrenching scenes
The prime minister called upon the Islamic world and the international community to come forward and address the issue urgently.
He said that on the basis of hard work of overseas Pakistanis, in the previous year, the country received $38.5 billion in remittances, adding that without this contribution of overseas Pakistanis, the country’s economy could not move forward.
He said the country’s economic indicators were showing upward trends and at the diplomatic front, the country was strengthening its ties and position.
Speaking on the occasion, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar said that overseas Pakistanis were the country’s diplomats.
He said in the year 2022, when the incumbent government came to power, it was a difficult time as the country was at the verge of default, and the global rating agencies and institutions were setting dates in this regard.
He said the nation saluted the prime minister for his dynamic leadership that ensured economic turnaround.
Enumerating the downward trends in the inflation and interest rates, he resolved that the government was striving for the economic empowerment.
Referring to the Indian aggression, he said Pakistan defeated an enemy that boasted of its armed power and regional net security provider, adding that the myth was buried on May 10.
Referring to climate change impact, Mr Dar said that Pakistan was vulnerable to climate change and the government was devising projects so that in the coming years, the country could be able to cope with this challenge.
He said the government was also raising its voice for the equality and justice, because the climate change was a matter of justice, not only for Pakistan but for any country suffering from the emissions worldwide.

In villages along the border with India, people are back in their fields, repairing link roads and watercourses. Tube wells once again irrigate rice fields, while youngsters fish in the river and in the ponds left behind by the flood. Speaking to them reveals a quiet resilience and determination to rebuild.
The river has now receded to its banks after a week of flooding, but the damage remains stark. Many residents watch as weakened homes crack or collapse.
Grain stocks are dampened even when spared direct contact with floodwater. Farm machinery is rusting, and stagnant water lingers in low-lying fields — breeding mosquitoes and pests across the uneven landscape. Irrigation channels lie collapsed or choked with mud.

Farmers thankful for rain that saved their crops from being buried under silt & mud brought by overflowing rivers

Thousands of acres of water-sensitive crops such as vegetables, fodder and sesame lie flattened, leaving farmers counting losses. Rice and sorghum fields largely survived, but hundreds — if not thousands — of acres in low-lying areas were destroyed.
“Nature has its own ways of helping in the most testing times,” says 52-year-old Iqbal, a resident of village Kajla. He explains that after the floods, 72 hours of torrential rain spared farmers from total destruction. In fields that were not low-lying, the rain washed away thick layers of mud that would otherwise have smothered the plants.
 
 

The flood had already re-energised the root zone with fresh silt deposits. “That’s why you can still see some green fields,” Iqbal says. “Without the rain, this picture would have been completely different.”
Alongside their courage to survive and faith in divine help, flood survivors also lament official neglect during and after the disaster. “This attitude multiplies the risks to our lives and makes survival harder,” they say.
Their sentiments broadly reflect three realities: the sheer scale of the tragedy, a fearful community struggling to rebuild, and poorly planned waterworks that have added to their misery.
The shifting river: a rising threat
The post-flood reality is visible in every corner of Narang Mandi.
Irrigation channels are silted up and clogged with mud. Each village has collapsed houses on its outskirts and cracked walls along its streets, where residents appeal to every visitor, often mistaking them for officials assessing compensation.
Poverty, deepened by the floods, is evident everywhere.
Roads linking the villages have either been washed away or deliberately breached by villagers to drain water, leaving them impassable for traffic. Commuting is now limited to trudging on foot or riding motorbikes along submerged paths.
Life is edging back to normal, but the progress is painfully slow, as villagers have only themselves to rely on.
“Villagers will repair their homes and streets in the coming days or weeks,” says 52-year-old Ashfaq Baryar of Baryar village on the Ravi’s bank. “What we cannot handle are the larger issues — the river drifting closer to our villages, consuming fertile land and depriving millions of their livelihoods,” he laments.
 
 

According to him, embankments are not reinforced, and each season water erodes the dykes, leaving them weaker until floods wash them away. He adds that the very nature of flooding has also changed.
In the past, floodwaters used to rise slowly, inch by inch — or at worst, foot by foot in emergencies. This time, it was a five-foot wall of water that swept across the area within two hours and stayed for over a week, leaving farmers little chance to flee or respond, Ashfaq says.
“It was an entirely new pattern, unheard of even in the stories of our ancestors. The very nature of the threat has changed, and even those of us who have lived here for generations do not know how to face it.”
Infrastructural flaws
Farhan Shaukat of Kot Bhailan explains the area’s vulnerability. Three water systems converge here, turning it into a vast pond. The Ravi, after zigzagging along the border, re-enters Pakistani territory and floods the land. The Marala-Ravi (MR) Link, carrying 22,000 cusecs, also ends here.
Finally, the elevated banks of the BRB Canal trap water between the Pakistan-India border and Lahore, submerging more than 50 villages along the 40-km stretch until the Ravi reaches Shahdara. These structures combine to create — and sustain — millions of cubic feet of stagnant water, which only drains once the Ravi begins to recede. This pattern has persisted for decades.
“The last two kilometres of the MR Canal have no banks,” says 60-year-old Riyasat Ali Kahloon of Khundey village. When the Ravi swells, it blocks the canal’s flow, which then reverses to flood villages between its endpoint and the river. “We have raised this issue with politicians and policymakers for years. They only made promises to build the embankment but never acted. In recent years we’ve been told the project was approved and procedures completed, yet no work has begun,” he says.
He warns that flaws in the man-made system must be fixed before it is too late. “The cost of the proposed embankment would be a fraction of what we lost in just one week of flooding.”

Pakistan’s only chance was posting a total that could pressurise India’s formidable batting line-up. Encouragingly, they took that chance in the first half of their innings and at the end, but a baffling seven overs of lethargy in the middle terminally damaged the team’s prospects.
India’s openers, Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill, thrashed Pakistan’s bowling all around the Dubai International Stadium. By the 10th over, India had full control of the game and had lost no wickets.
This shows that India produces batsmen while Pakistan unearths hitters. The latter also selects too many nudgers and blockers, so when the best teams in the world go hard at the opposition throughout an innings, it’s hard to understand why Pakistan persist with a bygone strategy.

Fakhar’s dismissal was just the latest example of the unwritten laws of cricket, which state that Team India — not the batsman — should receive the benefit of the doubt

The PCB might respond by saying that these are among the best players available. However, what the PCB must ask itself is why it oversees a system that fails to produce batsmen of sufficient quality to perform consistently in international cricket.
 
 

It must also ask itself why it fails to produce batsmen capable of executing the aggressive approach that today’s white ball cricket demands. And it must ask itself why Pakistan’s players are so inept at playing spin bowling.
But on the bright side, the version of Pakistan that we saw in the Super 4 contest was to some degree a different and welcome one. The hitters attacked from the beginning; granted they were aided by a pitch that — although a little on the slow side — offered no help to bowlers.
Fakhar Zaman set the example. He came not to play; he came to attack and seize the initiative.  Disappointingly, just as he was beginning to force the issue, he was wrongly dismissed by the third umpire, who somehow believed that a ball bouncing on the grass before nestling in the wicketkeeper’s gloves was out.
It was just the latest example of the unwritten laws of cricket, which state that Team India — not the batsman — should receive the benefit of the doubt.
Fakhar’s gusto was enough to light the fire in Sahibzada Farhan. Pakistan had made a wise decision in dropping Saim Ayub to number three, and Farhan laid a solid foundation for Pakistan’s innings.
Farhan continued his domination of the world’s premiere fast bowler following a historic six last week. This was something of a second humbling for Jasprit Bumrah, who other than his precision yorker, wasn’t quite sure how to respond.
When Saim joined Farhan, Pakistan’s pinch-hitter-turned-indispensable-bowler played a steady hand. Between them they took Pakistan to the dizzy heights of 93 from the first 10 overs. Unfortunately, the innings unravelled after the traditional break in play.
 
 

Pakistan lost momentum, firstly through Saim rediscovering his trademark no-look flick off the hips, which led to his dismissal. It is probably a shot that Saim needs to put away for a while.
Next, India’s spinners and back up bowlers becalmed Pakistan for no other reason than a lack of ambition from the Pakistani ‘nudgers and blockers’.
Part of the problem was that the Pakistan thinktank has become obsessed with the strategy of maintaining a left-and-right-hand combination. This led to Mohammad Nawaz, in particular, getting a promotion up the order, which backfired.
It was in those seven overs after the halfway mark that Pakistan shot themselves in the foot. Farhan became frustrated, fatigued, and partly succumbed to his hand injury. Salman Ali Agha, the captain, alongside Nawaz, wrongly chose to stabilise the innings.
Stability is one thing, but failing to score a boundary in 40 balls is a crime against cricketing logic.
The sad truth for Pakistan is that, however noble he is as a cricketer, Salman is not fit for the T-20 team. Equally, it’s unclear how often Nawaz must demonstrate his unsuitability for international cricket. These mistakes must be corrected when the next T-20 squad is picked.
Still, Pakistan recovered to a par score of 171. This was largely thanks to the witless approach of Nawaz, who was run out dawdling back to the crease in a homage to the great Inzamam-ul-Haq.
Pakistan were fortunate that Faheem Ashraf, who came in next, was in the mood to smite 20 runs off eight deliveries. Faheem’s success was in his willingness to take the attack to the Indian bowling, something that Salman and Nawaz were incapable of doing.
Through this mixture of calculated and fearless aggression — as demonstrated by Fakhar, Farhan, and Faheem — and dozy cricket — best exemplified by Salman and Nawaz — Pakistan reached a respectable total. However, it was 20 runs short of where it should have been given Pakistan’s start and given the opposition.
 
 

It didn’t make any sense that the hitting power of Mohammad Harris and Shaheen Shah Afridi was left sitting in the pavilion as the nudgers and blockers invited India back into the game. Let’s not forget that India gave Pakistan an unexpected helping hand by shelling four catches.
This may be a Pakistan side in transition, but the reality is that the problems in the batting order and tactics have made Pakistan a second rank side.
The bowling needs work too but it’s hard to evaluate properly because of the chronic failure of these hitters and the permanent indulgence of nudgers and blockers. Pakistan can still qualify for the final, but it would be a major surprise, and, at the moment, fully undeserved.

Abhishek Sharma was adjudicated player-of-the-match —  scoring 74 runs of 39 balls as he led the Indian effort from the front after getting a reprieve in Shaheen’s second over.
The bitterness between the players, which started with India’s refusal of customary handshakes in the first encounter, continued as Sharma at the post-match ceremony said:  “Today it was very simple, the way they were coming (at) us for no reason, I didn’t like it at all, and this is the only way I could give [an answer] with my bat.”
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking after the match, said, “We are yet to play the perfect game. We batted really well — but I think when it came to the bowling, they took the game away in the powerplay.”
 
 

He said they could have got 15 more runs after being 91 in the first 10 overs, but added that 171 was still a good total.
The Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav appreciated the character shown by his team after being behind in the game after the first innings.

Match report:
The Indian opening batters, after early reprieves, made a mockery of a decent score by the Pakistani batters as the Men in Blue chased down their highest score against the Green Shirts in men’s T20Is.
In the first innings, the Indian bowlers — barring Shivam Dube — had no answers to the Pakistani onslaught with the bat. The Men in Blue’s fielding was nervy and even worse than their bowling effort, with multiple dropped chances.
Pakistan’s batters smashed both the Indian pacers and the spinners on a dry pitch that got better as the match continued — with India making full use of the easier conditions.

Dube was the only redeeming aspect of the Indian bowling effort, as he got crucial wickets in the middle overs and dried up scoring — Pakistan going 39 balls without boundaries after being in a commanding position of 91-1 after 10 overs.
Nearly all the Pakistani batters had a commendable day with the bat as India were under pressure from ball one with the start Fakhar got. They ultimately got to their highest score batting first against India in men’s T20Is  — on the back of Sahibzada’s 50 and some late-order hitting by Faheem and skipper Salman.
Fakhar’s controversial dismissal was a major talking point, after the southpaw opener was given out by the third umpire caught by the keeper, though visuals showed that there was definitely room for doubt whether the ball carried — which usually goes in the batter’s favour.
But the Green Shirts had continued with their tradition of facing opponents with one hand tied behind their backs. They had picked Hussain Talat in a bid to strengthen their batting — but at the expense of leaving out their big hitters like Hassan Nawaz and Khushdil Shah.
 
 

Two out of three Pakistani pacers continued the tradition of Pakistani fastmen troubling Indian batters — with Haris Rauf in particular giving the Men in Blue a run for their money on a placid pitch.

He made a mess of Sanju Samson’s middle-stump and got the Indian skipper out for a duck with his express pace as well — giving away just 26 runs in his four overs.
Pakistan still have one more potential chance of redemption against the Men in Blue — if they build on the positives in this game and play well across both departments to reach the Asia Cup final next Sunday.

Faheem comes in to bowl.
Seems a matter of time for India now. Pakistan needed a tight over but Faheem was wayward and was duly dispatched for six on the second ball. 10 runs come off it and India are now nine away from victory.
Over 17 — India - 153/4
16.4: Haris strikes with a jaffa! He delivers an absolute peach of a delivery thats makes a mess of Samson’s stumps!
16.5: Hardik Pandya gets off the mark with a four through midwicket. Haris is not impressed.

Pakistan needed a breakthrough, and Haris struck. Samson tried to play across but missed the ball completely and saw his stumps shattered on the fourth ball of the over.
Any hopes of a shift in momentum, however, were quickly snuffed out by Hardik Pandya’s nonchalant flick for four on the first ball he faced. Haris has bowled his quota of four; India need 19 off the last three overs.

Over 16 — India - 143/3
Abrar continues and nearly gets another Indian wicket!
Luck goes India’s way as a miscued shot from Samson lands perfectly between three fielders. Pakistan could’ve done with a wicket there but that’s how the game’s been for them. India need 27 runs from the last four overs to win. Is there a miracle in store for Pakistan?

Over 15 — India - 140/3
Salman turns to Shaheen to be the provider for his side, but Tilak Verma gets his first boundary.
India get eight runs off the over, now 32 runs away from winning — again.

Over 14 — India - 132/3
Faheem continues but another wicket proves elusive for Pakistan as the incoming Sanju Samson plays a delightful cover drive for four. India closing in on target with six runs coming off the over.
They need 40 runs off the last six overs. Pakistan need a wicket or two and needed it yesterday!

Over 13 — India - 123-3
Abrar strikes and gets rid of Abhishek! The Indian batter does not bother to look up as he walks off.
Abhishek seemed primed to finish the game single-handedly, but after welcoming Abrar with a six, he went for another and was caught by Haris. India is still on top, but Pakistan have more than a sniff.
Sanju Samson is the next man in for India.

Over 12 — India - 117-2
Faheem comes back in the attack and is immediately lifted down the ground for four by Abhishek. The India opener shows cuts away Faheem for another boundary three balls later. India get 11 off the over and Pakistan need to regain some inspiration.

Over 11 — India - 106-2
Indian skipper Suryakumar is at the crease. He looks tense.
Haris strikes as the Indian captain departs! Suryakumar top-edged that pacey Haris delivery down to third-man, where Abrar held his nerve.
 


The big-hitting Tilak Verma is the next man in for the Men in Blue.
Things get better for Pakistan. A fired-up Haris sends back Suryakumar. The right-armer’s pace proves to be the undoing for the India skipper, who gets a leading edge and is caught by Abrar on the boundary. Haris gives away just one run in the over. Pakistan getting back in the contest.
 



Over 10 — India - 101-1
There is a stoppage in play as Shubman was limping while running.
Faheem wrecks Shubman stumps! Pakistan draw first blood!
Overheard in the newsroom: Is this the start of the Indian collapse?!
Faheem was brought into the attack as Pakistan desperately sought a breakthrough and the right-armer found the perfect line with an inswinger to knock Gill’s off-stump. Suryakumar swings and misses first ball. The question is can Pakistan claw they way back?

A tidy over by Haris — just five off it — but India are cruising to the target.
 



Over 8 — India - 96-0
Saim continues and Gill excels with a reverse hit for four before Abhishek brings up his half-century with a four. Pakistan look bereft of ideas. 11 runs off the over and India closing in on 100 runs.

Over 7 — India - 83-0
Sahibzada returns the favour from the first innings by palming Abhishek over the boundary for six, what could have been a dismissal is another six!
Change of ends for Abrar, but it doesn’t work for Pakistan as Abhishek launches him into the stands on the second ball of the over. Luck also not going Pakistan’s way as Sahibzada helps another big hit from Abhishek over the fence. Runs keep coming for India — and fast. 16 off the over. India firmly in the driving seat.

Over 6 — India - 69-0
The power play has been completely dominated by the Indian batters after an early reprieve.
Saim is brought back into the attack but to no avail as Abhishek hits him down the ground for four and Gill cuts him away for another boundary two deliveries later and finishes it off with another. 14 runs off the over. India firmly on top and Pakistan seem to have no answer.

Over 5 — India - 50-0
The express pace of Haris is something that Indian batters seem to struggle against — let’s see if he can get the breakthrough for Pakistan.
Haris Rauf replaces Shaheen from the other end for the fifth over. Abhishek’s edge on the second ball flies away for four on the second ball and he has an exchange of words with Haris. It’s heated in the middle with both sets of players under pressure to deliver. India seem to be dealing with it better and Gill swats away Haris to finish the over. 12 off the over again.
 



Over 4 — India - 37-0
Mystery spinner Abrar into the attack.
Pakistan continue with spin from the other end as Abrar Ahmed replaces Saim. Abrar kept it tight on the first three balls but Abhishek then cut loose; pulling him for a four and a six. Another 12 runs come off the over. India are off to a fast start and Pakistan need to respond.
 



Over 3 — India - 31-0
2.3: Shaheen nearly had his man! Abhishek is dropped by Nawaz running back. It was a tough chance.
There were some words exchanged after Gill hit the boundary on the final ball of Shaheen’s over.
 

India’s Shubman Gill (L) looks at Pakistan’s Shaheen Shah Afridi during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai on September 21, 2025.

Could that Abhishek drop be a ‘what if’ moment for Pakistan? Gill powered him down the ground for four off the next ball and then finished the over with a slap for another boundary on the off-side. India get 12 off the over; a breakthrough becomes crucial for Pakistan.
 



Over 2 — India - 19-0
Saim — Pakistan’s highest wicket-taker in the tournament — made a tidy start but was then swept for four by Shubman Gill on the fourth ball, before being cut away for another on the next ball. India get 10 from the over. Pakistan need to make inroads.

Over 1 — India - 9-0
Shaheen bowls to Abhishek Sharma. This is the redemption arc we have been waiting for!
0.1: Shaheen bounces Sharma first ball, but he is up to the task and hits it for six off the very first ball.
Shaheen — the player of the match in Pakistan’s last outing, tightened things up with just three more runs coming in the over.
 



Mid-match analysis by Abyan Amir: The Indian bowlers had no answers to the Pakistani onslaught with the bat. The Men in Blue’s fielding was nervy and even worse with multiple dropped chances!
Pakistan made a mockery of both the Indian pacers and the spinners on a dry pitch that will get better as the match continues — India will be pinning their hopes on dew coming to rescue later in the innings after they had an ordinary day in the field.
Nearly all the Pakistani batters had a terrific day with the bat as India were under pressure from ball one with the start, Fakhar got — getting to their highest score batting first against India in men’s T20Is.
Fakhar’s controversial dismissal was a major talking point after the southpaw opener was given out by the third umpire, and visuals showed that there was definitely room for doubt — which usually goes in the batter’s favour.
This is shaping up to be the redemption bid for the Green Shirts that they needed — and deserved!

Pakistan needed to finish with a flourish, and Faheem’s top edge flew for four on the second ball off the last over by Pandya. The Indian all-rounder then gave away just three runs off the next three balls — one of them a wide — before Faheem ended it with a slash for six. Pakistan will feel they have a defendable total on the board.

Bumrah was taken apart by Pakistan in his first three overs but found his nagging line in the fourth.
Two searing yorkers were blocked by Nawaz at the start of the penultimate over. Nawaz then gets sloppy with his running to be dismissed. Good thing for Pakistan, though, is that the incoming Faheem wasted no time in getting off the mark and did that with a six off the first ball before being dropped by Gill in the deep.

Pakistan finally get a move on with Nawaz, at long last, nailing a big hit. The left-hander started the 18th over by Dube with a six and got two off the next ball. A slash off the third flew for four, and 17 runs came off the over.

Hussain Talat, making his first appearance in the tournament, got off the mark first ball but then played three dots and didn’t make much of a free hit.
India have a tidy over at last, just five off it.

Bumrah hasn’t had the desired impact for India in his first two overs and has changed ends. It didn’t change anything for him as Sahibzada smashed him to the mid-on boundary for four and then smashed him to the mid-off fence off the last ball. Pakistan are off to a flyer in the powerplay. Thirteen runs off the over and — by the looks of it —  headed to a big score.

India turned to spin after Pakistan made hay against the pacers. Varun Chakravarthy gave just one run off the first three balls he bowled and Saim took him on, an attempted sweep getting a top edge which was spilled by Yadav at fine leg. Pakistan rode their luck and another edge, this time off Saibzada’s bat, flew to the third man fence.

3.4: Bumrah gets smashed for four by Sahibzada, pressure on the Indian pacer as it’s a no-ball above waist height.
Sahibzada gets on the act, pulling Bumrah away for four to start the over and then slapped a full toss — adjudged to be above waist height— to the mid-wicket fence. Current run rate is a neat 9.00. Pakistan have a start and now needs to capitalise on it.

Fakhar started the over by slashing Pandya to the point boundary, but India were soon up in celebration as the left-hander was caught on the next ball. The ball seemed to have died on its way to Samson’s gloves but the TV umpire — controversially — adjudged that it bounced off the keeper’s glove and into his hand. Saim Ayub belatedly got his first runs of the tournament, pulling Pandya away on the second ball he faced.

Fakhar shows his intentions from the start. A slow outfield prevented him from starting off with a four, but he found a boundary with a flick on the legside on the third ball and then danced down the track and dispatched Jasprit Bumrah to the long-off fence on the next ball. Solid start from Pakistan

Build-up to the high intensity clash
The Green Shirts have a chance at redemption as they face India again today in Dubai for the Super Four stage of the Men’s Asia Cup after their last game was marred by a controversy spiralling from the neighbouring team’s refusal to shake hands with their opponents.
The Group A clash between the fierce rivals last Sunday — their first meeting since the four-day military conflict between them in May — ended on a bitter note when the Men in Blue refused to shake hands with the Green Shirts after winning the game. There were no handshakes between the captains at the toss either.
According to Reuters, Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for today’s clash, which is scheduled for 7:30pm PKT at the Dubai International Stadium.
Match referee Andy Pycroft, whose removal was sought by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over the controversy but was denied by the International Cricket Council (ICC), is still scheduled to officiate today.
 
 

Asked about the handshake issue and Pycroft’s presence yesterday, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav changed the subject, saying, “It will be a good contest between the ball and the bat”.
He added: “Close your room, switch off your phone and sleep. I think that’s the best thing to shut the noise. It’s easy to say, but sometimes it is difficult.”
India won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively.
Suryakumar, who had seemingly politicised last Sunday’s victory by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, said: “I have been very clear with all the boys. I think it’s very important if you want to do well in this tournament and going forward.
“We will have to shut a lot of noise from outside and take what is good for you.”
Despite India’s triumph in their previous encounter, Suryakumar insisted past results would count for nothing when the rivals meet again in today’s Super Four match.
“I feel our preparation has been really good leading into the tournament. We have also had three good games, so we are actually focusing on what we can do best,” he added.
 
 

“We want to follow all the good habits that we have been doing from the last two or three games. We take it one game at a time. It doesn’t give us an edge that we have played them once, and we had a good game. We have to start from scratch.”
Pakistan had cancelled their pre-match press conference yesterday, making it the second consecutive time that they did so following the handshake incident.
Last night, PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi met with the Green Shirts in Dubai as they participated in warm-up exercises for today’s match.
 






Handshake ruckus
Earlier this week, the situation escalated to the point that the PCB was even mulling its participation in the Asia Cup after the ICC rejected its complaint seeking the removal of Pycroft, who PCB said told captain Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with his Indian counterpart before the match.
 
 

However, the situation was finally settled when, just before Pakistan’s match against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday, the PCB said Pycroft “apologised” to the Green Shirts’ manager and captain over the ruckus resulting from “miscommunication”.
Nevertheless, the tournament still had lingering disputes; the ICC reportedly took exception to the PCB recording Pycroft’s “apology” meeting with Pakistan team officials. The event had been marred by controversy before it even began, with calls for a boycott of the game from across the border.</p><small>2025-09-22 03:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/22081937ea88038.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943802/no-more-inaction' target='_blank'><strong>No more inaction</strong></a><br><p>WORLD leaders are making their way to New York as the 80th session of the UN General Assembly kicks off this week. Among other global crises, the Gaza genocide will top the agenda.
Yet it will be a massive disappointment if the global elite continue to simply offer their condolences to the besieged people of Gaza, instead of coming up with solid plans to end Israel’s butchery. The international community’s track record in this regard is quite poor, but the UNGA session offers a chance for the comity of nations to help end the slaughter.
As these lines were being written Israel was busy exterminating the population of Gaza City. Half a million Palestinians have reportedly been ethnically cleansed from the area, told to ‘leave’ by the Israeli military. But there is nowhere to go, as even overcrowded ‘safe zones’ in the occupied Strip are not safe from Israel’s predatory behaviour.
The paralysis of the international community, including the UN, is astounding, as states have been unable to take any punitive steps against Israel. Perhaps the biggest reason for this is that the US, the world’s most powerful country, is Israel’s biggest defender on the world stage. Last week, the US vetoed for the sixth time — since the Gaza offensive began — a ceasefire resolution at the UNSC.
Moreover, Washington has blocked or revoked visas for the Palestinian delegation, which means that President Mahmoud Abbas will have to address the UN by video link. Apparently, the US administration is not just against Hamas, it is actually against Palestine and its people. This is not surprising, as many within the Trump administration are virulent Zionists, willing to put everything on the line to defend Israeli crimes.
 
 

The UNGA session will provide states with a conscience to censure Israel for its crimes, and resist American bullying by expressing solidarity with Palestine. Let us see who is willing to do the right thing.
Suffice to say, impassioned speeches and flourishes of rhetoric will not end the Gaza genocide. Only an actionable plan to stop Israel’s butchery can work.
If the US intends on paralysing the Security Council through its veto, let the global majority use UNGA as a stage to send a strong message on Gaza. This can be done by endorsing a resolution to isolate Israel diplomatically and economically — along with enforcing an arms embargo — until Tel Aviv commits to a ceasefire.
Feeble critiques of Israel will not stop it; it will only embolden Israel to cause even more havoc in the occupied territories, as well as the larger region. Therefore, UNGA must speak with one voice: Israel must immediately end the holocaust in Gaza, and those responsible for the Palestinian genocide must face justice.

• Tarbela reaches full conservation level of 1,550 feet; Mangla nearly filled to brim
• Chashma Barrage also attains record storage level of 649 feet; officials expect minimal water shortage in Rabi season; wheat to benefit most
ISLAMABAD: After many years, Pakistan will begin the upcoming Rabi season with healthy carryover water storage of more than 13 million acre feet (MAF) in reservoirs, which may partially offset agriculture output losses caused by floods in the outgoing Kharif season.
“We expect water situation in Rabi season to be normal after many years”, said an official, adding that any shortage “will be minimal, bearable and manageable”. He noted that, after many years, we are also hopeful of having a reasonable carryover into the next Kharif season.
While Tarbela Dam reached its peak conservation level of 1,550 feet last month and has remained there, Mangla Dam is struggling at 1,239.6 feet as of Sunday night against its maximum conservation level of 1,242 feet, as river Jhelum flows remained low throughout the Kharif season.
As a result, Mangla’s storage was reported at 7.1MAF on Sunday night, compared to its maximum storage capacity of 7.277MAF. Officials, however, were not very hopeful about filling Mangla Dam to its capacity, as conservation was building very slowly with only 18,800 cusecs of inflow. Almost half of this (around 9,000 cusecs) was being released to Upper Jhelum Canal for drinking water needs. Mangla would require another 100,000 cusecs to attain maximum conservation, which appeared unlikely in the remaining nine days of the season.
Mangla storage had peaked at 1,233.25 feet at the end of Kharif 2023 and 1,224 feet in 2024. This meant that the country’s largest reservoir could not go beyond 5.9MAF last year, while it has already crossed 7.1MAF this year.
On the other hand, Tarbela Dam peaked to 1,548 feet in 2023 and 1,549 feet in 2024, compared to 1,550 feet this year. Chasma Barrage also attained its peak storage capacity of 649 feet this year, compared to 645 feet in 2023 and 646 feet last year.
As such, total storage has already crossed 13.1MAF, almost 99pc of the peak capacity of 13.3MAF. Last year, the storage had touched 11.388MAF. At present, all rivers are flowing at normal levels, except for medium floods at Kotri Barrage and Ganda Singhwala in the Sutlej River.
Given the reasonable quantities of water still in the irrigation system after the floods, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) has not yet scheduled meetings of its technical and advisory committees, as the provinces have not sought fresh allocations for water discharges.
 
 

Normally, both committees meet in the last week of September when provinces place indents for the first 10 days of Rabi.
Officials, however, cautioned that heavy sand deposits have been reported across farmlands due to the prolonged standing floodwaters in Punjab’s plains — unlike the usual fertile deposits that accompany floods. They said it was too early to predict the condition of agricultural lands until these areas are cleared of standing water.
Meetings of Irsa’s technical and advisory committees will be called once the floodwaters recede. An official said Sindh province usually places indents for Rabi crops, but this has not been the case this year, as it is still dealing with the flood situation.
Around 24MAF of water has already flowed into the sea since the beginning of the Kharif season on April 1 — almost double the combined storage capacity of the two major reservoirs — Tarbela and Mangla.
The total water requirement for Rabi crops, under the Water Apportionment Accord of 1991, is about 37-38MAF with the carryover from Kharif, water availability is expected to be close to 35-36MAF, along with river flows over the next six months.  The 1991 Water Accord empowers Irsa to determine water availability in the country and allocate the provinces’ share twice a year — for Kharif and Rabi seasons. Rabi season runs from Oct 1 to March 31, with wheat being largest crop. Other Rabi crops include gram, lentil, tobacco, rapeseed, barley and mustard.

The UN headquarters, serene in the early morning, turns restless as the day advances.
The plaza outside has become a veritable Hyde Park, with anti-Israel activists rallying daily under the banner ‘Stop Starving Gaza’, while pro-Israel groups stage counter-protests nearby.
Pakistanis and Kashmiris are present too, protesting the possible execution of Yasin Malik. Ukrainians and victims of other conflicts join in, turning the forecourt into a chorus of grievances.
As nearly 150 world leaders gather to mark the UN’s 80th anniversary, the global peace forum finds itself surrounded by protests and engulfed in wars.
 
 

From its inception, the unresolved question of Palestine has haunted the UN, testing both its credibility and its capacity to deliver peace.
The high-level international conference for the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, aims to revive support for a two-state solution.
In a break with convention, the General Assembly has also voted to allow Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to address the event by video link, after the US denied him and his delegation visas to attend the meeting.
Washington has urged countries not to rush into recognizing Palestinian statehood and has warned of visa restrictions on the Palestinian delegation, and President Donald Trump will be closely watched when he addresses the General Assembly on Tuesday.

In the latest round, Mobility startup BusCaro raised $2 million last week, bringing its total funding to $3.5m.
The round was led by UAE-based Daman Investments, with participation from US/Saudi Cartography Capital, New York’s Epic Angest, UK’s Wahed Ventures, the Aga Khan Development Network’s Accelerate Prosperity, and a mix of angel investors.
BusCaro, which offers shared commute services, was born in late 2022 — a time that could not have been less propitious for mobility startups. The world was emerging from the pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war had triggered a global crisis, Pakistan was reeling from floods, and the local mobility sector was collapsing. Airlift and Swvl had folded, and Uber had exited Pakistan. What was once the hottest space had suddenly become a no-go zone.
That’s when Maha Shehzad, former general manager of Swvl, launched BusCaro — putting its first bus on the road just a day after Swvl shut down.
The journey since then has been anything but smooth. Ms Shehzad says she received over 400 rejections before securing the game-changing $160,000 in the first year of operations that set the fledgling startup on its current growth path. Today, BusCaro claims to process more than 900,000 monthly bookings and is on track to hit $8.6m in annual revenue by December. But scaling up has brought its own financial headaches.
The financing conundrum
“Equity financing is the least of my problems — and that’s true for most founders,” says Ms Shehzad. “Working capital is the main bottleneck.”
BusCaro operates an asset-light, tech-first model: it doesn’t own vehicles, operates out of co-working space Collabs, and has no land or collateral to borrow against. Its topline is too large to qualify as a small or medium enterprise, and even if it did, the Rs5m lending cap would be far too little. As a result, BusCaro is forced to turn towards venture for day-to-day financing.
“Startups raise equity to fuel high-octane growth. It’s ridiculous that we need to raise it for working capital,” Ms Shehzad says. Despite being fully incorporated, with a strong credit history, a portfolio of formal clients willing to provide guarantees, and credit lines from major fuel companies such as Total and Parco, BusCaro still struggles to raise financing against its invoices, underscoring the challenges faced by the tech-based private sector.
Getting the model right
So what is BusCaro doing differently, where others with deeper pockets failed?
The steep hike in petroleum prices, the economic downturn, and the drying up of global financing made it impossible to sustain business models like Airlift and Swvl’s, which prized growth over profitability by subsidising services. When the economic tides turned worldwide, venture capitalists were no longer handing out blank cheques for costly customer acquisition; instead, they required startups to prioritise early breakeven over just chasing revenue growth.
However, according to BusCaro, it secured positive unit economics from the outset — in simple terms, each ride cost less to provide than the revenue earned from fares. And while its fares are correlated to fuel prices, a shared commute remains cheaper than a solo ride.
Unlike its predecessors, BusCaro has not subsidised its per-seat fare. This balance was achieved by driving aggregation across two verticals: business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C).
On the B2B side, BusCaro partners with institutions. Sometimes, employers subsidise a percentage of the commute cost as an employee perk; in other cases, BusCaro provides the option of shared transport if enough employees aggregate demand.
For B2B2C, it works with facilitators like housing societies or co-working spaces to pool commuters at pick-up points. This approach slashes customer acquisition costs and creates positive unit economics. With 80 clients onboard, about 60pc of BusCaro’s business comes from B2B, and 40pc from B2B2C, including its parent-facing app.
That app has also opened up a niche market: school commutes. A couple of decades ago, school vans were everywhere; today, parents are left scrambling for reliable options. BusCaro’s app enables parents and schools to track rides in real-time, with manual check-in and check-out options for minors. It’s a problem, Ms Shehzad believes, that has significant potential — not just in Pakistan, but across the GCC, especially for working mothers.
Startup burn
Not that BusCaro is profitable. Currently, it burns about $15,000 a month, with a -2.8 per cent EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortisation] — almost entirely due to additional tech spend. With Ms Shehzad mentioning the 36pc interest rate BusCaro has faced, the debt financing alone would add up to a hefty expense, pushing the bottom line deeper into the red — a problem that eventually led its previous cohort to their exit.
But demand is outpacing supply. “My pipeline is 5x to 6x more than what I can fulfil right now,” Ms Shehzad claims. And the logic seems simple: shared commute outside of public transport will always be the cheapest way to move people. However, for the bottom line to come out of the red, the company will need a topline growth of 28pc.
From non-air-conditioned 80-seater buses to air-conditioned Corollas, BusCaro offers options across price points, with an average blended fare of Rs130 per ride — more economical than most alternatives. It currently operates in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, and nearby cities.
Safety has also been a differentiator, BusCaro claims. With nearly 19m bookings since its inception, BusCaro claims zero reported harassment cases. The nature of shared rides, where 70pc of passengers are women and children, inherently lowers the risk, although the company also vets its drivers.
While speaking to Dawn, Ms Shehzad has a simple piece of advice for startups struggling to raise capital: don’t get caught up in FOMO. “A few years ago, everyone was rushing into fintech. Now it’s AI. Instead, solve the boring problems on the ground — and do it while staying unit positive.”</p><small>2025-09-22 02:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68d07a1d83cff.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943787/thousands-take-to-streets-as-manila-protests-flood-control-fraud' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands take to streets as Manila protests flood control fraud</strong></a><br><p>MANILA: Thousands of Filipinos marched in Manila on Sunday to vent their anger over a ballooning scandal involving bogus flood-control projects believed to have cost taxpayers billions of dollars.
But a day of largely peaceful mass protests erupted into violence as riot police deployed water cannon in clashes with scores of mostly young masked people who hurled rocks and shattered the glass of one police outpost.
Police arrested 72 people — including 20 minors — in two separate incidents that saw at least 39 officers injured and a trailer that was being used as a barricade set ablaze, according to a spokeswoman.
Major Hazel Asilo told AFP it was unclear if those arrested were “protesters or just people who are causing trouble”.

Trailer set on fire; 72 arrested, 39 injured in violent clashes

Rage over the so-called ghost infrastructure projects has been mounting in the Southeast Asian country since President Ferdinand Marcos put them centre stage in a July state of the nation address that followed weeks of deadly flooding.
Marcos said early last week he did not blame people for protesting “one bit”.
 
 

Sunday in the capital began without violence with a morning demonstration at a park that drew nearly 50,000 people, according to city estimates.
Thousands more joined an afternoon rally at the capital’s EDSA thoroughfare, ground zero for the 1986 movement that ousted Marcos’s dictator father.
‘This is enough’
“It’s very rare for me to go to rallies, but this situation was bad enough that I was really urged to say ‘this is enough’,” Mitzi Bajet, a 30-year-old designer said at the EDSA protest.
Teddy Casino, 56, chairman of left-wing alliance Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, said his group was demanding not only the return of stolen funds, but also prison time for those involved.
“Corruption requires people to go to the streets and express their outrage in the hope of pressuring government to actually do their jobs,” he said.
Billions lost
The Department of Finance has estimated the Philippine economy lost up to 118.5 billion pesos ($2 billion) from 2023 to 2025 due to corruption in flood control projects.
Greenpeace has suggested the nu­m­ber is actually closer to $18 billion.
Earlier this month, the owners of a construction firm accused nearly 30 House members and Department of Public Works and Highways officials of taking cash payments.
The scandal has already sparked leadership changes in both houses of Congress, with House speaker Martin Romualdez, a cousin of Marcos, tendering his resignation earlier this week.
On Sunday, multiple politicians were among those taking part in the EDSA protest, an event supported by the powerful Catholic Church that drew numerous families.

“The mother, the boy, the girl, and the baby in her womb — we found them all gone,” said Mosallam Al-Hadad, the dead woman’s father-in-law, saying his son had been seriously injured in the strike. “(He) was in a critical condition. We took him to the hospital, and his leg was amputated,” Hadad said.
Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 65,283 people and wounded 166,575 since October 2023. Thousands more are believed to be buried under the rubble. The strikes on besieged Palestinian territory also caused famine and displaced the territory’s population — in many cases multiple times.
On Sunday, a number of Pales­tinians were attacked by Israeli settlers in a village south of Hebron in the occupied West Bank, according to Al Jazeera Arabic, quoting local sources. The assault took place in the area of Khirbet Haribat al-Nabi in Masafer Yatta, a collection of Pale­stinian villages that have repeatedly been subjected to settler violence.

Senior doctor rejects Israeli military’s claim about Hamas sniper, saying his brother was visually impaired

Just a day ago, nearly 90 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes across the territory, most of them in Gaza City.
Hamas sniper?
The Israeli military claimed on Sunday it had killed a Hamas sniper in a strike the day before, but a senior Gaza doctor who is the man’s brother rejected the claim as “a lie and slander”, saying his sibling was visually impaired.
Mohammed Abu Salmiya, director of Gaza’s Al-Shifa Hospital, had been working in the emergency department on Saturday when his brother and sister-in-law’s bodies were brought in, telling AFP at the time that they were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza City. He rejected the Israeli military’s accusation about Hamas sniper as “a lie, slander and an unacceptable justification for targeting civilians with direct missile strikes”.
“My brother is a 57-year-old man who suffers from several illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes, and he has severe vision impairment — and they claim he was a sniper? This is pure fabrication,” he told AFP, noting his brother’s family had been displaced several times over the past two years.
In recent weeks, the Israeli military has launched a heavy air and ground assault on Gaza City, claiming that it was an effort aimed at eliminating Hamas from the territory’s largest urban hub.
 
 

On Sunday, witnesses said Israeli tanks were advancing towards the west through Tel Al-Hawa, a southeastern suburb.
The Israeli military estimates that over 450,000 people have left the city since the start of September. Hamas authorities dispute this, saying under 300,000 left and that nearly a million people remain des­pite ongoing shelling. The offensive has also alarmed many Israelis, as thousands rallied on Saturday night outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s official residence in Jerusalem, calling on him to end the war.

• Responsibility for Pakistan, Afghanistan shifted to WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region
• Report terms Pakistan’s claims of progress from 2021-23 ‘likely by-product of Covid prevention measures’
ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan reports 26 new polio cases this year, the global polio monitoring board has issued a stark warning that efforts to eradicate the disease are failing.
After 37 years and $22 billion invested, the world has reached an “inflection point” where, traditional methods offer diminishing returns, the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB) on polio said in its latest report.
The ‘glass mountain’ of polio eradication has proven unclimbable through conventional methods, it says, calling for fresh thinking and unambiguous country ownership to achieve success.
In a letter to World Health Organisation Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, IMB Chair­man Sir Liam Donaldson said the report, titled ‘The Glass Mountain’ arrives at a critical juncture.
“The confluence of persistent viral transmission, unprecedented geopolitical disruption, and severe financial constraints has created conditions that fundamentally challenge the programme’s survival and success,” Mr Donaldson wrote.
He noted that early optimism in 2023 has been replaced by the “stark reality of resurgence,” as historical reservoirs of the virus — a reference to Pakistan and Afghanistan — have been reinfected.
The IMB, which works on behalf of international donor agencies, said that fresh thinking, institutional courage, strategic realism, and unambiguous country ownership were the only paths to success.
The board identified several “systemic intractable weaknesses” hobbling the programme, including “performance-blind funding mechanisms that provide resources regardless of outcomes; fragmented integration approaches that fail to leverage synergies with essential immunisation; lack of country ownership and transactional behaviour; and accountability systems that generate reports rather than consequences.”
To address these deep-rooted issues, a fundamental shift in strategy and accountability is proposed.
 
 

The IMB has suggested moving responsibility for stopping wild poliovirus in Pakistan and Afghanistan to the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Regional (EMRO) Ministerial Polio Subcommittee.
This, Mr Donaldson argued, could combat the persistent “perception that polio eradication is something ‘the West wants’ rather than a regional priority,” potentially reducing community hostility, boycotts, and security threats that have resulted in the deaths of polio workers and police officers, especially in Pakistan.
This proposal has now been formalised, as the polio oversight board adopted the 2026 GPEI Action Plan on Sunday.
In a post on X, Hanan Balkhy, the regional director for WHO-EMRO said the coming low transmission season offers the best chance to stop wild poliovirus in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Mr Donaldson’s letter also pointed to a dramatically altered geopolitical landscape, citing major disruptions to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.
“The United States withdrawal from WHO, the dismantling of USAID, and the severe curtailment of CDC’s global health mandate represent the most significant disruption in GPEI history,” Sir Donaldson stated.
It also noted that since the report was finalised, there had been two serious monsoon-related floods in  different parts of Pakistan, an earthquake in Afghanistan, a child malnutrition crisis in  Borneo and a potential peace settlement in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, which have changed the operating landscape for polio.
Pakistan’s claims challenged
The report also challenges Pakistan’s recent claims of progress. While Islamabad asserts it had interrupted polio transmission from 2021 to 2023, the IMB said this was likely an inadvertent result of Covid restrictions, that were “hostile to poliovirus spread”, rather than an outcome of programmatic improvements.
The operating environment for polio is constantly shifting. After the IMB meeting and as  the report was being finalised, there were: two serious monsoon-related floods in  different parts of Pakistan, an earthquake in Afghanistan, a child malnutrition crisis in  Borno and a potential peace settlement in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
A Pakistani polio expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, agreed with the IMB’s assessment, highlighting an absence of accountability, innovation, and integration.
“Interestingly, as usual, government’s ownership despite PM’s intense engagement has been questioned,” the expert said. “This IMB report questions the money and time spent against the targets and in midst of virus circulation and resurfacing has questions the viability of the program.”
As a solution, the expert suggested “shifting the management and ownership in real sense to the government, restructuring the program, integrating with EPI and holding the chronic poor performers to account at the high level can address the issues”.

• NHA says four of six lanes damaged but denies complete washout
• NDMA reports 1,006 deaths; over 3m rescued in flood-hit areas
• Millions displaced, infrastructure in ruins
LAHORE: The Sutlej River continued to maintain a med­ium-level flood at Ganda Singh Wala and Sulemanki headworks on Sunday, with authorities monitoring its steady rise as waters inundated areas across Lodhran, Multan and Bahawalpur districts.
According to a Provincial Disaster Management Auth­ority (PDMA) report, the river flowed at 95,000 cusecs at Ganda Singh Wala and 82,000 cusecs at Sulemanki, with the latter volume expected to reach Jalalpur Pirwala within the next day or two, potentially raising water levels further in already affected regions.
Meanwhile, flood levels in the Chenab and Ravi rivers were reported as normal, with key readings showing 43,000 cusecs at Marala, 38,000 cusecs at Khanki Headworks, and 37,000 cusecs at Qadirabad on the Chenab, while the Ravi recorded flows of 7,000 cusecs at Jassar, 9,000 cusecs at Shahdara, and 28,000 cusecs at Head Sidhnai.
The Sutlej River water has been continuously rising since Sunday morning and inundating the flood-affected areas in Lodhran, Multan and Bahawalpur.
The water is passing from three to four breaches on the Noraja Bhutta embankment and rising around the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M5) from Jhangra in the Bahawalpur district to Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil in the Multan district.
As the water level started receding in the Chenab River, the people from the western side of Jalalpur Pirwala had started returning to their villages.
In Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district, the government was making efforts to fill the breaches on dykes and roads damaged by floods. A temporary bridge was constructed at Seetpur Road and opened for the public in Alipur. Repair work was also started to fill dykes in Kul Kanwal, Khairpur Saadat, basti Azeem Shah and Sultanpur-Khairpur Road.
 
 

The M5 motorway remained closed for a ninth consecutive day due to flood damage at six locations, with motorway police implementing diversions at Shah Shams and Uch Sharif interchanges.
Motorway police spokesperson confirmed that the M5 in Multan would remain closed for now due to flood-related damage.
He said that floodwaters have affected the motorway at six different locations and authorities were actively working to prevent further damage by filling cracks with stones.
National Highways and Motorway Police said traffic from Multan to Sukkur was being diverted from Shah Shams Interchange to G.T. Road, with re-entry at Uch Sharif, while vehicles from Sukkur to Multan were diverted from Uch Sharif to G.T. Road and allowed to rejoin at Sher Shah Interchange.
NHA General Manager Kashif Nawaz told Dawn that four of six lanes had been damaged at some points but denied reports of a complete washout. “Some interchanges are still underwater and traffic cannot be allowed until safety is ensured,” he added.
Multan Commissioner Amir Karim Khan inspected the old flood embankments of Jalalpur Pirwala and the affected motorway section, declaring the old embankments safe. At Noraja Bhutta, he identified four breaches and directed the Irrigation Department to expedite repairs to prevent ponding along the motorway.
The commissioner also visited relief camps, met affected families and instructed departments to improve facilities. He confirmed that floods had disrupted repair work on a damaged Sui gas pipeline.
The Multan district administration said emergency repairs of flood-hit roads and electricity infrastructure had begun.
Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said heavy machinery and special teams had been deployed to assess damages, restore link roads and drain water. A door-to-door survey would soon begin in affected areas, while medical teams were conducting disinfection and health interventions.
Punjab Irrigation Minister Kazim Hussain Pirzada said the government was taking all measures to protect Jalalpur Pirwala, with technical committees monitoring embankments.
Punjab Agriculture Sec­retary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo visited relief camps to review arrangements for livestock feed and urged owners to move cattle to dry areas, provide clean water and seek veterinary care.
Over 3m rescued
The National Disaster Mana­ge­ment Authority (NDMA) said on Sunday that more than 3.02 million people have been rescued in nearly 5,800 operations since June 26.
According to the latest figures, 3,020,130 individuals have been evacuated in 5,768 rescue operations carried out with the coordinated efforts of the NDMA, provincial authorities, the Pakistan Army and other agencies.
Punjab accounted for the largest share with 2.81m rescues in 4,749 operations, followed by Sindh with 184,011 in 753 operations. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 14,317 rescues, Gilgit-Baltistan 1,027, Azad Jammu and Kashmir 940, Islamabad 49, and Balochistan 19.
The NDMA said that at least 1,006 people lost their lives due to torrential rains and flash flooding, including 275 children, 568 men and 163 women.
KP recorded the highest number of fatalities with 504 deaths, while Punjab reported 304, Sindh 80, Balochistan 30, Gilgit-Baltistan 41, AJK 38 and Islamabad nine.
Another 1,063 people have been injured nationwide, among them 321 children, 450 men and 292 women. Punjab again bore the heaviest toll with 661 injured, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 218 and Sindh with 87.
The NDMA said 273,524 relief items have been distributed so far, including tents, blankets, ration bags, food packs, hygiene kits and safe drinking water. Additional supplies such as solar panels, de-watering pumps and generators have also been provided.
Since June 26, authorities have established 1,690 relief and medical camps in flood-hit areas. Of these, 741 medical camps have treated 662,098 patients, while 949 relief camps have provided shelter and services to 152,252 people.
The floods have destroyed or damaged 12,569 homes, killed 6,509 livestock and left communities struggling with displacement and shortages of essential resources.
Infrastructure losses include 239 bridges and nearly 2,000 kilometres of roads. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa suffered the worst damage with 52 bridges and 437km of roads lost, followed by AJK with 94 bridges and 201km of roads damaged.
Gilgit-Baltistan repor­ted damage to 87 bridges, Balochistan three, and Islamabad three. Sindh recorded no bridge damage but reported losses to seven kilometres of roads. The Islamabad Capital Territory also experienced damage to three bridges.

Twelve people have died in the past 24 hours while 740 new patients have been hospitalised with the mosquito-borne disease, the directorate general of health services said on Sunday. 
Dengue has killed at least 179 people and infected nearly 42,000 nationwide so far this year.
Children are increasingly crowding into hospital wards, many arriving with high fever, rashes, and dehydration. Some develop severe complications.

Changing weather patterns are worsening the outbreak, entomologists say

Entomologists say changing weather patterns are worsening the outbreak. The monsoon is stretching longer than usual, creating standing water almost everywhere, said Kabirul Bashar, a zoology professor at Jahangirnagar University. “This prolonged wet season is giving mosquitoes more time and space to breed, and it is intensifying the outbreak.”
Bangladesh’s rapid urbanisation, poor waste management, and stagnant water at construction sites have further expanded mosquito breeding grounds.
With hospitals under strain and infections climbing steadily, doctors fear the crisis will deepen in the coming weeks.
Children are more vulnerable to rapid fluid loss and shock, which makes severe dengue extremely dangerous for them, said physician ABM Abdullah, urging parents not to ignore early symptoms like a persistent fever or bleeding gums.
The worst year on record for Bangladesh was 2023, when dengue killed 1,705 people and infected more than 321,000. 
Experts fear that without stro­nger preventive measures such dea­dly cycles will continue.

We hope against hope when our team takes on India. Before the first ball is bowled, we tend to somehow forgo a few harsh realities and the reality that underlines all of them; India are way better.
“Farq hai yaar (there’s a difference),” as my colleague put it right after Tilak Varma clattered Shaheen Afridi past deep square-leg for a four to wrap things up. “It’s a gulf in fact, a huge gulf of quality,” he concluded.
His short analysis summed up Sunday’s Super Four fixture, which India comfortably won by six wickets with seven balls to spare. Pakistan genuinely came back stronger, impressing with the bat early on, but the “gulf” glared the brightest when Indian openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill were at the crease.
Indispensable Abhishek, Gill
With their opening partnership of 105 off 59, Gill and Abhishek — the two friends from the Indian Punjab — set the match aside for India, neutralising Faheem Ashraf and Haris Rauf’s decent show with the ball that came later on.

The openers’ ability to play the field made Pakistan’s bowlers look ordinary in the first half of India’s chase as they once again put on display their wide range of shots.
 
 

When Pakistan bowled even slightly short, Abhishek and Gill jumped back into their respective creases and bashed away through the leg-side and square through the off-side.
When the Pakistan bowlers pushed it fuller, the duo would use their powerful wrists to clear the boundary.
It wasn’t all about power for Gill and Abhishek; they had enough presence of mind to find gaps with pure timing and placement. Applying that kind of world-class skill, they combined to hit 14 fours and five sixes — all of the maximums hit by Abhishek.
Spinners fold under pressure
While the pitch didn’t offer much to the fast bowlers with the new ball, it had enough for the spinners in it, and taking nothing away from Gill and Abhishek, Pakistan spinners Saim Ayub and Abrar Ahmed were poor.
They were clueless against the Indian openers, failing to find the right lines and lengths on a consistent basis, bowling too short or too full and lacking in pace variation good enough to pose any threat to the batters.
Abrar.  who came into the match with an economy rate of less than four in the Asia Cup, gave away 10.50 an over on Sunday – a total of 42 runs in his four overs. Saim — more of a part-timer — on the other hand, had the opportunity to add to his better show with the bat earlier, but leaked a mammoth 35 in these three overs.
By the time Abrar and Saim were pulled out of the attack, India had completed more than half of the job.
Middle-order blunders
Despite getting more than a decent start as Pakistan cruised at 91-1 — thanks to Sahibzada Farhan’s fifty and impressive contributions by Fakhar Zaman and Saim — Pakistan struggled massively to continue the momentum from early on. Why though?
A middle-order incapable of attacking stroke play. The national side before this match had gone with Hasan Nawaz as their only middle-order pinch hitter — yes, his form, like all his colleagues, wasn’t the best — but replacing him with Hussain Talat, a totally different breed of a batter — was a highly questionable move from the Pakistan team management.
 






The left-hander returned a paltry 10 off 11, and the decision to send Mohammad Nawaz and himself over the likes of Mohammad Haris and Faheem — who have much more of the ability to go big — was criminal by Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha in a period when Indian medium-pacer Shivam Dube flourished.
Nawaz, who seemed completely at sea in front of the Indian spinners, was stuck in his crease, absolutely failing to use his feet, and added 21 off 19.
Salman, meanwhile, avoiding strike in the last over, proving critics right over his place in the Pakistan T20 side, scored 17 off 13.
Confident top-three
Pakistan’s start was refreshing. The side’s openers came into the match with a bad-boy attitude, a kind of naughtiness in their demeanour and smartness to back it up with.
Sahibzada and Fakhar were getting under the skins of Indian stalwarts Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya — at times exchanging words with them on the pitch.

After being dropped by Abhishek at third-man off Pandya, Sahibzada responded with bravery, seeing off Bumrah’s pinpoint Yorkers with equal amounts of precision and forcing the bowler to miss out on the right lengths as the right-hander from Peshawar posted a 38-ball 50.
His hits were clean and oozed with confidence as Fakhar also manipulated the Indian bowlers’ minds on the other end. Had it not been for a clearly wrong decision that went against his way, the seasoned southpaw may have made it slightly more difficult for India to continue their dominance over Pakistan.
Saim, who had started the Asia Cup with three ducks, meanwhile, improved from his past performances to hit 21 off 17 — that straight hit for six off Kuldeep Yadav — underlining his potential. But the left-hander’s contribution came only after he was dropped by Kuldeep when he had only single figures against his name.
Haris, Faheem impress with the ball

Apart from the openers, only Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf came up with a fight. Haris, in fact, was continually in the face of the Indian batters despite his team being on the back foot in the context of the match. He backed his aggression up with fiery pace bowling as well, destroying the stumps of Sanju Samson and getting the Indian skipper out for his two wickets and gave away a mere 26 runs in his four overs.
Faheem, meanwhile, gave away 31, but still caused problems for the Indian batters — although that came about too late for Pakistan — especially producing a peach of a delivery to clean up Gill through the gate.
More of that, and at the right time, is required if Pakistan are to make it to the finals. And against Sri Lanka on Tuesday, Salman and co have to prove that they are at least capable of beating decent sides in the world if not the best like that of India.

State television said Sharaa was en route “to the United States of America to participate in the affairs of the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York”, citing a presidency statement.
 
 

Sharaa seized power in December after his rebel group led a lightning offensive that toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad after nearly 14 years of civil war and more than half a century of brutal family rule. He is set to speak at the UN General Assembly in New York, the first Syrian leader to do so since Nureddin al-Atassi in 1967.
Sharaa has undergone a dramatic transformation since taking power, meeting foreign leaders such as US President Donald Trump in Riyadh and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on his first trip to the West.
In a pre-recorded interview broadcast on Sunday, Sharaa told US broadcaster CBS that “President Trump took a big step towards Syria by lifting the sanctions with a quick, courageous and historic decision”.
“He recognised that Syria should be safe, stable and unified.” Trump lifted most US sanctions on Syria, which date back to the Syrian war and earlier, in the spring.
Sharaa added that anyone seeking to maintain sanctions on Syria would be “would be complicit in killing the Syrian people once again”.
 


He moreover criticised the international community for failing to halt the brutalities committed by Assad’s government.
He said, “We should be the ones asking others: why did you stand silent as these terrible crimes were taking place in Syria?”
Syria-Israel talks
The Syrian leader remains under UN sanctions and a travel ban due to his past and must request exemptions for all foreign trips. His foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani, is already in Washington for an official visit.
Shaibani’s office said he held a series of meetings since his arrival, including with US senators and state department officials.
He also met with the US Commission on International Religious Freedom, as the international community presses Syria’s new authorities to protect minorities in the multi-confessional country, which has seen sectarian bloodshed in recent months.
A foreign ministry official had said Shaibani aimed to discuss ongoing negotiations with Israel and the lifting of the remaining US sanctions on Syria.
Syria and Israel remain technically at war, but opened direct negotiations after Assad’s overthrow, and Syrian and Israeli officials have met on several occasions.
The foreign ministry official had said Syria expected to finalise security and military agreements with Israel this year, in what would be a breakthrough.
Israel has demanded a demilitarised zone in southern Syria.
Last week, Sharaa said Syria was negotiating with Israel to reach a security agreement that would see Israel leave the areas it had occupied in recent months.

Meanwhile, Syria is set to hold the selection process for a transitional parliament on October 5, in accordance with a constitutional declaration announced earlier this year, the electoral commission said today.
The People’s Assembly of Syria was dissolved by Sharaa and the upcoming legislature, which will serve for a five-year transitional period, will comprise 210 lawmakers.
Of these, 140 will be designated by local committees supervised by the electoral commission and 70 will be directly nominated by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.
The process will be held on October 5, “in the electoral districts of Syria’s provinces”, the commission wrote on its Telegram channel. It did not specify if all provinces would take part.
In late August, the government announced that the selection would be delayed in the Druze-majority province of Sweida — the site of deadly clashes in July — and in the Kurdish-held regions of Raqa and Hasakeh, due to the security and political situation.
The system for appointing the interim parliament has been a target of major criticism by the opposition and civil society groups, which have denounced the concentration of powers in the president’s hands and insufficient representation of the country’s ethnic and religious minorities.
According to the constitutional declaration adopted in March, the transitional parliament will have a renewable mandate of 30 months. It will exercise its role until a permanent constitution is adopted and new elections are held.</p><small>2025-09-21 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624870-ziarat-assistant-commissioner-son-killed-a-month-after-abduction' target='_blank'><strong>Ziarat assistant commissioner, son 'killed a month after abduction'</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement from his office, CM Bugti said that the killing could not be condemned enough and hailed Baqi as a “dutiful, hardworking and capable officer who discharged his responsibilities with honesty and integrity”.
“The martyred Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Afzal sacrificed his life while fulfilling his responsibilities and will live on in the hearts of the people,” the statement read.
While paying tribute to the martyred AC and his son, he said that their deaths would not be in vain.
“[The CM] made it clear that the killers of innocent people and enemies of peace will never be able to escape their fate,” the statement read. “The sacrifices of the martyrs are a beacon [of] light in the journey of establishing peace and stability in Balochistan.”
The AC and his son were kidnapped in August by armed suspects while on a picnic in the Zezri area, Ziarat Deputy Commissioner Zakaullah Durrani said.
According to Durrani, Baqi and his son were taken to an unknown location after the suspects stopped the vehicle at gunpoint and ordered everyone to abandon it before setting it on fire. They released Afzal’s gunman, driver and other family members but forced the official and his son to go with them.
The DC said on August 13 that a search operation by security forces was active in the area for to recover AC Baqi and his son and that elders from different tribes were also contacted to use their influence to get the officer released.
According to Durrani, no organisation or group claimed responsibility. The local administration had announced a Rs50 million reward for providing information about the whereabouts of the kidnappers.</p><small>2025-09-21 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/212051007d8361f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943699/trump-vows-to-defend-poland-baltic-states-if-russia-escalates' target='_blank'><strong>Trump vows to defend Poland, Baltic states if Russia escalates</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Sunday said he would defend Poland and the Baltic states in case of an escalation from Russia, following Moscow’s incursion into Estonia’s airspace.
Asked whether he would help defend the EU members if Russia intensifies hostilities, Trump told reporters: “Yeah, I would. I would.” Estonia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Monday following Friday’s incursion.
Three Russian MiG-31 fighters violated Estonian airspace over the Gulf of Finland, triggering complaints of a dangerous new provocation from the European Union and Nato, but a denial from Moscow.
Italian F-35 fighters attached to Nato’s air defence support mission in the Baltic states, along with Swedish and Finnish aircraft, were scrambled to intercept the Russian jets and warn them off.
Asked whether he had been briefed on the situation in Estonia, Trump answered in the affirmative and added: “We don’t like it.” His statement came about two weeks after some 17 Russian drones violated Polish airspace, in an incident that Trump then sought to downplay.
“It could have been a mistake,” Trump told journalists on September 11.</p><small>2025-09-21 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/21192114d0a2b4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943686/uk-australia-and-canada-formally-recognise-palestinian-state' target='_blank'><strong>UK, Australia and Canada formally recognise Palestinian state</strong></a><br><p>Britain, Australia and Canada on Sunday recognised a Palestinian state in a seismic shift in decades of Western foreign policy, triggering swift Israeli anger.
Portugal was also to recognise Palestinian statehood later on Sunday, as Israel came under huge international pressure over the conflict in Gaza triggered almost two years ago by the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack.
“Today, to revive the hope of peace for the Palestinians and Israelis, and a two-state solution, the United Kingdom formally recognises the State of Palestine,” UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a message on X.
 






Britain and Canada became the first G7 countries to take the step, with France and other nations expected to follow at the annual UN General Assembly, which opens Monday in New York.
“Canada recognises the State of Palestine and offers our partnership in building the promise of a peaceful future for both the State of Palestine and the State of Israel,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote on X.
 






Meanwhile, Australia announced it “formally recognises the independent and sovereign State of Palestine”, according to a post on X by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.
“In doing so, Australia recognises the legitimate and long-held aspirations of the people of Palestine to a state of their own,” Albanese said in a statement as his country joined other major Western nations in increasing pressure on Israel to end the conflict in Gaza.
“Today’s act of recognition reflects Australia’s longstanding commitment to a two-state solution, which has always been the only path to enduring peace and security for the Israeli and the Palestinian peoples.”
 






It is a watershed moment for Palestinians and their decades-long ambitions for statehood, with the most powerful Western nations having long argued it should only come as part of a negotiated peace deal with Israel.
 
 

Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said that Britain, Canada and Australia’s recognition of a Palestinian state was a necessary step toward lasting peace in the region.
Welcoming the move by the three countries, Abbas said, “It constitutes an important and necessary step toward achieving a just and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy,” according to a statement by his office.
Abbas also called for a ceasefire in Gaza.
“He emphasised that today’s priorities are achieving a ceasefire, allowing humanitarian aid to enter, securing the release of all hostages and prisoners, ensuring Israel’s complete withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, enabling the State of Palestine to assume full responsibilities, advancing recovery and reconstruction and halting settlement activity and settler violence, “the statement added.
A senior Hamas official hailed the three nations’ recognition of a Palestinian state, describing it as a victory for the rights of Palestinians.
“These developments represent a victory for Palestinian rights and the justice of our cause, and send a clear message: no matter how far the occupation goes in its crimes, it will never be able to erase our national rights,” Mahmud Mardawi told AFP.
But the move puts those countries at odds with the United States and Israel, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacting angrily and vowing to oppose it at the UN talks.
Calls for a Palestinian state “would endanger our existence and serve as [an] absurd reward for terrorism,” Netanyahu said on Sunday.
A growing number of longtime allies have shifted positions, as Israel has intensified its Gaza offensive, vowing to eliminate Hamas.
The Gaza Strip has suffered vast destruction, a spiralling death toll and a lack of food that has sparked a major humanitarian crisis since the start of the conflict, which has drawn an international outcry.
‘Special burden’
The UK government has come under increasing public pressure to act, with thousands rallying every month on the streets. A poll released by YouGov on Friday showed two-thirds of young Britons aged 18-25 supported Palestinian statehood.
Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy acknowledged at the UN in July that “Britain bears a special burden of responsibility to support the two-state solution”.
Over a century ago, the UK was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the creation of the state of Israel through the 1917 Balfour Declaration.
Three-quarters of UN members already recognise Palestinian statehood, with over 140 of the 193 having taken the step.
Starmer said in July that his Labour government intended to recognise a Palestinian State unless Israel took “substantive” steps, including reaching a ceasefire in Gaza, getting more aid into the territory and confirming it would not annex the West Bank.
 
 

Starmer has also repeatedly called on Hamas to release the remaining hostages they captured in the 2023 attack, and is expected to set out new sanctions on the Palestinian group.
Lammy told the BBC on Sunday that the Palestinian Authority — the civilian body that governs in areas of the West Bank — had been calling for the move for some time, “and I think a lot of that is wrapped up in hope”.
“Will this feed children? No, it won’t, that’s down to humanitarian aid. Will this free hostages? That must be down to a ceasefire.” But he said it was an attempt to “hold out for” a two-state solution.
Palestinian foreign minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin told AFP last week: “Recognition is not symbolic. It sends a very clear message to the Israelis on their illusions on continuing their occupation forever,” she said.
‘Worrying evolution’
Hamas’s 2023 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures.
Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 65,208 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.
Portugal said that it would also formally declare its recognition in New York on Sunday.
“By acting now, as the Portuguese government has decided, we’re keeping alive the possibility of having two states,” Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said.</p><small>2025-09-21 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/21114533f788db8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943645/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-meeting-of-select-muslim-leaders-with-us-president-trump-in-new-york-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend meeting of ‘select’ Muslim leaders with US President Trump in New York: FO</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will be among the attendees of a meeting of “select” Muslim leaders with US President Donald Trump in the coming week on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) session in New York, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Sunday.
“The prime minister will also participate in a meeting of select Islamic leaders with US President Trump to exchange views on issues pertaining to regional and international peace and security,” a statement issued by the FO said.
 






The meeting of Muslim leaders with Trump could be the first instance of PM Shehbaz directly interacting with the US president since the latter assumed the top office in his country in January. Earlier, he met Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal General Syed Asim Munir in June, marking the first time a US president has hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House unaccompanied by senior civilian officials.
On his visit to New York, the PM would be leading Pakistan’s delegation to the “high-level segment” of the UNGA from 22 September 2025, the FO said, adding that he would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other ministers and senior officials.
At the UNGA session, PM Shehbaz “will urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination,” particularly in India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine.
“He will draw attention of the international community towards the grave crisis in Gaza and call for decisive action to end the suffering of the Palestinian people,” the FO stated.
“He will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development.”
The FO, in its statement, said PM Shehbaz would attend several “high-level events” on the sidelines of the UNGA session, including important meetings of the UN Security Council, a high-level Meeting of the Global Development Initiative (GDI), and a special high-level event on Climate Action, among others.
Further, during his visit, he will meet several world leaders and senior UN officials to exchange views on issues of mutual interest.
“He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN member states to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council,” the FO added.
FO highlighted that the PM’s participation in “this biggest annual gathering of global leaders” would showcase Pakistan’s “strong commitment to multilateralism and the United Nations”. It would also reaffirm “Pakistan’s longstanding contribution towards the shared objectives of peace and development,” it said.
Trump’s upcoming meeting with Muslim leaders, including PM Shehbaz, follows significant developments in the Middle East.
Earlier this month, Israel, a US ally, targeted top Hamas officials in Doha, Qatar, killing five of the group’s members and a Qatari security officer.
The attack drew widespread international condemnation, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, which is also an ally of Qatar.
Subsequently, Arab and Muslim leaders called for a review of ties with Israel at an emergency Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation joint session held in the Qatari capital. The event was co-sponsored by Pakistan. A joint statement from the summit also urged “all states to take all possible legal and effective measures to prevent Israel from continuing its actions against the Palestinian people”.
For his part, Trump — who had a dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York following the Israeli attack in Qatar — made careful remarks before the Arab gathering as Washington’s two powerful Middle Eastern allies faced a worsening rift.
The US president had initially rebuked Israel over the attack, saying he was “very unhappy” about it. However, later US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.
Some analysts are of the view that Israeli aggression against Qatar has cast a shadow on US credibility in the Middle East as Arab nations look elsewhere for protection from Israel.
This week, PM Shehbaz and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.</p><small>2025-09-21 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/21164031f37648f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943671/three-afghans-among-seven-terrorists-killed-in-di-khan-operation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Three ‘Afghans’ among seven terrorists killed in DI Khan operation: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Seven terrorists were killed, including three “Afghan nationals”, by security forces during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan district, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the operation was carried out in the Kulachi area upon the presence of “khawarij”.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and [as a result], seven Indian sponsored khwarij, including three Afghan National khwarij and two suicide bombers, were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.
The statement added that Pakistan expects the interim Afghan government, run by the Afghan Taliban, to uphold its responsibilities and deny the use of its soil to carry out acts of terror.
Relations between Islamabad and Kabul have soured over the use of the latter’s territory to stage attacks. Earlier this week, Pakistan warned the UN Security Council that terrorist groups operating from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan pose the gravest threat to its national security. Kabul denies the allegations.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
 






Earlier this week, security forces killed 31 terrorists in two separate IBOs in KP’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, the military’s media wing said on Monday.
“On 13-14 September, 31 khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in [the] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the ISPR said in a press release.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.</p><small>2025-09-21 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/211744439207e34.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943679/afghan-govt-spokesperson-says-leaders-shouldnt-make-provocative-statements-stresses-need-for-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan govt spokesperson says leaders shouldn’t make ‘provocative’ statements, stresses need for talks</strong></a><br><p>The spokesperson for the Taliban government in Afghanistan Zabiullah Mujahid has said that leaders should refrain from making “provocative” statements and that his country could not be held responsible for attacks taking place in Pakistan.
Mujahid’s remarks come as Pakistan continues to raise alarm over terrorist outfits, particularly the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), using Afghan soil to carry out attacks across the border. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to choose between maintaining ties with its neighbour or harbouring terrorists, but Afghan authorities have consistently denied the allegations.
He made these remarks during an interview with Imtiaz Gul, the executive director of Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies. According to Gul, the interview — conducted in the Pushto language — was recorded during his recent visit to Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
 


During the interview, Gul sought proposals from Mujahid to address recurring problems, such as the issue of TTP or “the negative propaganda in the media that harms and poisons the relations” between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The spokesperson was also asked whether he felt the need for some sort of “joint mechanism” on such matters.
In his response, Mujahid emphasised that leaders should avoid making “provocative” statements. If statements having “threatening” undertones were issued, “we cannot stop” others, he asserted. The Taliban government spokesperson went on to say that “giving statements to the media, spoiling the environment and taking military action is unwise”.
Instead, he stressed that talks should be held. “There should be more visits, which would create trust on both sides,” Mujahid added.
He said his government was “unhappy with the current environment and propaganda that was happening presently” as it was not in the interest of either Pakistan or Afghanistan.
Mujahid also highlighted that attacks by militants and terrorists in Pakistan were not a recent occurrence. “It has been happening since 2003.”
“Then Pakistan should take steps to foil such attacks”, he said. “Islamabad should also share information with Kabul so that we can make efforts to counter these threats as well.”
But, at the same time, Mujahid added that Afghanistan could not be held responsible for bomb blasts in Bannu or any other area of Pakistan.
“Pakistan should ensure its own security,” he asserted, further recommending that Islamabad and Kabul should engage in talks to discuss the reasons behind the issue of terrorism.
“You should take us into confidence if you believe that you face threats from [an entity] in Afghanistan.”
Mujahid’s remarks follow a recent statement by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in which he issued a stern message to Kabul, saying that Afghanistan must decide whether it stands with Pakistan or the TTP. The premier’s statement had come after he attended the funeral of 12 soldiers in Bannu, who were martyred during an exchange of fire with terrorists in  South Waziristan.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan, along with frequent border skirmishes, has long strained ties between the two countries, with Islamabad repeatedly urging the interim Afghan government to stop allowing its territory to be used for attacks.
Gul also raised this issue during his conversation with Mujahid with respect to the strained ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“Pakistan seems to have drawn a red line as far as the TTP’s presence in Afghanistan is concerned,” Gul said, adding that this was seen as the main reason for growing tensions between the two countries. Gul asked Mujahid whether he agreed with this.
Mujahid, however, clearly stated that the TTP was Pakistan’s “internal issue”.
“Pakistan should find a solution to this problem,” he said, adding that Islamabad should not spoil its ties with Kabul over this matter.
He also assured that Afghanistan was making efforts to make sure that “no one uses its soil against any other country”.
“No armed person can go to Pakistan from Afghanistan […] The terrain in some areas is difficult, and some people may be able to take advantage of it.
“We should find a solution to this problem through negotiations and Afghanistan should not be blamed for it […] We do not want fighting, bloodshed and difficulties in Pakistan.”
Earlier in the interview, when asked what messages he and the Islamic Emirate had for those in Pakistan, he said he wanted to convey to leaders and officials that “Afghanistan wanted brotherly ties and that any issues between the two countries should be resolved through negotiations”.
“Levelling allegations and making threats spoil the environment, which further complicates matters,” he said.  The spokesperson also called for reforms in policy and urged religious scholars in Pakistan to play a role in maintaining good ties between the two countries.
Lastly, he said, he had a message for the people of Pakistan.
“My final message is for the people of Pakistan. Afghans do not want lawlessness in Pakistan. Afghanistan does not want difficulties in Pakistan […] Afghanistan wants normalisation of ties with Pakistan.”</p><small>2025-09-21 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/211828193bd2896.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943681/modi-urges-indians-to-get-rid-of-foreign-products-amid-strained-us-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Modi urges Indians to get rid of foreign products amid strained US ties</strong></a><br><p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a public address on Sunday, asked citizens to stop using foreign-made products and instead use local ones, pushing for a self-reliant campaign when trade ties with the United States have soured.
After US President Donald Trump imposed a 50 per cent tariff on imported Indian goods, Modi has been urging the use of “Swadeshi”, or made-in-India goods. His supporters have started campaigns to boycott American brands, including McDonald’s, Pepsi and Apple, which are hugely popular in India.
“A lot of products we use daily are foreign-made, we just don’t know … we will have to get rid of them,” Modi said in an address to the nation ahead of Monday’s implementation of widespread consumer tax cuts.
“We should buy products that are made in India,” he added, without naming any country.
 
 

India’s population of 1.4 billion is a major market for American consumer goods, often purchased from US online retailer Amazon. Over the years, the reach of US brands has expanded deep into smaller towns.
Modi also asked shopkeepers to focus on retailing made-in-India products, arguing that this will boost the country’s economic growth.
In recent weeks, many companies have increased the promotion of local goods.

Trump threatened the country on Saturday with unspecified punishment, just days after he raised the idea of the United States retaking control of the base while on a state visit to the United Kingdom.
“If Afghanistan doesn’t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN!!!” the 79-year-old leader wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Trump, who has previously said he wants the United States to acquire territories and sites ranging from the Panama Canal to Greenland, has appeared focused on Bagram for years.
Asked on Saturday whether he would send in US troops to retake the base, Trump declined to give a direct answer, saying: “We won’t talk about that.”
“We’re talking now to Afghanistan and we want it back and we want it back soon, right away. And if they don’t do it — if they don’t do it, you’re going to find out what I’m gonna do,” he told reporters at the White House.
On Sunday, Fasihuddin Fitrat, chief of staff of the Ministry of Defence, said “some people” want to take back the base through a “political deal”.
“Recently, some people have said that they have entered negotiations with Afghanistan for taking back Bagram air base,” he said in comments broadcast by local media.
“A deal over even an inch of Afghanistan’s soil is not possible. We don’t need it.”
Separately, the Afghan Taliban also issued an statement, saying: “In accordance with Islamic principles and grounded in its balanced, economy-oriented foreign policy, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan seeks constructive relations with all states on the basis of mutual and shared interests.”
The statement said it had been “consistently communicated to the United States in all bilateral negotiations that, for the Islamic Emirate, Afghanistan’s independence and territorial integrity are of the utmost importance”.
It added: “ It should be recalled that, under the Doha Agreement, the United States pledged that ‘it will not use or threaten force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Afghanistan, nor interfere in its internal affairs.’ Therefore, it is necessary that they remain faithful to their commitments.
“Accordingly, it is once again underscored that, rather than repeating past failed approaches, a policy of realism and rationality should be adopted.
Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.”
 






‘Re-occupying Bagram might end up looking like re-invasion’
Bagram, the largest air base in Afghanistan, was a linchpin of the US-led war effort against the Taliban, whose government Washington toppled following the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
US and Nato troops chaotically pulled out of Bagram in July 2021 as part of a Trump-brokered deal with the Taliban.
The loss of crucial air power saw the Afghan military collapse just weeks later and the Taliban sweep back to power.
Current and former US officials privately caution that re-occupying Bagram air base in Afghanistan might end up looking like a re-invasion of the country, requiring more than 10,000 troops as well as deployment of advanced air defences.
Experts say the sprawling air base would be difficult to secure initially and would require massive manpower to operate and protect.
Even if the Taliban accepted the US re-occupation of Bagram following negotiations, it would need to be defended from a host of threats including the terrorist Islamic State and Al Qaeda militants inside Afghanistan.
It could also be vulnerable to an advanced missile threat from Iran, which attacked a major US air base in Qatar in June after the United States struck Iranian nuclear sites.</p><small>2025-09-21 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624802-police-probe-killing-of-three-transgender-persons-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Police probe killing of three transgender persons in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

The bodies were discovered shortly after midnight on Sunday in the Memon Goth area of Karachi, according to Edhi Information Centre.
“The bodies were found riddled with bullet holes,” the Edhi Centre said in its statement, adding that the deceased were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medicolegal formalities.
Police also confirmed the incident, with city police official Javed Ahmed Abro telling AFP, “We are still in the process of confirming their identities. It is too early to determine the motive behind the killings.”
Malir’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dr Abdul Khaliq Pirzada arrived on the scene and issued strict instructions to the concerned deputy superintendent of police and station house officer, issuing immediate orders to arrest the criminals, according to a spokesperson for the Malir District Police.
“On the instructions of SSP Malir, special teams are working to investigate every aspect of the incident on technical grounds,” the spokesperson added.
“The SSP Malir has also formed joint special teams of the police for the early arrest of the accused, which are investigating every aspect of the incident meticulously.”
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has issued orders to the inspector-general of police for the immediate arrest of the killers, according to a notice issued by the CM House today.
“The murderers of transgender persons should be arrested at all costs, and a report should be submitted to me,” the chief minister instructed.
“Transgender persons belong to the oppressed section of society that we all have to respect and honour. The state will not tolerate the killing of any oppressed and innocent citizen,” he added.
A spokesperson added that the chief minister had sought details of the incident.
Karachi’s deputy mayor, Salman Abdullah Murad, contacted the SSP seeking an inquiry report on the murders and demanding the killers’ arrest.
“The murder of three transgender persons in Memon Goth is shocking,” Murad said. “Those involved … should be arrested and given the strictest punishment.”
Although exact figures are not available due to severe underreporting, human rights groups such as Amnesty International say there has been a concerning rise in violence against trans people in Pakistan.
“When hate speech and campaigns are carried out so openly, outcomes like this are inevitable,” Shahzadi Rai, a trans activist and government-appointed local councillor in Karachi, told AFP.
“Even though the state and police are on our side, killings are still occurring, which indicates that deep-rooted hatred against transgender people persists in our society.”
A research report jointly compiled this year by Blue Veins and the National Commission on Human Rights found that many transgender individuals in Pakistan experience social exclusion, including rejection by families, employment discrimination and violence, pushing them further into vulnerability.
In July, armed motorcyclists killed a transgender person in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand division. The same month, another transgender person was shot dead by unidentified persons in the Tehkal area of Peshawar.
Last year, two transgender persons were stabbed to death in Mardan by assailants, who fled the scene after committing the crime, according to the police.</p><small>2025-09-21 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624797-seven-indian-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-di-khan-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Seven Indian-sponsored terrorists killed in DI Khan IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The hacking incident hit check-in and boarding systems provider Collins Aerospace, owned by RTX, disrupting operations on Saturday at London’s Heathrow, Berlin Airport and in Brussels, where passengers faced long queues, dozens of cancellations and delays.
Disruption had eased significantly by early Sunday despite some continuing delays, airport officials and data showed, while regional regulators said they were investigating the origin of the hacking incident.
The disruption is the latest in a string of hacks to hit sectors from healthcare to autos. A breach at carmaker Jaguar Land Rover halted production, while another caused Marks & Spencer losses in the hundreds of millions of pounds.
RTX called the incident a “cyber-related disruption” and said it had impacted its MUSE software, which is used by several airlines. RTX was not immediately available for comment on Sunday.
Berlin Brandenburg Airport said on Sunday that problems persisted, but that it was working with the company to resolve the issue. A manual workaround is in place, and there are currently no major delays or cancellations, it added.
Brussels Airport said in an update to passengers on Sunday that the cyberattack was having a “large impact on the flight schedule”, causing delays and cancellations of flights.
Heathrow said early on Sunday work was continuing to recover from the check-in system outage. It added that “the vast majority of flights have continued to operate”.
An analysis by aviation data provider Cirium said delays at Heathrow were “low”, Berlin had “moderate” delays, while Brussels had “significant” delays, but that they were decreasing.</p><small>2025-09-21 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/21141427efd264c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943654/three-sanitation-workers-die-while-cleaning-manhole-in-karachi-edhi' target='_blank'><strong>Three sanitation workers die while cleaning manhole in Karachi: Edhi</strong></a><br><p>Three sanitation workers died as they fell into a manhole while cleaning it in Karachi’s Usmanabad neighbourhood, Edhi officials said on Sunday.
Deaths from falling into open gutters and manholes frequently occur in Pakistan, particularly in major cities like Karachi, where poorly managed drainage systems, missing or broken covers, and inadequate lighting in congested neighbourhoods often put pedestrians in danger. The gutters are filled with toxic sewage and lack oxygen, making it easy to suffocate or drown within minutes.
“Four people fell into a drain near Siddique Wahab Road while cleaning it, three of whom lost their lives, while another remains unconscious,” the Edhi statement said.
The deceased have been identified as 22-year-old Vishal, 19-year-old Shahir, and 42-year-old George. The fourth man — identified as 26-year-old Faisal — was rushed to the Civil Hospital’s Trauma Centre, while the bodies of the deceased have been shifted to an Edhi morgue.
Police surgeon Sumaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the workers “expired in a manhole while cleaning it,” adding that the families have refused a post-mortem.
As per DIG South Syed Asad Raza, “the workers were hired by Union Council chairman Javed, and were working on the drain since 1am.” He added that, “when one of the workers lost consciousness while cleaning, two workers entered the manhole to pull him out..but both fell unconscious later.”
The workers were hired for a wage of Rs15,000, according to DIG South.
On Friday, three private sanitation workers were asphyxiated in the underground septic tank of a cattle farm in Faisalabad.
On September 11, two sanitation workers died after inhaling toxic gases while cleaning a company’s underground tank at Port Qasim, according to police and rescue service officials, while in June, five men, including a sanitation worker and two brothers, died under similar circumstances while cleaning an underground water tank in Karachi’s Ibrahim Hyderi.</p><small>2025-09-21 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624769-pm-shehbaz-to-attend-select-muslim-leaders-meeting-with-trump-on-unga-sidelines-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend meeting of 'select' Muslim leaders with Trump on UNGA sidelines: FO</strong></a><br><p>
