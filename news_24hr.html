<h2>News Archive – 24 Hours</h2>
<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/030849280196338.jpg?r=085346' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915115/warming-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Warming ties</strong></a><br><p>THERE is reason for cautious optimism as Pakistan and Afghanistan improve diplomatic ties, with some help from China. It had been announced on Friday that Pakistan’s charge d’affaires in Kabul was being upgraded to ambassadorial status; a day later, the Afghan Taliban’s envoy in Islamabad, too, was given the status of ambassador.
While these moves do not translate to recognition of the Afghan Taliban government, they are steps towards international acceptance of the Kabul regime, while also marking a significant improvement in Pak-Afghan ties.
The diplomatic activity was complemented on Sunday with a phone call between Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Afghan counterpart. Both vowed to deepen bilateral cooperation in various fields.
From exchanging fire only a few months ago over border disputes, the two sides have shown maturity in improving diplomatic relations and pledging to further cement ties.
The sudden improvement in relations appears to be largely the work of Chinese diplomacy. The foreign ministers of the three states had met in Beijing last month as part of a trilateral dialogue.
At this forum, the Chinese foreign minister had said that Pakistan and Afghanistan had “expressed … willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and … exchange ambassadors as soon as possible”. The hopes raised in the Chinese capital have been realised with the appointment of ambassadors in Kabul and Islamabad.
China was the first country to accept the credentials of the Afghan Taliban representative in Beijing in January 2024, though this step did not amount to a full recognition of the regime. Along with China, the UAE and Uzbekistan, Pakistan is the fourth state to have an ambassador in Kabul, while Russia has accepted the nomination of Afghanistan’s envoy in Moscow.
For China, maintaining ties with the Afghan Taliban is important for economic and security reasons. Beijing has multimillion-dollar investments in Afghanistan and is also keen to cooperate in the security field to keep anti-China militants at bay.
The Kabul regime, which remains largely isolated, knows that the road to international recognition runs through Beijing, while it is also keen to court Chinese investment.
These developments favour Pakistan, as it can cooperate on many fronts with Kabul, chiefly in the realms of security and commerce.
Perhaps working under the trilateral format with China can better address Pakistan’s security concerns with Kabul — especially in view of the presence of anti-Pakistan terrorist groups on Afghan soil — and amplify the message this country has been conveying bilaterally.
Pakistan, along with China and other regional states, should emphasise to Kabul that regional integration and commerce can only take off when Afghan soil has been cleansed of militant groups. Hopefully, upgraded diplomatic ties with Kabul will remove the irritants that stand in the way of greater cooperation.

Heading a five-member bench of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) which started hearing of the case related to the delay in the conduct of local bodies elections in Islamabad and Punjab, he called for early completion of the local government laws in Islamabad and Punjab.
Mr Raja said it would be embarrassing for the government if the ECP issues an order. He declared that the ECP will issue an order at the next hearing for local government elections in Punjab.
He said the Commission cannot sit with its eyes closed as it wanted to see progress. The ECP will set the timeline itself without waiting for any input from Punjab, he said.

Calls for early completion of local govt laws in Islamabad, Punjab

He recalled that he personally appeared before the Supreme Court in the case and underscored that it was unacceptable for a provincial government to avoid passing necessary legislation and delay elections for five years. He also highlighted that the elections in rest of the three provinces and cantonments had already taken place.
The remarks came after Punjab’s Minister for Local Government informed the Commission that a draft of the election rules was ready and can be submitted. He also stated that the local government election legislation was currently under review by the standing committee, with efforts being made to speed up the process.
He said the Speaker of the Punjab Assembly has also been urged to accelerate the legislative process. The ECP secretary, Omar Hamid Khan, briefed the forum about the delays in holding electoral processes and contended that the Punjab and the federal government had shown a little interest in holding local government elections. He pointed out that Punjab has delayed the elections for over three years, as the term of local governments in the province ended on December 31, 2021. Moreover, he added, since 2019, local government laws have been amended five times in Punjab, and the law is now being changed for the sixth time in the province.
At one point, one of the ECP members wondered as to who should be called to give a commitment that the election will be held. The hearing was later adjourned without setting a new date.
Under Section 219 (4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold elections to local governments within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local governments of a province, cantonment and Islamabad Capital Territory. In April 2019, the then PTI-led Punjab government dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on Dec 31, 2021. That means the elections were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022. Likewise, tenure of Islamabad’s local bodies expired on February 14, 2021, and the law required elections by mid of June 2021.

• Govt allocates Rs880bn for the public sector development programme, down 20pc from current year
• Provinces to pitch in Rs2.80tr under annual plan to boost uplift spending
• Development plan prioritises Bhasha Dam, Rs120bn Balochistan highway
• Ahsan Iqbal says more than 100 projects worth Rs1tr to face cuts
ISLAMABAD: Under the tight control of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),  next year’s federal development programme cuts allocations for almost all sectors, barring a rise in road building schemes and no changes to  parliamentarians’ schemes.
Despite this, the Annual Planning  Coordination Committee (APCC) cleared the national development programme worth a record Rs4.083 trillion, aided by Punjab and Sindh, showing greater financial muscle than the Centre which is pauperised by greater financial devolution, debt servicing, and security needs.
Based on this spending, the government set next year’s growth target at 4.2pc, supported by a 4.4pc target in agriculture output, 4.3pc in industry, and 4pc in the services sector, and an inflation rate at 7.5pc.
Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, who presided over the meeting, did not mince words about the unprecedented fiscal constraints and asked the provincial representatives to convince their leadership not to seek federal funds anymore, given their fattened kitties.
He said Pakistan faced some limitations with the IMF programme and thus the challenge ahead was to leverage the limited resources to achieve maximum returns from each project to satisfy goals and objectives outlined in the national economic transformation plan, 5Es based five-year plan, and the “Uraan Pakistan Programme”.
The provinces, however, indicated that they may not be able to provide cash surpluses they committed to with the Centre and the IMF under the national fiscal pact, given the over Rs1tr revenue shortfall by the FBR and resultant decline in their share.
Given the constraints, the APCC decided to put a complete ban on the approval of development schemes by the departmental development working parties (DDWPs) of various ministries and divisions until the conclusion of the IMF programme.
“Therefore, policy decision regarding moratorium on approval of DDWP level projects till completion of IMF programme so that focus may be made towards national level mega and foreign funded projects,” the planning ministry said, adding, “This will ensure financial discipline, reduce throw forward and focus on critical national level projects, particularly in water and transport sectors.”
Thus, the government allocated Rs880bn for the public sector development programme (PSDP) for next year, down 20pc compared to the current year’s revised allocation of Rs1.1tr and 37pc lower than the current year’s original budget allocation of Rs1.4tr. Yet, the government pitched the PSDP at Rs1tr after also including Rs120bn for the N-25 highway in Balochistan to be generated through an additional petroleum levy imposed by the prime minister last month.
Lower allocations
But despite these challenges, the government has earmarked Rs50bn for parliamentarians’ schemes, unchanged from the current year’s Rs50bn. Likewise, the allocation for merged districts would also remain unchanged at Rs70bn. The transport and communication sector is the only sector where the allocations have been increased for next year to Rs332bn against Rs268bn during the current year.
All other sectors, including special areas, like Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, would be handicapped by lower allocations. The infrastructure sector would get only Rs644bn next year against Rs661bn during the current year. Energy sector’s allocations would reduce to Rs144bn next year from Rs169bn this year, while the water sector allocation would fall to Rs109bn next year from Rs135bn this year despite aggressive Indian moves. The allocations for physical planning and housing would plunge by 34pc to Rs59bn next year from Rs89bn. The social sector would also face major fiscal tightening as it would get only Rs150bn next year compared to Rs200bn this year, down by a quarter.
The share of special areas – AJK and GB – has been reduced by 16pc to Rs63bn from Rs75bn during current year. The allocations for science and technology would also be down to Rs53bn next year from Rs62bn this year while governance-related projects would plunge by almost half to Rs9bn from Rs17bn.
Production sectors would get only Rs11bn next year compared to Rs15bn and the major loser would be the food and agriculture whose allocation would plunge to just Rs3bn from Rs8bn.
The four provinces would allocate about Rs2.795 trillion. This included Rs1.188tr in Punjab, about Rs888bn from Sindh, which would further jack it up to Rs1tr, followed by Rs440bn annual development plan of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Rs280bn of Balochistan.
Federal state-owned entities would together invest about Rs288bn next year, taking the total development spending to about Rs4.083tr, which may further go up as provinces come up with their final budgets. The consolidated Rs4.083tr development outlay is almost 21pc higher than current year, mainly because of higher share of the provinces.
Constrained fiscal space
The planning minister emphasised that despite constrained fiscal space and competing demands, the government was fully committed to sustaining development momentum through strategic realignment of resources, performance-based planning, and increased coordination with provinces. He reiterated that the government’s vision is to steer Pakistan towards becoming a $1 trillion economy by 2035 and $3 trillion by 2047.
As of May 31, Rs1.036tr had been authorised and Rs596 billion utilised. A total of 1,071 projects were included in the PSDP, with a cumulative approved cost of Rs13.427tr. Throw-forward liabilities stood at Rs10.216tr, prompting a strong push for project rationalisation.
The Rs1tr PSDP includes Rs270bn foreign aid with priority to Diamer-Bhasha Dam and the launch of Hyderabad–Sukkur Motorway in FY 2025–26 in line with political commitments.
Regarding projects on low priority that could be frozen or shut down, the minister said the government has identified 118 projects worth Rs1,000bn that need to be placed on low priority or capped to save resources, reported Dawn.com.

• UK PM says situation ‘getting worse by the day’
CAIRO: Israeli fire killed at least three Palestinians and wounded dozens of others near an aid distribution site operated by the US-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, local health authorities said on Monday.
Separately, Gaza’s civil defence agency said an Israeli strike on a home in the northern town of Jabalia killed 14 people on Monday. “The number of martyrs from the targeting of the Al-Bursh family home has risen to 14, including six children and three women, in addition to more than 20 missing individuals still under the rubble,” agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.
The Israeli military said it was aware of reports of casualties near the aid distribution site and the incident was being thoroughly looked into.
The GHF, a private group sponsored by the United States and endorsed by Israel, said there had been no fatalities or injuries at its distribution site or the surrounding area. Reuters could not independently verify what took place.
The reported incident was the latest in a series underscoring the volatile security situation that has complicated aid delivery to Gaza, following the easing last month of an almost three-month Israeli blockade.
On Sunday, Palestinian and international officials said at least 31 people were killed and dozens wounded near the same site, one of four operated by the GHF in Rafah.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Monday he was appalled by reports of Palestinians killed and injured while seeking aid in Gaza on Sunday, and called for an independent investigation.
“It is unacceptable that Palestinians are risking their lives for food,” Guterres said in a statement, without assigning blame for the deaths. “I call for an immediate and independent investigation into these events and for perpetrators to be held accountable.”
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday that the situation in Gaza was getting “worse by the day” and that it was important to ensure the Palestinian enclave receives more humanitarian aid urgently.
“The situation is intolerable in Gaza, and getting worse by the day,” Starmer told reporters in Scotland, when asked whether the UK would take any action over the issue.
“Which is why we are working with allies — to be absolutely clear that humanitarian aid needs to get in at speed and at volumes that it is not getting in at the moment, causing absolute devastation,” he added.
The Gaza health ministry said Israeli strikes across the enclave had killed 51 people and wounded 500 others in the past 24 hours.
Risk of famine
The GHF said Monday’s deliveries raised the number of meals it has distributed since it began operations to nearly six million.
The United Nations has said most of Gaza’s 2m population is at risk of famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade on aid entering the strip.
The GHF launched its first distribution sites last week and said it would launch more.
Its aid plan, which bypasses traditional aid groups, has come under fierce criticism from the UN and humanitarian organisations, which say the GHF does not follow humanitarian principles.
The Palestinian NGOs Network urged a boycott of what it called the “US-Israeli aid mechanism” in protest over the killings on Sunday.
At Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, relatives of Hussam Wafi, a 37-year-old father-of-six, who was killed near the aid site on Sunday, arrived to pay their last respects before burial. Wafi’s brother Ali said the victims were driven by hunger.
“The US and Israel, what do they tell us? Go and get your food and water, and the aid. When the aid arrives, they hit us. Is this fair?” Wafi told Reuters.
“They were going peacefully, they were killed. They went to get food and water for their children, to get a can of hummus or fava beans, a box or whatever is available, and they get shot, they died, he added.
Israel and Hamas, meanwhile, traded blame for the faltering of a new Arab and US mediation bid to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli prisoners held in Gaza by Hamas, in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli jails.
On Monday, a Palestinian official close to the mediation effort said Hamas leaders were in constant contact with Egyptian and Qatari mediators in Cairo and Doha.
Israel says it accepts a temporary truce to release prisoners, but that war can only end once Hamas is driven out of Gaza.

• Ukraine, Russia agree to fresh prisoner swap in Istanbul talks, but not truce
ANKARA: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Monday reiterated his willingness to host a meeting between the American, Russian and Ukrainian leaders in an effort to end the war in Ukraine.
“My greatest wish for both sides is to bring both (Russia’s) Vladimir Putin and (Ukraine’s Volodymyr) Zelensky together in Istanbul or Ankara, and even to bring (US President) Mr (Donald) Trump to their side, if they accept,” he said.
Turkiye, he said, would “take steps” to facilitate such a meeting, following direct talks between the two sides in Istanbul on Monday.
Erdogan said it was a big achievement that Monday’s talks even took place.
Ukraine carried out one of its most brazen and successful attacks ever on Russian soil on the weekend, its drones ambushing dozens of strategic bombers at bases deep inside Russia.
“It is a success in itself that the meeting happened despite what happened yesterday,” he said, hailing the talks as “magnificent”.
Hours after Erdogan’s statement, the White House said US President Donald Trump is  “open” to meeting his Russian and  Ukrainian counterparts in Turkiye. Trump, who wants a swift end to the three-year war,  “is open to it  (a three-way summit) if it comes to that, but he wants both of these leaders and both sides to come to the table together”, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in Washington.
At Monday’s meeting, which lasted just over an hour, Ukraine and Russia agreed to exchange severely injured prisoners of war as well as those under 25, alongside the remains of 6,000 troops killed in combat, Kyiv said.
“These figures given by both Russia and Ukraine… (are) very, very important in terms of showing how important these Istanbul meetings are. And we are proud of this,” Erdogan added.
Ukraine and Russia agreed another large-scale prisoner exchange, but failed to make a breakthrough on an immediate halt to the fighting.
At the second round of direct talks between the warring sides, Ukraine said Moscow had rejected its call for an unconditional ceasefire, offering instead a partial truce of two to three days in some areas of the frontline.
Urged on by US President Donald Trump, Moscow and Kyiv have opened direct negotiations for the first time since the early weeks of Russia’s invasion, but have yet to make progress beyond prisoner exchanges and the agreement to swap their demands for a longer-term settlement.
Top negotiators from both sides confirmed they had reached a deal to swap all severely wounded soldiers as well as all captured fighters under the age of 25.
“We agreed to exchange all-for-all seriously wounded and seriously sick prisoners of war. The second category is young soldiers who are from 18 to 25 years old — all-for-all,” Ukraine’s lead negotiator and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov told reporters in Istanbul.
Russia’s lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said it would involve “at least 1,000” on each side — topping the 1,000-for-1,000 POW exchange agreed at talks last month.
But there was less sign of progress towards a truce.
“The Russian side continued to reject the motion of an unconditional ceasefire,” Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya told reporters after the talks.
Russia said it had offered a limited pause in fighting.
“We have proposed a specific ceasefire for two to three days in certain areas of the front line,” top negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said, adding this was needed to collect bodies of dead soldiers from the battlefield.
No ‘reward’ for Putin
The two sides also agreed to hand over the bodies of 6,000 killed soldiers, Ukraine said after the talks.
But Russia’s Medinsky said Moscow would hand 6,000 killed Ukrainian soldiers over unilaterally, adding that he did not know “if they have any bodies on their side”, but that Russia would take them, if so.
Moscow does not disclose how many of its soldiers have been killed, closely guarding any information on the huge losses sustained during its three-year invasion.
As talks concluded, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said any deal must not “reward” Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Police officials said the prisoners broke through the jail’s outer wall, which had been weakened due to the multiple low-intensity tremors felt in the area since Sunday.
Heavy gunfire could be heard in videos shared on social media, claiming to from areas surrounding the Malir prison. Other footage showed some inmates running on the roadside.
Police officials claimed that an operation to recapture the escaped prisoners was underway, while a Malir police officer claimed that over one dozen prisoners have been rearrested at the time of going to press.
The police officer said the whole area had been cordoned off and no one was allowed to enter or leave without proving their identity.
Sindh Prisons Minister Ali Hasan Zardari took notice of the jailbreak and sought a report from the IG and DIG prisons.

Based in Norway, the forum aims to act as a “driving force for global cooperation to ensure freedom of expression for all”, according to its website.
The award was presented to her by Philippine Nobel Laureate Maria Ressa in the award ceremony of the forum’s annual conference in Lillehammer, Norway for her “extraordinary courage, integrity and impact in the struggle for the rule of law and justice”.
The award jury said the lawyer’s work had “inspired the local community and earned global recognition-making”.
“The recipient’s outspoken stance has made her a role model for a new generation of lawyers and students, especially women, and instilled hope and optimism in them. She’s shown that the legal profession can be a viable avenue for justice and systemic change, even in hybrid regimes,” Ressa said while presenting the award.
She said that despite continued pressure, the lawyer continued to defend Pakistan’s most vulnerable and marginalised communities.
“Her advocacy remains rooted in legal, nonviolent and ethical resistance; a principled human rights work model in one of the world’s most challenging environments. Her resilience in the face of such challenges is a testament to her courage and dedication and it calls for our continued support and empathy.”
Digital rights expert and activist Usama Khilji said he was proud of the lawyer for her “fearless courage & inspiring a generation of young people, giving them hope when there is little left”.
 






Rights activist Sammi Deen Baloch said she was “truly delighted” to see the “formidable defender of free speech and human rights” receive the award.
“This is a powerful international recognition of Imaan’s fearless fight for free expression and democracy in Pakistan.
“In a country where standing up for human rights and free speech comes at great risk, Imaan has remained determined. Despite threats, intimidation, and false charges, she continues to rise with courage defending truth, justice, and the fundamental right to speak freely.”

He added that over 21,000 Safe City cameras will be used to monitor those displaying weapons and modern artificial intelligence will also be used to identify weapons.
 
 

Referring to luxurious pickup trucks, the Hilux has become a symbol of power, status, and intimidation in a society marked by significant class divisions.
Hiluxes part the traffic — speeding up behind cars and flashing their lights, demanding drivers move out of their way. Guards with faces wrapped in scarves and armed with AK-47s can be packed into the back of the truck, its windows blacked out. In Karachi, a city rife with street crimes, the imposing Vigo Dala deters even outlaws.
The Hilux debuted in 1968, but the model that became popular in Pakistan was the mid-2000s Hilux Vigo. In recent years, the “Vigo Dala”, as it is locally known, has soared in popularity as an escort vehicle among newly successful urban business owners.</p><small>2025-06-02 18:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/022313243e2ab5b.jpg?r=231632' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915023/trump-xi-will-likely-talk-this-week-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>Trump, Xi will ‘likely’ talk this week: White House</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping will likely hold a long-awaited call later this week, the White House said on Monday, as trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies ratchet back up.
Trump reignited strains with China last week when he accused the world’s second-biggest economy of violating a deal that had led both countries to temporarily reduce huge tit-for-tat tariffs.
“The two leaders will likely talk this week,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing when asked whether Trump and Xi would speak.
Trump and Xi have yet to have any confirmed contact more than five months since the Republican returned to power, despite frequent claims by the US president that a call is imminent.
Trump even said in a Time magazine interview in April that Xi had called him — but Beijing insisted that there had been no call recently.
Stock markets around the world mostly slid on Monday as the US-China tensions resurfaced.
Trump in early April introduced sweeping worldwide tariffs that targeted China most heavily of all, accusing other countries of “ripping off” the United States and running trade imbalances.
Beijing and Washington last month agreed to slash staggeringly high tariffs on each other for 90 days after talks between top officials in Geneva.
But Trump and top US officials Washington officials last week accused China
of violating the deal, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying Beijing was “slow-rolling” the agreement in comments to Fox News on Sunday.
Beijing rejected those “bogus” US claims on Monday, and accused Washington of introducing “a number of discriminatory restrictive measures.”
Trump has separately ramped up tensions with other trade partners, including the European Union, by vowing to double global tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 per cent from Wednesday.</p><small>2025-06-02 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02222647b3c50a6.jpg?r=223149' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915020/' target='_blank'><strong>Man convicted for desecrating Holy Quran outside London’s Turkish consulate</strong></a><br><p>A man who desecrated a copy of the Holy Quran outside the Turkish consulate in London was found guilty on Monday of committing a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a verdict critics said effectively reinstated an abolished blasphemy law.
Hamit Coskun, 50, was fined 240 pounds ($325) at London’s Westminster Magistrates’ Court after being convicted of being disorderly by shouting “F*** Islam” as he held aloft the burning book near the consulate in central London in February.
The lawyer for Coskun, whose father was Kurdish and his mother Armenian and who lived in central England, had argued that the prosecution amounted to an attempt to bring back a blasphemy law that was abolished in England in 2008.
Coskun had denied the charge and said on social media he was carrying out a protest against the Turkish government. While he was holding the book aloft, he was attacked by a man with a knife who kicked and spat at him.
“Burning a religious book, although offensive, to some is not necessarily disorderly,” said Judge John McGarva.
“What made his conduct disorderly was the timing and location of the conduct and that all this was accompanied by abusive language. There was no need for him to use the ‘F word’ and direct it towards Islam.”
He was motivated by “hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam”, McGarva said.
“Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,” said the judge.
State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.
“He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,” said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.
The National Secular Society (NSS), which helped pay his legal fees, said the prosecution was “a significant blow to freedom of expression”, a sentiment echoed by the main opposition Conservative Party.
“Britain has no blasphemy laws. Yet this verdict creates one de facto,” the party posted on X.
“Parliament never voted for it. The British people do not want it. This decision is wrong.”

An Adani spokesperson called the report “baseless and mischievous” in a statement, adding: “We are not aware of any investigation by US authorities on this subject.”
The WSJ said it had found tankers travelling between the Gulf and billionaire Gautam Adani’s Mundra port in western India exhibiting traits that experts say are common for ships evading sanctions.
It said the US Justice Department was reviewing the activities of several LPG tankers used to ship cargoes to Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship entity, citing people familiar with the matter.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the report and the US Department of Justice and the US Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Adani said it did not handle any cargo from Iran at its ports, as a matter of policy. It said all its LPG trade, which accounts for 1.46 per cent of Adani Enterprises’ total revenue, was fully compliant with domestic and international laws, including US sanctions regulations.
A shipment referred to by the WSJ was handled as a “routine commercial transaction” via third-party logistics partners and supported by documentation identifying Sohar, Oman, as the port of origin, Adani said.
US President Donald Trump said in May that any party buying Iranian oil or petrochemical products would immediately be subject to secondary sanctions.
Last November, US authorities indicted Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, on suspicion of paying bribes to secure power supply contracts and misleading US investors during fund-raising in the United States.
Adani Group has denied the accusations and vowed to fight them.</p><small>2025-06-02 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/022218568cadfb6.jpg?r=231937' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915014/shoaib-akhtar-dr-nauman-niaz-reignite-feud-with-defamation-notice-sent-to-maverick-ex-pacer' target='_blank'><strong>Shoaib Akhtar, Dr Nauman Niaz reignite feud with defamation notice sent to maverick ex-pacer</strong></a><br><p>Former star cricketer Shoaib Akhtar received a defamation notice of Rs1 billion from sports journalist and former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official Nauman Niaz on Monday, reigniting yet another feud between the two personalities.
The legal notice dated May 29, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, claimed that the ex-pacer made “baseless” and “unethical” comments regarding Niaz.
On May 25, Akhtar appeared on a show on a private news channel where he said that Niaz “used to carry our bags” and “he was kept for that purpose”, the notice stated.
“Your [Akhtar’s] comment/remark was not only factually incorrect, it was an assault on memory and dignity,” it said.
The notice read that Akhtar’s statement employed “foul and defamatory language” against Niaz, with the “sole intention of destroying the reputation acquired by him [Niaz] through hard work”.
“That the false statements and the representations made by you [Akhtar] … have injured the reputation of our client [Niaz], lowered him in the estimation of others, reduced him to ridicule, unjust criticism, dislike and contempt …”
“It is expected that our client will suffer severe financial and reputational loss and harm as a result of your actions,” it added.
The notice asked Akhtar to issue an apology and retraction within 14 days, otherwise, he will face legal proceedings under Defamation Ordinance 2002 with damages amounting to Rs1bn.
In a post on X, the former “Rawalpindi Express” wrote that he received a “legally defective, unfounded, ego-satisfying and utterly frivolous” defamation notice from Niaz, saying that he has contacted a lawyer “to draft and send a befitting reply in this regard”.
 






The pair have engaged in similar feuds in the past.
In 2021, Niaz tendered an “unconditional apology” for his misconduct with Akhtar in a live TV show a week ago, prompting the resignation of the former star pacer from the channel.
 
 

They were part of a panel for a PTV Sports programme, where Akhtar credited the Pakistan Super League’s Lahore Qalandars franchise for discovering Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf.
Niaz took issue with Akhtar’s comments and said: “You are being a little rude so I don’t want to say this but if you’re being over-smart then you can go. I am saying this on air.”
Once the show resumed after a break, Akhtar apologised to the guests on the panel and announced his resignation from PTV, saying that he could not continue with the programme because of “how I was treated on national television”.
Niaz later confessed to his “mistake” and said that the reaction to his outburst was justified. He added, “I had no right. To err is human and for that, I apologise. Not only once, but a million times. Shoaib has been a rock star. Whatever happened on camera was unbecoming.”</p><small>2025-06-02 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02205929a23981a.jpg?r=210901' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915012/responsibility-of-sc-judges-to-speak-truth-demands-courage-to-defy-political-pressure-justice-shah' target='_blank'><strong>Responsibility of SC judges to speak truth demands courage to defy political pressure: Justice Shah</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court (SC) Senior Puisne Judge Mansoor Ali Shah has said that SC justices have a responsibility to “speak truth to power, guided by the Constitution as their unwavering normative anchor”, in an interview seen by Dawn.com on Monday.
Shah has previously expressed that the judiciary needs to stand against influence or pressure from the executive. In November 2024, he said, “The independence of the judiciary is the cornerstone of justice, and its true test lies in a judge’s ability to stand firm under authoritarian regimes.”
Speaking exclusively to law magazine The Legal, Shah said that the role of SC justices must be understood as that of protectors of the Constitution and fundamental rights rather than as policymakers.
“Judges must balance respect for legislative intent with a commitment to constitutional principles, ensuring that the judiciary acts as an impartial arbiter rather than a policymaker,” he said in response to a question about the role of SC judges amid a shifting legal landscape.
“Their role demands not only legal expertise but also wisdom, courage, and humility, as their decisions profoundly impact individuals and society at large,” he added.
“At the heart of this role lies a deeper philosophical imperative: judges must speak truth to power, guided by the Constitution as their unwavering normative anchor.”
Justice Shah noted that this responsibility “requires not compromise but courage to defy political pressures, resist majoritarian impulses, and stand firm in the face of injustice”.
“Let future jurists not be defined by fear or fatigue, but by purpose. Let them carry forward a judiciary that is not complicit in silence, but committed to struggle. The Constitution doesn’t just need protection it needs protectors,” he emphasised.
Previously, Shah termed the passing of the 26th Constitutional Amendment “one of its (the judiciary’s) weakest moments in our history”, expressing concern that executive overreach was interfering in judicial affairs and processes.
In a letter to SC Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail written in December, Shah wrote, “This unprecedented shift in the composition of the JCP (Judicial Commission of Pakistan) poses grave risks, including the potential for political appointments and the packing of courts with judges lacking an ideological commitment to the rule of law.”
In a landmark decision in May, the SC allowed civilians accused in the May 9, 2023 riots — triggered by the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan — to be tried in military courts, overturning an earlier ruling that declared military trials of civilians null and void.
However, the decision was not unanimous — the two dissenting judges, Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afghan — declared military court convictions “without jurisdiction” and unconstitutional. Rights groups and leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have likewise decried the ruling, citing concerns over due process.
The legal fraternity weighed in too, warning that the judgment threatened the right to a fair trial and chipped away at civilian justice system.</p><small>2025-06-02 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02215413291465c.jpg?r=215509' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915016/madressah-teacher-held-by-muzaffargarh-police-for-alleged-rape' target='_blank'><strong>Madressah teacher held by Muzaffargarh police for alleged rape</strong></a><br><p>A madressah teacher who allegedly molested a student in Muzaffargarh’s Bet Mir Hazar Khan area has been arrested, police said on Monday.
According to Muzaffargarh District Police Officer Dr Rizwan Ahmed Khan, the teacher in Jatoi tehsil allegedly raped the student and locked him in the madressah for five days to prevent him from reporting the assault.
“The teacher had invited his young student to his room under the pretext of a massage and raped him,” DPO Khan alleged. “A case was registered against the teacher and he was taken into custody.”
The Bet Mir Hazar Khan Station House Officer (SHO) said, “Such a brutal person will be punished severely according to the law and such people do not deserve any concession.”
In a separate incident, police have said that they will arrest a tailor’s son who allegedly raped an 11-year-old girl and blackmailed her with video footage of the assault six months ago.
The incident took place in the Riazabad area of Kot Sultan, where a girl had gone to learn sewing at a tailor’s house and was allegedly later raped by his son.
She alleged that the suspect found her alone at home and raped her, filming the assault. Threatening to share the footage and “make it viral”, the suspect allegedly continued raping the victim for the last six months.
The girl’s father said that when questioned, the victim spoke about the incident. A medical examination revealed that the girl was five months pregnant.
A case has been registered at Kot Sultan police station upon the complaint of the victim’s father.
SHO Haroon Raza Randhawa said that under the supervision of DPO Layyah Ali Waseem, a case was registered and teams were formed to apprehend the suspect, whom he said “would be arrested soon”.

Officials have beefed up heat mitigation measures, hoping to avoid a repeat of last year’s Haj, which saw 1,301 pilgrims die as temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures were forecast to exceed 40 degrees Celsius this week as one of the world’s largest annual religious gatherings starts on Wednesday.
 
 

The Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam, must be performed at least once by all Muslims with the means to do so.
As of Friday, more than 1.3 million pilgrims had arrived in Saudi Arabia for the multi-day pilgrimage, according to officials.
This year, authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials, doubling their efforts against heat-related illness following the lethal heatwave of 2024.
Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres (12 acres), thousands more medics will be on standby and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, Saudi Arabia’s Haj minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah told AFP last week.

Today, with temperatures topping 40 degrees Celsius, the health ministry said 44 cases of heatstroke had already been treated.
The latest artificial intelligence technology will also help monitor the flood of data and footage, including video from a new fleet of drones, from across Makkah to better manage the mammoth crowds.
Despite the punishing heat, pilgrims were overjoyed as they arrived in Makkah.
‘Very, very, very hot’
“This is really a blessing from Allah,” Abdul Majid Ati, a Filipino lawyer and Sharia counsellor, told AFP near the Grand Mosque.
“We feel so peaceful and safe in this place.”
Abdulhamid, from Nigeria, said he was “very happy” to be performing his second pilgrimage in a row at just 27 years old.
But the young man said he never walks out without his sunglasses, describing the temperatures in Makkah as “very, very, very hot”.
The rites in the holy city and its surroundings, which follow a lunar calendar, fall again this year during the hot month of June.
Last year, most of the deaths were among unregistered pilgrims who lacked access to air-conditioned tents and buses.
“They were caught by surprise because the intensity of the heat was so high that their adaptation measures failed,” said Fahad Saeed of Climate Analytics, a think tank based in Germany.
In the run-up to this year’s Haj, Saudi authorities launched a widespread crackdown on unregistered worshippers, using frequent raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.
Arrest and deportation
Haj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals by lottery.
But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt the Haj without a permit — though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.
Along with hefty fines, those found illegally entering Makkah during the Haj face a potential 10-year ban from Saudi Arabia.
Large crowds at the Haj have proved hazardous in the past, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the “stoning the devil” ritual in Mina, near Makkah, killed up to 2,300 people in the deadliest Haj disaster.
Saudi Arabia earns billions of dollars each year from the Haj and Umrah pilgrimages undertaken at other times of the year.
The pilgrimages are also a source of prestige for the Saudi monarch, who is known as the custodian of the two holy mosques of Makkah and Medina.
For Mariama, a 52-year-old pilgrim from Senegal, the journey to Makkah has fulfilled a lifelong dream.
“I was dreaming about it, thinking about it every time to come here to do the Haj,” she said.</p><small>2025-06-02 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607408-bilawal-vows-to-present-pakistans-message-of-peace-with-dignity-and-equality-at-un' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal vows to present Pakistan's message of ‘peace with dignity and equality' at UN</strong></a><br><p>

According to the Saudi Ministry of Haj and Umrah, over 7,000 volunteers work across Makkah and other holy places to facilitate the pilgrims. They are the “unseen anchors” whose efforts, often behind the scenes, ensure that the pilgrims do not face hardships.
“You may not know their names. You may not remember their faces. But
if you have ever performed Haj, you have felt their kindness — a bottle of cold water pressed into your hand, a voice gently guiding you when you felt lost,” the ministry said.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
The statement said that the volunteers sacrifice their own Eid celebrations, sleep and comfort so that they can help out the pilgrims in many ways, narrating the stories of multiple volunteers.
One of the volunteers, Amani Al-Atawi, who was the executive director of the Sharaf Association, was the one who welcomes people at the border town of Halat Ammar.
“Amani and her team are already on their feet — offering cool bottles of water, sweet dates, and clear directions in languages the pilgrims can understand.
It’s simple, but powerful. That first smile. That gentle hand offering help
without being asked. It sets the tone for everything that follows.”
The statement said that Amani sees her work as a “calling” which extends to “a sense of calm, care, and welcome that stays with pilgrims long after they have moved on from the border”.
It further said that she has exchanged Eid festivities for long shifts, without being with her family. “It’s hard … My family asks why I’m not home, but when I see a pilgrim’s
face light up with gratitude, or when they whisper a dua for me, it’s like I’m
carrying their blessings back to my family. That’s worth everything,” she was quoted as saying.
Another volunteer was the 24-year-old Huda Alalawi, who was an emergency medical specialist and paramedic. She was quoted in the statement as saying, “It makes me feel truly present, and that my existence has real value.”
Huda has played a critical role since 2022 to “preserve the lives of pilgrims, alleviate their pain, and provide them with necessary medical care”, the statement said, adding, “She frequently utilises Nusuk cards for swift access to pilgrim information and seamless coordination of urgent needs, actively lending her expertise to
bolster the Red Crescent’s broader medical support efforts across the holy
sites.”

The ministry said that the pilgrims might come across “youthful presence”, such as the 22-year-old Khalid Al-Mansour, who was a psychology student. “Khalid might sit with a young man from Nigeria, visibly overwhelmed by the sheer crowds and the
relentless heat,” the statement said.
He was quoted as saying, “Haj can be intense — spiritually, physically. I tell them it’s okay to feel lost. That’s part of the journey.”
One of the older volunteers was the 56-year-old Bakheet Alghamdi, who has worked as a Haj volunteer for 36 years, according to the ministry. He was a certified first aid trainer who was “often found guiding lost pilgrims, expertly managing
transport, or providing critical medical support when it is needed most”.
The statement said that he once performed CPR to save a pilgrim’s life, while another time, he was responsible for reuniting a wheelchair-bound couple from
Pakistan.
“Most pilgrims may not remember their [volunteers’] names. But they will never forget the kindness — the outstretched hand, the quiet reassurance, the unexpected calm in a moment of need,” the statement said, stressing that their efforts do not “ echo loudly“, but were steady, and full of compassion and care.

The PCC was officially launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
According to a press release by the finance ministry, the meeting was chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and attended by PCC Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib, governor of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and government officials.
“The meeting focused on the draft regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets in Pakistan, aiming to align with international standards and evolving technological trends,” the press release said.
It added that the participants discussed options for establishing “an autonomous regulatory authority to oversee and regulate the digital finance and crypto ecosystem in the country”.
“It was agreed to constitute a technical committee comprising representatives from SBP, SECP, Law Division, and IT & Telecom Division,” the ministry said, adding that the committee will review the draft laws and propose a robust framework and governance structure to be reviewed by the PCC in the next meeting.
The press release said that the PCC members gave valuable input for “a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment” which aims to promote “responsible blockchain adoption, safeguarding investors, and advancing financial inclusion”.
The finance minister appreciated the contributions of all stakeholders and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to creating a “future-ready financial infrastructure that supports innovation while maintaining financial stability and regulatory compliance”, it added.
 
 

Last week, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance held a meeting, where PPP MNA Sharmila Farooqi introduced a bill on digital currency regulations. Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said that the ban on cryptocurrency was still in place across Pakistan, stressing the need for its regulation during the meeting.
The same day, Saqib had unveiled the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance”.
Cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum globally as the number of use cases is increasing and many countries are now making them legal. However, it has had a mixed reception by regulators globally.
In some countries, like El Salvador, it has legal tender status, while in others, including Pakistan, India and China, it is not accepted as payment for goods and services, nor can one own it legally, though it is not officially banned either.</p><small>2025-06-02 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02162751957536b.jpg?r=163224' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914985/russia-ukraine-swap-peace-roadmaps-at-istanbul-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Russia, Ukraine swap peace roadmaps at Istanbul talks</strong></a><br><p>Russia and Ukraine on Monday swapped plans for ending their three-year war during talks in Istanbul aiming to find a way out of Europe’s largest conflict since World War II.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said any deal must not “reward” Russian leader Vladimir Putin, but said Kyiv was willing to take the “necessary steps for peace”.
Urged on by US President Donald Trump, Moscow and Kyiv have opened direct negotiations for the first time since the early weeks of Russia’s invasion, but have yet to make progress towards an agreement.
Monday’s talks come a day after Ukraine carried out one of its most brazen and successful attacks ever on Russian soil — using drones to hit dozens of strategic bombers parked at airbases thousands of kilometres behind the front line.
A first round of meetings in Istanbul last month yielded a large-scale prisoner exchange but no pause in the fighting, which has raged since Russia invaded in February 2022.
On Monday, the delegations “exchanged documents through the Turkish side, and we are preparing a new release of prisoners of the war,” Zelensky said at a press conference in Vilnius just after the talks in Istanbul concluded.
“The key to lasting peace is clear, the aggressor must not receive any reward for war. Putin must get nothing that would justify his aggression,” he added.
Opening the talks at the Ciragan Palace in Istanbul — an Ottoman imperial house on the banks of the Bosphorus that is now a luxury five-star hotel — Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the “eyes of the entire world” were watching.
Zelensky had said Kyiv was “ready to take the necessary steps for peace”, though the Russian and Ukrainian negotiating positions have long appeared irreconcilable.
‘Immediate ceasefire’
“If they are ready to move forward, not just repeat the same previous ultimatums, then there may be good and big news today,” a source in the Ukrainian delegation said ahead of the talks.
Ukraine wants a “full and unconditional ceasefire” to allow space to then discuss a long-term settlement. Russia has repeatedly rejected those calls.
Moscow says it wants to address the “root causes” of the conflict — language typically used to refer to a mix of sweeping demands including limiting Ukraine’s military, banning the country from joining Nato and massive territorial concessions.
Kyiv and the West say those concerns are baseless and that Russia’s assault is nothing but an imperialist land grab.
Tens of thousands have been killed since Russia invaded, with swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine destroyed and millions forced to flee their homes, in Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II.
‘No home’
In the frontline town of Dobropillya in eastern Ukraine, 53-year-old Volodymyr told AFP that he believes the talks in Istanbul would amount to very little.
“We thought that everything would stop. And now there is nothing to wait for.
We have no home, nothing. We were almost killed by drones,” he said.
In Kramatorsk, a garrison city near the front with trenches and rolls of barbed wire on its outskirts, a Ukrainian serviceman also said the talks in Turkiye would not likely bring out about any results.
“I have no faith in them. But it would be great if they could agree to stop, to have some kind of respite, so that we could take our guys, those who died, and so that guys would just stop dying,” he told AFP, sipping a coffee.
After months of setbacks for Kyiv’s military, Ukraine said it had carried out an audacious attack on Sunday, damaging some 40 strategic Russian bombers worth $7 billion in a major special operation.
Kyiv’s security service said the plan — 18 months in the making — had involved smuggling drones into Russia, then launching them from near the airbases, thousands of kilometres away from the front lines.
On the ground, Russia’s territorial advance gained pace in May, according to AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
Ahead of the talks, Russian officials have called for Ukraine to be cut off from Western military support and cede territory still controlled by its army.
Kyiv has previously accepted it may only be able to get territory taken by Russia through diplomacy, not fighting.
Ukraine also wants concrete Western-backed security guarantees — like Nato protections or troops on the ground — that have been ruled out by Russia.</p><small>2025-06-02 14:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02180624e420b4c.jpg?r=182833' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915004/massive-plume-of-ash-gas-spews-from-italys-mount-etna' target='_blank'><strong>Massive plume of ash, gas spews from Italy’s Mount Etna</strong></a><br><p>A huge plume of ash, gas and rock spewed forth Monday from Italy’s Mount Etna, Europe’s largest active volcano, after a portion of its southeastern crater likely collapsed, authorities said.
Images showed a massive grey cloud billow forth from the volcano on the island of Sicily, beginning about 11:24am local time (0924 GMT), according to the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV).
Surveillance cameras showed “a pyroclastic flow probably produced by a collapse of material from the northern flank of the Southeast Crater”, the agency said.
A pyroclastic flow occurs when volcanic rock, ash and hot gasses surge from volcanos. They are extremely dangerous.
The explosive activity “had transitioned to a lava fountain”, INGV said, with the plume of ash expected to dissipate towards the southwest.
A red alert issued for aviation authorities said the height of the volcanic cloud was estimated at 6.5 kilometres.

The government has adopted austerity measures for the upcoming budget — set to be announced on June 10 — in line with the demands of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to implement stricter spending policies and raise revenues to reduce the budget deficit and improve debt sustainability, as part of its $7 billion loan programme. The global money lender also expects Pakistan to achieve a 3.6 per cent economic growth with 7.7pc inflation next year.
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad after a meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee, the planning minister noted that since 2023, the development budget had decreased, stating that Pakistan was observing “tight financial discipline in order to balance spending and income” — a process he said had been agreed upon with the IMF.
“Pakistan has faced such severe inflation that the federal government would end up spending the money it collected from the provincial governments to pay off loans,” he explained.
“The reason we have these debts is because the govt in power between 2018 and 2022 took multiple loans and the policy rate rose to 23pc due to heavy inflation,” Iqbal added. “Repaying those loans became 55pc of our spending. As a result, this has affected our development budget.”
“Since resources are limited, we need to focus on high-priority projects for national development.  We need to ensure ‘value for money’ in selecting projects.
“Efficiency and prioritisation of investment are two important pillars to fulfil lack of resources,” the federal minister said earlier while addressing the committee meeting.
He said that fiscal space will be provided in the next PSDP for projects of strategic importance. He said efforts have been made to align the development budget with national priorities while staying within limited resources.
The minister recalled that when the PML-N was voted out of government in 2018, the defence and development budgets were Rs1 trillion each.
Breaking down the development budget, Iqbal said that Rs664bn would be allocated to infrastructure projects including energy, water, transport and planning.
“The energy, water and highway sectors will be prioritised,” he noted.
He added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered that Rs120bn of the Rs1 trillion development budget be allocated to upgrade the N-25 Highway in Balochistan, which runs from Chaman to Karachi through Quetta.
“The road will be upgraded to an expressway,” he said. “Excepting this project, we have Rs880bn with which we have to balance the PSDP (Public Sector Development Programme).”
Iqbal further said that special areas such as Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan would receive Rs63bn, while the merged districts in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa would receive Rs70bn.
“Science and IT (Information Technology) will receive Rs53bn, bodies performing institutional reform will get Rs9bn, while the production sector will receive Rs11bn. Altogether, this makes Rs1tr,” he outlined.
“Our guiding principle was to make sure that we prioritise projects for which we have rupee cover and foreign funding available,” Iqbal explained. “Those projects of national importance are protected. At the same time, projects in their advanced stages will also receive funding to achieve completion.
“We will move away from token allocation as it renders projects unhealthy,” he added, further stating that the government will try and ensure transparency through a comprehensive monitoring system where projects will be observed by satellite.
Outlining the government’s annual plan, Iqbal expected Pakistan’s GDP to grow by 4.2 per cent.
He added, “4.5pc of that will be agriculture, 4.3pc from industry and 4pc from services.”
The planning minister said that the country set a target of $35bn for its exports and $39bn for foreign remittances.
“Remittances reached $27bn in 2022-23 and can reach $37bn in 2024-25 — an increase of $10bn,” he said. “I want to thank overseas Pakistanis for ignoring negative calls and claims that ‘overseas Pakistanis are upset’ and calls for boycotts and continuing to send remittances.
“It is a very big contribution and it is like oxygen to us,” he added, stating that there is scope for remittance figures to climb to $50bn in the future.
Iqbal mentioned that Pakistan had among the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world. “We are ranked among the lowest tax collectors in the world. The rate is hardly 10pc whereas developing countries ahead of us collect 16-18pc,” he said.
“If we are serious about the nation’s development, then tax collection, tax evasion, and tax reforms will have to be considered as an aspect of national security as the top most priority,” the minister asserted.
“Every citizen should be watchman against tax evasion,” adding that the government is taking action against those earning millions but not paying taxes. He urged tax paying citizens to cooperate with the government against evaders.
Iqbal mentioned that within the next five years, the government needs to raised large amount of resources to fulfill the development budget.
“Last fiscal year, we started with Rs1400 billion, but it was reduced to Rs1100 bn. This year it has further reduced to Rs1000 bn. I think this raises a huge question mark about our future and is a sign for concern,” the minister cautioned.
“To reverse this situation, we need to increase the tax collection by huge proportions.”
He said the federal government will hand over development projects by provinces to the provincial governments and focus on projects by the Centre, adding that such projects are a huge strain on resources.
He mentioned that the federal budget has projects devolved to provinces but still a responsibility of the federal government, adding such projects have “reduced the space” of the Centre.
“Till 2018, PSDP hardly had 12-14 pct provincial projects. Between 2012-2013, the federal government moved forward with record development projects.
“After 2018, provincial projects began to creep in. By 2022, when we came back (to power), they were around 40 pct.”
Iqbal said while selecting PSDP for the upcoming year, the government ensured that international projects or those linked with multi-lateral organisations should be provided rupee cover as the top most priority.
He said the government ensured that allocations of resources for regions such a Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir, and merged areas are protected and there is no deduction so their requirements are fulfilled.
He said the third priority was that projects 70-80 pct in completion phase are allocated huge sums so they are completed and “moved from the books and improve our portfolio” and do not incur further costs.
Furthermore, he said under Uraan Pakistan initiative, the government needs to ensure that projects of “strategic importance” are allocated sufficient funds. This includes funds for Diamer Basha dam which is vital to address the water crisis that the government will have to complete with speed.
For connectivity, he said projects like Sukkur-Hyderabad motorway, Quetta-Chaman road, and second phase of Karakoram highway need to be prioritised.
Iqbal called for allocating funds to incomplete projects of Higher Education Commission so that the youth are not affected.
“We need to increase tertiary education by three times. Pakistan already have the lowest ratio in the region. Our ratio is 13 pct, India has 30 pct, Bangladesh has 25 pct, and China has 60 pct. We need to increase it in the future,” he asserted.
Regarding projects on low priority that could be frozen or shut down, the minister said the government has identified 118 projects worth Rs1000bn that need to be placed on low priority or capped to save resources.</p><small>2025-06-02 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0217570709e810a.jpg?r=175856' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914996/eight-injured-in-flamethrower-attack-on-israeli-hostage-protest-in-us' target='_blank'><strong>Eight injured in ‘flamethrower’ attack on Israeli hostage protest in US</strong></a><br><p>In the face of rising criticism of Israeli atrocities on Gaza, which has killed nearly 54,000 Palestinians, a man in the United States yelling “free Palestine” used incendiary devices to torch protesters rallying in support of Israeli hostages, injuring at least eight people in the US state of Colorado on Sunday.
The FBI said it was investigating the incident as a “targeted terror attack” and identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.
He was booked into the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to county records. His bond has been set at $10 million.
The incident comes as pressure on Israel rises to cease what has been called a “genocide” in Gaza by the United Nations and Amnesty International among other international human rights organisations.
Police in the city of Boulder said it was too early to determine a motive for the attack, which took place shortly before 1:30pm (12:30am PKT) at a demonstration outside a mall.
The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said the “violent anti-Semitic attack” occurred at Sunday’s “Run for Their Lives” event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community in solidarity with hostages seized during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the onslaught in Gaza.
FBI agent Mark Michalek told reporters the attack happened at a “regularly scheduled weekly peaceful event”.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary into the crowd,” he said, adding that “the suspect was heard to yell: ‘Free Palestine!’”
Boulder Police said that eight victims, four men and four women aged between 52 and 88, were transported to hospitals.
Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters that “at least one victim was very seriously injured, probably safe to say critical condition.”
The suspect was also injured before being taken into custody, Redfearn said.
Molotov cocktails
In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.
He can be heard screaming “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.
Other images showed billowing black smoke.
Boulder resident Alexis Cendon said he felt “very, very scared” after hearing about the attack near his workplace.
Sunday’s attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.
It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted “Free Palestine,” was arrested.
Boulder Police Chief Redfearn insisted it was “way too early to speculate motive,” but FBI chief Kash Patel described the incident as “a targeted terror attack”.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser labelled it “a hate crime”.
“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” Weiser said.
White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on X that the suspect was a foreign national who “illegally overstayed [his] visa”.
Fox News and CBS both cited US officials as saying Soliman was an Egyptian national.
The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the incident.
‘Burning the streets’
Israel’s top diplomat Gideon Saar condemned Sunday’s “terrible anti-Semitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder”.
Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also voiced outrage.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also described the Boulder incident as a “targeted terror attack,” while Attorney General Pam Bondi termed it “a horrific anti-Semitic attack”. Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle expressed revulsion.
“Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.”
Several organisations also decried the violence.
“This is an attack on all of us — and we will not stay silent,” the Israeli-American Council said in a statement.</p><small>2025-06-02 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021727529b6563d.png?r=172808' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914994/govt-announces-four-day-eidul-azha-holidays' target='_blank'><strong>Govt announces four-day Eidul Azha holidays</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Monday announced a four-day public holiday on the festive occasion of Eidul Azha.
According to a notification issued by the Cabinet Division, the government has declared a public holiday from June 6-9, 2025 (Friday to Monday).
“The prime minister has been pleased to declare the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th (Friday to Monday) as public holidays on the occasion of Eidul Azha,” the statement said.
Pakistan would observe Eidul Azha on June 7, the moon sighting Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) announced last month after the crescent for the month of Zilhaj was not sighted.
The committee’s meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad’s Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its office.
Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, “No testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan […]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.”
He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.
Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to see the moon. Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.
Dr Mohammad Hasan Ali, director of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Pakistan Meteorological Department; Shaukatullah Khan of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco); and Zainul Abedin from the science and tech ministry were among those present during the meeting.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><small>2025-06-02 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021605225736bd3.jpg?r=160711' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914964/main-suspect-held-after-video-of-citizen-being-assaulted-in-karachis-dha-goes-viral' target='_blank'><strong>Main suspect held after video of citizen being assaulted in Karachi’s DHA goes viral</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi police on Monday arrested a main suspect along with his two employees over charges of beating a citizen in the city’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The development came after a video of the incident went viral on social media earlier today, prompting authorities to take notice of it.
The man, identified as Salman Farooqi, was arrested from DHA and his vehicle was impounded, Karachi South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said in a statement.
The man, travelling in a luxury car, allegedly subjected a bike rider, who was accompanied by a woman, to torture on the Khayaban-i-Ittehad road after a minor accident.
Earlier today, the police had arrested the suspect’s driver and guard during late-night raids on his home and office in DHA. DIG Raza clarified that the held suspect was not a government employee.
Stating that the citizen who was subjected to violence had not approached the police to file a complaint, the DIG said the police were trying to contact his family.
Meanwhile, the Gizri police registered a first information report (FIR) against the suspect, his armed guard and driver on complaint of a citizen named Mohammad Saleem under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506-B (threat to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Other PPC sections invoked included 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).
According to the FIR, Saleem identified himself as a cell manager of a cellular company. The complainant said he had gone to Ittehad Commercial for recovery at around 8:35pm on Sunday when a minor accident took place between the bike rider and a Land Cruiser.
 
 

The complainant said Farooqi put the bike rider hostage at gunpoint inside his vehicle, after which he beat him, used abusive language and threatened him.
He added that the woman pleaded with the vehicle owner but he pushed her back with contempt.
DIG Raza said the police were taking the issue “extremely seriously” and that an investigation has been launched. He asserted that no one was above the law and vowed to promise “complete justice” to the aggrieved citizen.
“The suspects involved in the torture would be brought to justice and all requirements of justice would be fulfilled. The law is equal for all, and there is no exception,” he said.
Meanwhile, both Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar and Karachi Additional IG Javed Alam Odho directed the South senior superintendent of police to submit a detailed report on the incident.
They further ordered him to take action against the culprits, as no one was above the law.
In another road rage incident in Lahore in March, armed guards of a private security company reportedly fired shots at a car rider at Dharampura Underpass, thrashed him and fled the scene, leaving a vehicle and some weapons on the spot.
In October last year, three men were held for their alleged involvement in assaulting women during a quarrel at a restaurant in DHA.

“Iran is drafting a negative response to the US proposal, which could be interpreted as a rejection of the US offer,” the senior diplomat, who is close to Iran’s negotiating team, told Reuters.
The US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, who was on a short visit to Tehran and has been mediating nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington.
But after five rounds of talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to resolve the nuclear standoff, many issues remain unresolved.
Among clashing red lines is Iran’s rejection of a US demand that Tehran commit to scrapping uranium enrichment, viewed as a potential pathway to developing nuclear bombs.
Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
“In this proposal, the US stance on enrichment on Iranian soil remains unchanged, and there is no clear explanation regarding the lifting of sanctions,” said the diplomat, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Tehran demands the immediate removal of all US-imposed curbs that impair its oil-based economy. But for the US, the removal of nuclear-related sanctions should be done in phases.
Dozens of Iranian institutions vital to Iran’s economy, including its central bank and national oil company, have been sanctioned since 2018 for, according to Washington, “supporting terrorism or weapons proliferation”.
Trump’s revival of a “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since his return to the White House in January has included tightened sanctions and threats to bomb Iran if current negotiations yield no deal.
During his first term, Trump in 2018 ditched Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. In return, Tehran has rapidly violated the 2015 nuclear pact’s curbs on its nuclear programme.
The 2015 deal required Iran to take steps to restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from US, EU and UN economic sanctions.
The diplomat said the assessment of “Iran’s nuclear negotiations committee”, under the supervision of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was that the US proposal is “completely one-sided” and cannot serve Tehran’s interests.
Therefore, the diplomat said, Tehran considers this proposal a “non-starter” and believes it unilaterally attempts to impose a “bad deal” on Iran through excessive demands.
Two Iranian officials told Reuters last week that Iran may pause uranium enrichment if the US releases frozen Iranian funds and recognises Tehran’s right to refine uranium for civilian use under a “political deal” that could lead to a broader nuclear accord.</p><small>2025-06-02 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607369-man-poisons-children-takes-own-life-after-failing-to-afford-eid-clothes' target='_blank'><strong>Man poisons children, takes own life after failing to afford Eid clothes</strong></a><br><p>

The by-election for PP-52 (Sambrial) took place yesterday, two months after the seat had fallen vacant following the demise of PML-N MPA Arshad Javed Warraich — father of the winning candidate.
Analysts had expected a tough one-on-one contest between the ruling PML-N and the PTI-backed aspirants, whereas the PPP had also been running an aggressive campaign in Sambrial to perform better in the race.
According to Form-47 issued by the ECP today and signed by Returning Officer Muhammad Iqbal, Warraich clinched the seat by winning 78,702 votes.
Warraich’s main opponent, Fakhir Nashat Ghumman, who was an independent candidate backed by the PTI, was the runner-up with 39,018 votes.
PPP’s Raheel Kamran Cheema ranked third with 6,832 ballots cast in his favour, followed by Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s Muhammad Shafaqat with 4,851 votes.
The balloting had remained peaceful throughout yesterday, except for verbal arguments between PTI supporters and the police at some polling stations out of a total of 185.
PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram accused the Punjab government and the police of interfering in the by-election, alleging that its polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. The former ruling party also claimed to have “video evidence of the rigging”.
 






However, Provincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah, in a statement, denied these allegations. He said the voting process continued in all 185 polling stations without any interruption till 5pm. He said that the election commission would review any complaint regarding irregularities if it was provided in a proper way.
The local administration, apparently for security reasons, had placed containers in front of the RO office — a move lambasted by the PTI as well as the PPP, which also staged a sit-in in front of the office in Sambrial.
PPP leader and ex-premier Raja Pervaiz Ashraf also added to the PTI’s rigging allegations.
Speaking to the media in Sambrial yesterday, flanked by PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza, Ashraf claimed polling stations had been closed in several areas by the administration.
The ex-premier said it would be unfortunate if the results were changed, adding that it would not be a good omen for the government. He said it was not tolerable that rigging took place during the by-election.
 






The ECP had set up 185 polling stations, categorising 11 as highly sensitive, 38 as sensitive, and 136 as normal. A total of 1,696 officers and staff had been deployed to perform election duties across these stations.
The total number of registered voters in PP-52 was 297,185, including 157,725 male voters and 139,460 female voters.
The voter turnout was recorded as 44.79 per cent, with a total of 133,096 ballots cast, out of which 130,837 were counted as submitted in the right manner.
Elected to serve, says  Hina Warraich
After her victory, Warraich told Dawn.com: “This is not just my victory — it is the victory of the people of Sambrial. They did not elect me for politics but for service, and I will do my utmost to live up to their expectations.”
The PML-N leader went on to thank Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, adding that her support helped her. Warraich had served as chairperson of the Sialkot district council from 2016 to 2020.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed gratitude for the victory, congratulating Warraich.
“Thanks to the unbreakable bond between the leadership and the workers, PML-N continues to reflect the will of the people,” the premier asserted in a post on X.
He credited the victory to the unwavering leadership of PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam, as well as the dedication of his party workers.
 






In a statement, CM Maryam also felicitated Warraich on her success. “Thanks to the people of Sambrial for once again placing their trust in PML-N,” she said.
“This victory is a validation of our policies. The public has sent a clear message that they want progress, service, and stability,” she said.
The chief minister stressed her government was actively working for public welfare in every constituency, pledging that those efforts would now be further accelerated.
“We will live up to the trust the people of Sambrial have shown in us,” CM Maryam was quoted as saying by her party.
