“The prime minister will also participate in a meeting of select Islamic leaders with US President Trump to exchange views on issues pertaining to regional and international peace and security,” a statement issued by the FO said.
 






On his visit to New York, the PM would lead Pakistan’s delegation to the “high-level segment” of the UNGA from 22 September 2025, the FO said, adding that he would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other ministers and senior officials.
At the UNGA session, PM Shehbaz “will urge the international community to resolve the situations of prolonged occupation and denial of the right to self-determination,” particularly in India-occupied Kashmir and Palestine.
“He will draw attention of the international community towards the grave crisis in Gaza and call for decisive action to end the suffering of the Palestinian people,” the FO stated.
“He will also highlight Pakistan’s perspective on the regional security situation, as well as other issues of international concern, including climate change, terrorism, Islamophobia, and sustainable development.”
The FO, in its statement, said PM Shehbaz would attend several “high-level events” on the sidelines of the UNGA session, including important meetings of the UN Security Council, a high-level Meeting of the Global Development Initiative (GDI), and a special high-level event on Climate Action, among others.
Further, during his visit, he will meet several world leaders and senior UN officials to exchange views on issues of mutual interest.
“He will also underline Pakistan’s resolve to work with all UN member states to uphold the UN Charter, prevent conflict, foster peace and promote global prosperity in Pakistan’s current role as a member of the Security Council,” the FO added.
FO highlighted that the PM’s participation in “this biggest annual gathering of global leaders” would showcase Pakistan’s “strong commitment to multilateralism and the United Nations”. It would also reaffirm “Pakistan’s longstanding contribution towards the shared objectives of peace and development,” it said.
Next week, the meeting of Muslim leaders with Trump could be the first instance of PM Shehbaz directly interacting with the US president since the latter assumed the top office in his country in January.
In June this year, President Trump met with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal General Syed Asim Munir — marking the first time a US president has hosted Pakistan’s army chief at the White House unaccompanied by senior civilian officials.
Both countries have enjoyed improved bilateral relations in recent times, with the US signing a “landmark” tariff deal with Pakistan in the wake of Trump’s tariff policy. Pakistan also signed a separate agreement with the US, allowing the country to develop “massive oil deposits” in Pakistani territory.
In May, US President Trump mediated a ceasefire between Pakistan and India during a military standoff.
Trump’s upcoming meeting with muslim leaders, including PM Shehbaz, comes amid growing tensions in the Middle East. Earlier this month, Israel, a close US ally, targeted top Hamas officials in Doha, Qatar, killing five of the group’s members and a Qatari security officer.
The attack drew widespread international condemnation, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, Israel’s main backer.
Subsequently, Arab and Muslim leaders called for a review of ties with Israel at an emergency Arab League and OIC joint session held in the Qatari capital. The event was co-sponsored by Pakistan.
Some analysts are of the view that Israeli aggression against Qatar has cast a shadow on US credibility in the Middle East as Arab nations look elsewhere for protection from Israel.
This week, PM Shehbaz and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
The move is being seen as a moment of tectonic significance for the Middle East and South Asia.</p><small>2025-09-21 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624769-pm-shehbaz-to-attend-select-muslim-leaders-meeting-with-trump-on-unga-sidelines-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend meeting of 'select' Muslim leaders with Trump on UNGA sidelines: FO</strong></a><br><p>

The move was broadly criticised within Pakistan and by some former cricket greats in other cricket-playing countries as well. 
Most Indians have been going through an existential crisis of sorts after losing a short war against Pakistan in May this year. Not shaking hands with Pakistani players can, therefore, also be understood as an act of sulking brought on by the shock of losing a war to a much smaller neighbour. 
One of the most common reactions to the sulky behaviour of the Indian players was that “politics should not be mixed with sport.” Nothing new in this, really. For decades, one has heard this over and over again. Indeed, one can’t help but agree with this sentiment, but when it comes to cricketing relations between India and Pakistan, politics is historically and inherently entrenched in these relations. 
 
 

After the 1965 war between the two countries, both the countries snapped their cricketing ties. Things got even worse after the 1971 war between the two countries. Pakistan had accused India of aiding militant Bengali separatists in the erstwhile East Pakistan during a civil war there. In December 1971, East Pakistan broke away to become Bangladesh when India entered the war on the side of the separatists.

Cricket, whether one likes it or not, is inescapably linked to the turbulent waters that Pak-India relations tread and to suggest ‘keeping politics out of sport’ is to ignore this reality

Interestingly, though, both countries continued to compete regularly in international hockey events. But the hockey matches were often politically charged. For example, just a day before their match against India at the 1974 Asian Games, the Pakistan team played loud patriotic songs to irritate their Indian opponents lodged nearby.
In 1976, the government of Z.A. Bhutto in Pakistan gave the green light to the country’s cricket board to start talks with the Indian cricket board. The response of the Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi was positive. The two cricket boards met and decided to resume cricket ties by 1978. The ties were revived when India toured Pakistan in late 1978 (after 17 years) — even though, by then, Indira had lost power after the 1977 Indian elections, and the Bhutto regime had been overthrown in a military coup by Gen Ziaul Haq. 
India-Pakistan relations remained somewhat stable until 1982, when the Indian government — once again headed by Indira — accused Pakistan’s military regime of providing support to Sikh separatists. This did not impact the cricketing ties between the two countries, though. However, in 1984, the Indian team cut short its tour of Pakistan when Indira was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards. By 1986, tensions between the two countries started to mount once again. Both the countries were set to jointly host the 1987 Cricket World Cup.
In February 1987, as India began amassing its troops along the Pakistani border, Gen Zia paid an unscheduled visit to New Delhi. Pakistan was still deeply involved in the anti-Soviet insurgency in Afghanistan. The Pakistan cricket team was touring India at the time. Zia’s visit came as a surprise to the Indian PM Rajiv Gandhi.
Zia announced he had come to watch a Pakistan-India Test match with the Indian PM. Rajiv, though hesitant at first, obliged. The two did visit the stadium to watch some cricket. But they mostly talked politics. Zia dubbed his trip as a “Cricket for Peace Tour” and managed to defuse tensions between the two countries. Political commentators dubbed this as “cricket diplomacy.” 
 


But relations between the two countries began to deteriorate once again in the 1990s. The escalation of militancy in Kashmir led to a sentiment (in India) that bilateral cricketing ties should be avoided. The electoral appeal of Hindu nationalists in India had begun to expand as well. Hindu nationalism is radically anti-Muslim/anti-Pakistan. Even though the two countries played against each other in one day international (ODI) tournaments — including jointly hosting the 1996 World Cup — Test matches between the two came to a standstill.
It was only in 1999 — a decade after the 1989-90 Test series — that the two countries once again fully restored cricket ties. In 1999, a Hindu nationalist government was in power but it had decided to stabilise relations with Pakistan — especially at the behest of Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif. 
It was a tense series. Radical Hindu nationalist organisations were constantly threatening the Pakistani players and, in one case, destroyed the pitch in Delhi on which a Test had to be played. Just months later, war between the two countries erupted in Kargil and Sharif was toppled in a military coup by Gen Pervez Musharraf. Cricket ties between the two countries snapped again. 
Three years later, relations between India and Pakistan began to stabilise and, once again renewal of cricket ties was used to signal this. In 2003, India toured Pakistan after 15 years. Pakistan toured India in 2005, India returned in 2006, and Pakistan toured India again in 2007. Former Pakistan cricket board chairman and diplomat, the late Shahryar Khan, described this period as one of the most robust years of cricket diplomacy between the two countries. 
But cricket ties snapped once again after a terrorist attack in Mumbai in 2011. Things got even worse after a more radical Hindu nationalist government came to power in India in 2014 and Pakistan was facing terror attacks from militant Islamists and Baloch separatists. 
Both countries accused each other of aiding terrorism in their countries. They continued to play against each other in ODI and T20 events on neutral venues, even though Pakistan travelled to India to play the 2023 World Cup. There have been no bilateral Test, ODI and T20 series between the two countries since 2007, except one in 2012 when Pakistan toured India for a short ODI/T20 series.
One can also posit that hockey, once a popular sport in both the countries, suffered due to the constant usage of cricket as a tool for political diplomacy. Nevertheless, the possibility of cricket diplomacy has continued to shrink. Politics is inherently mixed with cricket when it comes to Pakistan-India cricket ties. Saying that it shouldn’t is not a practical sentiment. 
The fact is, one can’t help but mix the two. Therefore, I think the more appropriate thing to suggest would be to mix it in a way that is not detrimental to the game. But, unfortunately, it has become detrimental — not only for cricket in both the countries, but for the larger cricketing world as well. And India can now be pointed out as a leading culprit in this regard.

The legislative changes are remarkable in the context of deep patriarchy and parochialism that permeates Pakistan’s society and culture.
The legal developments are the product of a combination of factors, not least of which is a strong women’s rights movement that has consistently demanded that the state act to protect and promote the rights of women.
A frequent refrain in political and social commentary in Pakistan is that these laws, while transformative on paper, have not translated to actual change in the lives of women and girls because of poor implementation. Widespread incidents of violence against women at the home, workplace and public places persist. Women and girls who approach state institutions, such as police and courts, in the hope of some accountability for violence, confront patriarchal attitudes and corruption and inefficiency of state actors, leading to deep frustration and retraumatisation. Online spaces, where misogynist targeting of women and girls is rampant, amplify their insecurities.
Historically, feminism in Pakistan has relied heavily on the power of the law to promote gender justice. For much of Pakistan’s history, feminists formed alliances with state actors and institutions to achieve their goals.  This was, in part, due to the state’s receptivity to demands for progressive laws and policies to promote the status of women.
Gen Ziaul Haq’s decade of rule over Pakistan from 1977-88 was an aberration, with long-standing impact. Zia initiated sweeping changes to laws as part of his ‘Islamisation’ campaign, which led to the detention of women on accusations of adultery and fornication, promoted impunity for sexual violence and threatened to demote them to second-class citizens. A women’s rights movement grew in response to Zia’s policies and devoted many years fighting against his regressive changes.

From resisting Gen Ziaul Haq’s regressive Hudood laws to having progressive anti-harassment and domestic violence legislation enacted, the women’s rights movement in Pakistan has achieved much. But for countless women, the gulf between the laws on paper and the realities on the ground remains wide. Does the strategy for gender justice need a rethink? Eos presents, with permission, an excerpt from the book Progressive Laws in Patriarchal Societies: Lessons from Pakistan, published by Bloomsbury…

The passage of gender progressive laws in recent years marks a dramatic shift in the state’s attitude to women’s rights, compared to Zia’s rule. Years after the passage of some of the gender progressive laws, however, their effective implementation remains a distant goal. Legislatures and some mainstream political parties may have affirmed their faith in gender equality, but pushing state machinery to meaningfully activate legislation is proving to be an immensely difficult task.
Given the disjuncture between gender progressive laws on the one hand and the lived experiences of women and girls in Pakistan on the other, the following question should be investigated closely: what are the barriers to enforcement of gender-progressive laws and what can be done to eliminate or, at least, reduce the barriers?
This is a crucial question for the women’s rights movement in Pakistan, which has adopted reform of legal frameworks as one of its central aims. While the women’s right movement that grew from the activism against Zia’s rule has premised its work on the assumption that a liberal democratic state will help advance the goal of gender equality, the current scenario casts doubt on the effectiveness of state power, even with gender-progressive laws in place, to meet feminist goals.
Assessing the obstacles to implementation is important for women rights activists to understand not only how law reform can be made more meaningful, but also to determine the extent to which they should prioritise law reform advocacy in their work.
 


MAIN ACTORS DRIVING LAW REFORM
A key force behind the passage of laws was a women’s rights movement that gained strength over the decades, particularly during the 1980s and beyond. Women legislators in elected parliaments gained strength in numbers after reserved seats were reinstated in 2002 and supported the demands of women’s rights activists. Pronouncements by the judiciary on the state’s responsibility to prevent and punish gender-based violence gave impetus to advocacy for legislative change. These factors led to fertile ground for the enactment of gender-progressive legislation.
ACTIVISTS AND NGOS
Until the 1980s, women’s rights activism in Pakistan met with a degree of benign accommodation by the state. Following the imposition of discriminatory laws by Zia, women’s rights activists adopted a confrontational stance towards the state and challenged its promotion of patriarchy and its ‘Islamisation’ agenda.
Zia notoriously imposed ‘Islamisation’ on laws and policies, and a crucial pillar of his project was to undermine women’s freedom and autonomy.  He openly stated that women’s role should be confined in the home or ‘chadar chaar divari’ [veil and four walls]. He made extensive changes to criminal laws through the Hudood Ordinances.
One piece of legislation, the Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance 1979, took rape provisions outside the Penal Code and placed them in purportedly Shariah-based laws that conflated rape with adultery, with the result that many women, including those who had in fact been raped, faced adultery trials that could lead to the death penalty. His government’s reforms to the Evidence Act 1872, to supposedly bring it in compliance with Shariah [Islamic law], stipulated that, in financial matters, a woman’s testimony is worth half that of a man’s.
This change was perceived as state-sponsored discrimination against women and the imposition of second-class status. It was met with strong resistance from women activists who, in February 1983, demonstrated outside the Lahore High Court and were confronted with police brutality, leading to the imprisonment of several women, some of whom went on to become leaders of the women’s movement that played a significant role in the resistance against Zia’s dictatorship.
Activists formed the Women’s Action Forum (WAF), a collective that advocated for the reversal of Gen Zia’s regressive legal measures. It comprised women lawyers, journalists and academics and established chapters in cities across the country. Activists in WAF simultaneously established and strengthened non-governmental organisations (NGOs) during the course of the 1980s, which lent institutional support to their advocacy agenda.
Shirkat Gah, an NGO formed in 1975-6, became a prominent voice in the struggle against the Zia regime and included activists such as Khawar Mumtaz and Farida Shaheed. The Aurat Foundation was formed in 1986 by Shahla Zia and Nigar Ahmed as a research and advocacy organisation focusing on the rights of women. Over the years, it developed legislative expertise and regularly issued analyses of laws, legal proposals and recommendations for legislative change. Aurat Foundation released a newsletter called Legislative Watch that monitored legislative advocacy and made recommendations for law reform.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan was founded in 1986 by leading lawyers and activists, including Asma Jahangir and Hina Jilani, and became a major force for advocacy for the rights of women and the research and documentation of human rights abuses.
With the end of Zia’s regime and the return of elected governments in 1988, the women’s movement pushed for state recognition of women’s equal status and a legal regime that guaranteed the equality of women. The 1990s saw the expansion of a nationally prominent women’s movement and women-led civil society organisations that directly interacted with and confronted state power to demand the repeal of Zia’s laws and the implementation of laws that protect women from patriarchal violence.
Western donors and the United Nations provided funding to these organisations, allowing some of them to expand rapidly to major cities across Pakistan. These organisations developed ties to a global human rights community and, in particular, the global women rights movement that achieved crucial gains in the international human rights system through the decades of the ’80s and ’90s. Benazir Bhutto attended the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo and the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing. NGOs such as Shirkat Gah and Aurat Foundation participated in the conferences and also worked with the government to prepare conference reports.
The Pakistan government signed and ratified the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in 1996 in response to demands from WAF and other NGOs. Leading activists took roles in the United Nations human rights system, which enabled them to strengthen human rights norms globally and also enhanced the credibility of their domestic advocacy.

Jahangir was appointed a UN Special Rapporteur on extra-judicial killings and, then, freedom of religion. Jilani was appointed Special Representative to the Secretary General on Human Rights Defenders. NGOs also developed ties to feminists in South Asia, becoming founding members of South Asians for Human Rights (SAHR). Shirkat Gah joined a network of Muslim feminists known as Women Living Under Muslim Laws, to share experiences of women living in Muslim countries and to advocate for law reform.
 
 

Women’s rights activists and NGOs used their resources to raise awareness around pervasive violence against women during the decade of the 1990s. They led vigorous agitations against the ‘honour’ killings of women, which were reported in the media and highlighted by activists. The case of Samia Sarwar, who was killed by her mother in the law offices of Jilani after Sarwar had left her husband and sought a divorce, received widespread media and international attention. It stoked the flames of outrage against increasing reports of women being murdered with impunity.
‘Honour’ killings were exonerated because of amendments to the Penal Code provisions on murder and assault brought about as a result of Zia’s push to ‘Islamise’ criminal laws. Known as Qisas and Diyat amendments, which were first introduced through an ordinance and then enacted by parliament in 1997, these legal changes made murder a ‘compoundable’ offence — one for which punishment in the form of imprisonment could be avoided if the heirs of the victim agreed to be compensated by the murderer.
Activists highlighted incidents of sexual violence and condemned the failure of the state to hold perpetrators accountable for these incidents. The NGO War Against Rape, founded in 1989, publicised incidents of sexual violence and provided aid and legal representation to survivors. Activism through the 1990s led to increased public awareness and societal condemnation of gender-based violence, paving the ground for legislative changes that were to come years later.
Activism in Pakistan was fuelled by the international women’s rights movement of the 1990s that made violence against women one of its central advocacy goals. “Violence against women (VAW)” became an established phrase, assuming an important role in the international human rights system. The concept incorporated the recognition that violence in both public and private spheres falls within the human rights obligations of governments.
The 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights was a watershed moment for the recognition of women’s rights as human rights. The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action that emerged from the conference reflected the recognition that women have the right to be protected from violence in the private sphere. States acknowledged their responsibility to prevent and punish harms caused to women within the family and to address the harmful effects of traditional and customary practices.
 
 

The UN General Assembly passed a declaration in 1993, soon after the Vienna Convention, that recognised that violence against women “is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which have led to domination over and discrimination against women.” The declaration explicitly covered violence occurring in private as well as public life.
In 1994, a UN Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women was appointed who submitted annual reports to the UN General Assembly. These accomplishments of the international women rights movement reinforced the women’s movement in Pakistan against patriarchal violence, which gained strength through the 1990s and the first decade of the 20th century.
Activist fervour and donor-funded NGO agendas combined to lay the groundwork for criminal legislation on violence against women. The resistance of activists to gender-based violence and their inclination to hold the government accountable for its inaction met with the rights-based, law-reform-oriented priorities of NGOs, whose agendas were influenced by United Nations’ human rights norms and foreign donor priorities.
Resistance to the state, a hallmark of the 1980s activism, was tempered over a period of time to accommodate reformist agendas that found openings with Pakistan’s constitutional and legal framework to address patriarchal violence. Over time, activists and NGOs found allies in political parties and legislatures.

POLITICAL PARTIES AND LEGISLATORS
The return of civilian governance in the 1990s did not lead to a reversal of Zia’s regressive laws. Although much hope was placed in the first government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, it did not repeal the Zina Ordinances or discriminatory provisions in Zia’s law of evidence.
A former member of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and National Assembly, Dr Shahnaz Wazir Ali, notes that the PPP governments of the 1990s were continuously besieged by the military establishment and aggressive opposition within the parliament. In this environment, Benazir Bhutto and the PPP focused on political survival and could not afford to take on the religious right by repealing laws that were ascribed a religious justification.
The two tenures of Benazir Bhutto’s government (1988-1990 and 1993-96) did, however, create space for women activists and NGOs to advocate with legislators and government departments. Bhutto’s participation in the 1994 International Conference on Women and Development and the 1995 Beijing Conference signalled an openness to demands for gender equality and a willingness to engage with activists and NGOs.
In her second government, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto formed a Commission on the Inquiry of the Status of Women, which included lawyers and activists Asma Jahangir and Shahla Zia, and was chaired by a Supreme Court judge. The commission released its report in 1997, which gave comprehensive recommendations for political and legal reform in the areas of criminal laws, violence against women, family laws and political participation among others.
The recommendations in the area of criminal legislation included the repeal of Zia’s Hudood Ordinances. The commission’s report contained a chapter on the theme of Violence Against Women, which included a recommendation that “[s]pecific legislation on domestic violence by husbands or in-laws should be enacted” and that there “should be no mitigation of any sentence in any case of honour killing.” It also called for a law “making it mandatory for all employers to respond to and monitor incidents of violence and harassment in the workplace.”
 
 

The report also contained a chapter on ‘Institutionalisation’, which included recommendations on protection measures for persons vulnerable to violation. It called for shelters throughout the country that are “only protective and not custodial or reformatory.” The commission’s inquiry report included a set of recommendations on political participation. It recommended that 33 percent seats in both houses of parliament — the Senate and the National Assembly — be reserved for women, and that women in the reserved seats be elected directly.
In 1999, Pakistan’s short-lived experience with elected governments was cut short as another military leader, Gen Pervez Musharraf, came into power in a coup. Musharraf led the country until 2007. Unlike Pakistan’s previous military dictator, Musharraf made some attempts to portray a progressive outlook, including on issues of gender.
The most significant institutional reform during Musharraf’s years was the restoration of reserved seats for women in elected bodies. The 1973 Constitution provided five percent reserved seats for women in the National Assembly and provincial assemblies, but this provision lapsed in 1980. Musharraf’s Legal Framework Order of 2001 granted women 33 percent reserved seats at all three tiers of local government, and 17.5 percent in national and provincial legislative bodies.
This dramatically increased the representation of women in subsequently elected assemblies. Following the 2002 general elections, more than 70 women became members of the National Assembly. The National Assembly formed after the 2008 general elections had 76 women representatives (60 on reserved seats, and 16 on general seats).
National elections held in 2008 marked a return to civilian government, with the PPP emerging victorious in national elections after the assassination of its leader, Benazir Bhutto. The PPP came to power with the most progressive agenda among mainstream parties on the issue of gender. Its origins in populist democracy in the 1970s as well as its leadership by Benazir, the first Muslim woman to lead a Muslim country, are among the factors that contributed to its progressive outlook and rhetoric on gender.
The party also formed a government in the province of Sindh. The provincial assemblies acquired greater legislative power following the 18th constitutional amendment in 2010, which devolved more areas of governance from the federal government to the provinces.
With a critical mass of women legislators in the assemblies, the momentum for women’s rights and progressive legislation accelerated in the 2008-2013 period.
This period also saw the first woman speaker of the National Assembly, Fahmida Mirza, who supported the women legislators in their efforts to bring progressive legislation to the floor.  Women legislators formed cross-party alliances to pass these laws, using the Women Parliamentary Caucus as an important forum for discussion and debate on legislation. Civil society organisations also engaged with the caucus, providing crucial resources and support while lobbying for legislative measures.
National and provincial legislatures during this time passed a number of gender-progressive laws, including: the Protection against Harassment of Women in the Workplace Act 2010, the Acid Crime Prevention Act 2011, the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013 and the Sindh Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act 2013. This legislation was perceived to be ground-breaking, as it provided legal guarantees to women and girls of state protection against harassment, violence and traditional patriarchal norms in the private sphere of the home and the workplace.
The elected National Assembly completed its tenure and elections held in 2013 marked a shift in power to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), led by Nawaz Sharif. During its two tenures in the 1990s, the PML-N was no friend of the women’s movement or its causes. In his second stint in office (1997-99), Nawaz proposed a constitutional amendment that would give the federal government the power to enforce Shariah — a measure that was also strongly opposed by WAF, which saw it as an attempt to extend Zia’s ‘Islamisation’ agenda that would pave the way for more regressive legislation for women.
Sharif’s party’s attitude to women’s rights shifted somewhat when he took office in 2013. In 2016, the National Assembly made amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code that strengthened criminal penalties against rape and amended procedures for evidence collection in sexual assault cases.
The year 2016 also saw amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code that attempted to restrict the application of Qisas and Diyat provisions in the case of ‘honour’ killings against women — but, unfortunately, the amendments were not effective.
In 2016, the PML-N-dominated National Assembly passed the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), which contained criminal penalties for offending the “modesty of a natural person.” Free speech activists and journalists protested against the law that imposed draconian restrictions on online speech, but it was nonetheless enacted, while being portrayed as a law that would protect women in online spaces.
ASSESSING SUCCESS
These successes [towards law reform] nonetheless demand critical analysis and thorough assessment. This book attempts to critically assess the success attained by governance feminism in Pakistan in the legal recognition of many forms of violence against women and legislative enactments to introduce new criminal offences, enhance criminal penalties and establish protection mechanisms.
By tracing the background momentum that led to these changes, it considers why this particular solution — criminal regulation and accountability — gained more recognition than other potential approaches to tackle violence against women.
It looks at how the successes impacted the intended beneficiaries of these gains — women and girls who face patriarchal violence and how they attempted to utilise these legislative gains. It also sheds light on the costs of these gains, costs that may be incurred through both the failures of implementation as well as the successful utilisation of criminal law and processes as well as their failures.
Finally, it asks women rights activists in Pakistan who continue to raise concerns about gender-based violence to assess options for future advocacy. While working out how criminal justice-based approaches may be made more effective, they should also consider how approaches outside the criminal justice system may be explored and leveraged.
I suggest that these questions be answered not from a standpoint that idealises state power or an opposite perspective that rejects any emancipatory potential of state institutions. In fact, the evidence about the impact of gender-progressive laws illustrates that a superior framework rejects a state/non-state binary. Instead, it identifies elements of state power that can be harnessed to pursue feminist goals, while incorporating emancipatory activism that de-centres the punitive state.

Police officials said that 70 lawyers were nominated in the case, along with 150 to 200 unidentified persons, in an FIR lodged at the Secretariat Police Station on the complaint of IHCBA President Syed Wajid Ali Shah Gillani.
After registration of the case, the police obtained arrest warrants. Later, separate police teams raided different places, including the residences of 11 lawyers nominated in the FIR.
By evening, 17 raids had been conducted in the capital, but all remained unsuccessful as the nominated individuals had gone into hiding to avoid arrest.
Footage from CCTV cameras installed in and around the IHC and Constitution Avenue was also being obtained and examined to identify others involved in the clash.
 
 

According to the FIR, Advocate Gillani went to the parking area outside the IHCBA office, where he spotted 60 to 70 people dressed in lawyers’ uniforms along with 150 to 200 unidentified persons. They were chanting slogans against the IHC chief justice, state institutions and the army.
Advocate Gillani asked the lawyers to refrain from such acts, but the mob ‘attacked and manhandled him’. They also allegedly ‘verbally abused’ him and threatened him with dire consequences.
Office-bearers and staff of the IHCBA rescued him, after which the group dispersed.
In a post on her X account, Shireen Mazari stated that at 1am a heavily armed police party from the Secretariat Police Station surrounded her house and asked for Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatha.
“They were not there and we informed them. Police said there was an FIR against them and they should report to the police station, and then they left,” she wrote.
 






In another post, Ms Mazari said that all videos of the IHC protest clearly showed the FIR charges were false, adding that eyewitness accounts also confirmed this.
“But the persecution of Imaan and Hadi has become a daily routine by the state. Ironic that PTI lawyers’ support got the IHC bar president elected,” she added.
Reportedly, lawyers had staged a protest on the IHC premises to oppose the suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work.
However, tension flared when, after the demonstration, PTI-affiliated lawyers confronted the IHCBA president.

“If Afghanistan doesn’t give Bagram Airbase back to those that built it, the United States of America, BAD THINGS ARE GOING TO HAPPEN,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.
Trump said on Thursday that the United States had sought to regain control of the base used by American forces following the attacks of September 11, 2001. He told reporters on Friday that he was speaking with Afghanistan about it.
The withdrawal of American forces in 2021 led to a takeover of US bases, and the toppling of the US-backed government in Kabul, by the Taliban movement.
Afghan officials have expressed opposition to a revived US presence.
Current and former US officials privately caution that re-occupying Bagram air base in Afghanistan might end up looking like a re-invasion of the country, requiring more than 10,000 troops as well as deployment of advanced air defenses.
Trump, who has previously said he wants the United States to acquire territories and sites ranging from the Panama Canal to Greenland, has appeared focused on Bagram for years.
Asked on Saturday whether he would send in US troops to retake the base, Trump declined to give a direct answer, saying: “We won’t talk about that.”
“We’re talking now to Afghanistan and we want it back and we want it back soon, right away. And if they don’t do it — if they don’t do it, you’re going to find out what I’m gonna do,” he told reporters at the White House.
The sprawling airfield was the main base for American forces in Afghanistan during the two decades of war that followed the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington by Al Qaeda.
The base once counted fast-food restaurants like Burger King and Pizza Hut catering to US troops as well as shops selling everything from electronics to Afghan rugs. It also hosted a massive prison complex.
Experts say the sprawling air base would be difficult to secure initially and would require massive manpower to operate and protect.
Even if the Taliban accepted the US re-occupation of Bagram following negotiations, it would need to be defended from a host of threats including the terrorist Islamic State and Al Qaeda militants inside Afghanistan.
It could also be vulnerable to an advanced missile threat from Iran, which attacked a major US air base in Qatar in June after the United States struck Iranian nuclear sites.</p><small>2025-09-21 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/210832558f7c159.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943592/justices-vs-ihc' target='_blank'><strong>Justices vs IHC</strong></a><br><p>THE judiciary’s decline will be underwritten by the apathy of those it depends on to fight vigorously for its integrity and independence.
It is this realisation, perhaps, that prompted five senior judges of the Islamabad High Court to march to the Supreme Court on Friday. There, they lodged separate but similar petitions against what they, and many in the legal community, consider serious issues undermining the IHC’s integrity and independence.
Images of the five justices, seated around a table, waiting — as ordinary petitioners do — while court staff processed their paperwork quickly made their way to social media. They were shared widely as the nation processed with growing trepidation the most visible symptom yet of what seems to be the judiciary’s hastening collapse. The petitioner judges themselves framed it in similar terms: “The demolition of the IHC and its independence, that is being witnessed today, is only because the petitioner judges dared to object to the executive’s interference in their judicial work and uphold their oath as judges of the IHC.”
 
 

This is an alarming development. The judiciary, one of the pillars of the state, has signalled that it may be too divided to be able to keep the constitutional order stable. The implications of this will not be lost on the public. Nor should they be lost on the powerful. The authorities should not need reminding that the Constitution envisions a tripartite separation of powers whereby each branch of the state is supposed to be independent.
The doctrine is meant to keep any institution from accumulating so much power that the prospect of political tyranny becomes a possibility. Worryingly, Pakistan seems to be making itself quite comfortable with absolutism. Where once ideals like civil liberties and independent institutions found spirited champions willing to fight for them, one now sees a complacency that too often resembles complete surrender.
 
 

Perhaps it was frustration with the status quo that pushed five serving judges to take such an extreme step. When justice becomes hard to come by, it must be fought for. That this fight has been taken to a court is a sign that, perhaps, not all is lost. As long as the courts can be expected to do justice, there is hope for course correction. It is when hope is lost that anarchy takes over.
Other countries in this corner of the world have seen violent upheavals in recent years over different strains of state dysfunction. All those with power, political or any other kind, must therefore work to prevent any such crisis from unfolding in Pakistan. The constitutional order and the boundaries it demarcates must be respected, and the law should remain above all other considerations. It is time justice is done, and is seen to be done.

The petition was filed by citizen Ghulam Murtaza Khan through Barrister Zafarullah Khan Advocate, stating that the dissemination of “provocative and malicious” content from the account of a convicted prisoner is unlawful and contrary to prison rules.
The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated.
 
 

The petition further sought directions for blocking and removing such content from social media platforms.
It also called upon the court to instruct the jail superintendent to ensure that the prisoner is not allowed to access or operate social media in violation of jail regulations, terming such activity “unconstitutional and illegal.”
In addition, the petitioner asked the court to restrain PTI from redistributing or promoting any posts originating from the founder’s account during his imprisonment.

The IMF team is scheduled to visit Pakistan on Sept 25 to review the country’s performance under the $7 billion EFF arrangement, covering the first half of 2025. The review will assess Pakistan’s progress in meeting key economic targets for the March-June quarter.
Based on Topline’s estimates, Pakistan is likely to meet the IMF’s QPC, including targets related to net international reserves and swap positions. The primary balance numbers for FY25 are also well within the IMF’s projections, the report noted.
In addition to fulfilling IMF-mandated reforms, Pakistan is actively seeking foreign investment in emerging sectors such as offshore drilling, mining, and Web 3.0 technologies. A key milestone in this effort was the Pakistan Mineral Investment Forum 2025, held in April, which drew over 5,000 delegates from more than 50 countries.

Fund mission to assess economic performance from 25th as floods and inflation pressures persist

The report also highlighted renewed interest from the United States in Pakistan’s offshore hydrocarbon resources, which could play a crucial role in the development of the country’s untapped natural resources. The Reko Diq mining project, a flagship initiative, is expected to reach its financial close in the coming weeks.
However, Pakistan is also grappling with severe floods and heavy rains, affecting much of the country except for a few regions like Balochistan and Azad Kashmir. While the central bank has noted that the intensity of the current floods is less severe than past events, Topline cautioned that the floods could temporarily disrupt economic reforms. The report added that Pakistan’s resilient economy should recover from the impact in the near term.
The floods are expected to increase relief spending and further strain government revenues, leading to a projected rise in the fiscal deficit for FY26. Topline has revised its fiscal deficit forecast to 4.8 per cent of GDP, up from an earlier estimate of 4.1pc.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is now expected to collect Rs13.6 trillion in tax revenues for FY26, down from the earlier target of Rs14.1tr. This revision reflects a slower economic recovery and the expected impact of the floods on GDP growth.
GDP growth is now forecast to be between 2.75pc and 3.25pc, down from the previous range of 3.5pc to 4pc. Agriculture growth has been downgraded to 2.6pc, following expected crop losses of 15pc for rice and 10pc for cotton due to the floods.
The current account deficit is expected to remain within the 0-0.5pc range of GDP. Topline has revised its import growth forecast to 10pc (from 9pc), while lowering its export growth projection to just 1pc (from 4%). However, remittances are expected to grow by 6pc, with any higher growth in remittances acting as a positive offset to the current account deficit.
 
 

The report also indicated that the central bank is likely to maintain the policy rate unchanged through FY26, revising its previous assumption of a potential rate hike.
This shift is attributed to risks stemming from food inflation due to the floods, rising import bills, and geopolitical uncertainties, including recent tensions in Israel and Qatar, which could affect oil prices.

National Food Security and Research Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, in a statement on Saturday, highlighted that the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) has accredited the Citrus Research Institute’s post-entry quarantine facilities. This accreditation paves the way for the introduction of new, disease-resistant, and seedless kinno varieties that offer higher yields and greater consumer appeal.
Mr Tanveer emphasised that citrus, especially kinno, is a symbol of Pakistan’s agricultural strength. He noted that the government’s efforts are not limited to expanding fresh fruit exports; equal emphasis is also being placed on promoting seedless kinno and value-added citrus products such as juices, concentrates, and essential oils, which have higher market value internationally.
 
 

The government is also focusing on capacity building for growers and exporters through training programmes and workshops.
These initiatives aim to equip stakeholders with modern agricultural techniques and ensure compliance with international export requirements.

Introduces measures to boost global recognition of citrus

Furthering its international engagement, the minister pointed to Pakistan’s recent meeting with a Russian delegation in Islamabad as an example of expanding cooperation to strengthen citrus exports. In addition, more laboratories have been accredited across the country to speed up the testing and certification processes for agricultural products.
In a bid to facilitate farmers and exporters, the government has established a temporary outpost in Sargodha, Pakistan’s primary citrus-producing region. This facility will provide on-the-spot support and ensure the timely processing of export consignments.
The minister reiterated the government’s commitment to boosting citrus exports, particularly kinno, and ensuring that Pakistani citrus products maintain their presence in traditional markets while also reaching new destinations. These markets include Central Asia, Russia, the Middle East, Africa, and the European Union.
He also commended the DPP’s efforts in streamlining export procedures, such as reducing unnecessary testing for pesticide residues in kinno shipments.
Furthermore, the registration of new exporters for markets like Uzbekistan and other Central Asian countries is expected to broaden market access and create new trade opportunities for local farmers and exporters.

She claims to have been falsely implicated for political reasons.
Through her Advocate Sameer Khosa, Ms Shah argues that she had no involvement in the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House during the riots.
She maintained she was not named in the FIR, nor was she implicated throu­­gh supplementary statements.
No identification para­­de was conducted to establish her presence at the scene.
 
 

The trial, held inside Kot Lakhpat jail, resulted in 21 acquittals out of 51 accused, with 12 declared proclaimed offenders. Ms Shah was among the 18 convicted, recently sentenced to five years in prison and fined Rs100,000.
The appeal highlights that the prosecution’s case relied solely on her social media activity post-May 9, 2023.
However, the trial court scrutinized her entire online data without legal basis, terming the charges “defective, vague, and unsustainable.
The appeal stresses that the judgement was “assu­mption-based” and lacked credible evidence linking Shah to the alleged offenses.
Her legal team urged the Lahore High Court to set aside the Sept 9 verdict of the anti-terrorism court and acquit her of all charges.

We were driving to Leeds, UK, for a family commitment. It is about 2,300 kilometres away from where we live in Javea, Spain, a small town on the Mediterranean coast, midway between Valencia and Alicante.
In my relatively younger days, we thought nothing of driving a thousand kilometres in a day. But now, in my not-so-young days, my family does not agree to any plan that involves such long drives. We drive about 600 km at most and make night stops after being on the road for no more than six to seven hours.
Our night stops decided, accommodation booked, we thought we’d be happily on our way. But the French had other ideas. They vehemently safeguard their rights and, despite voting in a Conservative president committed to curtailing public expenditure, resent any cuts that impact their lives, healthcare plans, pensions, retirement age, to name just a few.
So, when their government presented a plan in parliament aimed at addressing what it said was a 44 billion-euro hole in the finances, the first casualty was the prime minister, who was voted out — not the same significance as in our parliamentary democracy, because France’s president is all-powerful, with the power to appoint one prime minister after another, which he promptly did.

America’s unconditional support to Israel is forcing a rethink in the Middle East and beyond.

An impromptu strike call was given by some parties and unions last week, which was partially successful. Then, this past Thursday, all the main unions joined in the strike call and pledged to shut down the country.
Since our arrival date was not flexible and neither was our departure, we decided to drive from our home in Spain to Clermont Ferrand in France, a distance of 1,100 km because we could not take the chance of being stranded due to the strike at our original night stop in Perpignan, just across the border from Spain — a town where Spaniards used to drive to watch films which the censors would block during the Franco dictatorship in their country.
Our amended plan meant staying two nights in Clermont Ferrand, which is home to the famous Michelin Tyres with a huge manufacturing unit and research laboratory situated here. Our drive took us through the picturesque Massif Central via the Norman Foster-designed Millau Viaduct (the world’s tallest bridge), which we saw being constructed when we first drove through the area in 1995. We stayed at one of the motorway (called autoroute in France) hotels for two nights.
After the 10-hour, 1,100 km drive, when we finally got to the room, a shattered me received my good friend and Dawn Magazines editor Hasan Zaidi’s ‘this is huge’ WhatsApp message, sharing a link, carrying the story of Pakistan’s mutual defence agreement with Saudi Arabia.
For as long as I can remember, the two nations have had very close defence ties, with Pakistani troops based in Saudi Arabia in the past for not just training their army but also acting as a reserve force in an internal security role. Even then, I have never read anything nearly as categorical as “an attack on one will be considered an attack on both”.
After Chinese mediation in recent years led to not just de-escalation in tensions between traditional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran, but also declarations of brotherhood, this defence accord can’t really be directed at Tehran.
In fact, it followed Israel’s missile attack on Qatari soil, apparently targeting the Hamas negotiating team said to be discussing a US proposal for hostage release and ceasefire in Gaza. Israel remained unapologetic and said it would again target its enemies wherever they were.
The attack seems to have brought home the realisation to the Arab Gulf leaders that the security umbrella the US extends to their states excludes protection from Israeli aggression as a totally different set of standards govern the conduct of the genocidal apartheid state.
“Pakistani military might, Saudi financial heft to redraw Gulf security map,” read the six-colu­­mn headline in The News, summing up the developm­ent. Whether the Gulf security map would be re­­drawn via this agreement will become clearer when the details emerge. But it has been signal­led that Saudi security won’t rely on a single sou­r­­ce, which proved unreliable in Qatar’s case. Qa­­tar was attacked despite being home to the US Ce­­ntral Command’s largest base in the Middle East.
 
 

Even the details, if made public, are unlikely to shed light on, for example, a nuclear umbrella for the kingdom. Equally, many Pakistanis would be keen to find out what kind of response the next possible aggression from India on our soil would evoke from Saudi Arabia. India is Saudi Arabia’s second-largest trading partner, while Saudi Arabia is India’s fifth.  Riyadh has pledged tens of billions of dollars in investment in India.
But America’s unconditional support to Israel is forcing a rethink not just in the Middle East ; it is leading to realignments beyond as well. Who knows if the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s collective or indivisible security may,  in the end, appear more appealing to the wealthy Arab Gulf states than reliance on the US, which has shown it supports Israeli ambitions at the expense of other allies, including those in the Gulf.
In fact, when the Muslim leaders’ emergency meeting in Qatar was calling upon the US to exerc­ise its influence over Israel for a ceasefire in Gaza, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was inaugurating the excavation of a tunnel (an ‘archaeological site’) which will end near the Al Aqsa Mosque and for which many Palestinians have been forcibly evicted from their homes in Jerusalem. Against this backdrop, the US-end­orsed Gaza genocide continues, billions around the world who oppose it are powerless to stop it.

This reunion comes after more than half a decade of both countries exploring alternative strategic alignments, only to return to their traditional partnership. The new defence pact, carrying significant strategic and geopolitical importance, has reignited debates across the Middle East and South Asia, where it is being interpreted through multiple lenses and perspectives.
The strains in Pakistan-Saudi relations had deepened when Islamabad chose to align with a new bloc led by Iran, Turkiye and Malaysia, an initiative that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman took as a serious affront. Personal tensions between former prime minister Imran Khan and MBS, often whispered about in policy circles at that time, further complicated matters. But the cracks had appeared earlier, when Pakistan refused to dispatch troops to Yemen, despite the red-carpet welcome prime minister Nawaz Sharif had received from King Salman bin Abdulaziz. The crown prince’s ambition to build an ‘Islamic Nato’ also faltered, pushing Riyadh to explore other strategic options, including strengthening ties with India and relying more heavily on the US for defence.
 
 

In this context, Saudi Arabia, along with the UAE, envisioned, with the US, an ‘India-Middle East Economic Corridor’ in 2023, conceived as a counterweight to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Pakistan, tied deeply to the BRI through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, found itself excluded from this alternative connectivity project.
During this period of strain, both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia tested the limits of their influence. Pakistan’s establishment pursued ‘patron shopping’, seeking new alliances and sources of support, while Saudi Arabia recalibrated its neighbourhood policy, mending ties with Iran, reimagining its partnership with Turkiye, and reshaping its strategic engagement with Russia.
At the same time, Pakistan sought to create inroads into Central Asia and the Baltic region, with a particular focus on Azerbaijan, while further strengthening its ties with Turkiye to fill the geopolitical void left by its estranged relationship with Saudi Arabia.
In short, over the past seven years, both nations have gone through bitter as well as sweet experiences, and there is hope that the foundation of their renewed relationship will prove as solid as before. One advantage for Pakistan this time is that the ‘Iran factor’ is less likely to strain ties, as it did in the past.
Saudi Arabia and Iran have already developed a functional state-to-state relationship. Tellingly, even as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed their new defence cooperation agreement, Iran’s foreign minister was in Riyadh on a follow-up visit to President Masoud Pezeshkian’s April trip to maintain the momentum of their relationship, which Tehran needs most in the volatile Middle East situation. During that visit, Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, met with both MBS and Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman, signalling a broader regional détente.

The future of renewed Pak-Saudi ties lies in standing together during difficult times.

Although the recent pact is not the first defence-related agreement between the two nations, one clause has drawn particular attention: “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”. For Pakistan analysts, the significance of this commitment, modelled on Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, lies in the Indian context, while many Saudi and Middle Eastern experts view it through the prism of Yemen and potential aggression from Israel.
As for Saudi-India relations, their trajectory is unlikely to change dramatically. Over the past two decades, both countries have invested heavily in economic, strategic, and political ties that cannot easily be reversed. Under Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia seeks to diversify its economy, reduce dependence on oil and attract foreign investment in areas where India is considered a vital partner. If conflict were to erupt between India and Pakistan, the most Riyadh would realistically do is attempt to mediate, as it did during the stand-off of May 2020.
 
 

A crucial lesson Saudi Arabia has drawn in recent years is that its relationship with Pakistan cannot be reduced to transactional security concerns or proxy wars. Despite past strains, the partnership remains broader and more profound. The future of this renewed relationship lies in standing together during difficult times, expanding military training and joint defence production, and building capabilities that not only strengthen both sides but also send a clear message to any potential aggressor: the Pakistan-Saudi friendship is not to be breached.
 
 

The optimism that followed the agreement — that it might pave the way for an Islamic bloc — is little more than an illusion. The rulers of Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states lack both the vision and the desire to pursue such a project, having long felt that sentimentality has yielded little in the past and is unlikely to pay off in the future.
The idea of an Islamic alliance is, in fact, more of a Tehran aspiration, born out of Iran’s relative isolation in the Muslim world and its need to project moral and ideological leadership. Beyond Iran, these utopian notions are sustained mainly by radicals, both violent and non-violent, within Muslim societies, as well as by ideologues who occasionally compel rulers to adopt such rhetoric, as has often happened in Pakistan. In reality, the idea remains impractical, especially when multiple Muslim nations continue to vie for leadership of the ummah.
The revived Pakistan-Saudi relationship, however, will bring tangible economic and financial benefits to Pakistan. Yet, one critical lesson for Pakistan’s power elites is that the country’s persistent economic fragility has itself strained ties with Riyadh. Time and again, Pakistani leaders have looked towards Saudi Arabia in moments of crisis, reducing the relationship to a lifeline for financial bailouts. True national strength does not lie in defence capabilities alone; it depends on internal cohesion and sustained economic growth.

The recommendation appears in the US Department of State’s 2025 Fiscal Transparency Report, released on Friday. The annual report reviews the openness of budgetary practices worldwide, assessing how governments publish, audit, and manage public funds.
“The military and intelligence budgets were not subject to adequate parliamentary or civilian public oversight,” the report stated in its Pakistan section. It added that “steps Pakistan could take to improve fiscal transparency include… subjecting the military and intelligence agencies’ budgets to parliamentary or civilian public oversight”.
The report also urged Pakistan to ensure the timely publication of its executive budget proposal. “The government… did not publish its executive budget proposal within a reasonable period,” the assessment noted, calling for earlier release of the document to enable informed debate and scrutiny.
 
 

On debt disclosure, the report found that “the government made only limited information on debt obligations, including major state-owned enterprise debt, publicly available.” It recommended “disclosing detailed information on government debt obligations, including for state-owned enterprises”.

Fiscal Transparency Report commends Pakistan’s audit institution, says it ‘meets international standards of independence’

While highlighting these shortcomings, the State Department acknowledged progress in other areas. It noted that Pakistan’s “enacted budget and end-of-year report [were] widely and easily accessible to the public, including online,” and that budget information was “generally reliable and subject to audit by the supreme audit institution.”
It also praised the independence of Pakistan’s supreme audit institution, saying it “met international standards of independence” and published audit findings within a reasonable period.
The report further observed that Pakistan “specified in law or regulation, and appeared to follow in practice, the criteria and procedures for awarding natural resource extraction contracts and licences,” and made “basic information on natural resource extraction awards publicly available”.
This year’s assessment echoes concerns raised in previous State Department reports, which have repeatedly pointed to gaps in debt transparency and the lack of legislative oversight of defence spending.
The report comes as Pakistan grapples with severe budgetary pressures. The government presented its budget for the fiscal year 2025-26, totaling Rs17.57 trillion. Of this, Rs9.7tr has been allocated for debt servicing, while Rs2.55tr has been set aside for defence — a nearly 20 per cent increase compared to last year.
The US recommendations are aimed at bolstering public trust and international confidence in Pakistan’s financial management at a time when external financing and investment remain critical to economic stability.
 
 

The 2025 Fiscal Transparency Report is a global assessment, evaluating fiscal practices in 140 governments and entities. It examines whether countries publish executive budgets in a timely manner, disclose debt obligations (including state-owned enterprises), maintain independent audit institutions, and ensure that sensitive spending — such as defence and intelligence — is subject to legislative or civilian oversight.

The civil defence agency said 11 were killed when warplanes struck the Dughmush family in the city’s Al-Sabra neighbourhood.
The assault came as 10 countries including Australia, Belgium, Britain and Canada are scheduled to formally recognise an independent Palestinian state on Monday, ahead of the annual gathering at the UN General Assembly.
Israel’s intensified military demolition campaign targeting high-rise buildings in Gaza City began this week alongside a ground assault.
 
 

Its forces, which control Gaza City’s eastern suburbs, have in recent days been pounding the Sheikh Radwan and Tel Al Hawa areas from where they would be positioned to advance on central and western parts of the city, where most of the population is sheltering.

Hamas warns lives of Israeli prisoners are in danger due to massive bombardment

Israel’s military estimates it has demolished up to 20 tower blocks over the past two weeks and believes some 350,000 people have left Gaza City since the start of this month. Another 600,000 or so remain, however.
 
 

Included in that tally are some of the Israeli prisoners being held by Hamas.
The group’s military wing released an image of the prisoners on Telegram on Saturday, warning that their lives were at risk due to Israel’s military operation in Gaza City.
In almost two years of fighting, Israel’s bombardment has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, spread famine, demolished most structures and displaced most of the population, in many cases multiple times.
Israel says the “war will end only if Hamas surrenders”, frees Israeli prisoners, disarms and disbands. Hamas says it will not disarm until a Palestinian state is established.
A total of 48 of the 251 Israelis taken prisoner on Oct 7, 2023, are yet to be released, but 28 are thought to be dead.
Hospital director traumatised
As Israel presses on with its offensive to capture the territory’s largest urban centre, Palestinians are going through unimaginable trauma.
The director of Al Shifa hospital was shocked and devastated when two victims killed in a strike were delivered to his ward: his brother and sister-in-law.
“I was shocked and devastated to see the bodies of my brother and his wife,” said Mohammed Abu Salmiya, who was working in the emergency department of the territory’s main hospital at the time.
“Anything is possible now, as you receive your dearest ones as martyrs or wounded,” he said. “The occupation’s crimes continue, and the number of martyrs keeps rising.”
A journalist saw ambulances with sirens blaring into the hospital compound, bringing more bodies of people killed by Israel’s bombardment of Gaza City.

• Says health, construction and agriculture sectors could lose over $1.5tr
ISLAMABAD: The World Economic Forum (WEF) warned in a fresh insight report that climate change, if left unaddressed, could result in 14.5 million excess deaths and trillion of dollars in economic loses by 2050, concentrated in the world’s most disadvantaged regions and populations.
The report, “Building Economic Resilience to the Health Impacts of Climate Change,” says deaths from extreme weather events in those regions have been about 15 times higher over the past decade.
It also warns that climate-health impacts threaten business resilience and that today, less than 5 per cent of global adaptation funding targets health protection. “This is a dangerous gap that also presents an opportunity for private-sector action,” the report said.
 
 

The WEF defines a Climate and Health Business Framework and applies it to four highly exposed sectors to identify specific climate-health risks and opportunities.
In food and agriculture, the report says an estimated 24m additional people will face hunger by 2050 and that agricultural workers are expected to face growing climate-health risks. It estimates a likely, mid-range scenario of $740 billion in worker-availability losses between 2025 and 2050.
“Businesses that invest in resilient and precision agriculture practices and modified working practices will be best positioned to meet growing global needs for consistently available, healthy foods,” the report said.
In the built environment, the forum notes that more than half of the world’s population lives in urban areas and that most buildings and infrastructure are poorly adapted for climate extremes such as heat and air pollution.
 
 

Construction workers are particularly vulnerable; the report projects a likely, mid-range scenario that the industry will lose at least $570bn in worker-availability losses between 2025 and 2050. It says climate-resilient design and retrofits have the potential to safeguard communities and economy.
The health and health-care sector is expected to face at least $200 billion in worker-availability losses in a likely, mid-range scenario from 2025 to 2050 and to bear an additional $1.1 trillion treatment burden due to climate change by 2050, the report says, underscoring the need for a shift toward preventive care.
“There is tremendous opportunity for companies to lead this transformation and build resilience by creating new climate-resilient medicines and robust care pathways, and improving public-health engagement,” it said.
Climate change is also driving up claims in health, life and casualty coverage. The report cites Swiss Re forecasting 0.75pc excess mortality annually by 2050.
Meanwhile, it notes, only about 8pc of people in low-income communities are covered by health insurance. Insurers, the report says, can support and accelerate resilience by offering innovative products, improving forecasting capabilities and incentivising risk reduction.
Taken together, it says, worker-availability losses across food and agriculture, the built environment and health and health care are projected to exceed $1.5 trillion between 2025 and 2050, underscoring the magnitude of the climate-health challenge.
While institutions in each sector can act, the report stresses that no sector can tackle the challenge alone.
“Success depends on enabling coordinated action — through supportive policies, interoperable climate-health data systems and innovative financing to mobilise capital,” it said. Those foundations, the WEF added, can help ensure long-term, scalable resilience.
The report highlights practical measures that can reduce illness and mortality in vulnerable regions: providing workers with medical care, implementing cooling solutions and modifying work practices. It also calls for expanded investment in research and development to advance science and develop solutions for climate-linked health challenges.
“By investing in research, businesses can help identify the root causes of climate-health risks and develop new treatments, technologies and preventive strategies,” the report said.

Over the past weeks, the PPP chairman and senior leaders have encouraged the use of the flagship income support initiative to provide relief to thousands of citizens affected by the monsoon floods. Earlier this week, its vice president, Sherry Rehman, had “strongly and repeatedly” advocated the use of BISP for the purpose in a Senate committee meeting.
On Saturday, another PPP leader Humayun Khan urged the government to do the same. His statement came days after PML-N leader and PM’s aide Rana  Sanaullah expressed apprehensions about the BISP, calling it unviable for a cash-strapped government. Rana Sana said the BISP could not be  continued in its current form — it either needed to be wrapped up or be  completely revamped.
The PML-N leader had suggested ‘Benazir Rozgar Scheme’ or ‘Hunarmand Scheme’ would be a more effective way to provide skills and employment opportunities to its beneficiaries instead of a monthly stipend. He had said the matter would be discussed in parliament, claiming that even some PPP leaders were also in agreement with this proposal.
In a statement on Saturday, PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan reiterated his party’s demand that relief activities should be fast-tracked through the BISP, named after former premier late Benazir Bhutto.
He said that the federal government should provide immediate financial assistance to the flood-affected families through the BISP. He emphasised the BISP was a “proven, transparent, and efficient mechanism capable of delivering direct support” to the country’s most vulnerable populations.
“In these critical times, the affected families are in desperate need of urgent support. BISP is the most reliable platform for ensuring swift and fair distribution of relief funds,” he said. The PPP leader urged the government to put aside political differences and act purely on humanitarian grounds, ensuring that relief efforts were carried out without delay or discrimination.
“This is not the time for political point-scoring. It is a time for solidarity and action. The government must mobilise all available resources to assist those in need through BISP’s transparent system,” he added.
At least 910 people have lost their lives in the torrential rains and flash floods across the country since June 26, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, APP reported on Sept 8. It was reported that 1,044 people were injured, 7,850 houses were destroyed, and 6,180 livestock were killed.

After conflict, amid cross-border tensions, a cricket match was perfect to lower temperatures, open dialogue, and start the long and winding road back to normality.
Cricket now deepens divisions. Pakistan and India have a great history of fierce but sporting competition but the extent of cricket’s politicisation is damaging the status of these games. India is responsible. J’accuse.
Instead of eager anticipation for Sunday’s Asia Cup match, the focus is on handshakes, cancelled press conferences, fan boycotts, and overt political statements by players. This is a game in a tournament that matters little, in a group stage that feels unnecessary, between players that are ill-matched. In the grand scheme of things it’s a nothing match but the political agendas surrounding a game may never have been so corrosive.
The blame for this lies firmly at the door of the Board of Control for Cricket in India. Yes, the Pakistan Cricket Board has played its part with missteps, but the BCCI has nurtured an environment that is in direct contravention to the norms of international sport. International Cricket Council, the sport’s theoretical ruling body, is nothing more than a wholly owned subsidiary of the BCCI — the international arm of the BCCI’s commercial operations.
This is a shameful situation. It’s false to pretend that cricket was never political. It’s probably the most politicised sport in the world, which is why the international game is surrounded by so much passion and emotion.
However, one purpose of cricket is to simultaneously allow that fervour to play out on a sports field — war minus the shooting — while the players, fans, and match officials show how it is possible to compete intensely but retain mutual respect and civility.
Cricket was politicised when it was run by Australia and England under the guise of the Imperial Cricket Conference (1909 to 1963), and then the International Cricket Conference (1964 to 1988). Despite the underlying colonialism and racism in those structures, the spirit of cricket was held up as a virtue best demonstrated on the cricket field. “It’s not cricket,” was a phrase that extended beyond the sport to highlight unfairness and wrongdoing.

Pakistan meet India in Super 4 clash of Asia Cup today

Looking back now, possibly with a Pakistan-tinted lense, the moment when the teams competing for the 1992 World Cup lined up on tiered seating, in coloured clothing, on a boat in front of the Sydney harbour bridge, with South Africa newly welcomed back to the fold, was the highest watermark in the ambitions for cricket as a truly global and unifying force. What would we give now for the naive optimism of that time?
The rest we know. Pakistan thrillingly won the first globally televised World Cup, losing to India on the way — as they tend to do in tournament cricket. The Asian nations wrestled control of the recently formed ICC — Pakistan and India working together to unseat Australia and England. Only for India to drop Asian allegiances, in particular with Pakistan, to realign themselves with Australia and England.
The pretence now is that the voice of any country other than India matters. We know why there is no sanction from the ICC, the BCCI subsidiary. But why is there silence from Australia and England, those moral high horse riders, when India refuses to uphold the spirit of cricket by refusing to shake hands with Pakistan, and India’s captain makes a pre-planned and overtly political statement at the post match conference. You can be sure if a player expressed a view on the genocide in Gaza they would be immediately censured.
The answer is money. Australia and England will say nothing because they are commercially dependent on India. The BCCI is motivated by money too. How is it that Pakistan and India end up in the same group in every global or regional tournament? It’s no mystery, of course. The cash cow needs milking.
Money is also the explanation for the BCCI playing both sides over the controversy of the Asia Cup. Despite the calls from India for a boycott against Pakistan, the BCCI wants its money from the tournament. But to appease its domestic zealots, the matches between India and Pakistan are tactically politicised.
Unfortunately in all this, cricket is barely discussed. The brief history of Pakistan India matches in tournaments is that Pakistan were the better team in the 20th Century.
India, nonetheless, did tend to beat Pakistan in ICC tournaments albeit with the air of plucky underdogs. The momentum shifted with the beginning of the 21st Century, when India’s power grew and Pakistan’s declined — on and off the field.  Since then Pakistan has had moments of superiority: the 2009 T20 World Cup, the 2016 Test Championship, and the Champions Trophy of 2017.
However, the trends in cricketing performance and political power have been relentlessly downwards. Pakistan cricket is weak on and off the field, while India dominates. Pakistan still has talented players, but they are forced unready into international cricket and their talent destroyed.
 
 

The question for the politicians of Pakistan and the PCB is whether the individuals involved can put their personal agendas to one side and re-establish Pakistan as a force in international cricket? Pakistan does not have the commercial power of other countries. It is being politically outmanoeuvred and sidelined by India. The only way back, therefore, is through performance on the cricket field.
At the moment, we expect little. Pakistan are the underdogs, particularly because the batsmen have failed to deliver. They haven’t even done much against the minnows. Yet, there is potential here, and the only vague hope that Pakistan holds is that one of the batsmen, Saim Ayub or Hassan Nawaz, produces a match-winning cameo.
Maybe even Fakhar Zaman and Mohammad Haris might do something match winning. Stranger things have happened, except that there is nothing to suggest that Pakistan are in the right mindset to overcome a superior team.
Pakistan arrive at the Super Fours of the Asia Cup with a squad lacking experience and confidence, a coach lacking a track record, and a world game lacking integrity. The odds are entirely against a Pakistan win. But hope never dies in the heart of a cricket fan — and whatever the result here in Dubai, the scene of many Pakistan triumphs over India, Salman Agha’s team have every chance of finding themselves in the final in a week’s time.

• Mills barred from using wheat for manufacturing poultry feed
LAHORE: The Punjab government has stepped up measures, including geotagging of stocks, to avert a potential wheat crisis in the province after floods in the eastern rivers washed away farmlands and destroyed stockpiles in its central districts.
The move comes amid restrictions on the interprovincial movement of the commodity by the provincial government, which has raised prices in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by up to 68 per cent, also prompting protests by Sindh and KP.
Sources told Dawn that the decision to restrict the wheat trade was taken to ensure an ample supply of the grain in the province and to avert a looming crisis. Besides this measure, the Punjab Price Control and Commodities Management also decided to start geotagging and physically verifying wheat stocks in warehouses across the province.
 
 

Its secretary Dr Kiran Khurshid notified a four-member departmental monitoring committee led by Deputy Secretary Shazia Rehman to collect data from all districts in collaboration with the Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera) and the food directorate. Through this practice, the wheat stocks stored in government and private warehouses will be registered to meet the food crisis feared in the aftermath of the floods.
Dr Khurshid said her department would implement the government policy to avert the unpredictable and unforeseen crisis post-floods. She said people had lost massive wheat stocks in the recent floods and now it was the government’s responsibility to take care of its citizens.
She said the price control and commodities department was geotagging wheat warehouses to gather information about the actual stocks and resources for predictive analysis and anticipative planning.
“The geotagging is just an intervention, not a solution,” she said, adding that it would take time to trace wheat.
She said the department had established a strategic management wing (SWM) to digitise the department’s assets, resources and activities of the department’s eight directorates. “All the scattered information would be available for the department and higher authorities in one dashboard for monitoring and taking informed decisions,” she said.
 
 

The Punjab Home Department, at the request of the price control department, had also imposed Section 144 and prohibited the mills in the province from using 10,184 metric tonnes of wheat for feed manufacturing.
Interprovincial curbs
Sources said the provincial government was keeping a strict check on the movement of wheat at the exit points of the province. They claimed that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had made it clear that her foremost duty was to stave off a food crisis in her province and ensure that the citizens got their due wheat share through government packages or other means.
She had also been quoted as saying that some four million people had been affected by floods and the executive machinery needed to ensure the availability of wheat for the flood survivors.
The price control secretary, Dr Khurshid, also acknowledged that Punjab was monitoring the wheat movement at the Sindh and KP borders because “businessmen would always like to sell their commodities, where they would get a better price”.
“In this situation, the government’s role is to ensure that wheat stocks in the province meet the needs of its people. It will be insane if the government lets its wheat go to other provinces at a lower price and later purchase it at a higher cost for its own people,” Dr Khurshid said. It may be mentioned that the government had not purchased wheat and there were no hefty stocks in government warehouses.
Meanwhile, the department arrested 107 profiteers, fined 12,043 profiteers, and registered cases against seven individuals. In the matter of over-charging in wheat flour prices, the department officials arrested 18 officials, registered cases against four individuals and fined 1,074 persons. In a crackdown on hoarders, the department has already recovered 334,000 metric tonnes of wheat across the province.
These measures helped increase wheat stocks in flour mills by 165,000 metric tonnes this month alone.
Additionally, the grinding of 360,000 metric tonnes of wheat has ensured a steady supply of flour and brought down wheat prices from Rs3,800 to Rs3,000 per 40kg.

A first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Sukkur’s Kandhra police station under sections 114 (abettor present), 428 (mischief by killing or maiming animal with value of Rs10 or more), 429 (killing or maiming cattle, etc, of any value), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the complaint of Ghulam Mustafa.
The incident took place at 2pm yesterday, according to the FIR, wherein three suspects were nominated.
According to the complainant, when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond on the land, one of the suspects hit one of them with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor.
The complainant said he kept pleading with the suspects to spare the camel, but they did not listen.
According to the FIR, the suspects reacted angrily, saying that the camel had destroyed crops.
Sukkur Senior Superintendent of Police Azhar Mughal said while speaking to the media that police had arrested two of the suspects.
This was also confirmed in a post on X by the  Sindh Chief Minister House’s official account. It said that police had so far arrested two suspects and the hunt for a third suspect was under way.
 






The statement also condemned the “the gruesome” attack, adding that the CM had ordered strict action against the culprits.
On the CM Murad Ali Shah’s directive, Sukkur District Council Chairman Syed Kumail Hyder Shah was “supervising” the injured camel’s treatment, it added.
 






Kumail Shah also posted about the incident on X, saying: “Heartbreaking to witness such cruelty against a helpless camel in Rohri.
“I’ve personally spoken to the owner, the wounded camel has been shifted to Karachi for immediate treatment. No animal should ever suffer such cruelty, every life, human or voiceless, deserves compassion and care.”
 






Separately, Sukkur Commissioner Abid Saleem told Dawn.com on the phone that the camel was shifted to Karachi after coordination with a private sector organisation that deals with such cases of injuries.
He said the camel would undergo surgery on its leg, adding that she had also sustained injuries on her jaw.
 
 

Meanwhile, the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) Benji Project for Animal Welfare in Karachi, which had helped another mutilated camel stand back with a prosthetic leg, said earlier today that its veterinary doctors would examine the camel.
“On Friday, September 19, a two-year-old female camel suffered unspeakable abuse in Sukkur. She had wandered onto land in search of water, where the landowner viciously broke her leg and then dragged her with a tractor,” the CDRS project wrote in a post on Instagram.
The organisation said it “immediately began coordinating with the Government of Sindh to rescue her”, adding that it was extremely grateful to Faryal Talpur, Sukkur MPA Awaiz Shah and MPA Sumeta Syed “for their efforts in helping us secure this camel […] and for so vehemently taking action”.
“Once our vets have examined her properly, we will share an update,” CDRS said, affirming that its team will try its “very best to give her love, comfort, and some semblance of peace”.

“There are no words left to explain the cruelty we continue to see. It is unimaginably painful to witness these beautiful, voiceless beings — created in such perfection and innocence — suffering at the hands of humans who were meant to protect them. All we can do is keep standing up for them and take one day at a time,” CDRS wrote.
A statement from CM Shah’s office said the camel was moved to the CDRS shelter and named “Sumi”.
It added that as per the shelter administration, her leg was crushed, jaw was broken, tongue was burnt and there were serious injuries on her body. The chief minister was told that she could not eat and was being administered intravenous fluids.
“On the instructions of the Sindh CM, Livestock Secretary Kazim Jatoi has been entrusted with the responsibility of providing the best treatment for Sumi,” the statement said.
The shelter posted various videos on its Facebook page of the treatment being provided to her.
The recent incident bears similarity to that of Cammie, a camel who had her front leg chopped off allegedly by a landlord in June 2024 as punishment for foraging in his field for fodder. She was taken in by the CDRS Benji Project, where she got her prosthetic leg in July and is still in care.

“Pakistan will not be holding their pre-match press conference today,” ACC said in a short statement.
Andy Pycroft will be officiating the match as the referee again after last week’s controversy.
A senior Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official confirmed to Dawn.com that the board had moved on after Pycroft’s ‘apology’ and had no issue with his appointment for the Pakistan-India match.
 
 

The Group A clash between the fierce rivals last Sunday ended on a bitter note when Indian players refused to shake hands with their opponents.
It was the first meeting between the regional neighbours since a four-day conflict in May left more than 70 people dead.
While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end.
Then, at the post-match ceremony, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav seemingly ‘politicised’ the victory by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country.
PCB called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Yadav before the match.
Pakistan’s last group game — which they won easily against the United Arab Emirates — was delayed for an hour due to the stand-off before the matter was resolved with Pycroft’s apology.
Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for Sunday’s clash.
India won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively.
Ramiz Raja says Pakistan need to ‘reset’ strategy
Former PCB chairperson Ramiz Raja said Pakistan “need to reset their strategy as it’s not working out.”
Speaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan, “This strategy, which is akin to a sparkler that fizzles out quickly, is not working out at all,” the former Pakistan men’s captain said.
The team needs to get to a 150+ score first, Ramiz said, adding that the over-reliance on all-rounders was not the way to go.
“If Saim Ayub or Hassan Nawaz are critical players and if they fire tomorrow, then I see Pakistan competing with India,” Ramiz said.
He also said that the dot-ball percentage needed to go down for the Green Shirts.
Speaking on the Indian team’s refusal to shake hands, he said, “Who resorts to things like this in this day and age?”

Last Sunday’s match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to boycott the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands, as is customary, at the toss and after the match.
A potential third India-Pakistan showdown looms if both sides qualify for the final on September 28 in Dubai.
India lifted the Asia Cup in its last, 50-over edition and were the favourites to retain the crown.
Pakistan and India advanced to the next stage from Group ‘A’, while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh qualified from Group ‘B’.
Along with regional bragging rights, the Asia Cup serves as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.</p><small>2025-09-20 19:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624728-pakistan-saudi-pact-creates-superpower-presence-boosts-defence-ties-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-Saudi pact signals emerging joint Muslim 'superpower', says Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>

“Despite the foreign ministry’s cooperation with the [International Atomic Energy] Agency and the presentation of plans to resolve the issue, the actions of European countries will effectively suspend the path of cooperation with the agency,” the Supreme National Security Council said in a televised statement.
Britain, France and Germany were among the parties to a 2015 deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that gave Iran relief from UN sanctions in return for UN-monitored restrictions on its nuclear activities.
 
 

The three governments say Iran has reneged on its commitments under the deal which has been effectively moribund since Washington pulled out in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term.
The UN Security Council voted on Friday, after European pressure, to reimpose the UN sanctions on Iran.
Russia slammed the vote earlier today and warned of a risk of an “escalation of tensions”.
“The Russian side has repeatedly pointed out the provocative and illegal nature of the actions of the European countries participating in the JCPOA,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
“These actions have nothing to do with diplomacy and lead exclusively to a further escalation of tensions surrounding the Iranian nuclear program,” the Russian ministry said.
In August, Moscow warned that the reimposition of sanctions against Iran, its key ally, risked “irreparable consequences”.
Tehran and Moscow have been bolstering political, military and economic ties over the past decade as Russia drifted away from the West.
Relations between the two countries grew even closer after Russia launched its offensive in Ukraine.</p><small>2025-09-20 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/201046448a15cd9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943398/trumps-100000-fee-for-h-1b-visas-a-tech-industry-favourite-concerns-india' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, a tech industry favourite, concerns India</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Friday ordered an annual $100,000 fee be added to H-1B skilled worker visas, creating potentially major repercussions for the tech industry where such permits are prolific.
The new measure, which could likely face legal challenges, was announced alongside the introduction of a $1 million “gold card“ residency programme that Trump had previewed months earlier.
“The main thing is, we’re going to have great people coming in, and they’re going to be paying,” Trump told reporters as he signed the orders in the Oval Office.
Later, the White House issued a major clarification to the new visa policy, saying the $100,000 fee will be a “one-time” payment imposed on new applicants.
“This is a one-time fee that applies only to the petition. It only applies to new visas, not renewals or current visa holders,” a White House official said on condition of anonymity.
H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.
The United States awards 85,000 H-1B visas per year on a lottery system, with India accounting for around three-quarters of the recipients.
Large technology firms rely on Indian workers who either relocate to the United States or come and go between the two countries.
Tech entrepreneurs — including Trump’s former ally Elon Musk — have warned against targeting H-1B visas, saying that the United States does not have enough homegrown talent to fill important tech sector job vacancies.
“All the big companies are on board,” said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who joined Trump in the Oval Office.
Trump has had the H-1B programme in his sights since his first term in office, but faced court challenges to his earlier approach, which targeted the types of jobs that qualify. The current iteration has become the latest move in the major immigration crackdown of his second term.
According to Trump’s order, the fee will be required for those seeking to enter the country beginning Sunday, with the Homeland Security secretary able to exempt individuals, entire companies, or entire industries.
The order expires in a year, though Trump can extend it.
The number of H-1B visa applications has risen sharply in recent years, with a peak in approvals in 2022 under then-president Joe Biden.
In contrast, the peak in rejections was recorded in 2018, during Trump’s first term in the White House.
The United States approved approximately 400,000 H-1B visas in 2024, two-thirds of which were renewals.
Trump also signed an order creating a new expedited pathway to US residency for people who pay $1 million, or for corporate sponsors to pay $2 million.
“I think it’s going to be tremendously successful,” Trump added.
India says visa fee hike could disrupt families
India’s foreign ministry has said that the Trump administration’s move to increase H1-B visa fees was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy.
 






Meanwhile, India’s leading trade body Nasscom has said the timeline for implementing the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas for high-tech workers in the United States was a “concern”.
“A one-day deadline creates considerable uncertainty for businesses, professionals, and students across the world,” it said in a statement after President Donald Trump announced the fee, which comes into force from Sunday.
It added that policy changes of this scale were best “introduced with adequate transition periods, allowing organisations and individuals to plan effectively and minimise disruption.”
India’s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi shared clippings of previous developments as well as the current one on X to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“I repeated, India has a weak PM,” he wrote.
 






South Asia Analyst Michael Kugelman, in a post on X, said: “The new H1B visa fee is the latest blow to what’s long been one of the most resilient elements of US-India partnership: People-to-people ties.”

Having been rolled over by Sri Lanka in the first round, Bangladesh got their act together after winning the toss and choosing to bowl first.
Bangladesh required 10 runs off 10 balls with seven wickets in hand but the dismissal of Hridoy spiced things up. He was trapped leg before by Dushmantha Chameera in the 19th over, and Dasun Shanaka then struck twice in the last over to keep the contest alive.
In the end, tail-ender Nasum Ahmed scampered a cheeky single to cover off the penultimate ball to see Bangladesh home.
Their bowlers had set it up by limiting Sri Lanka to 168 for seven on a belter of a track and thanks to Hridoy and Hassan, Bangladesh crossed the line with one delivery to spare.
Sri Lanka could have been bundled out for much less, but three spilt catches let them off the hook. In the end, the drops didn’t hurt as the chase looked comfortable.
 






Hassan provided an electric start, making the most of the powerplay with 61 off 45 balls studded with two fours and four sixes. Hridoy ensured they didn’t waste the opportunity, posting 58 off 37 with four fours and two sixes. In the process he brought up 1000 T20I runs.
Sri Lanka rued being a bowler short as part-timers filled in four overs and Bangladesh cashed in gleefully.
All-rounder Dunith Wellalage featured after landing in Dubai the morning of the game, having returned home to Colombo to pay his last respects to his father who passed away on Thursday.
Former captain Shanaka had earlier top-scored for Sri Lanka with 64 off 37, his first half-century since January 2023.
The pitch for the match was the same as the one used for the Pakistan-UAE clash.
From Group A, Pakistan and India will face each other in their second encounter of the tournament tomorrow.
A potential third Pakistan-India showdown looms if both sides qualify for the final on September 28 in Dubai.

The new guidelines, laid out in a lengthy memo distributed to reporters on Friday, require them to sign an affidavit promising to comply, or risk losing their media credentials.
The move is the latest by the administration of President Donald Trump to control media coverage of his policies, after he suggested that negative stories could be “illegal.”
The Pentagon “remains committed to transparency to promote accountability and public trust,” the memo says.
But it adds: “Information must be approved for public release by an appropriate authorising official before it is released, even if it is unclassified”, effectively barring material sourced to unnamed officials.
This new restriction would apply to both classified and “controlled unclassified information.”
The memo also details sweeping new restrictions on where Pentagon reporters can actually go without official escorts within the military’s vast headquarters just outside Washington.
“The ‘press’ does not run the Pentagon — the people do,” Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote on X. “The press is no longer allowed to roam the halls of a secure facility. Wear a badge and follow the rules — or go home.”
 






The new rules come months after Hegseth faced stark criticism for revealing timings of US air strikes on Yemen’s Houthis in a Signal group chat that inadvertently included a reporter.
Hegseth, a former Fox News co-host and Army National Guard veteran, was also reported to have shared those details in a separate Signal group chain that included his wife.
A spokesperson for The New York Times — a frequent target of Trump’s ire — called the new rules “yet another step in a concerning pattern of reducing access to what the US military is undertaking at taxpayer expense.”
National Press Club President Mike Balsamo hit out at the new rules, and called on the Pentagon to quickly rescind them.
“If the news about our military must first be approved by the government, then the public is no longer getting independent reporting,” Balsamo said in a statement. “It is getting only what officials want them to see. That should alarm every American.”
Trump terms his negative media coverage ‘illegal’
A day prior, Trump bashed US media coverage that he claimed was unduly negative and therefore “illegal,” stoking a debate over free speech following the suspension of comedian Jimmy Kimmel’s TV show by ABC.
“They’ll take a great story and they’ll make it bad. See, I think it’s really illegal, personally,” Trump, who has sued multiple major news organisations this year, told reporters gathered in the Oval Office.
The 79-year-old Republican, an avid television watcher, chiefly focused his diatribe on US television networks, reiterating a claim that coverage of him and his administration is “97 per cent bad”.
 


He also defended the head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Brendan Carr, whose threats against broadcasters have sparked a national debate over free speech and caused some unease even among Republicans.
Carr on Wednesday criticised Kimmel’s remarks on the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and threatened broadcasters who carry his show with possible sanctions. Hours later, ABC announced Kimmel’s show was suspended indefinitely.
On Friday, Trump called Carr “an incredible American patriot with courage.”
Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a close Trump ally, meanwhile, said he believes it’s dangerous for a government to put itself in a position to say what speech it may or may not like.
Commenting on Carr’s threat to fine broadcasters or pull their licenses over the content of their shows, Cruz referenced a Martin Scorsese gangster movie.
“I got to say that’s right out of Goodfellas,” Cruz said. “That’s right out of a mafioso coming into a bar, going, ‘Nice bar you have here. It would be a shame if something happened to it.’”
Trump himself faced a setback in his personal anti-media crusade, with a federal judge issuing a scathing ruling and tossing out his $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times.</p><small>2025-09-20 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/20220935b51578f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943451/iaea-praises-pakistans-partnership-progress-in-peaceful-nuclear-programme' target='_blank'><strong>IAEA praises Pakistan’s partnership, progress in peaceful nuclear programme</strong></a><br><p>The country’s nuclear programme has received recognition from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in addition to Pakistan’s steady progress and close cooperation with the agency.
In a post on X following his meeting with Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) Chairman Raja Ali Raza Anwar on the sidelines of the 69th IAEA General Conference in Vienna, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi highlighted Pakistan’s achievements in expanding its civil nuclear energy capacity.
He observed that Pakistan’s nuclear power programme was advancing “at a good pace”, particularly with the ongoing construction of Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Unit-5 (C-5).
Grossi recalled witnessing the first concrete pouring at the site in February, which he described as a “major milestone in Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen energy security through clean and sustainable nuclear power”.
 






The IAEA DG and PAEC chairman reviewed areas of cooperation under various agency initiatives.
These included Atoms4Food, which applies nuclear technology to improve crop yields, food safety and pest control, and Rays of Hope, which aims to expand access to nuclear medicine and radiotherapy for cancer care across the Asia-Pacific region.
Grossi appreciated Pakistan’s active engagement with the agency, especially in capacity-building, training, and the application of nuclear knowledge for socio-economic development.
He noted that Pakistan continued to serve as an important partner in the peaceful uses of nuclear science and technology.
The PAEC chairman reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the peaceful applications of nuclear technology, in line with national development priorities and IAEA frameworks. He underlined that Pakistan’s nuclear power plants operated under the highest safety standards and contributed significantly to the energy mix by providing reliable, low-carbon electricity.
“The PAEC’s activities were closely aligned with the IAEA’s vision of promoting nuclear technology for peace, health, and prosperity,“Anwar added.
The meeting also provided an opportunity to discuss Pakistan’s contributions to regional initiatives under the IAEA, particularly in the Asia-Pacific, where Pakistani expertise in nuclear applications is being shared with other member states.
The Pakistani delegation reiterated the country’s resolve to continue working with the IAEA and member states in advancing peaceful nuclear cooperation, sustainable development and improved quality of life for people across the region.
Pakistan and the IAEA signed the fifth Country Programme Framework (CPF) for 2026-2031 on the sidelines of the IAEA General Conference on Wednesday.
The CPF 2026-2031 stands as a testament to the enduring partnership between Pakistan and the IAEA. Its implementation will strengthen Pakistan’s socio-economic development and reinforce its role as a responsible member state committed to the global mission of the IAEA, a press release of PAEC said.
 






The country programme outlined national priorities where nuclear science and technology will directly support socio-economic development. It builds on decades of collaboration and aligns with Pakistan’s development agenda and international commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals.
Covering three technical cooperation cycles, it identified five key areas: food and agriculture, human health and nutrition, climate change and water resource management, nuclear power, and radiation and nuclear safety.</p><small>2025-09-20 17:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2016244325b8ec3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943427/americans-would-dominate-board-of-new-tiktok-us-entity-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>Americans would dominate board of new TikTok US entity: White House</strong></a><br><p>A deal for the Chinese parent company of popular video-sharing app TikTok to sell its US operations would see the creation of a board dominated by Americans, the White House said on Saturday.
“There will be seven seats on the board that controls the app in the United States, and six of those seats will be Americans,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.
She said a deal could be signed “in the coming days.”
 


The United States has forcefully sought to take TikTok’s US operations out of the hands of Chinese parent company ByteDance for national security reasons. Under President Donald Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden, the US Congress passed a law to force ByteDance to sell its US operations or face a ban on the app.
US policymakers, including in Trump’s first term, have warned that China could use TikTok to mine data from Americans or exert influence on what they see on social media.
But Trump turned to the platform, which is hugely popular with young Americans, to garner support during his ultimately successful 2024 presidential campaign. The Republican president has repeatedly pushed off implementation of the ban while a deal has been sought.
Investors reportedly being eyed to take over the app include Oracle, the tech firm owned by Larry Ellison — one of the world’s richest people — and a major Trump supporter.
Leavitt seemed to confirm Oracle’s participation.
“The data and privacy will be led by one of America’s greatest tech companies, Oracle, and the algorithm will also be controlled by America as well,” she told Fox News. “So all of those details have already been agreed upon. Now we just need this deal to be signed.”
Earlier, China stuck to its stance on the future of TikTok in the United States, a day after  Trump said a deal to switch ownership was progressing.
“China’s position on TikTok is clear: The Chinese government respects the wishes of the enterprise, and welcomes it to carry out commercial negotiations in accordance with market rules to reach a solution compliant with China’s laws and regulations, and strikes a balance of interests,” China’s Commerce Ministry said in a statement, reiterating a position it has maintained over the past week.
Questions remain, including the precise ownership structure of TikTok, how much control China will retain over the app’s inner workings, and what Beijing gets from backing down and letting the US muscle in on one of China’s most successful companies.
Progress over the future of the social media app, which has 170 million US users, is seen as key to unlocking concessions in other areas — from aeroplanes to soybeans — as the world’s two largest economies chart a path beyond their current tariff truce.
“It is hoped that the US side will work towards the same goal as China, earnestly fulfil its corresponding commitments, and provide an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory business environment for the continued operation of Chinese enterprises in the US, including TikTok,” the Commerce Ministry statement added.
Since a framework deal was struck in Madrid earlier this week, Chinese officials and state media have called it a “win-win”, promising to review TikTok’s technology exports and intellectual property licensing.
The framework deal was one hurdle Trump needed to clear to keep TikTok open. The US Congress had originally ordered the app to be shut down for US users by January 2025 if its US assets were not sold by Chinese owner ByteDance.
He Yadong, a spokesperson for China’s Commerce Ministry, reiterated China’s hope that the US reduce the barriers to trade facing Chinese firms, when asked what Beijing had got out of the Madrid deal during a news conference on Thursday.</p><small>2025-09-20 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2017522255a9a9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1943435/five-children-among-7-killed-in-punjabs-hafizabad-district-roof-collapse-police' target='_blank'><strong>Five children among 7 killed in Punjab’s Hafizabad district roof collapse: police</strong></a><br><p>Seven people, including five children, died when the roof of a room in a house collapsed in the Farooq Azam neighbourhood of Punjab’s Hafizabad district on Saturday, according to police.
Hafizabad District Police Officer (DPO) Atif Nazir Kadhar said in a statement that a woman and her son were holding tuition classes in the affected house when the room’s roof collapsed. “As a result, the woman, her son and five children who were taking tuition classes died.”
The statement said DPO Kadhar reached the site after receiving information about the incident and oversaw the rescue work.
According to data shared by the Rescue 1122, one child also suffered a critical head injury in the incident.
 


Last month, three members of a family died after the roof of their under-construction house caved-in in the Islampura locality of Nankana Sahib in Punjab.
Earlier in July, two children had died and two other were injured when the roof of a house collapsed in Lahore’s Badami Bagh.

The accused pled not guilty to murdering Yousaf, who was shot dead at her house in June.
During the hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Mohammad Afzal Majoka enquired whether Hayat had killed Sana.
“I did not commit any such crime,” the accused replied.
The judge then asked him whether he was falsely accused in the case.
“Is this all a lie?” the judge remarked. He also pointed out that Hayat had also been accused of snatching Yousaf’s mobile phone.
At that, the accused maintained that all allegations levelled against him were “based on falsehood”.
The court then adjourned the hearing until September 25.
Islamabad police had arrested Hayat on June 3, a day after Yousaf was killed at her house in Islamabad.
Preceding his arrest, a first information report (FIR) of the murder was registered at Islamabad’s Sumbal police station against an unidentified man on the complaint of Sana’s mother, Farzana Yousaf, invoking Section 302 (intentional murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
In the FIR, Yousaf’s mother said that a man with a pistol in his hand had entered their house suddenly at around 5pm and “shot straight at my daughter with the intention to kill”.
Later, Islamabad Inspector General (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi had said during a press conference the police had arrested a suspect, who was a was a 22-year-old man, from Faisalabad.
He said Hayat had tried to contact Yousaf repeatedly and was being “rejected by her again and again”, adding that the accused had taken Yousaf’s mobile phone in a bid to wipe out the evidence but it had been recovered along with the weapon of offence.
On July 25, police had formally submitted the challan against Hayat to the prosecution branch of the district and sessions courts. It also included Hayat’s confessional statement recorded under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
In his statement, Hayat — son of a retired government official and a TikToker himself — said he had developed a one-sided infatuation with Sana after connecting with her through social media. He had confessed that suspicion and jealousy drove him to kill her.
 
 

Hayat revealed that he had travelled from Jaranwala to Islamabad on May 28 to wish Sana on her birthday. When she did not meet him, he became convinced she was deliberately avoiding him, he said, adding that On June 2, he returned to the capital after renting a Toyota Fortuner and carrying a 30-bore pistol, intending to confront her.
According to his account, when Sana did not respond to his repeated calls, he went to her home in G-13 sector of the capital, forced his way inside, and fatally shot her in front of her mother and maternal aunt. He then took Sana’s mobile phone to erase their conversations and fled.
Hayat said he directed the driver to drive fast and later hid the murder weapon near a railway bridge before returning to Jaranwala.
 


Following the last hearing of the case on September 13, Dawn reported that Hayat had expressed remorse for his actions, telling the magistrate that he felt deeply ashamed for having taken the life of an innocent teenage girl.
“I feel deeply ashamed for committing such a cruel act,” he had reportedly said, adding that his confession was voluntary and not made under pressure.</p><small>2025-09-20 11:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624676-karachi-child-abuse-suspect-confesses-before-magistrate' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi child abuse suspect confesses before magistrate</strong></a><br><p>
