In a post on the social media platform X, the PPP leader said, “In flagrant violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India has just given approval to the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab River in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K).
“As per the IWT, which cannot be unilaterally revoked, as recent UN rapporteurs have confirmed, Pakistan has control over the waters of the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej rivers fall under India’s control,” she said.







“Following the illegal suspension of the treaty, India has decided to fast-track several disputed hydroelectric projects in the Indus Basin. These projects include Sawalkot, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai-1 and 2. Dulhasti Stage-II is considered part of this strategy,” she said.
“This weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the frontlines of climate change and environmental stress. It will inflame tensions in a bilateral relationship already bristling with hostility and distrust,” she said.
According to the Times of India, a panel of the Indian environment ministry has approved a hydropower project on the Chenab River in the Kishtwar district of occupied Kashmir.
The report said that the 260MW project comes two months after the approval of the 1,856MW Sawalkot hydroelectric project on the same river. It said that both the projects aimed to “harness the potential of the Chenab”.
A similar report was also carried by The Hindu, which added, “With the IWT now in abeyance, the centre is pushing ahead with several hydroelectric projects in the Indus basin, such as Sawalkote, Ratle, Bursar, Pakal Dul, Kwar, Kiru, and Kirthai I and II.”
The development comes days after United Nations experts expressed concern that India’s “unlawful use of force” on Pakistan’s territory in response to the April 22 Paha­lgam attack in occupied Kashmir appe­ars to have “violated the rights to life and security of person”. This observation by UN special rapporteurs was made in a correspondence dated Oct 16, which was made public on Dec 15.
In April, India had held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
Meanwhile, the five UN experts, who compiled the correspondence, also observed that New Delhi’s actions that “may be taken to disrupt the flow of water to Pakistan” under the IWT.
Earlier this month, Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi had stated that a letter had been written to India seeking clarification about the “abrupt variation” in the flow of the Chenab River, with the situation badly affecting wheat and other crops being fed through the Marala-Ravi link and other canals in various parts of Punjab.</p><small>2025-12-29 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2911234379b8cf8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963909/youtuber-rajab-butt-attacked-at-sessions-court-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>YouTuber Rajab Butt attacked at sessions court in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: YouTuber Rajab Butt was attacked at a sessions court in Karachi on Monday during the hearing of a case registered against him for allegedly “hurting religious” sentiments.

And this is precisely what happened, with the Lahore High Court suspending the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025, earlier last week, and later overturning decisions taken under that law.
For context, the Punjab government had, in late October, introduced a new legal framework to combat land grabbing and expedite the resolution of property disputes. The framework, initially introduced as an ordinance, was reportedly designed to provide relief to citizens suffering from prolonged litigation in land disputes by fixing a 90-day time frame for case resolution. Several District Dispute Resolution Committees were established for this purpose, which were headed by a district commissioner and district police officer.
Subsequently, the Punjab government launched a crackdown against land grabbers, promising to restore ownership to rightful claimants within 24 hours of each DDRC decision. The government claimed more than 1,000 cases were settled within days, and the ordinance was later replaced by an act of the Punjab Assembly.
However, within days of the act coming into effect, the LHC issued an interim order suspending it, with the chief justice of the court criticising it as “dismantling the civil setup, civil rights and judicial supremacy”. It appears that the Punjab government had not considered the legal implications of having revenue officers decide the possession of properties which were also being contested in civil courts. It also transpired that the tribunals meant to act as a check on the DDRCs were never functional.
The Punjab chief minister was understandably displeased by the LHC’s decision, arguing that it would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”. Her defiance triggered a sharp response from the legal community, with various lawyers’ associations publicly endorsing the court’s decision, terming the legislation “unconstitutional and unlawful”, and counter-accusing the provincial government of seeking to “appease” land mafias.

 

This has now turned into an unnecessary dispute. Unending property-related disputes have been a cause of untold misery for countless individuals and families, and it is commendable that the Punjab government sought to deliver a solution that could ensure prompt resolution. Granted, there were flaws in its approach, but the law can be amended and made stronger by removing the objections raised by the LHC.
There is, without a question, a dire need all over the country for a working mechanism to deliver quicker decisions in property-related cases. If Punjab can model a successful solution, it would become an example for other jurisdictions to follow. Therefore, instead of battling the legal community, the Punjab government must think about how it can still accomplish what it set out to achieve. Many would be grateful for it.

Father and son Sajid and Naveed Akram are accused of targeting a Hanukkah event on Sydney’s Bondi Beach on December 14, killing 15 people and wounding dozens in what authorities have described as an anti-Semitic terrorist attack.
Despite the tragedy, tales of heroism emerged of those who tried to stop the two gunmen during their deadly rampage.
Among them was Ahmed al Ahmed, a fruit seller, who went viral for ducking between parked cars as the shooting unfolded and then wresting a gun from one of the assailants.

 

“My target was just to take the gun from him, and to stop him from killing a human being’s life and not killing innocent people,” he told CBS News in an interview that airs on Monday.
“I know I saved lots, but I feel sorry for the lost.”
Ahmed was shot several times in the shoulder after tussling with one of the gunmen and underwent several rounds of surgery.
He recalled the moment he “jumped” on the gunman’s back, holding him with his right hand and said: “Drop your gun, stop doing what you’re doing”.
“I don’t want to see people killed in front of me, I don’t want to see blood, I don’t want to hear his gun, I don’t want to see people screaming and begging, asking for help,” Ahmed told the television network.
Ahmed was at the beach getting a cup of coffee when the shooting occurred.
The father of two emigrated to Australia from Syria in 2007; his uncle Mohammed, a farmer, had told AFP in Ahmed’s hometown of Al-Nayrab days after the shooting.
“His act is a source of pride for us and for Syria,” Mohammed said.
The Australian government has fast-tracked and granted a number of visas for Ahmed’s family, local media reported.
“Ahmed has shown the courage and values we want in Australia,” Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said in a statement.
One of the gunmen, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot and killed by police during the attack. An Indian national, he entered Australia on a visa in 1998.
His 24-year-old son, Naveed, an Australian-born citizen, remains in custody on charges including terrorism and 15 murders, as well as committing a “terrorist act” and planting a bomb with intent to harm. He has yet to enter a plea.</p><small>2025-12-29 05:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29101859e41f066.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963903/china-launches-war-games-around-taiwan-as-island-vows-to-defend-democracy' target='_blank'><strong>China launches war games around Taiwan as island vows to defend democracy</strong></a><br><p>China’s military moved army, naval, air force and artillery units around Taiwan on Monday for its “Justice Mission 2025” drills, as the island vowed to defend democracy and mobilised troops to rehearse repelling a potential Chinese attack.
The Eastern Theatre Command announced the drills will involve live-fire exercises on Tuesday, in a statement containing a graphic demarcating five zones surrounding the island that will be under sea and air space restrictions for 10 hours from 8am (5am PKT).
This marks China’s sixth major round of war games since 2022 after then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the democratically governed island, and follows a rise in Chinese rhetoric over Beijing’s territorial claims after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.
The exercises began 11 days after the United States announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever weapons package for the island, drawing a protest from China’s defence ministry and warnings the military would “take forceful measures” in response.
China’s military said it had deployed fighter jets, bombers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and long-range rockets, and would practice striking mobile land-based targets while simulating a coordinated attack on the island from multiple directions.
“This (the drills) serves as a serious warning to ‘Taiwan Independence’ separatist forces and external interference forces,” said Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the Eastern Theatre Command.
Taiwan’s government condemned the drills.
A presidential office spokesperson urged China not to misjudge the situation and undermine regional peace, and called on Beijing to immediately halt what they described as irresponsible provocations.
Scare tactics
The island’s defence ministry said two Chinese military aircraft and 11 ships had been operating around the island over the last 24 hours, and that Taiwan’s military was on high alert and poised to carry out “rapid response exercises”.
That particular drill is designed to move troops swiftly in case China suddenly turns one of its drills around the island into an attack.
“All members of our armed forces will remain highly vigilant and fully on guard, taking concrete action to defend the values of democracy and freedom,” the defence ministry said.
Dozens of Chinese military boats and planes were operating near Taiwan on Monday, and some of them “deliberately closing in” to Taiwan’s contiguous zone, defined as being 24 nautical miles from its coast, a senior Taiwan security official told Reuters.
Taiwan’s coast guard said it had dispatched large ships in reaction to Chinese coast guard activity near the island’s waters and that it was working with the island’s military to minimise the drills’ impact on maritime routes and fishing areas.

 

Taiwan stock markets were unaffected by the drills, up 0.6 per cent to a record high in morning trading.
“I think these drills are just meant to scare us,” said Lin Wei-ming, a 31-year-old teacher based in the capital, Taipei.
“Similar drills have happened before … the political side of things can only be handled by Taiwan’s current government and how they choose to respond.”
Taiwan rejects China’s claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island’s future.
‘Smash the separatist scoundrels’
The Chinese military released two posters titled “Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions,” and “Arrows of Justice: Control and Denial”, along with a third graphic depicting four locations across the island with targets locking on, following the drill announcement.
China’s state broadcaster said the drills would focus on sealing off Taiwan’s vital deep-water Port of Keelung to the island’s north and Kaohsiung to Taiwan’s south, the island’s largest port city.
While the PLA practiced port blockades around Taiwan during war games last year, this marks the first time it has publicly stated that drills around the island are aimed at “deterrence” of outside military intervention.
The Japanese prime minister’s remarks triggered a surge in Chinese messaging stressing its sovereignty claims. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump in November that Taiwan’s “return to China” after World War Two was central to Beijing’s vision of the global order.
The first poster appeared to show the armada of civilian ships China is mobilising to help in an attack on Taiwan. Vessels with ramps and open decks similar to military landing craft used in amphibious assaults were also shown.
“Any foreign interference that touches the shield (of justice) shall perish!” the poster read. “Any separatist scoundrels who encounter the shield shall be destroyed!”
The second poster shows flaming arrows raining down on Taiwan and spearing green cartoon bugs. Beijing regularly calls Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te a “parasite” and began using the cartoon green bug caricature to represent separatist forces during April’s war games.
“I think their (China’s) goal is, as they said, ‘keep the island, not the people,’” said Stephanie Huang, a 56-year-old interior designer. “They just want to save face by claiming Taiwan as part of their own country, but Taiwanese people don’t see it that way.

In India, both the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and CPI (Communist Party of India) were founded, as the handicrafts movement took off and the first local electric train was inaugurated. Globally, the first true television images were transmitted, and the 150mph speed barrier was broken for automobiles. Heisenberg published his paper on quantum mechanics, and the modern airline industry kicked off.
The first major surrealist art exhibition took place in Paris, and Louis Armstrong’s records fueled the Jazz Age. Woolf, Cather, Gide, Dreiser, Dos Passos, Proust and Kafka published landmark novels, while Auden and Isherwood reconnected as adults and Eliot became a director at Faber. Major operas by Berg, Ravel and Busoni premiered, and the Bauhaus moved to Dessau.
All this, in a random year of the early 20th century. Modernism, the cultural peak of industrial capitalism and liberal democracy, furiously fed both art and politics, and was disseminated globally through a technological firestorm whose fumes we still breathe. Growing communal riots, a dwindling Khilafat movement, and an already spent moderate nationalism marked 1925 in India, as if yesterday were today.
By comparison, what do we have in 2025? Or really, the entire first quarter of the 21st century? What is the last fundamental breakthrough of any kind you can remember?

As neoliberal capitalism and liberal democracy collapse, there will be openings for humane creators.

Nothing, I would argue. Nothing of note in philosophy, literature, music, art, architecture, science and technology, film, social sciences and economic policy except whatever remains of the aftereffects of the major discoveries of the 20th century. There has never been a less creative period globally since the beginning of the capitalist-imperialist onslaught against the world’s major civilisations half a millennium ago. Individual accomplishments in various fields certainly persist but are not part of any larger trends.
The two greatest movies of the 21st century, In the Mood for Love and Mulholland Drive, were both released a quarter century ago, and summed up 20th-century aesthetics rather than looking forward. Brilliant films come out of Iran, South Korea, Thailand and elsewhere, but there is little cinematographic advancement, compared to the 1960s and 1970s when every week witnessed an astounding new film. Popular music died long ago in the West, compared to the era of innovative bands, and the last rites were pronounced over jazz decades ago. Art and architecture have long descended into superficial parodies empty of ideological content, while the social sciences and humanities have totally succumbed to a postmodernism without a belief system. Hardly any novels of note have appeared in the West in this period, except by a few émigré writers. Big Science, in the form of Big Physics and Big Biology, is singularly uninterested in addressing the practical problems currently degrading individual and collective health and well-being. The present system is not creative enough to address environmental collapse.
The only area of innovation seems to be computer technology, namely the internet, which fuelled the dominance of social media. Lately, the buzz is all about artificial intelligence. But present computer technology is only an intensification of mid-20th-century innovations, and AGI (artificial general intelligence), according to real scientists, is decades away, if it can ever be realised. Computer technology has largely become an instrument of the global crumbling of political ideology.
The counterargument to my narrative would be that we couldn’t possibly be living in more momentous times. The Western empire is collapsing before our eyes, while another is rising in the East. Except for a few languishing economies in Africa and Asia (Pakistan being one of them), the entire world is experiencing economic modernisation.

 

I would answer that what resonates with me is the attempted erasure of individual cultures around the world, even as the empire dies a gruesome death. By the time it is dead, will anything worth salvaging remain of any culture in the world? Will it have degraded the livability of the planet, including such basics as production of real food, so much that we will view this period’s “development” entirely negatively?
The answer to why creativity, in both the arts and sciences, is in eclipse everywhere is that the West’s half a millennium of hegemony is ending in a parody of apocalypse. Its most obvious manifestation is America’s self-devouring frenzy, inevitably hurtling toward domestic ethnic cleansing by way of the blunt instrument of mass denaturalisation.
But American fascism borrows uninterestingly from 20th-century fascism, featuring nothing surprising. The more it advances the more unoriginal it becomes. Although inflicting real loss of life and values (witness the Gaza genocide), it is a clown fascism stealing from past clown fascisms, and in this respect is the most boring development of the last quarter century, even if it petulantly demands that the rest of the world pay undivided attention to its operatic self-strangulation.
Creativity in the arts, social sciences and humanities, and science and technology has little chance of reemerging in the world until the empire has once and for all ended, and a form of anarchic dystopia fills its absence for a while, although permanent stagnation, until some fatal rupture occurs, seems more likely. The 21st-century equivalents of phones, cars, planes, freeways, radios, skyscrapers and vaccinations, along with fascism, communism and populism, may not appear soon, but as neoliberal capitalism and liberal democracy collapse in tandem, there will be openings for humane creators once the deadweight is removed.
The difficulty is that the empire saw to it, while dying, that Europe’s compassionate turn, China’s political liberalisation, and resurgent Islamic and Asian values were stopped in their tracks. We may be upset at the distorted turns fundamentalism has taken, but if we view it as empire’s last will and testament it becomes easier to deal with. Removal from empire’s malevolent psychodrama, which manifests as an assault on reason, can allow individuals to stay creative, even if creativity at a socially meaningful level is probably unachievable.

Published in Dawn, December 29th, 2025</p><small>2025-12-29 04:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6951c83bd315d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963879/why-pakistan-should-stay-out' target='_blank'><strong>Why Pakistan should stay out</strong></a><br><p>THERE is increasing public questioning and expression of doubts about the wisdom of Pakistan sending troops to join the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) under President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan. This is envisaged by the US as a multinational force led by an American general. It is a crucial component of the Trump plan. But its acceptance by Hamas is essential as without that, countries who join it can be drawn into a conflict with the Palestinian group.
The government has stated and conveyed to the US administration that it is considering joining the force but a final decision is yet to be made. Last month Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar declared Pakistan was “definitely ready” to contribute to ISF but disarming Hamas was not “our job”. He also said “the Prime Minister has already announced after consultation with the Field Marshal that we will contribute”, but a firm decision will be made once it is clear what ISF’s mandate and terms of reference are.
Pakistan has been in discussions with the US over the past several months seeking clarity over the mandate and structure of the Gaza force and related issues. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed this at his recent presser when he conveyed gratitude to Pakistan for the offer to be part of it. But he acknowledged that issues relating to the force’s mandate, command structure and funding were still under discussion.
In fact, several other Muslim states who earlier showed interest in joining ISF have since demurred. No country has committed soldiers as they await clarity on key issues. On Dec 16, US Central Command hosted a conference in Doha, in which Pakistan also participated, to discuss the next phases of Trump’s plan including deployment of ISF and to evolve a consensus on its mandate. The meeting failed to reach agreement on the mandate. This means reservations of Muslim countries about the mission persist and they may not participate if the mandate involves forcible disarmament of Hamas and other Palestinian resistance groups.

Sending troops to an ill-defined ISF unacceptable to one of the parties is high-risk.

To consider whether Pakistan should be part of ISF it is important to first examine the current state of play in Gaza and how the Trump plan’s second phase is unfolding. The next stage is faced with formidable obstacles which have held up the plan, prompting the widening view that the process has stalled because of disagreements between the parties. The Economist described the peace plan as “faltering in the chaos of Gaza”. The gap between the principal parties, Israel and Hamas, remains wide but there are also friction points between the US and Israel. To iron out differences President Trump has invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Mar-a-Lago, his Florida home, on Dec 29. The outcome of that meeting will be consequential to the fate of the peace process.
The second phase involves establishing governance arrangements for Gaza, further withdrawal of Israeli forces, disarmament of Hamas and deployment of ISF. Announcements about the Board of Peace, headed by Trump, as supervisory authority for Gaza’s transitional governance have yet to be made. Nor have members been named to the technocratic committee of Palestinians responsible for Gaza’s day-to-day running. Although Rubio has said this will soon be done, delays on this count reflect both lack of clarity and consensus.

 

In Gaza itself a shaky ceasefire is breached daily by Israel while it builds new settlements amid military actions in the occupied West Bank. Since the ceasefire took effect in October, over 400 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli airstrikes. Israeli firings have increased across the ceasefire ‘Yellow Line’. This reinforces Israel’s longstanding record of not abiding by agreements and being an unreliable ‘partner for peace’. Meanwhile top Israeli officials continue to say Israel will never withdraw fully from Gaza, as envisaged under the peace plan. In that case, Hamas won’t disarm.
From what is known so far it is apparent what ISF is and isn’t. It is not a UN, blue-helmet force. It has a vague UN mandate but no UN supervision. It will not be a peacekeeping force as it will have peace enforcement responsibilities, which makes it operationally different. It will have to work closely with Israeli authorities, other than Egypt. Israel has to approve countries that can be part of the force.
When the UN Security Council resolution endorsing the Trump plan was adopted last month, Hamas rejected it and declared any international force, if established, “must be deployed only at the borders to separate forces, monitor the ceasefire, and be fully under UN supervision”. Hamas also said assigning the force the task to disarm groups resisting occupation “strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation”.
Recently a Hamas official reiterated this position, adding that talks remain stalled with no agreement on ISF’s tasks and role. Finalisation of the mandate and rules of engagement for the Gaza force that addresses Hamas’s objections will be critical. Without buy-in by Hamas, ISF’s deployment will be ineffective.
It is against this backdrop that Pakistan has to take a decision about becoming part of ISF. Participation should be ruled out if the mandate is for troops to police Hamas. That will bring them into direct confrontation with Hamas/other resistance groups and any claim that Pakistani troops are there to protect Palestinians will not wash. The consequences of Pakistani soldiers clashing with Palestinians, regardless of their affiliations, would be dire both on grounds of principle and the public backlash at home.
Deployment would involve close cooperation with Israel, who is entirely untrustworthy and routinely fires at UN peacekeepers in Lebanon. What happens if Israeli forces start firing at ISF’s Pakistani contingent? Moreover, cooperation with Israel will be tantamount to implicit recognition of Israel and only a step away from formal recognition and joining the Abraham Accords. All this without any movement towards establishment of a Palestinian state. This will be contrary to Pakistan’s long-standing policy.
Finally, Pakistan must consider that given obvious hurdles in enforcing an ill-defined Gaza peace plan and chances of it becoming a messy, inconclusive affair, should it risk walking into a quagmire which puts our soldiers in harm’s way. Pakistan’s national interests should be supreme in a decision that must be made in full transparency.

The authority also approved removing excise duty on industrial hemp and hemp seed oil while giving approval to increase in excise duty on full-spectrum Cannabidiol and Tetrahydrocannabinol.
The documents read that CRA approved reducing licence fee for cannabis cultivation from Rs0.6 million to Rs0.5 million and licence fee for cannabis processing from Rs1.5 million to Rs1 million. It read that CRA reduced the licence fee for hemp processing from Rs0.7 million to Rs0.5 million while excise duty on full-spectrum Cannabidiol and Tetrahydrocannabinol was increased from Rs3,000 per kilogram to Rs5000 per kilogram.
The decision was taken during a meeting held with minister for excise, taxation and narcotics in the chair on December 22, the document said. It added that the meeting was a continuation of the sub-committee meeting held on December 4 and had recommended the changes.
The documents said that during CRA meeting, the proposed Hemp Model for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was presented before the committee where secretary of excise, taxation and narcotics control and secretary of health emphasised that the proposed model may be simplified for ease of doing business and facilitation of investors.

 

After thorough deliberation, the meeting approved that pilot hemp cultivation licences would be issued to reputed industries in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and industries would enter into partnership with farmers.
CRA approved application form for cultivation and processing of industrial hemp licence, Tetrahydrocannabinol sampling and analysis form, periodic inspection form and other mandatory registers.
The committee approved that Board of Investment (BOI) and industries department would extend facilitation in joint venture of industry and farmers, registration of farmers as private or cooperative company kept optional.
It approved that the import of hemp seed and its certification would be the responsibility of licensed industry concerned. Cannabis cultivation and processing will be postponed for the time being and medicinal cannabis regulation and its product management will be viewed in light of the requirements and criterion of Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan.
The document said that a sub-committee would be constituted for devising a cannabis model and revisiting cannabis regulations within 15 days for its constitution.

“These dolphins are often seen in this season and recorded by fishermen. The ongoing bloom is neither toxic nor poses any threat to fishermen,” Director of Marine Fisheries, Balochistan, Ahmed Nadeem told Dawn, adding that such blooms were observed in the area once to twice a year.
About its possible impact on fisheries, Mr Nadeem said: “There is no serious negative impact, though it does contribute to marine productivity once it starts decomposing at the bank of the sea and turns into nutrients for marine life.”
According to him, the bloom doesn’t cause a bad smell. “Small fish that get trapped in the bloom and die cause the stench.”

Algal bloom termed ‘beneficial’ as fish freely congregate in the area

Seconding Mr Ahmed’s opinion, Muhammad Moazzam Khan, Technical Adviser at the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P), said that Noctiluca blooms were not harmful in most cases and rather increased the productivity of marine water.
“It is heartening that pods of bottlenose dolphins are seen within the Gwadar (West Bay), which verifies that the bloom is not affecting the marine biodiversity of the area,” he said.
Asked about the mass fish mortality reported from Ormara (East Bay) in 2016, which was also reportedly caused by a Noctiluca bloom, he said a symbiont called Protoeuglena noctilucae (a tiny green flagellate microorganism) wasn’t present in the bloom.
“Hence, Noctiluca did not produce oxygen but rather consumed all oxygen in the seawater of the area, resulting in mass fish mortality. However, currently we are seeing green Noctiluca bloom. What has given it this colour is Protoeuglena noctilucae that produces oxygen under the sunlight and contributes to marine productivity.”
According to WWF-P, the winter bloom is a characteristic of the northern Arabian Sea. There have been studies conducted by the organisation, which indicate that the bloom is triggered by the spread of cold water from upwelling in some part of the Arabian Sea and its spread under the influence of eddy formation during this period.
Linking this bloom, it says, with Eutrophication is not scientifically substantiated. Noctiluca scintillans is a small, free-floating organism that may appear in red, orange, green, or even colourless forms.

Speaking at the National Press Club, he said the KP government should support security operations, as “without stability, development projects could not move forward”.
Insecurity has a negative impact on the social and economic conditions of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, adding that “sustained peace was essential for businesses and investment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”.
Mr Kundi blamed Afghanistan for the rise in terrorism and alleged the involvement of Afghan nationals in the attacks in Pakistan. He said those Afghans who did not have documents to stay in Pakistan were “illegal”. The governor said no foreign national could reside in Pakistan without valid documents and the same policy applied to the undocumented Afghans too. He added that those wishing to study or work must enter through proper legal channels.

Says foreign nationals cannot reside in country without documents

Governor Kundi claimed attacks in D.I. Khan and the Cadet College Wana involved Afghan nationals. He said Pakistan had repeatedly urged the Afghan authorities not to allow their territory to be used against Pakistan. “These terrorist elements are playing into the hands of India and Israel,” he claimed, adding that Pakistan had successfully countered India on both military and diplomatic fronts.
He said global interest in defence cooperation and trade with Pakistan was increasing. “This is evident with the frequent visits by foreign heads of state to the country,” he added.
The governor also commented on domestic politics, saying political cases should be contested through arguments rather than abuse. Without naming individuals, he referred to the PTI leadership for contradictory statements regarding the negotiations with the government.

The winter rains have made an already precarious life worse for people like Sharafi, who is among the hundreds of thousands in the Palestinian territory displaced by the war, many of whom now survive on aid provided by humanitarian organisations.
“My children are shivering from cold and fear… The tent was completely flooded within minutes,” Sharafi, 47, said on Sunday.
“We lost our blankets, and all the food is soaked,” added the father of six, who lives in a makeshift shelter with his children in the coastal area of Al-Mawasi.
Insufficient aid
Nearly 80 per cent of buildings in the Gaza Strip have been destroyed or damaged by the war, according to United Nations data.

UNRWA chief says supplies not being allowed in ‘at the scale required’

And about 1.5 million of Gaza’s 2.2m residents have lost their homes, said Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGO Network in Gaza.
Of more than 300,000 tents requested to shelter displaced people, “we have received only 60,000”, Shawa told AFP, pointing to Israeli restrictions on the delivery of humanitarian aid into the territory.
The UN refugee agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, said the harsh weather had compounded the misery of Gazans.
“People in Gaza are surviving in flimsy, waterlogged tents & among ruins,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini wrote on X.
“There is nothing inevitable about this. Aid supplies are not being allowed in at the scale required.”







Earlier this month, Gaza experienced a similar spell of heavy rain and cold. The weather caused at least 18 deaths due to the collapse of war-damaged buildings or exposure to cold.

Emerging from the July uprising, it asked people to see it as a break from Bangladesh’s old habits of convenience and compromise. It promised to distinguish itself with its own political language and its own sense of responsibility.
Two developments have turned speculation into a moment of reckoning. Tasnim Jara, a senior and one of the more visible leaders, in her own right, resigned from the party. She announced she would contest the Dhaka-9 constituency as an independent.
At the same time, 30 members of the party’s central committee have formally written to Convener Nahid Islam, opposing any political alliance or seat-sharing arrangement with Jamaat-i-Islami. It has now become a question of credibility for the NCP.
Seat-sharing is not unusual in Bangladesh. Elections are fought one constituency at a time and depend on organisation, polling agents and the ability to protect votes. New parties struggle because these structures take years to build. Seat sharing arrangements or alliance might make sense for electoral politics.
But the NCP did not enter politics asking to be judged by that standard alone. From the outset, it framed itself as the political expression of a movement that rejected the logic of a deal that “works”. Its leaders, shaped by the July uprising, spoke against shortcuts, against recycling old alignments, and against moral ambiguity. They spoke of a new arrangement, ‘Naya Bondobosto’ as they kept harping.
That positioning mattered. It is why many young people, first-time participants and politically unaffiliated citizens placed their trust in the party. What has changed since then? If the NCP has reassessed its strength and concluded that contesting independently is not viable in this election cycle, it should say so plainly. Admitting organisational limits would not weaken the party. It would demonstrate seriousness.
Any understanding with Jamaat-i-Islami also carries a weight far beyond seat numbers. Jamaat’s opposition to independence in 1971 and its role during the Liberation War are not fringe allegations. They are part of Bangladesh’s mainstream political history. That history has shaped alliances, exclusions and public trust for decades. It cannot be set aside through electoral arithmetic.
Tasnim Jara’s decision brings this tension into sharp focus. In announcing her independent candidacy on Facebook, she openly acknowledged the disadvantages of running without party infrastructure, an organised worker base, or institutional access to security and administration. Yet she chose that path, citing her commitment to a new political culture and the promise she had made to voters.
The central committee letter makes the issue impossible to dismiss as personal dissent. The 30 signatories invoke the NCP’s declared ideology, the historical responsibility of the July uprising and democratic ethics.
They explicitly cite Jamaat’s political history, particularly its role in 1971, as incompatible with the party’s values. They also warn of immediate consequences, saying that even reports of a possible alliance have already led supporters and organisers to reconsider their backing.
Money adds another layer of accountability. The NCP presented itself as a citizen-funded alternative to patronage politics. Crowdfunding is not merely a financial tool. It is a political contract. Many of those contributors are uncomfortable with Jamaat’s history and politics.
If the party now moves in a direction that contradicts the assumptions under which that money was raised, the cost will extend beyond this election.
Warnings have also come from within the wider July movement. Abdul Kader, a former coordinator associated with the uprising, has cautioned publicly that an NCP–Jamaat understanding risks damaging the future of youth politics. That concern reflects a fear that a rare moment of political clarity is being traded for short-term opportunism.
If the NCP believes reform is impossible without parliamentary seats, it should say so. If it believes contesting independently is not viable this time, it should explain why. If it believes seat-sharing with Jamaat does not dilute its core commitments, it must articulate those commitments clearly and draw its red lines.

DHAKA: Inqilab Moncho and allied groups staged simultaneous blockades across major highways and intersections in various cities across Bangladesh on Sunday, demanding justice for the killing of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi.
Hadi, a vocal critic of India who took part in last year’s mass uprising, was shot by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier this month and later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore.
Cities hit by the protests included Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi, Gazipur, Barishal, Cumilla and Khulna.
Leaders and activists of Inqilab Moncho blocked the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka for the third consecutive day on Sunday.
“Statements from the administration are nothing but eyewash. They are simply trying to waste time. The perpetrators could have been arrested on the very day the shooting happened,” said Naim Islam, a central member of Inqilab Moncho.
“The government must disclose to the public who is pressuring whom. They claim some people have been arrested, but the real killer must be brought to justice,” he added.
“The interim government is determined to ensure justice for the [Hadi’s] killing,” he said, adding that police, Border Guard Bangladesh, Rapid Action Battalion, and intelligence agencies were working closely and in coordination to uncover the facts behind the murder.
Pressure has been mounting on Bangladesh’s interim government to arrest the killers of Hadi, who was set to contest the general elections in February next year.
Bangladesh’s home adviser, retired Lt Gen Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said investigators were expected to submit the charge sheet in the popular student leader’s murder case within 10 days.
He said authorities had made significant progress, but not everything could be disclosed at the moment to protect the integrity of the investigation and to identify both the perpetrators and those who backed them.
He said 11 people have so far been arrested in the case, including the wife and parents of the alleged mastermind, Faisal Karim Masud.
Among the arrestees, six gave confessional statements under Section 164, while four witnesses also gave statements under the same provision, the adviser said.
Based on information from the arrestees, witness statements, reviews of recovered evidence and an overall assessment, the investigation is now in its final stage, he added.
“I request everyone to remain patient,” he said, adding that a decision had already been made to transfer the case to a speedy trial tribunal.
“I want to assure you that the trial in the Hadi murder case will be completed within the tenure of the current interim government.”
‘Fled to India’
Meanwhile, AFP quoted Bangladesh police as saying that Hadi’s suspected killers had fled to India, in comments likely to further strain relations with India.
“The killing was premeditated. Those behind it have been identified,” Nazrul Islam, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police officer, said at a news conference He added that the suspects left Bangladesh through the Haluaghat border on Dec 12.
“They were received at the border by two Indian citizens, who escorted them into the northeastern state of Meghalaya before handing them over to two accomplices.” Bangladeshi investigators were in contact with their Indian counterparts, who had arrested the two suspected accomplices, Islam said.

LAHORE: After spending three days in the provincial capital galvanising party supporters, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Min­ister Sohail Afridi said the PTI would not engage in talks with the government without first taking to the streets to demonstrate its opposition to the status quo.
His remarks come as party leaders are split into two camps: one led by veterans favouring dialogue, while the other is bent on street agitation as per the directions of the incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.
A day earlier, CM Afridi said the decision to initiate talks rested with the opposition alliance, and that he was in charge of the ‘street movement’.
CM Afridi, along with other provincial ministers and members of the assembly, had arrived in Lahore to launch a new street movement, as per the directives of Imran Khan. He left the provincial capital in the evening. Before Afridi, his predecessor, Ali Amin Gandapur, also came to Lahore earlier this year, ostensibly to launch a protest drive.
Earlier in the day, Mr Afridi told journalists at a meeting that reconciliation was impossible without resistance. “We will be at a loss if we enter into dialogue without resistance. So, the protest movement will continue until the rulers come to the table after recognising the opposition as an equal partner,” he said.
Responding to a question whether the party had perpetually been protesting without any result, CM Afridi said, “This time, we will not make tall claims but do practical work and come up with a positive output.”
Sharing his thoughts about the dialogue offered by the government, the CM claimed there must have been some ‘direction’ from the powers that be to the PM that he offered talks. He said talks could be meaningful only after inclusion of individuals who wielded power and influence.
“We could not develop a working relationship with the establishment because they did not accept my policy and I could not accept their policy,” he said in response to a question about him reaching out to the powerful quarters.
“The establishment now knows that the incumbent rulers were unable to take Pakistan forward,” he said, while accusing the ruling parties of corruption and economic mismanagement.
Mr Afridi said it was not necessary that the PTI pick D-Chowk in Islamabad as its protest site, as it did in November last year, adding that it was also not important to end the protest after a couple of days.
In an X post, the CM also announced his intention of visiting Karachi for the ‘street movement’.







Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, meanwhile, said no political party could go into a blind alley. “We are seeing that the government wants the PTI to neither speak about its election fraud, the release of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, nor question institutions’ interference in politics and journalism. Then what should we do?”
Mr Raja said reconciliation and dialogue could only begin when the “basic principles” would be agreed — otherwise the party would take to the streets to get these principles accepted.
Following the meeting with journalists, CM Afridi was stopped from entering the Lahore cantonment area, where he had plans to meet the families of incarcerated former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and advocate Hassaan Niazi.
The KP CM said he had been stopped as they had made (cantonement) a no-go area. “I have asked whether Pakistan’s territory ended here and another country’s land started.”
“The Punjab government should not have behaved in such a harsh manner with the chief minister of a province. This has all been happening with me for the past three consecutive days,” he lamented.
“The KP CM is also ready to go without his gunmen and KP police, but is still not being allowed,” Salman Akram Raja said.
Azma ridicules PTI
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari ridiculed the PTI’s street movement, saying its reality was “exposed in daylight after social media hype overnight.”
In a statement on X, Ms Bokhari quipped that PTI supporters were celebrating by sharing images of Bangladesh since last night, claiming that the so-called street movement failed to attract any public response during the day.







She said there was no one even to respond to the slogans raised by the protesters. Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, she said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return.
“Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead. She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.

Speaking at a press conference at a park adjacent to the party’s Bahadurabad headquarters, Mr Kamal said if Mr Hussain “truly considers himself innocent, he should approach a London court and file a petition for a transparent investigation into the brutal murder of Dr Imran Farooq”.
It may be noted that in 2020 an Islamabad anti-terrorism court had sentenced three men — Syed Mohsin Ali, Moazzam Ali and Khalid Shamim — to life imprisonment and declared Mr Hussain an absconder in the Imran Farooq murder case.
The MQM-P leader’s presser came a day after the burial of Dr Imran Farooq’s widow Shumaila, who died a couple of days ago in London. Mr Kamal, as well as leaders of MQM factions, attended the funeral and expressed their condolence with her two sons and other family members.
During his press conference, Mr Kamal lost his cool and used foul language against Mr Hussain. He also alleged donations were collected from around the world in the name of sending Shumaila’s body to Pakistan.
Lamenting that Dr Imran Farooq’s children “are being dragged onto social media and exploited for political purposes”, Mr Kamal advised them to stay away from Mr Hussain and his faction.
MQM-L responds
Meanwhile, the MQM-L condemned Mr Kamal’s press conference and challenged him to prove his allegations.
Senior London-based leader Mustafa Azizabadi told an online media briefing that “Kamal’s press conference is an extremely disgraceful attempt to drag the innocent children of Dr Imran Farooq”.
He condemned use of foul language by Mr Kamal.
He also played video clips showing Dr Imran Farooq’s late father telling a TV host that the killers of his son were with Mr Kamal.
Mr Azizabadi said his party was not making allegations against anyone, but that people should decide for themselves after watching Imran Farooq’s father’s video.

But soon after the event, a more pressing debate surfaced. Should we celebrate the Rs135 billion, the bid at which the deal was finalised? Or mourn that the government will only receive Rs10.2bn?
While this entire debate will always be clouded by partisan views, it’s important to address the topic because it’s only going to resurface frequently in the near future. After all, the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is just one of the many state-owned assets to be sold. In August, the government unveiled an ambitious five-year roadmap targeting 24 state-owned enterprises (SOEs) across three phases. The kickoff began with First Women Bank being sold to a United Arab Emirates firm in October.

In the past, handing over monopolistic businesses to the private sector didn’t eliminate the need for subsidies

So, what is the real worth of these companies? And more importantly, how do you price them in the first place? Maybe the combined value of all the assets they own, whether it’s the aircraft fleet, the land, or some other machinery? Of course, the problem here is that many SOEs own less than what they owe and continue to bleed losses with every passing day.
In FY24, SOEs recorded cumulative revenues of Rs13.5 trillion, doubling from FY21 levels. On the other hand, losses stood at Rs30.6bn, though improving substantially from Rs274.2bn in FY22. However, in both cases, the credit lies squarely with the oil and gas sector, which alone accounted for 60 per cent of the total revenue increase and contributed 85pc of the overall profits, largely on the back of rupee devaluation and higher prices.
The privatisation pipeline
This variation in performance becomes particularly relevant when examining which entities are being privatised and which are being retained. Out of the 24 entities earmarked for privatisation, 20 generated Rs3.87tr in revenues during FY24, representing 29pc of the entire SOE portfolio’s topline. Yet, the same companies posted collective losses of Rs225bn. Without them, the remaining SOE portfolio would have recorded a net profit of Rs195bn.
Within the privatisation pipeline, losses are heavily concentrated in the power sector, adding up to Rs199bn FY24 and boasting four of the five biggest laggards among SOEs. The remaining fifth is, of course, none other than PIA.
In fact, both transport and power sectors exhibit a highly lopsided and unattractive balance sheet composition, where the leverage ratio for both sectors stood at 0.39/0.71, respectively, whereas for the financial and manufacturing sectors, the ratio stood at 1.08/1.49, likewise as of FY24.
However, the pipeline also includes profitable entities, most notably State Life Insurance and National Insurance, both of which generate significant net income while growing at healthy rates.
While the story of losses is documented, what we often fail to grasp is how much it costs the government, and therefore the taxpayer, to keep our beloved SOEs afloat. In FY24, this support added up to Rs1.58tr, of which just under two-thirds was directed towards the power sector to offset tariff shortfalls and sustain distribution companies.
More than Rs780bn of the support came in the form of subsidies, while another Rs367bn were grants and Rs337.5bn in loans. Basically, the government pumped Rs1.58tr, or 12pc of its budget receipts, into these entities so they could generate lucrative losses of Rs30bn; talk about return on investments.
Disposing of these from the books will certainly free up some fiscal space, but it doesn’t really mean the remaining SOE portfolio will yield huge dividends. The transport sector is a great case in point.
Combined, Pakistan Railways and the National Highway Authority posted losses of Rs347bn in FY24 and are going to be held for the foreseeable future. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily. Especially in the latter’s case, the task at hand is the development of critical infrastructure, which requires heavy investments and low returns. It’s essential to provide public goods, something no private sector can or will do.
Nevertheless, the privatisation drive can help delineate the state’s role better. By offloading commercial enterprises that have demonstrably failed under public management while retaining entities with public good characteristics or strategic importance, the government can move towards optimising its portfolio.
Doing so is critical to ensuring fiscal operations run smoothly, but the more important question is: will the privatisation agenda set the course for the transformation of selected sectors? Or even free it from the clutches (or crutches) of the sovereign? In the past, handing over monopolistic businesses to the private sector didn’t eliminate the need for subsidies.
Secondly, the private sector will also have to put its money where its mouth has always been and actually invest for growth, rather than turning to the same government for support in the form of subsidies, contracts, grants, and whatnot.

LAKKI MARWAT: At least 12 terrorists were killed and several others injured in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) carried out by security forces in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Sunday.
The military’s media wing said that security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Balo­chistan’s Kalat district, killing four terrorists.
According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operation was carried out the previous day following intelligence repo­rts about the presence of terrorists affiliated with Fitna al Hindustan — the term the state uses for Balochistan-based separatist groups.
During the operation, security forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were killed, the ISPR said in the statement.
It added that weapons and ammunition were seized from the dead terrorists, who had been actively involved in terrorist activity in the area.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored terrorist found in the area. [The] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under [the] vision “Azm-i-Istehkam” (as approved by [the] Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the ISPR stated.
The operation came a day after the ISPR reported that four terrorists from the Fitna al Khawarij — a term used to describe the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — had been killed in an IBO in Balochistan’s Panjgur district.
Karak operation
Separately, Karak police spokesman Shaukat Khan told Dawn that eight terrorists were killed and several of their accomplices injured during an IBO in Karak district. He said police moved to the area after receiving credible intelligence about the presence of terrorists in the mountainous terrain of Banda Daud Shah tehsil.
“During the operation, led by Karak District Police Officer Saud Khan, the law enforcement personnel eliminated eight terrorists in an intense exchange of fire and destroyed their hideouts in the difficult mountainous terrain,” he said, adding that Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) commandos, backed by intelligence operatives, assisted police in effectively engaging the terrorists.
The official added that the terrorists attempted to take away the bodies of their slain accomplices, but the police effectively engaged them, resulting in an exchange of fire that lasted several hours.
Peace body member injured
Separately, in Lakki Mar­wat, a member of a peace committee was injured when terrorists attacked his house in the Abbasa Khattak area late Saturday night.
District police spokesman Qudratullah confirmed the attack, saying a group of terrorists fired rockets launchers at the house of Hamayun, a key member of the local peace body.
As a result of the attack, Hamayun sustained injuries, while other residents of the house remained unhurt. Local police, with the help of armed residents and volunteers of the peace body, returned fire and forced the assailants to flee.
The terrorists also fired at the Abbasa police post before fleeing towards the mountainous border area with Karak district. Despite his injuries, Hamayun, along with other peace committee volunteers, is expected to assist police in operations against terrorists in the area.
The attack followed a successful operation in the Takhti Khel area of Lakki Marwat district, where police claimed to have killed six terrorists, including a com­­mander identified as Nusratullah Wazir.
Security advisory
Police also issued a security advisory for police personnel, government officials, and the public in light of intelligence reports suggesting a possible subversive activity in the district.
According to the advisory issued by the District Police Officer Lakki Marwat, the TTP Teepu Gul Group, with support from the Hafiz Gul Bahadar group of North Waziristan, was planning a large-scale terrorist attack in the district. It warned that terrorists might use explosive-laden vehicles to target schools, sports activities, large public gatherings, and bazaars.

 

“The planned attack may be similar to the terrorist incident that took place in the Shah Hassan Khel area of Lakki Marwat district on Jan 1, 2010”, the advisory said.
It further stated that terrorists had begun preparing an explosive-laden vehicle and that a suicide bomber, an Afghan national, was reportedly undergoing training in Paktia province, Afghanistan.
The advisory warned that terrorists might kidnap or target police personnel and civilians, directing SDPOs and SHOs to place all police units on high alert and ensure strict checking of suspected vehicles, particularly vans, trucks, and pick-ups.

The comments, delivered during an event in Kabul, come after JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, on December 23, criticised Islamabad for striking terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Iran and for deporting Afghan refugees.
“There comes a point when refugees become a problem, but you come together to resolve it; you don’t expel people who have been living in your country for 40 years,” he said, calling on Pakistan and Afghanistan to maintain friendly relations.







A declaration from Dec 23 stated that tension “is not in the interest of either country and will only benefit anti-Islamic forces”, urging Kabul and Islamabad to resolve their issues through dialogue.







Haqqani referred to the conference on Dec 23, noting that Fazl and religious scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani “expressed their goodwill towards Afghanistan, for which we are deeply grateful to all these personalities”.
He added that “positive and goodwill statements” were also delivered by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar regarding Afghanistan.
“If goodwill, good interaction and positive relations are established between countries, and nations are brought closer to each other, then we welcome it,” Haqqani was quoted as saying.
The interior minister clarified that Afghanistan was committed to peace, stability and security in the region and assured all parties that the Afghan people did not intend any harm or ill will against any country or nation.
Haqqani concluded his statement by saying: “We have made a firm decision to build and develop our homeland; now others should also stand by us in this process. No one should have any concerns about us.
“Afghanistan has now entered the reconstruction phase and we want other countries to be our partners on this path, and to abandon wrong attitudes and negative intentions about Afghanistan.”
Meanwhile, Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi had expressed similar views while addressing a ceremony yesterday, stating: “Recently, scholars from famous madrasas and universities and religious movements and parties from across Pakistan gathered in Karachi and gave the best advice to their government.
“They made the best decisions. We respect them. We always expect that just as scholars have tried to reform systems and personalities throughout history. They tried for peace and goodness. They played a role in brotherhood and closeness; they should play a similar role in the future as well.”
Pak-Afghan tensions
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism.
After border clashes on October 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha.
Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
But on November 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Pakistan. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the clashes.</p><small>2025-12-29 02:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/29085005b60b94e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963853/balochistan-police-chief-doubles-financial-assistance-for-families-of-martyrs' target='_blank'><strong>Balochistan police chief doubles financial assistance for families of martyrs</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The Balochistan police chief has announced a comprehensive and historic increase in financial assistance and welfare benefits for the families of police martyrs, serving personnel, retired employees and their children. 
Inspector General Muhammad Tahir said the welfare of police personnel and the families of martyrs was among his foremost priorities. “The sacrifices of police martyrs were a guiding light for the force. Completing their mission and easing the difficulties faced by their families and police employees is our first duty,” he emphasised. 
Under the enhanced martyrs package, immediate financial assistance for the families of martyrs has been increased from Rs100,000 to Rs200,000. Compensation for personnel seriously injured in the line of duty has been raised from Rs10,000 to Rs100,000, while assistance for those sustaining minor injuries has been increased from Rs5,000 to Rs25,000. 
The IGP said burial assistance for martyrs had also been substantially enhanced. Funeral expenses within the province have been increased from Rs40,000 to Rs75,000, while the amount for transporting bodies outside the province has been raised from Rs50,000 to Rs100,000. An additional Rs20,000 to Rs25,000 has been allocated for other burial-related needs. 

Immediate relief amount increased from Rs100,000 to Rs200,000

Marriage grants for police employees have been increased from Rs12,500 to Rs50,000. Assistance for the marriage of daughters of martyrs and deceased officials has been raised from Rs50,000 to Rs200,000, while marriage grants for two daughters of serving or retired employees have been increased from Rs25,000 to Rs100,000. 
IGP Tahir also announced an increase in monthly financial assistance for widows of deceased employees. For employees in grades 1 to 11, the amount has been raised from Rs7,500 to Rs12,000; for grades 12 to 15, from Rs8,750 to Rs14,000; and for grades 16 to 17, from Rs8,750 to Rs14,000. 
The annual allowance for police officers has been increased from Rs10,000 to Rs16,000, while for officers up to grade 18 it has been raised from Rs12,600 to Rs20,000. The annual allowance for their children has also been increased from Rs12,000 to Rs18,000. 
The IGP announced that tuition fees of children of police employees who secure admission on merit in cadet and residential colleges of Balochistan will be paid from the Police Welfare Fund. In addition, special cash prizes will be awarded to children of police employees who secure top positions in matriculation and intermediate examinations under the Balochistan Board, including Rs50,000 for first position, Rs40,000 for second and Rs30,000 for third position.

The man appeared to be suffering from mental health issues, and four of his own children were among the fatalities in the attack, which took place in and around his home, according to local media reports.
The suspect had an argument with his wife over the phone before stabbing one of the victims, his 11-year-old daughter, 44 times in the kitchen of their home, local media reported.
“A man killed four adults and five children with a sharp object at a residence in Hadji Iding Soemitaweg,” the local police said in a statement.
“A sixth child and an adult were seriously injured and were transported” to the hospital, according to the statement.
Officers who arrived on the scene had to open fire on the suspect, as “he attacked police with a sharp object,“ the statement said.
The man sustained a gunshot wound to the leg and has been hospitalised under police supervision, police said without identifying him.
“Further details regarding the true circumstances of this tragic attack will follow,” the statement concluded.
According to the local press, which visited the scene of the attack and spoke to the man’s neighbours in Hadji Iding Soemitaweg, a neighbourhood in the Commewijne district, the suspect had mental health issues.
Suriname’s President Jennifer Geerlings-Simons issued a statement in response to the killings on her Facebook page.
“At a time when family and friends should stand together and support one another, we are faced with the harsh reality that there is another side to the world,” she wrote.
“A father who takes the lives of his own children and, in the process, kills his neighbours as well. I wish all those in mourning much strength, courage, and comfort in this unimaginably difficult time.“</p><small>2025-12-28 18:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2813470560b2cf1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963728/trump-hails-very-productive-call-with-russias-putin-ahead-of-zelensky-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Trump hails ‘very productive’ call with Russia’s Putin ahead of Zelensky meeting</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Sunday he had “a good and very productive” phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin ahead of his meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Florida later today.
He did not provide details about what was discussed.
Meanwhile, Russia’s Interfax news agency reported that the pair had spoken, citing Kremlin Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.
Taking to Truth Social, Trump wrote that the meeting would take place in the main dining room of his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida’s Palm Beach at 1pm (11pm PKT).
“Press is invited,” the US president wrote.



Zelensky and Trump intend to hammer out a plan to end the war in Ukraine, but face major differences on crucial issues and provocations from Russian air attacks.
Russia struck Kyiv and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. Zelensky called it Russia’s response to the ongoing US-brokered peace efforts.
Zelensky has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine’s contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump’s Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics.
The Ukrainian president and his delegation arrived in Florida late on Saturday, Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Serhiy Kyslytsya said on X.
“Good evening, Florida!” Kyslytsya wrote, accompanying the post with a photo of an aircraft bearing the US president’s surname on the fuselage.







Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv’s control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday’s talks might produce.
The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a US proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelensky said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote.
Axios said US officials viewed Zelensky’s willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote. A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan.
Zelensky’s in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1pm (11pm PKT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States.
Sticking points over territory
Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelensky said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90 per cent finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved.
While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines.
The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms.
Zelensky, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km of its territory per day in 2025.
Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12pc of its territory, including about 90pc of Donbas, 75pc of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.
Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join Nato.
Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack Nato members.
The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan, which emerged from talks between US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November.
Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and US negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan.
Canada, European allies rally behind Kyiv
Saturday’s air attacks show that Putin does not want peace, Zelensky said to reporters after arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.
In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney said peace “requires a willing Russia”.
“The barbarism that we saw overnight — the attack on Kyiv — shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time,” Carney said, pledging C$2.5 billion (US$1.83bn) in additional economic aid to Ukraine.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke with Zelensky along with other European leaders on Saturday, said on X that their shared objective remained “a just and lasting peace” that preserved Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strengthening the country’s security and defence capabilities.







Zelensky said he would speak with European leaders again after he meets with Trump.</p><small>2025-12-28 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2819320838e7b88.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963742/picss-terms-2025-deadliest-for-militants-in-pakistan-with-2115-fatalities' target='_blank'><strong>PICSS terms 2025 ‘deadliest’ for militants in Pakistan with 2,115 fatalities</strong></a><br><p>The year 2025 was found to be “deadliest” for terrorists in Pakistan, with 2,115 terrorist fatalities, while 664 security personnel and 580 civilians were slain, according to a report released by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).
PICSS said that Pakistan saw a “marked escalation” in 2025, with violence intensifying in both “tempo and lethality”, pushing several security indicators to their highest levels in years.
As per the report, the year 2025 has not only delivered a steep rise in overall combat-related deaths, but also became the deadliest year for terrorists since 2015, the most lethal for security forces since 2011, and the worst for civilian casualties in a decade.
“Militant attacks climbed to their highest annual total since 2014, and the use of suicide bombings and small drones showed a clear upward trend,” said the report.
According to statistics released by PICSS, combat-related deaths in 2025 rose by 73 per cent to 3,387, compared to 1,950 in 2024. Fatalities included 2,115 terrorists, 664 security forces personnel, 580 civilians and 28 members of pro-government peace committees (combatants).
The report added that terrorists accounted for about 62pc of total combat-related deaths, and their 2,115 fatalities represented the highest annual terrorist death toll since 2015, when 2,322 militants were killed. Compared to 2024, terrorist deaths increased by 122pc, as 951 militants were killed in 2024.
PICSS also recorded 664 fatalities among security personnel in 2025, a 26pc rise from 528 in 2024 and the highest annual figure since 2011, when 677 personnel lost their lives.
Civilian deaths also increased by 24pc to 580 in 2025, compared to 468 in 2024, marking the highest annual civilian toll since 2015, when 642 civilians were killed.
Injuries also rose sharply, with the think tank recording that 2,263 were injured in 2025, including 1,025 security forces personnel, 982 civilians, 228 terrorists and 28 members of pro-government peace committees.
“This represents a 53pc increase over 2024 and was the highest annual number of injuries since 2014, when 3,829 people were injured,” said PICSS.
Compared with 2024, PICSS said that injuries among security forces increased by 62pc (1,025 compared to 631), civilian injuries rose by 40pc (982 compared to 701), and terrorist injuries increased by 61pc (228 compared to 142).
The Islamabad-based think tank also reported an 83pc rise in arrests of suspected terrorists, with 497 suspects held in 2025 compared to 272 in 2024. According to the report, the 2025 figure was the highest annual total since 2017, when 1,781 terrorists were either arrested or laid down their weapons.
The report further indicated that kidnappings rose even more sharply in 2025, with terrorists abducting 215 people compared to 82 in 2024; an increase of 162pc. PICSS said the 2025 kidnapping figure was the highest in a single year since 2012, based on its militancy database.
On the operational front, PICSS recorded at least 1,063 terrorist attacks in 2025, a 17pc increase compared with 908 in 2024 and the highest annual total since 2014, when 1,609 terrorist attacks were recorded.
It further reported that the suicide attacks increased by 53pc, with 26 such incidents reported in 2025 compared with 17 in 2024.
PICSS noted an expanding trend in the use of small drones, including quadcopters, with 33 such incidents recorded during 2025, alongside increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles by security forces.
The report stated that the most violence remained concentrated in  Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including the tribal districts, and Balochistan.
Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan said on Wednesday that 27 cops were martyred in 134 terrorist attacks targeting personnel in the district in 2025.
He said the data showed that during 2025, a total of 134 terrorist attacks targeted police stations, police posts, checkpoints, police mobiles and police parties. In these attacks, 27 police personnel were martyred, while 79 sustained injuries. In retaliatory action by police, 53 terrorists were killed, and 163 were injured, he said.
The DIG said that Bannu police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations across the district, resulting in the arrest of 105 terrorists and the elimination of 65 terrorists. Overall, successful action was taken against 170 terrorists, he said.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism and stop providing sanctuary to the TTP, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.</p><small>2025-12-28 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/282012272de17b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963743/m-tag-mandatory-for-islamabad-entry-starting-january-1-2026' target='_blank'><strong>M-Tag mandatory for Islamabad entry starting January 1, 2026</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: To ensure the security of the federal capital, the administration has decided that vehicles without M-Tags will not be allowed to enter Islamabad from January 1, 2026.
The M-Tag is a prepaid radio frequency identification (RFID) sticker for a car windshield that automates toll payments. As a vehicle passes through a toll plaza, scanners identify the vehicle and entry point; upon exiting, the system automatically deducts the fare from the balance, eliminating the need to wait in long queues.
The decision has been made on the instructions of the Federal Minister for Interior Mohsin Naqvi. Moreover, actions will be taken against vehicles without M-Tags.
The Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Islamabad, Irfan Memon, has ordered that processing at all M-Tag points be expedited so that the maximum number of vehicles can be registered before the deadline approaches.
According to Memon, “16 M-Tag facilitation points have been established at various locations across the city.”
Since November 14, nearly 100,000 vehicles have been issued M-Tags, the DC Islamabad stated.
“Vehicles without M-Tags will be identified with the help of tag readers. Tag readers have been installed at various entry points and checkpoints. From January 1, as soon as the tag readers become operational, action will be taken against vehicles without M-Tags,” Memon said.
“Citizens are advised to get M-Tags installed on their vehicles immediately to avoid any inconvenience.“
Earlier this year, the National Highways Authority (NHA) decided to encourage the public to have M-Tags, and for that, it announced to charge an additional 25 per cent from people without M-Tags on motorways.
Each person is being charged Rs250 for the issuance of an M-Tag.</p><small>2025-12-28 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2815530870d42e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963730/bodies-of-woman-3-children-found-hanging-in-a-house-in-karachis-sohrab-goth-police' target='_blank'><strong>Bodies of woman, 3 children found hanging in a house in Karachi’s Sohrab Goth: police</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Bodies of a woman and three children have been found hanging inside a house near Machhar Colony in Karachi’s Sohrab Goth, police said on Sunday.
A statement issued by Sohrab Goth police said a crime scene unit had visited the site and further investigation was under way.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said Sohrab Goth police brought the bodies of the woman, 35 and her children, aged 10, 3 and 2, for post-mortem examination at Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
“We have collected all samples for chemical analysis,” said Dr Syed, adding that the cause of death has been reserved until reports are issued.
East Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zubair Nazir Shaikh told Dawn that there was no sign of a quarrel at the site of the incident, nor did neighbours say they heard a struggle.
“The husband told police that he worked at New Subzi Mandi and had left for work at around 4am on Sunday,” SSP Shaikh said. “When he returned several hours later, he saw his wife and three children dead.”
The SSP said police are waiting for post-mortem findings, “as it would be premature at this stage to reach any final conclusion”.
Another police officer, Sohrab Goth Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Aurangzeb Khattak, told Dawn that the woman allegedly killed the children by hanging them, before ending her life over domestic issues.
“The woman was an Afghan national, while her husband originally hailed from Punjab. She was reportedly emotionally disturbed [and] allegedly used to beat the children,” DSP Khattak said.
“Her husband sometimes, in a fit of anger, used to threaten her that he would marry another woman if she did not stop beating the children.”
The DSP clarified that police have not detained the husband, but said he was being questioned.
“The man told police that when he returned from his job at New Subzi Mandi and knocked on the door, he did not receive any response,” the officer said. “When he climbed the wall, he saw their bodies hanging inside the room.”
Meanwhile, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of the incident and sought details of the case from the East senior superintendent of police (SSP), a statement by the minister’s office said.
According to the statement, he directed the official to investigate the case from all angles.
The reasons behind the crime should be identified and suspects should be dealt with in accordance with the law, Lanjar was quoted as saying.
He added that the suspects should be identified and arrested at the earliest.
Moreover, justice for the affected family and a transparent investigation into the matter should be ensured, he said.
Earlier this month, three women were found dead in an apartment in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal. Police had declared the mysterious deaths a case of homicide.</p><small>2025-12-28 15:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28201718e99ffb3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963744/pressure-intimidation-and-violence-from-multiple-actors-has-erased-space-for-press-freedom-in-balochistan-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pressure, intimidation and violence from multiple actors has erased space for press freedom in Balochistan: report</strong></a><br><p>A report on journalism in Balochistan has highlighted how pressure, intimidation and violence from multiple actors have caused the space for press freedom to shrink in the province.
The report, titled State of Media Freedoms, Access to Information and Safety of Journalists and Media Professionals in Balochistan – The Way Forward, was released by Freedom Network (FN) on Sunday and examines Balochistan’s overall media landscape, threat actors, service structures, gender dynamics, legal cases and challenges, including censorship, harassment, intimidation and dismissals from service.
It notes that national television channels and newspapers have steadily reduced their bureau presence in Quetta, as digital distribution becomes the norm, leaving coverage outside the provincial capital sparse or non-existent.
“Drawing on desk research, focus group discussions and key informant interviews, it (the report) finds a chronically constrained information environment in which local media are financially brittle, structurally peripheral to ‘national mainstream’ agendas, digitally disadvantaged, and exposed to overlapping coercive pressures from state and non-state actors,” the report stated in its executive summary.
“The cumulative effect is systematic under-coverage of public-interest issues, heightened self-censorship, and a steady erosion of citizens’ right to know.”
The province still lacks a terrestrial current affairs television channel. State-run outlets such as PTV and Radio Pakistan operate mainly from urban centres, and their multilingual mandate complicates both content production and audience reach.
The report highlighted privately-owned TV channels based in Karachi, which have positioned themselves as 24/7 satellite channel for Balochistan audiences with national and diasporic reach.
Additionally, print media is largely concentrated in Quetta and struggles with high costs, long distances and low literacy rates in rural areas.
The report also traces how security conditions, governance failures, economic constraints and demographic realities have shaped the media ecosystem and journalists’ safety in Balochistan.

It noted that journalists in the province face threats from separatist and militant groups, political and tribal elites and mobs, creating an environment where independent reporting is no longer possible.
“Journalists face pressure from both the state and non-state actors to be on their side, while the state cannot provide them safety in a place where its writ is challenged; nor is such security desirable because it naturally makes them an easy target for the militants,” the report stated, quoting Balochistan Minister for Planning and Development Zahoor Ahmad Buledi.
The report added that over two decades, “40 journalists have been killed in Balochistan; roughly 30 were targeted killings, the rest collateral to bombings/attacks“.
“Journalists are frequently coerced to carry militant claims or assist security services in tracing callers; refusal or cooperation can each trigger threats,” it added.
“Over the years and decades, Baloch militant organisations suspended the distribution of local and national newspapers in southern and central Balochistan, demanding coverage of their activities in media.”
Additionally, the report noted that intimidation comes not just from militant groups, but also from influential tribal leaders.
“Sans a few political parties that react to media coverage with restraint and patience, expressing their anger and grievances in a civil manner, others resort to tribal traits,” the report read.
FN noted in the report that aside from physical threats to their safety, journalists are also at risk of facing “structural barriers to reporting”, such as closing down offices and preventing the circulation of newspapers. They also face a dearth of government or federal advertising, causing financial insecurity.
Furthermore, it highlighted severe gender disparities in the media, noting that female journalists remain very few in number, largely confined to Quetta.
The report said they face layered constraints, including limited mobility, hostile field conditions, newsroom sexism, pay gaps, lack of basic facilities and harassment.
Editors often bar women from district assignments in the name of safety, reinforcing stereotypes while still expecting output without adequate support. As a result, many women journalists work off-camera or have their reports voiced by male colleagues.
FN Executive Director Iqbal Khattak said journalism is “lost” in Balochistan, where enforced and self-imposed censorship prevail to stay safe and avoid any mishap.
He expressed hope that the findings would draw the attention of all stakeholders to reverse the situation and ensure the safety of media practitioners so that citizens can access credible information.</p><small>2025-12-28 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/281945377b5ee6a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963741/three-iranian-satellites-launched-from-russia-state-media-says' target='_blank'><strong>Three Iranian satellites launched from Russia, state media says</strong></a><br><p>Three more Iranian satellites were sent into space on Russia’s Soyuz launchers on Sunday, Iranian state media said, as the two US-sanctioned nations extend their space collaboration.
Iran has increasingly relied on its ally Russia to put satellites in orbit in recent years, with the latest three intended to help with monitoring agriculture, natural resources and the environment.
“These satellites were designed and produced by Iranian scientists … despite all the sanctions and threats,” Iran’s ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, told state TV in reference to Western measures over Tehran’s nuclear programme.
“We are working together (with Russia) in different areas. Some are evident, and some we don’t like to clarify.” Iran’s official IRNA news agency said the three satellites — Paya, Zafar 2, and a second Kowsar —were for low-earth orbit.
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Iran and Russia have deepened ties, with Western countries accusing Iran of providing missiles and drones for Russian attacks.  Tehran denies that.</p><small>2025-12-28 14:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641941-four-indian-backed-terrorists-killed-in-kalat-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Four Indian-backed terrorists killed in Kalat IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The Khalistan Movement wants an independent Sikh state carved out of India and dates back to India and Pakistan’s independence in 1947, when the idea was pushed forward in negotiations preceding the partition of the Punjab region between the two new countries.
The protest was held in connection with reports of violence against Hindus in Bangladesh. During the gathering, Paramjeet Singh Pamma, identified by organisers as a coordinator of the Khalistan Referendum campaign, was involved in a brief scuffle with an Indian Hindu protester.
Metropolitan Police officers on duty intervened quickly, separating the individuals and dispersing the groups from close proximity to the mission building. No injuries were reported.







Following the incident, pro-Khalistan Sikh protesters formed a cordon near the embassy entrance and continued their demonstration.
They raised political slogans, accusing the Indian government of involvement in the killings of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and others. Police maintained a presence to prevent further confrontation and said the situation was brought under control.
India has designated Pamma as a “most wanted terrorist” — a charge he and his supporters reject. He currently resides in the United Kingdom. UK authorities have not announced any charges against him, and previous Indian requests related to his extradition have not resulted in court action.
The Metropolitan Police did not issue any immediate statement on arrests or further action.
Nijjar was shot dead at the age of 45 by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. His murder in June 2023 near his home in Vancouver sparked a diplomatic storm between India and Canada.
Similarly, in November 2023, US authorities thwarted a plot to kill Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States and issued a warning to India over concerns the government in New Delhi was involved, the Financial Times (FT) reported.
In October 2024, an Indian intelligence official and an Indian national indicted for their role in the plot to kill Pannun, according to the US Justice Department.
Meanwhile, in March this year, India asked the US to list Sikhs For Justice, a separatist group, as a terrorist organisation — a point that came up during talks between Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and visiting US national intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard.</p><small>2025-12-28 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28111926c1e8946.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963725/blatant-disregard-for-international-law-pakistan-20-other-nations-reject-israels-recognition-of-somaliland' target='_blank'><strong>‘Blatant disregard for international law’: Pakistan, 20 other nations reject Israel’s recognition of Somaliland</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in rejecting Israel‘s recognition of self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.
The statement also registered the countries’ rejection of any “potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land”.
The joint statement has been issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Comoros, Djibouti, Gambia, Iran, Iraq Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Turkiye, Yemen and the OIC.







Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy — and relative peace and stability — since 1991, when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.
Israel’s decision could reshape regional dynamics and test Somalia’s longstanding opposition to secession.
The Foreign Office (FO) released the joint statement by 21 nations, including Pakistan, and the OIC on Sunday, underscoring their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of the Federal Republic of Somalia.
The statement said that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.
The 21 nations and the OIC condemned the measure in the strongest terms, saying that it “constitutes a grave violation of the principles of international law and the United Nations Charter, which explicitly stipulates the imperative of protecting the sovereignty of states and their territorial integrity, and reflects Israel’s expansionist” policy.
They underscored their full support of the sovereignty of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and the unequivocal rejection of any measures that undermine the unity of Somalia, its territorial integrity or its sovereignty over its entire territory.
“The recognition of parts of states constitutes a serious precedent and threatens international peace and security, and violates the cardinal principles of international law and the United Nations Charter,” their joint statement read.
They registered their “full rejection of any potential link between such measure and any attempts to forcibly expel the Palestinian people out of their land, which is unequivocally rejected in any form as a matter of principle”.
In a separate statement on Saturday, the FO termed Israel’s recognition of Somaliland an attempt to undermine Somalia’s sovereignty.
“Pakistan strongly condemns any attempts to undermine the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia, and rejects, in this regard, the announcement made by Israel recognising the independence of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” the FO said in a statement.
Islamabad called on the international community to step in to reject any such actions, and “prevent and deter Israel from undermining the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the broader region”.
Meanwhile, in a call with Somali Foreign Minister Abdisalam Abdi Ali, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s full support for Somalia’s sovereignty and condemned actions undermining it, the FO said in a post on X.
“The Somali Foreign Minister thanked the DPM/FM (Dar) for standing by Somalia and for Pakistan’s continued and sustained support,” the post read. “He also sought Pakistan’s assistance in raising Somalia’s concerns at the UNSC.”
The FO said that Dar affirmed Pakistan’s full support for Somalia at the UN and other multilateral fora.







Similarly, in another call with Egyptian Foreign Minister Dr Badr Abdelatty, Dar discussed regional and global developments, with Somalia and Yemen in particular, the FO said in another social media post.







For its part, Somalia has declared the Israeli decision a “deliberate attack” on its sovereignty.
Meanwhile, the African Union has warned the move risks “setting a dangerous precedent with far-reaching implications for peace and stability across the continent”.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry said on the social media platform X on Saturday that Israel had previously identified Somaliland “as a destination for the forced displacement of our Palestinian people, particularly from the Gaza Strip”. It warned against any “complicity” with such plans.







While several other nations, as well as the European Union, have called for respecting Somalia’s sovereignty, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has characterised the recognition as a continuation of the “spirit of the Abraham Accords”.
However, the United States signalled it would not follow Israel’s lead. When asked by the New York Post whether the US planned to recognise Somaliland, President Trump said, “No.”
“Does anyone know what Somaliland is, really?” Trump said, distancing Washington from the move.</p><small>2025-12-28 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/28155346a922711.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1963729/bilawal-highlights-significance-of-politics-of-reconciliation-calls-for-opposition-to-play-responsible-role' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal highlights significance of politics of reconciliation, calls for opposition to play ‘responsible’ role</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari highlighted on Sunday the significance of the politics of reconciliation, urging the opposition to play a “responsible” role and also called for the ruling party and its allies to take the necessary steps in this regard.
Bilawal expressed these views while speaking to the media at the inauguration ceremony of the Sindh Institute of Child Health and Neonatology in Larkana.

He recalled that former prime minister Benazir Bhutto had given the message of “truth and reconciliation” and “reconciliation in politics”.
Linking it with the country’s progress and economic prosperity, he said the ruling party and its allies would have to play their part for this while the opposition would also have to play a “responsible role”.
“If stringent [measures] are taken in response to the politics of extremism, then there should be no complaints,” he remarked, quoting the English idiom “if you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen”.
He added, “If you (the PTI) attack a national institution just because of a small NAB (National Accountability Bureau) case against your leader and because of a small arrest, then don’t complain. Action will be taken against you in accordance with the law and Constitution.“
Bilawal maintained that if the PPP had been in PTI’s place, it would have faced more severe consequences.
He advised the PTI to let go of the “politics of extremism”, saying that it would not benefit the party itself and its workers, but it would also have a positive impact on the country’s politics.
The PPP chairperson then went on to say that while Benazir’s philosophy was that of the politics of reconciliation, President Asif Ali Zardari had played the “biggest role” in its implementation.
“From the first day after the election till yesterday in my speech, and even within the party, my stance has been that President Zardari will have to play his role.
“President Zardari not just has a [track record] but also the people’s confidence that he is capable of playing a role for reconciliation in politics,” Bilawal said.
However, he pointed out there was a “unique dynamic” that had to be considered in current circumstances.
“The situation on frontiers with India and Afghanistan is before you, and internally terrorism is increasing,” he said, adding that in this situation, the role of opposition parties was of most importance.
“If they have to operate like an extremist party, then the state’s response would be in accordance with that […] But if they adopt a political attitude, [other] parties may get some political space to play a role in reducing the political division and polarisation in the country.”
He said political reconciliation was the way forward and an environment conducive to that would have to be created, else the people and the country would face the consequent loss.
In response to a question about Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who recently demanded fresh elections across the country, Bilawal said all political parties should play their role to ensure that free and fair elections were held, whenever they were to be held.
“And if any amendments, any changes in the law are required for that, we will have to increase people’s trust in the Election Commission.
“There is no point in holding elections if allegations of rigging are to be made again. So, now that there is time and the writing on the wall is that elections will not be held early, serious political parties should try to bring electoral reforms aimed at increasing the trust of people, as well as the political parties in the election commission,” Bilawal said.
Referring to the complaints regarding recent by-elections, he said he wouldn’t want polls, be it by-polls or general elections, to be held in such a situation and become a cause of “more political instability”.
Again highlighting the need for the opposition to work towards reconciliation, Bilawal said that the government would also have to take some measures.
“Parliament should be made functional. The [platform] of Parliament should be used — politicians and political workers will have to take several measures for us to be able to create space for tolerance in politics,” he added.
Earlier in the media talk, Bilawal said that while the government had been claiming that the economy was improving and economic indicators on paper seemed to be improving, there was a “crisis of affordability” in the country.
He also said that the PPP’s views on privatisation were that a successful model in this area was that of public-private partnership.
In response to a question, he again stressed that political parties should find political means to resolve issues.
“Long-term solutions to our issues, economic difficulties and questions of national security lie in genuine political stability and in the lasting innings of one political party,” he asserted.
“And all political forces and our senior politicians should think about what measures need to be taken to establish genuine political stability.“</p><small>2025-12-28 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641921-pod-of-dolphins-spotted-in-gwadar-amid-noctiluca-bloom' target='_blank'><strong>Pod of dolphins spotted in Gwadar amid Noctiluca bloom</strong></a><br><p>
