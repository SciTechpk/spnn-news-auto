Frank was seconds away from launching his era in charge with a trophy until a late Paris Saint-Germain revival won the UEFA Super Cup on Wednesday.
The former Brentford boss replaced Ange Postecoglou despite the Australian ending Tottenham’s 17-year trophy drought by lifting the Europa League last term. Postecoglou was undone by Tottenham’s worst domestic season since 1976-77 as they finished just above the relegation zone in 17th place.
Frank’s bid to revive Tottenham’s league fortunes got off to the perfect start in north London. Richarlison made the most of the faith shown in him by Frank as the Brazilian turned in Mohammed Kudus’ cross to open the scoring.

The pair combined again on the hour in more spectacular fashion as Richarlison’s bicycle kick converted the Ghanaian’s delivery.
Brennan Johnson was Tottenham’s Europa League final hero with the only goal against Manchester United and he began the new season by racing clear to slot in the third.
“Perfect start or dream start. A good performance against a difficult opponent. I will just enjoy it and I hope the players, the club and the fans enjoy it because that is important,” Frank said.
At Molineux, Pep Guardiola unveiled his City revamp as he bids to bounce back from last season’s third place finish.
City’s failure to defend the title after winning it for the previous four seasons has prompted a major overhaul from Guardiola.
Norway striker Haaland opened the scoring with a 34th minute tap-in from a Rico Lewis pass. Tijjani Reijnders, signed from AC Milan in the close-season, doubled City’s lead with a fine finish from an acute angle three minutes later.
Haaland blasted City’s third goal in the 61st minute before Rayan Cherki, lured from Lyon in the summer, marked his debut by drilling in from the edge of the area in the 81st minute.

For the past two seasons, all three promoted teams have gone down.
Hoping to buck the trend, Sunderland shocked West Ham 3-0 on their return to the Premier League.
Former Arsenal and Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Granit Xhaka is among the pool of new signings attracted to the Stadium of Light. But it was three players key to their promotion back to the Premier League for the first time since 2017 who scored.
Eliezer Mayenda’s looping header gave the Black Cats lift off on the hour mark. Centre-back Dan Ballard headed in the second before Wilson Isidor rounded off a huge win in stoppage time.
Newcastle miss Isak
Newcastle missed the unsettled Alexander Isak as they failed to find the breakthrough against 10-man Aston Villa in a 0-0 draw at Villa Park.
The Magpies were the dominant side even before Ezri Konsa’s red card for bringing down Antony Gordon 24 minutes from time.
Isak had not been involved during Newcastle’s pre-season as he appears determined to force through a move to Liverpool, who reportedly saw a £110 million ($149 million) offer for the Swedish striker rejected.
The two clubs face off in their next league match at St. James’ Park on August 25.
Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said he wants an end to the saga one way or another.

“From my perspective, you want a resolution quickly. It’s taking away the focus of the players and the supporters,” said Howe “We want to be united together. We’d like a resolution, but we’re not in control of that.”

This adds to the casualties in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, where the unprecedented floods have claimed at least 12 and nine lives, respectively, besides causing widespread destruction.
KP witnessed devastating scenes yesterday as flash floods caused by heavy rainfall and cloudbursts in multiple districts claimed over 200 lives in a day, including five crew members of a provincial government chopper that crashed in Mohmand during relief and rescue efforts.
Buner was the worst-affected district in the province with 208 lives lost in the past 48 hours, according to a PDMA situation report. It added that 120 people were injured, while Deputy Commissioner Kashif Qayum Khan’s office reported that 50 were still missing.
 
 

According to a PDMA report seen by Dawn.com earlier today, Shangla reported 37 deaths, Mansehra 23, Swat 22, Bajaur 21, Battagram 15, Lower Dir five and a child drowned in Abbottabad.
Detailing infrastructure damage, the report said 11 houses were destroyed while 63 were partially damaged due to the floods. Two schools in Swat and another in Shangla were also affected.

The KP government declared an emergency in the severely affected districts of Buner, Bajaur, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, Torghar, Upper and Lower Dir and Battagram.
According to a notification available with Dawn.com, the state of emergency will remain in place until August 31 and local administrations in these districts have been authorised to mobilise all resources for relief activities.
“The Provincial Disaster Management Authority shall provide from its central storage … a reasonable quantity of tents and NFIs (non-food items), and/or any other article available if required for the subject purpose,” the notification read.
The KP government released Rs1 billion in funds to the PDMA for “timely compensation/preparedness and response to cope with any untoward situation”, a notification shared by it on X said.
It also allocated over Rs1.55bn worth of funds for its Communication and Works Department for the restoration of highways and bridges in the flood-affected districts.
Additionally, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said it was closely monitoring the situation in flood-affected areas, noting that flash floods damaged several cellular and fixed-line sites, causing service disruptions.
“PTA teams are on the ground, coordinating with federal [and] provincial authorities, district administrations and telecom operators for swift restoration,” the PTA said in a statement.
In Buner, the PTA held meetings with Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Buner Deputy Commissioner Kashif Qayum and senior officials of PTCL and CMOs (cellular mobile operators) to review recovery efforts.
“PTA, together with operators, is making all-out efforts to restore communication services at the earliest, recognising their vital role in rescue and relief operations,” the statement added.
Additionally, mobile operator Jazz announced in a press release that it would provide free on-net and PTCL calls for all subscribers in KP.
“The Government of Pakistan has also launched the nationwide 911 unified emergency helpline (PEHL), offering citizens free-of-charge access to emergency services across the country,” the operator added.
 






On the directives of Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, the Pakistan Red Crescent in KP set up an Emergency Relief Centre to assist flood-affected districts. It can be contacted on 0300-5849255 (secretary), 0334-9086169 (admin officer), 091-9333666, or 091-2590846.
 






Meanwhile, state broadcaster PTV News provided a weather advisory on X, warning people of “a severe risk of floods and landslides on Torghar, Battagram, Shangla, Lower Kohistan, Tatta Pani, Gilgit, Hunza and Swat roads”, discouraging unnecessary travel in these areas.
According to the post, GB’s Somro Bridge, Ghanche, Saltoro Bridge and Baghicha (Skardu) Bridge were severely damaged and citizens were urged to completely avoid travel.
It added that traffic was suspended on the Jaglot-Skardu road, while routes in Ghizer district, Naltar Road, Babusar Top Road and around Hunza were closed, with tourists discouraged from travelling.
 






Meanwhile, the provincial management service (PMS) chairman requested in a letter that the KP finance secretary deduct a day’s salary from all PMS officers and redirect the money for relief work, further requesting that the secretary redirect his “whole salary”.
In a statement on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was “deeply anguished by the devastation caused by cloudbursts and flash floods in KP and northern Pakistan”.
Extending his heartfelt condolences and expressing solidarity, he affirmed: “The government is mobilising all resources for rescue and relief operations.”
The premier added that he met National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik and directed him to “expedite rescue operations in the nine affected districts of Swat, Buner, Bajaur, Torghar, Mansehra, Shangla, and Battagram, with urgent focus on Bajaur and Battagram”.
“Immediate relief is being provided to stranded residents, medical aid to the injured, and heavy machinery has been deployed to clear roads and restore connectivity,” PM Shehbaz said.
 






Buner Police’s public relations officer Israr Khan, put the district’s death toll at 207, compared to the 204 stated by the PDMA.
DC Qayum, in a statement, ordered a ban on the entry of private vehicles into Buner, stating that it was hindering rescue and relief work.
PTI’s Barrister Gohar, who is an MNA from Buner, and MPA Riaz Khan visited the flood-hit area of Beshonai and met the bereaved families who lost their loved ones in the floods, the KP government said.
 






Later, Gohar chaired a meeting at the Buner DC’s office, which was attended by CM Gandapur, the KP chief secretary, provincial ministers and other senior officials.
“Instructions were given to the relevant departments and district administration to expedite the search for missing persons, rehabilitation, and road clearance operations in the affected areas,” a post on Gohar’s X account read.
 






As the nation observed a day of mourning for the five crew members who died in a helicopter crash during rescue efforts, the national flag flew at half-mast at Governor House in Peshawar.
KP CM orders expedited relief efforts in flood-hit areas
CM Gandapur chaired an emergency meeting in Peshawar to review the damage caused by cloudbursts, heavy rains and flash floods across the province, which was attended by the chief secretary, divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners, senior officials and PDMA representatives, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Officials said rescue operations were largely completed and the focus was now on relief and rehabilitation.
The meeting’s participants were informed that 309 people were killed and 23 were injured in various rain and flood-related incidents, while 63 houses were partially damaged. Surveys of damage to roads and other infrastructure are still underway.

“Work is being carried out to restore road links to cut-off areas, and medical teams, food, medicines, and essential supplies are being sent to the affected districts,” the report read.
The meeting was informed that the provincial government has released Rs 1.5 billion to the PDMA for rescue, relief, and compensation, while releasing another Rs 1.5bn to the communication and works department for the repair of roads and infrastructure.
In addition, Rs500 million was allocated to deputy commissioners to compensate the families of those killed in the flooding.
“The provincial government stands firmly with the people in this difficult time and will use all available resources for their rehabilitation,” the chief minister said at the meeting.
Expressing solidarity with the bereaved families, CM Gandapur praised the provincial and district administrations for their swift response, saying their performance in the crisis had been commendable and urged them to maintain their commitment during the relief and rehabilitation phase.
“Road connectivity must be restored as quickly as possible, with helicopters used to deliver aid to inaccessible areas,” the CM ordered. “Compensation payments must be completed within two days and additional medical staff need to be deployed from neighbouring districts.
“Food supplies must be ensured so that no affected family faces shortages.”
The chief minister also instructed the chief secretary and the PDMA to strengthen monitoring and coordination between federal and provincial agencies, mobilise heavy machinery for reconstruction and immediately dispatch all available food and non-food items to flood-hit districts.
Earlier, the CM visited Buner to review the damage caused by flooding and ongoing relief operations, according to a post on X by the KP government.
“The divisional and district administration will brief the chief minister on human and financial losses and relief activities,” the government wrote. “The chief minister will also visit the affected areas and meet with the affected families.”
The post added that members of the provincial cabinet, the chief secretary, and other officials would accompany CM Gandapur.
 






While speaking to reporters in the area, the chief minister said that rescue operations have started and the government is working to clear roads blocked by the flooding.
“Routes in some areas have been restored; however, some have not,” he said. “We have also requested helicopters. Our goal right now is to restore the routes.
“I want to let people know that the provincial government compensate citizens fully for damages to their homes,” the chief minister added. “We are in touch with the NDMA and they will provide us with whatever we need.”
 






PM to visit affected areas: Amir Muqam
Federal Minister Muqam, visited areas in Buner affected by floods today to assess the damage and meet with victims, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The minister, who is also the president of the PML-N in KP, was accompanied by the Malakand commissioner and other senior officials.
Muqam stated that he was visiting on the instructions of PM Shehbaz, who is personally overseeing the relief operation. “This is not the time for politics; the entire nation stands with victims,” he said.
The minister added that the prime minister would also be visiting the affected districts soon, but did not say specifically when.
 






During his visit, Muqam directed officials to expedite relief efforts, which are being supported by the local police and district administration. He met with affected families, offering condolences and reviewing ongoing relief activities.
The minister noted that the local administration, the Pakistan Army, and Frontier Corps were all participating in the rescue operation.
“Many villages have been completely destroyed and prayers are being offered for those still missing,” he said. “Medical camps have been established in affected areas and the federal government will provide all necessary resources.”
11 dead, 318 homes destroyed in GB: disaster authority
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), 11 people were killed, 25 were injured and four were reported missing during the past 48 hours.
The authority added that 92 houses were partially damaged, while 99 were fully destroyed, citing initial reports. Detailed assessments were still ongoing
Interior Minister Shams Lone said that the bridge on the Baltistan Highway was swept away in the flood, cutting off four districts of Baltistan from Gilgit for the second day.
He said that since July 22, “thirty-five people died, 35 were injured and four are missing in the flood waves. Similarly, 318 houses have been completely demolished and 674 have been partially damaged.”
Lone said that the GB government does not have the resources, so the Army has taken steps to help in relief efforts.
“The Pakistan Army played an important role in the rehabilitation after the massive destruction caused by the Babusar flood and provided food and other essential items to the victims of Ghizer today,” he said. “The Army has played an important role and is still at the forefront in this difficult phase.”
Later, Rescue Information Officer Shakriz said in a statement that the body of a person previously reported missing had been recovered, bringing the overall death toll in the region to 36.
Tourists trapped, power plants damaged in GB’s Naltar Valley: govt
Meanwhile, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said a “great number of tourists” were trapped in the Naltar Valley as the land route was disconnected after floodwaters washed away a huge chunk of the Naltar Expressway.
In his statement, the official said the power supply in the area had been suspended as the three power plants situated there were shut down due to the floods.
According to Faraq, river waters from the Jaglot Goro stream entered several houses and restaurants in low-lying areas.
He added that floods across the province caused severe damage to public property and infrastructure.
“Flooding in four locations in Gilgit district today severely damaged four power plants, a bridge and an expressway, while a large number of buildings were submerged in Jaglot Guru.”
Faraq said that the floods in Naltar Valley damaged three power plants, cutting off power supply to thousands of people.
“A power plant and a bridge were also damaged in Bagrot, cutting off power, while land communication was suspended due to the bridge being washed away,” Faraq said.
“A flood relay containing heavy stones swept away a house within the limits of Allahwali Lake in Astore in the afternoon,” he added. “Local people ran to save their lives.”

Rescue efforts continue but face challenges
The KP PDMA told AFP that around 2,000 rescue workers were engaged in recovering bodies from the debris and carrying out relief operations in nine affected districts.
Rescue 1122 Director General Muhammad Tayyab Abdullah told Dawn.com that an elite rescue squad of 80 individuals has been formed for areas where operations are facing “intense difficulty”.
“In the past 12 hours, 3,542 emergencies have been responded to, while 76 vehicles are taking part in the rescue operations,” he detailed.
DG Abdullah noted that the teams were facing challenges in their activities because of ruined roads, while people were also not able to contact helplines due to damaged mobile towers.
Similarly, KP Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told AFP: “Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances.
“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he highlighted.
“They are trying to evacuate survivors, but very few people are relocating due to the deaths of their relatives or loved ones being trapped in the debris.”
 


Meanwhile, PTV News reported that Pakistan Army personnel have arrived in Buner as part of relief efforts. The broadcaster said in a post on X that special equipment from the Army Corps of Engineers will be used to recover bodies and those injured trapped underneath layers of mud.
“Rations and other supplies are being provided through Pakistan Army helicopters, and people are being evacuated from flood-hit areas to safe locations,” PTV News wrote.
 






A statement issued by Buner’s Rescue 1122 said DG Abdullah, Buner Operations Director Mir Alam, North Region Operations Director Arshad Iqbal and the district emergency officer were supervising the operation themselves.
The Rescue DG urged the public not to go near floodwaters, rainwater drains or bridges, and contact the 1122 helpline in the case of an emergency.
In Battagram, two more bodies were recovered at the Malkal Gali-Neel Band village, which had been impacted by a cloudburst on early Thursday, according to Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Saleem Khan.
The rescue operations had resumed at 6am after being suspended at 7:30pm yesterday due to nightfall and the challenging terrain.
Flash floods also severely impacted the power infrastructure in Swat, as floodwaters entered the 132KV Swat grid station, causing the tripping of 41 feeders and the complete suspension of electric supply across the region.
The KP PDMA has said rainfall would continue until August 21 in different parts of the province.
The Pakistan Meteoro­logical Department (PMD) has also warned the Balochistan government to take emergency measures to prepare for a new spell of monsoon rains in the province, which will start from Aug 18 and continue until Aug 22.
Villagers in Buner deal with the aftermath
Beshonai village in Buner, a settlement of more than 80 households, was left in ruins a day after flash flooding tore through the village centre.
According to a Dawn.com correspondent on the ground, a steady stream was calmly running beneath the large stones the flood brought in, and though there are some remaining houses along the bank of the stream, most others were completely washed away, along with their inhabitants.
Hakeem Jan, a resident of a nearby village, told Dawn.com that he heard “loud bursts” in the mountains, then “a huge rally of water and big stones colliding and raging downward”.
“Multiple cloudbursts in the upper portion of the Elum valley caught the villagers unguarded, leaving them with no time to escape,” Jan said. “The survivors are the children who were at school away from the village or the ones who are on jobs outside Buner.”

One survivor, Gul Bacha, told Dawn.com, “Most people working in the relief operations are outsiders and there are no confirmed figures on the death toll here. I was upstream when I saw a big wave of black water coming in the direction of our village.
“I ran like crazy and was screaming to the villagers …  some people heard me and ran, but most people downstream were caught unawares.”
Javed Khan, a schoolteacher who lost several relatives, told Dawn.com that while no bodies were recovered in Beshornarry, “seventy corpses were swept away and recovered in Peer Baba and Dagar, later laid to rest by locals”.

Peer Baba Union Council Nazim Abbas Shaheen told Dawn.com that accessibility was a major hurdle. “It is almost impossible to bring heavy machinery into the affected areas,” he said.
In Qadar Nagar, another valley in the area affected by the floods, a collective funeral for 56 people was offered, where one family lost 40 people. The two survivors among them were a father and his son, who were at Islamabad airport to collect another son who had returned home from abroad.
After hitting Beshonai village and Qadar Nagar, the floodwater left behind wrecked houses and destroyed vehicles in its path, affecting major towns and villages. Images taken by a correspondent on the ground showed cars swept away and lodged in buildings, as well as flooded school yards.

Suhail Warraich, senior editor for the Daily Jang newspaper, wrote today that the army chief had spoken to him in person on the matter during a recent meeting between the two in Brussels. Field Marshal Munir had stopped over in Belgium on his return from last week’s visit to the United States.
“The talk started with politics, especially on rumours that there is some effort to change the president of Pakistan as well as the prime minister. Field Marshal Munir clearly said, during both the Brussels gathering and in his two-hour discussion with me, that the rumours about a change were completely false,” the column said.
 
 

“When informed that this ‘news’ had been circulated by both civil and military agencies, he [Field Marshal Munir] said this could not be possible. ‘In fact, there are elements behind this who oppose both the government and the authorities and wish to create political anarchy,’” the army chief was quoted as saying.
Last month, speculation was rampant that President Asif Ali Zardari may soon step down, potentially paving the way for the army chief to assume the country’s presidency. The reports on social media had claimed that work was underway to replace the current parliamentary system with a presidential form of government. Some reports had also claimed that President Zardari had set one condition for his exit — a key role for his son Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the new dispensation.
The rumours were summarily addressed and rubbished by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi twice and by military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry as “nonsense”.
 
 

Field Marshal Munir was also reported as saying on stage at the Brussels gathering that: “God has made me protector of the country. I do not desire any position other than that.”
The army chief praised the prime minister and his 18-hour work streak, the federal cabinet and the government, especially their “determination and courage” during the May conflict with India.
“On a question about politics, he [the army chief] said that political reconciliation is possible only if there is a sincere apology,” the column read. Although it does not specify who the army chief was referring to or who the question was about, it can be inferred that he may have been referring to the PTI and its incarcerated leader.
The military considers the PTI the “planners and architects” of the May 9 riots and in May 2024, demanded an apology from Imran Khan, who in turn claimed that the army owes an apology to him since he was “abducted” by the Rangers on May 9. However, days later, he offered to apologise on the condition that the involvement of PTI supporters in the violent protests was proved through CCTV evidence. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified.
On foreign relations, the army chief was said to have expressed confidence in maintaining equilibrium between the US and China. “We will not sacrifice one friend for the other,” Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying.
The army chief also described US President Donald Trump’s efforts for peace as “genuine”, and said Pakistan had taken the lead in nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize, which was then followed by other nations.
The column further said the army chief had warned India against destabilising Pakistan’s peace through the use of “proxies”, and also cautioned Afghanistan against “pushing the Taliban into Pakistan”, or it would be met with a response.
“He said that we have shown kindness and favours to Afghans for years, but instead of repaying them, a conspiracy is being hatched against us in collaboration with India,” the column read.</p><small>2025-08-16 18:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/161203323f7916c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931253/in-pictures-pakistans-north-reels-from-death-ruined-infrastructure-after-calamitous-floods' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Pakistan’s north reels from death, ruined infrastructure after calamitous floods</strong></a><br><p>Flash floods caused by heavy rainfall and cloudbursts devastated the country’s northern areas on Friday, with over 300 lives lost in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa alone so far.
The unprecedented floods also claimed at least 11 lives in Gilgit-Baltistan. The majority of casualties were in Ghizer district, where the deluge damaged agricultural land, crops and a vital bridge, cutting off the area’s 15,000 residents from the rest of the region.
Another nine people died across Azad Jammu and Kashmir, where infrastructure losses included two schools, 12 water mills, one main and four pedestrian bridges, six electricity poles, among others.
Rescue and army personnel have been engaged in rescue and relief operations since yesterday, as the country reels from yet another monsoon calamity.

Pakistan and the UK have been engaged in Enhanced Strategic Dialogue since 2011, which has deepened and broadened the dialogue between the two countries, covering areas such as trade, economic growth and development, cultural cooperation, security, and education.
The Foreign Office posted a photo of FM Dar in the UK today with Pakistani High Commissioner Dr Mohammad Faisal.
 






A statement by the FO earlier today said that during his two-day official visit FM Dar would hold meetings with Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Pakistan Hamish Falconer in London, in addition to a breakfast meeting with Commonwealth Secretary-General Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey.
He would also inaugurate a Punjab Land Record Authority project, which was piloted at the Pakistan High Commission in London. “The initiative aims to assist members of the diaspora in resolving land documentation issues in Pakistan remotely,” the FO said.
It added that FM Dar would also engage with British parliamentarians, Kashmiri leaders and representatives of the British-Pakistani community.
 






Earlier this month, Pakistan and the UK pledged to deepen their partnership across key sectors, with a renewed focus on defence cooperation and strategic dialogue, during high-level talks in Rawalpindi.
In July, the UK’s government launched e-visas for Pakistani students and workers as part of an “enhanced” border and immigration system.
The announcement came just a day after both countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and announced the establishment of the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.</p><small>2025-08-16 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1609313691279dc.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931238/trump-seeks-us-russia-ukraine-summit-after-putin-meeting-fails-to-secure-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Trump seeks US-Russia-Ukraine summit after Putin meeting fails to secure ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump failed to secure a Ukraine war ceasefire at a high-stakes summit with Russia’s President Vladimir Putin, but insisted on Saturday that he would now target a full peace agreement to end the conflict.
Three hours of talks between the White House and Kremlin leaders at an Alaska air base produced no breakthrough, but Trump and European leaders said they wanted a new summit that includes Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Speaking to top officials in Moscow a day after the talks in Alaska, Putin said he discussed ways of ending the conflict “on a fair basis” during the meeting. He also said the summit with Trump had been “timely” and “very useful”, according to images published by the Kremlin.
Zelensky said he will now go to Washington on Monday, while European leaders said they were ready to intensify sanctions against Russia after Trump briefed them on the summit and they held their own protracted talks. European leaders have also been invited to attend Monday’s meeting.
Trump remained upbeat about meeting Putin in a post on his Truth Social platform. “A great and very successful day in Alaska!” he proclaimed, adding that European leaders backed his plan for a three-way meeting with Putin and Zelensky.
“It was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a peace agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere ceasefire agreement, which often times do not hold up,” he added, confirming his meeting with Zelensky on Monday.
“If all works out, we will then schedule a meeting with President Putin. Potentially, millions of people’s lives will be saved.”
Meanwhile, The Financial Times, citing four people with direct knowledge of the talks, reported that Putin demanded that Ukraine withdraw from the eastern Donetsk region as a condition for ending the war, but told Trump he could freeze the rest of the frontline if his core demands were met.
In exchange for the Donetsk region, Putin said he would freeze the frontline in the southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, the report added.
After the summit, Trump spoke first with Zelensky, the White House said.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen later joined the call, officials said.
The European leaders, who had been wary of being left out of the Alaska meeting, held their own talks on Saturday and said they supported the proposed three-way summit.
“We are also ready to work with President Trump and President Zelensky towards a trilateral summit with European support,” they said in a joint statement that added that pressure must be maintained on Russia.
“As long as the killing in Ukraine continues, we stand ready to uphold the pressure on Russia. We will continue to strengthen sanctions and wider economic measures to put pressure on Russia’s war economy until there is a just and lasting peace,” they said.
Russia could not have a “veto” on Ukraine joining the European Union or Nato, they added.
In a separate statement, Starmer praised Trump’s efforts as bringing “us closer than ever before to ending Russia’s illegal war in Ukraine”.
But Macron, writing on X, cautioned against what he said was Russia’s “well-documented tendency to not keep its own commitments”. He called for any future peace deal to have “unbreakable” security guarantees.
He also argued for increased pressure on Russia until “a solid and durable peace” had been achieved. The European leader welcomed what they called “security guarantees” made by Trump without giving details.
A diplomatic source told AFP that Trump had offered Ukraine guarantees similar to Nato membership, but without it joining the alliance.
Later today, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told German public broadcaster ZDF said the US is ready to be part of security guarantees for Ukraine.
The war, which has killed tens of thousands and devastated much of Ukraine, went on despite the summit. Ukraine announced that Russia had launched 85 attack drones and a ballistic missile during the night. Russia said it had taken two more villages in Ukraine.
Zelensky said Trump had laid out the “main points” of the summit and that he would go to the White House on Monday “to discuss all of the details regarding ending the killing and the war”.
Trump and Putin emerged from their talks at a Cold War-era air base to offer warm words at a press briefing but took no questions from reporters.
“We’re not there yet, but we’ve made progress. There’s no deal until there’s a deal,” Trump said.
 


He called the meeting “extremely productive” with “many points” agreed, but did not offer specifics.
“There are just a very few that are left; some are not that significant, one is probably the most significant,” Trump said without elaborating.
‘Next time in Moscow’
Putin also spoke in general terms of cooperation at the joint press appearance that lasted just 12 minutes.
“We hope that the understanding we have reached will … pave the way for peace in Ukraine,” Putin said.
As Trump mused about a second meeting, Putin smiled and said in English: “Next time in Moscow”.
 


The former KGB agent tried to flatter Trump, who has voiced admiration for the Russian leader in the past.
Putin told Trump he agreed with him that the Ukraine war, which Putin ordered, would not have happened if Trump were president instead of Joe Biden.
Trump, for his part, again complained of a “hoax” that Russia intervened to help him in the 2016 election — a finding backed by US intelligence.
Before the summit, Trump had warned of “severe consequences” if Russia did not accept a ceasefire.
But when asked about those consequences during a Fox News interview after the talks, Trump said that “because of what happened today, I think I don’t have to think about that now”.
 






Putin warns Western allies
Trump, whose tone with Zelensky has changed since he berated the Ukrainian president at the White House in February, told Fox that “Now it’s really up to President Zelensky to get it done.”
Trump could not get the Russian agreement to get Zelensky into Friday’s talks.
But Zelensky, who has rejected suggestions that Ukraine give up territory, said on Saturday that he supported the American efforts.
“It is important that America’s strength has an impact on the development of the situation,” he said.
Putin warned Ukraine and European countries to “not create any obstacles” and not “make attempts to disrupt this emerging progress through provocation or behind-the-scenes intrigues”.
Trump invited Putin just a week ago and ensured there was some carefully choreographed drama for their first in-person meeting since 2019.
The two leaders arrived in their respective presidential jets and descended on the tarmac of an air base, with Trump clapping as Putin appeared.
 


US military might was on display with a B-2 stealth bomber flying overhead, as a reporter shouted audibly to Putin, “Will you stop killing civilians?”
Putin, undaunted, grinned widely as Trump took the unusual step of escorting him into “The Beast”, the secure US presidential limousine, before a meeting in a room before a screen that said — in English only — “Pursuing Peace”.
Putin smiled and joked with Russian reporters on the visit, a landmark for a leader who is facing an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court related to the Ukraine war, which has killed tens of thousands of people.

Battlefield gains
Russia, in recent days, has made battlefield gains that could strengthen Putin’s hand in any ceasefire negotiations.
Although Ukraine announced as Putin was flying in that it had retaken several villages, Russia’s army on Saturday claimed the capture of Kolodyazi in Ukraine’s Donetsk region and Vorone in the neighbouring Dnipropetrovsk region.
Trump had insisted he would be firm with Putin, after coming under heated criticism for appearing cowed during a 2018 summit in Helsinki.
While he was travelling to Alaska, the White House announced that Trump had scrapped a plan to see Putin alone and he instead held the talks alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his roving envoy Steve Witkoff.
Zelensky was not included and has refused pressure from Trump to surrender territory seized by Russia.
“It is time to end the war, and the necessary steps must be taken by Russia. We are counting on America,” Zelensky said in a social media post.

Malakand Deputy Commissioner and Commandant Malakand Levies Hamid Ur Rehman confirmed to Dawn.com that Mufti Kifayatullah had been injured in the attack.
“Today, around 1pm, JUI Malakand district emir Mufti Kifayatullah, along with his two daughters, was shot within the limits of Chowki Batkhela, Levies Post Batkhela area,” a statement by the KP Police said.
The statement added that one of his daughters was killed in the shooting, and a Levies sepoy was also killed. Another daughter was injured and is undergoing surgery, according to the statement.
Levies in large numbers are carrying out raids to arrest the attackers. Further investigation is in hand, the statement added.
Last month, at least three people were killed and four others, including a woman, were injured in an exchange of gunfire between two rival groups in the Kharkai area of Dargai tehsil in Malakand.

Swells generated by Erin will affect portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, and the Turks and Caicos Islands through the weekend, the NHC said.
The swells will spread to the Bahamas, Bermuda and the east coast of the US early next week, it said.

The new safeguard is being rolled out in the United States as Google-owned YouTube and social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok are under scrutiny to shield children from content geared for grown-ups.
A version of AI referred to as machine learning will be used to estimate the age of users based on a variety of factors, including the kinds of videos watched and account longevity, according to YouTube Youth director of product management, James Beser.
“This technology will allow us to infer a user’s age and then use that signal, regardless of the birthday in the account, to deliver our age-appropriate product experiences and protections,” Beser said.
“We’ve used this approach in other markets for some time, where it is working well.”
The age-estimation model enhances technology already in place to deduce user age, according to YouTube.
Users will be notified if YouTube believes them to be minors, giving them the option to verify their age with a credit card, selfie, or government ID, according to the tech firm.
Social media platforms are regularly accused of failing to protect the well-being of children.
Australia will soon use its landmark social media laws to ban children under 16 from YouTube, a top minister said late last month, stressing a need to shield them from “predatory algorithms”.
Communications Minister Anika Wells said four-in-ten Australian children had reported viewing harmful content on YouTube, one of the most visited websites in the world.
 
 

Australia announced last year it was drafting laws that will ban children from social media sites such as Facebook, TikTok and Instagram until they turn 16.
“Our position remains clear: YouTube is a video sharing platform with a library of free, high-quality content, increasingly viewed on TV screens,” the company said in a statement at the time. “It’s not social media.”
On paper, the ban is one of the strictest in the world. It is due to come into effect on December 10.
The legislation has been closely monitored by other countries, with many weighing whether to implement similar bans.</p><small>2025-08-16 11:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/161436581096223.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931260/key-to-success-in-balochistan-is-its-people-identifying-terrorists-themselves-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Key to success in Balochistan is its people identifying terrorists themselves: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that a military operation in an area can only be successful when the people living there themselves identify the terrorists, according to a statement issued by the military’s media wing on Saturday.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. In February, nearly 62 per cent of the total terrorism-related deaths in the country occurred in Balochistan.
“An operation in any area is successful when the people themselves identify the terrorists,” Lt Gen Chaudhry was quoted as having said.
The DG ISPR was speaking at a session with students in the ongoing internship programme organised by the military’s media wing.
During the session, there was a lively discussion regarding Pakistan, especially Balochistan, the statement said, adding that Lt Gen Chaudhry also gave detailed answers to the questions of students from Balochistan.
On the demand for a major operation against terrorism in Balochistan, the DG ISPR said: “It is put in our minds that something is festering for Pakistan among the people and youth of Balochistan.”
The people of Balochistan understand the relationship between Pakistan and the province very well, he said, adding that the people of Balochistan are also now frustrated and fed up with these terrorists.
He called on the participants “to go to Balochistan and see how sensible and far-sighted the Baloch people are.”
“Hundreds of examples have emerged that Baloch children who have studied have become the masters of their region and their destiny,” the DG ISPR said.
He quoted the example of scientist Dr Yarjan Abdul Samad, who hails from Balochistan and completed his schooling in the province, later going to graduate from the University of Cambridge.
He also gave the example of Karate champion Shahzaib Rind, adding that women from Balochistan are currently appointed as deputy commissioners in districts.
“The martyred Major Muhammad Anwar Kakar was a very brilliant officer and a great son of this land,” he continued.
He added that Major Muhammad Anwar Kakar had earlier also killed many terrorists in the Gwadar PC Hotel attack.
Lt Gen Chaudhry said it is not that the army vacates an area, conducts an operation, as when the army leaves, the terrorists will come again.
“We have to do everything with great understanding, that is why it is called an intelligence-based operation,” he said.
“The army has no interest in taking the lives of innocent people in the name of terrorism,” he continued.
“If any citizen shelters terrorists or keeps explosives in his house, they will have to face the consequences.”
“We have to work together with the people and administration of Balochistan,” he said, highlighting that an entire region or village cannot be punished for the act of one individual.
“The people there have to stand up and are standing up against terrorism,” the DG ISPR concluded.</p><small>2025-08-16 10:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619095-jui-fs-mufti-kifayatullah-injured-in-malakand-home-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F's Mufti Kifayatullah injured in Malakand home shooting</strong></a><br><p>

The SJC is a judicial body comprising of Chief Justice of Pakistan, two most senior Judges of the Supreme Court and two most senior Chief Justices of High Courts, according to the Supreme Court’s website.
A press release dated Aug 15 read that complaints against “CEC Mr Sikandar Sultan Raja and members of ECP, Mr Nisar Ahmed Durrani and Mr Shah Muhammad Jatoi, have been dismissed by the SJC in its meetings held on Nov 8, 2024 and Dec 13, 2024”.
The SJC’s statement did not provide any details regarding the complaints.
The five-year terms of CEC Raja, Sin­dh Member Durrani and Baloch­istan Member  Jatoi ended on Jan 26, but they will continue to hold the offices under the 26th amendment made in the Constitution in October last year.
The controversial amendment allowed the CEC and the members to continue till their successors come in. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution, the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days. This deadline expired on March 12, yet no concrete steps were taken.
 
 

Raja’s term is characterised by controversies. He is often criticised by the opposition for his failure to hold timely general elections, denying PTI its ‘bat’ symbol and alleged manipulation of election results.
Although the statement did not mention the complainants, the PTI had filed a complaint before the SJC in July 2024 seeking the removal of Raja and four members of the ECP. The complaint alleged that the July 12 order of the SC has held that the ECP used powers in violation of the Constitution with malice and made a skewed interpretation of the Jan 13 judgement of denying election symbol of ‘bat’ to the party.
Distrust in the CEC had been expressed long before the delayed general elections of 2024. In 2022, PTI filed a reference before the SJC to order the removal of Raja on account of the “commission of continuous and deliberate misconduct”.</p><small>2025-08-16 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619088-light-to-moderate-rains-expected-across-sindh-from-august-18' target='_blank'><strong>Rains expected across Sindh from August 17</strong></a><br><p>

“From August 18 to 20 … (Chinese foreign minister) Wang Yi will upon invitation visit India and hold the 24th special representatives meeting on the China-India border issue,” a spokesperson said in a statement.
Past trade between the neighbours across icy and high-altitude Himalayan border passes was usually small in volume, but any resumption is significant for its symbolism.
It stopped following a deadly 2020 clash between border troops.
Indian media had reported earlier in the week that China’s Wang was expected for talks in New Delhi on Monday.
His Indian counterpart, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, visited Beijing in July.
 
 

The two major economic powers have long competed for strategic influence across South Asia.
However, caught in global trade and geopolitical turbulence triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff regime, they have moved to mend ties.
In recent weeks, Chinese and Indian officials have said the two countries were discussing resuming border trade.
Agreements to resume direct flights and issue tourist visas also have been seen as part of an effort to rebuild their relationship.</p><small>2025-08-16 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619086-community-should-not-suffer-for-individual-terrorist-acts-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Community should not suffer for individual terrorist acts: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

And yet, I write this not because of that excitement, but in spite of it because there are higher roads to the same high, and this series took the service lane.
I remain stubbornly stuck in my fool’s paradise, expecting every over-staffed Test team administration to conjure a Wasim Akram, manage a Shane Warne, unleash a Shoaib Akhtar, and luck into a Jacques Kallis. I want to treat a Siraj-like spell not as heroic, but as the expected.
I’ve arranged my life so that summers in Oxford are given over to batting — being at the crease, chasing that brief illusion of batting immortality as time dissolves and the scoreboard feels like it could climb forever.
This season, that spell has been snapped by hostile bowlers, unyielding wickets that make every innings feel fragile and fleeting. Which is why watching five Tests played on pitches engineered to grant batsmen eternal life, supported with such generous slip fielders, has induced jealousy never felt before.
Dear reader, proceed knowing you’ll almost certainly disagree with me, and I’d rather have been out there, batting on those pitches than writing about them. But the pitches were theirs, not mine, so this piece is all we’ve got; most of the stats are from memory, and a few may well be wrong.

There are times when cricket forgets its soul. And then there are times like this: when cricket remembers only the algorithms.
The 2025 India vs England series was not a tale of grit or greatness. It was a viral earworm: sticky, dumb, irresistible, humming its shallow tune through five Tests like a ringtone left on repeat. Every headline read like dopamine: Gill’s century here, Duckett’s assault there, Brook’s flourish, Nair’s return. Feed-friendly, stat-heavy, instantly disposable.

At times, this series felt less like cricket and more like a month-long infomercial for bat makers — every replay, every angle, every unchallenged forward push sending the same logo into living rooms so relentlessly you could’ve sworn it was part of the broadcast watermark.
And the pitches? Boardroom floors, pristine, unyielding, built for the comfort of the well-padded. They punished fast bowlers for existing and rewarded batters for showing up. India dared to field only one seamer in the fourth Test; England countered with five in the fifth and still couldn’t scuff the shine.
Ben Duckett’s 149 rescued England’s chase of 371 at Headingley. Gill morphed mid-series from spoiled protégé to Tendulkar redux with his Edgbaston masterclass 269 and 161. Joe Root, beautiful, clinical, ultimately inconsequential. Karun Nair returned after eight quiet years, offering starts without impact.

This wasn’t a clash of wills; it was a duel where real weapons were banned. England’s fast bowling was suggestion more than threat: tidy, unthreatening, decaffeinated. Josh Tongue topped England’s wicket tally. In contrast, Mohammed Siraj became the quiet engine for India, claiming 23 wickets across five Tests, taking nothing for granted.
Edgbaston wasn’t a battle, it was a scorer’s paradise. Gill’s double centuries looked absurdly majestic like wielding a cannon in a library. At Lord’s, the ball lost its menace fast; every bowler sensed it. At The Oval, the final Test produced edge-of-seat chaos not because the pitch offered drama, but because Siraj refused to let the moment flatten. His final spell, desperate yet disciplined, helped deliver a six-run victory that leveled the series at 2–2.
The series arc? A slow burn without combustion. Suspense, yes, but without stakes. Everyone batted, no one bled. The tension mimicked Wi-Fi outages during a Netflix binge, not the existential dread of a fifth-day pitch and a game-turning spell. Players didn’t earn their performances, they were gifted them. And we, the audience, applauded saturation for substance.
Final outcome: a 2-2 draw, no heroes just influencers holding bat ads, bowlers backgrounded, and fans clapping but emotionally checked out.

Every great Test series needs a demigod with the ball. Not just a workhorse or a rhythm merchant, but someone who can, in the space of six deliveries, rearrange the story. Think of Warne circa 2005, Wasim and Waqar in ‘92, or Shoaib (of the Akhtar and not Bashir variety) in Australia. You didn’t watch them for economy or plans. You watched them for eruption.
And this was missing most acutely in the 4th Test. No one on Stokes’s team has looked remotely capable of slicing through the top order and creating that collapse on the last day — that electricity, that wild inevitability of falling wickets that makes us sit up straighter in our seats.
The result? A meandering Test match. Not poor cricket, just deeply unremarkable cricket. Passages of competence without punctuation. Good players nudging along. Bowlers doing enough to tire, but never quite enough to terrify.

If there was one constant, it wasn’t brilliance, it was blunder. Administrators so disconnected from Test cricket’s pulse they might as well be vending washing machines. The rot started in Test 1, and yet test matches 2-4 repeated it on reruns …  and still they applauded the algorithm. Had England’s final match not been salvaged by cloud cover, the fifth Test would have played out as yet another bloated draw; a mercy spared only by the drizzle, not by  managerial or athletic savvy.
In the end, what remained was not memory but metrics. Gill’s average. Duckett’s strike rate. Siraj’s stubborn resolve. No rivalries. No bruises. No poetry. Just a scoreboard with a smile.
It will linger, not in the bloodstream as great cricket should, but in the inbox unread, irrelevant, and impossible to delete.
Not as art. But as spam.</p><small>2025-08-16 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619081-with-over-2m-pending-cases-in-courts-justice-shah-warns-of-eroding-public-trust-over-delays' target='_blank'><strong>With over 2m pending cases in courts, Justice Shah warns of eroding public trust over delays</strong></a><br><p>

• Internet service across Balochistan to stay suspended until 31st, lawmakers told
• PML-N legislator accuses govt of ‘copying’ his bill
ISLAMABAD: Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar has assured the Senate that the release of an official advertisement on Independence Day, without a portrait of the country’s founder Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, would be investigated.
“It is not in our notice. If it has happened, this is heart-afflicting for all,” he told the upper house of parliament on Friday. He assured that an inquiry would be conducted to ascertain how it happened and the house will be formally informed about the progress.
The government had come under fire from political and social circles over the official advertisement issued by the Ministry of Information, which omitted images of the Quaid-i-Azam and national poet-philosopher Allama Iqbal.
The advertisement, published in major national newspapers and aired on television channels, featured images of President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, as well as the chiefs of navy and air force, besides tanks and aircraft, and a picture depicting the cultural diversity of the country.
 






The issue was raised by PTI’s Faisal Javed in his maiden speech, following his reelection, soon after the house unanimously adopted a resolution reaffirming the resolve to protect the sovereignty of Pakistan, preserving its democratic ethics and building a prosperous future for generations to come.
He stressed that the ruling elite had not paid for these advertisements out of their own pockets, saying public funds had been used for personal promotion. “They even put their photographs on newly built public toilets,” he remarked.
The PTI lawmaker also accused the government of doling out civil awards on political grounds and demeaning the prestige of the awards. “This is the insult of the people who truly deserved receiving these,” he remarked.
The law minister, himself a recipient of the Nishan-i-Imtiaz, defended giving civil awards to politicians — all from the ruling coalition. He said that out of roughly 200 recipients, only about 15 were politicians.
He said these included eight members of the team led by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari that visited various countries after heightened tensions with India, while the rest were part of the ‘war cabinet’ formed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during the conflict with India, spending many sleepless nights to remain available for emergency decisions at all times.
 


Resolution on Independence Day
Through a resolution marking the Independence Day, the house pledged to strive for sustainable development, economic empowerment and national unity.
Honouring the leadership of the Quaid-i-Azam, the resolution, moved by the law minister, paid homage to all those whose sacrifices made Pakistan a sovereign and independent state. The resolution commended the armed forces and security institutions for their unmatched valour and sacrifices in defending the nation. It paid tribute to the martyrs and Ghazis, pledging to preserve and uphold their legacy for future generations.
The resolution paid special tribute to the parliamentarians, who framed the Constitution of Pakistan and advanced democratic reforms, while reaffirming the commitment to preserving the parliamentary democracy, constitutional supremacy and rule of law.
 






The resolution also expressed commitment to promoting peaceful coexistence, regional stability and constructive engagement with neighbouring countries. It also expressed commitment to address the shared challenges, including climate change, economic inequalities, terrorism and public health crisis, while safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty.
The resolution called upon the citizens, particularly the youth, to work beyond personal and political differences and contribute actively to nation building through education, innovation, civic engagement and service to humanity.
Another resolution, urging the federal and provincial governments to celebrate the 1,500th Eid Miladun Nabi (peace be upon him) on a grand scale, was also adopted unanimously.
 






Internet services
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry informed the house that internet services in Balochistan would remain suspended until the end of August.
Responding to a calling-attention notice about the suspension of mobile internet across 36 districts of the province in the name of security causing great unrest among students, freelancers and businessmen, he said the suspension was temporary and solely a security measure.
 
 

As per a policy directive under Section 8 of the Pakistan Telec­ommunication (Reor­ganisation) Act, 1996, he said such decisions followed a specific process. He explained that requests originated from the Ministry of Interior, based on recommendations from relevant security stakeholders, and were then forwarded to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) for implementation.
The minister said that mobile internet services in Balochistan were suspended from August 6 to 31 due to credible security concerns. However, he added, telephone services remained fully operational, and the restriction was limited to mobile internet.
“All airlines, including PIA and private carriers, are fully functional in Balochistan, while road and rail links to Quetta and other cities remain open,” he added.
‘Plagiarism’ accusation
Another highlight of the day’s proceedings was criticism the government had to face from one of its own.
As the Virtual Assets Ordinance was laid before the house, PML-N MNA Afnan Ullah Khan said the bill had been blocked when he tried to bring it to the house after months of hard work.  “Now they have copied and brought it to the house,” the PML-N lawmaker said and noted that this comes in the ambit of plagiarism and cheating. “The credit should be given to the one whose bill this is,” he said.
Later, another government ally protested an attempt to get the petroleum amendment bill — okayed by the National Assembly — passed without sending it to the standing committee concerned.  It was BAP parliamentary leader Manzoor Kakar loudly opposed the bill.
The law minister initially pointed out that it was a prerogative of the house to pass a bill without referring it to the standing committee, as it had been discussed threadbare in the lower house, but PTI parliamentary leader Barrister Ali Zafar opposed the move.
The law minister ultimately had to surrender and agreed that the bill be referred to the standing committee. He, however, said he was doing this out of respect for Mr Kakar and still believed it was not a legal requirement to send a bill already passed by the NA to a standing committee.

The LSM, which contributes around 8pc to the national GDP, had contracted by 0.03pc in FY24, following a growth of 0.92pc in the preceding year.
In June 2025, LSM posted a 4.14pc year-on-year (YoY) growth, the fourth consecutive month of positive growth, mainly due to a reduction in the key interest rate to 11pc earlier in the fiscal year. However, on a month-on-month (MoM) basis, LSM showed a decline of 3.67pc in June.
The food sector, a significant component of LSM, declined by 1.83pc YoY in FY25. However, wheat and rice milling experienced a 6.38pc rise, while starch production rose 0.59pc. Vegetable ghee production dropped by 0.94pc, cooking oil by 0.33pc, and tea by 2.76pc.

Food, steel and energy weigh, while automobiles and textiles shine

The textile sector performed better, growing by 2.49pc YoY. Cotton yarn production rose by 7.59pc, and cotton cloth by 0.68pc, together making up more than 80pc of the textile sector’s output. Garment exports surged by 5.70pc.
 
 

The coke and petroleum products sector grew of 5.33pc. Petrol output increased by 1.68pc, high-speed diesel by 10.96pc, and kerosene by 23.88pc. However, LPG production fell by 1.59pc, and jet fuel oil dropped by 10.19pc.
The automobile sector exhibited robust growth, expanding by 46.15pc YoY, primarily driven by a 41.99pc increase in cars and jeeps, a 157.73pc rise in light commercial vehicles (LCVs), and 100pc growth in trucks. Bus production also grew by 66.41pc, though diesel engine production declined by 6.05pc.
The pharmaceutical sector recorded a growth of 2.74pc, while fertiliser production saw a modest increase of 1.69pc.On the downside, the iron and steel sector contracted by 8.71pc, with billets/ingots, used mainly in construction, falling by 21.86pc.
Production of hot-rolled sheets, strips, coils, and plates decreased by 1.98pc. Rubber products, non-metallic minerals, and electrical equipment also experienced declines, with respective decreases of 1.27pc, 7.88pc, and 11.65pc.

Under the PM’s Cashless Economy initiative, key goals include raising the number of active digital merchants to 2 million by the end of 2025-26, increasing mobile and internet banking users from the current 95 million to 120m within a year, and doubling annual digital payment transactions to 15 billion.
According to finance ministry sources, another primary target is routing 100pc of overseas remittances through bank accounts or mobile wallets, up from the current 80pc. This move seeks to eliminate cash payouts and boost transparency in remittance flows.
Following the directives of the committee chaired by the prime minister, the SBP is expected to play a pivotal role in expanding mobile banking services to all segments of society.

2m digital merchants and 15bn transactions targeted by FY26

Meanwhile, Minister for IT and Telecom Shaza Fatima said Pakistan, with over 143 million broadband users, has significant potential to transition to a cashless economy.
 
 

“Mobile wallets now outnumber traditional bank accounts, and the branchless banking infrastructure is robust,” she said, noting the government’s commitment to reducing reliance on physical currency and promoting digital payments. However, she acknowledged that among the four cellular mobile operators, only two — Jazz and Telenor — have established strong mobile wallet platforms.
Telenor’s Easypaisa, launched in 2009, was Pakistan’s first mobile wallet and has since evolved into the country’s first digital bank.
Farhan Hassan, Chief Digital Officer of Easypaisa Digital Bank, said the platform now offers a full range of banking services similar to those of traditional banks, helping to drive financial inclusion for millions of unbanked and underbanked Pakistanis. Easypaisa currently has around 18 million monthly active users, including 14 million mobile app users.
JazzCash, which began operations in 2012, remains the market leader with 21 million monthly active users and 15 million app users, making it the largest digital financial service provider in the country. Khayam Siddiqi, Head of Communication at JazzCash, attributed this growth to the ease of account opening, which requires no paperwork or branch visits. “Digital wallets offer a suite of services in one place — nano loans, savings, insurance, welfare disbursements, and everyday payments,” he said.
While JazzCash has gained traction in rural areas, Easypaisa enjoys a strong presence in urban centres. Despite occasional speculation surrounding its future amid the Telenor-PTCL merger, Easypaisa has retained a loyal user base.
The strength of mobile digital wallets lies in their simplicity — accounts are linked to mobile phone numbers, and transactions are facilitated by local shopkeepers acting as agents for cash-in and cash-out services. In contrast, Upaisa, the mobile wallet offered by Ufone, has a limited footprint, while Zong has yet to enter the digital market.

An FIR has been filed against her husband and children for murder and concealing evidence of the crime.
Ghulam Akhtar, a resident of Kot Adu (District Muzaffargarh), lodged an FIR with the Dhamial police stating that his daughter Samina had married Amir Abbas of her own choice about 19 years ago and was settled in Malik Colony, Girja Road, Dhamial.
The couple had three children — Mohammad Zaman, 17, Shan Haider, 15, and Maryam Rani, 12.
He said that on Wednesday morning, an announcement was made in their native town that the funeral of his daughter would be held at 8am in a local graveyard without his family being informed about her death.
Mr Akhtar said he along with his brothers Ghulam Rasool and Abdul Rehman, sister Kalsoom Bibi and others reached Amir Abbas’s home. He said his sister, Kalsoom Bibi and other women had seen torture marks on the body of Samina.
He said he contacted the police emergency in Kot Adu and sought help. As he called the police, Amir Abbas and his children started hurling threats of dire consequences at him.
After the Kot Adu police informed Ghulam Akhtar that the incident had happened in the jurisdiction of the Dhamial police station in Rawalpindi, the concerned police took legal action on his complaint. Samina’s body was transported to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital Rawalpindi for postmortem.
He further alleged in the FIR that his son-in-law, along with his children, murdered his daughter.

During a provincial assembly’s session presided over by Deputy Speaker Suriya Bibi here, Dr Ali said that floods in Malakand and Hazara divisions claimed several lives and destroyed buildings.
He said that the chief minister would be approached with a request for declaring emergency in both divisions to help out the calamity-hit residents.
The aide to the CM warned that floodwaters would soon reach Charsadda and Nowshera. He asked authorities to take all necessary steps to prevent loss of public life and property to the natural disaster.

Dr Amjad Ali calls for measures to prevent damage to public life, property

Special assistant of the chief minister for population Liaquat Ali Khan claimed that when Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan was the prime minister, neither the province faced any law and order situation nor did any resident receive extortion phone calls.
He said that the people demanded early yet effective resolution of their problem.
Mr Khan said the terrorists, who were resettled in the province, should be sent back to Afghanistan.
He sarcastically said that in the past, the PPP and PML-N leaders “fell ill” within days of detention,but PTI founder Imran Khan has not reported any such complaint in the last two years of imprisonment.
The chief minister’s special assistant said that former PTI MNA and Senator-elect Murad Saeed was named in several cases just for raising his voice for peace.
He said that the opposition parties jointly got the Mines and Mineral Bill passed in the BalochistanAssembly but were resisting a similar proposed law in KP.
Mr Khan said that Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur would never allow the passage of that bill in the provincial assembly.
He accused the opposition members of committing corruption, triggering heated exchanges.
Earlier, during the question hour, member of the opposition PPP Ahmad Karim Kundi said that he had inquired about the number of “regularised surplus employees” in the culture and tourism department and the reply submitted to the house didn’t satisfy him.
He said that since vacancies in government departments would be advertised and recruitment would be made, those recently terminated by the provincial government should be preferred for those posts.
However, law minister Aftab Alam Afridi said that the KP Culture and Tourism Authority was established in 2020.
He said that since it was a policy matter, the adviser to the chief minister on tourism would brief the opposition lawmaker on it in detail.
Mr Kundi said he would be satisfied only if the sacked employees were recruited against those vacant posts.
Minister Mr Afridi said that the government departments should not become limited companies.
He said that the opposition leadership in the Centre had “overburdened” several departments, leading to their collapse. The chair later referred the question to the relevant house committee for discussion and recommendations.
Member of the opposition JUI-F Adnan Khan said that he, too, was not satisfied with the department’s answer about the “scale and time period for upgradation of an initially recruited police constable.”
He said that in the upgradation summary laid before the chief minister, the total salary of the initially recruited constable was Rs69,127 compared to Rs73,000 for a constable in Punjab and that it was misleading as according to the salary slip of a fresh recruited constable, he received 43,000.
Mr Khan said that there were differences in the risk allowances for different grades as BPS-7 constable received around Rs4,000, BPS-9 head constable around Rs3,210 and BPS-11 assistant sub-inspector around Rs2,100.
He said that the police rendered sacrifices but had yet to receive a pay raise. He requested the chair to refer his question to the relevant house committee for further deliberation and recommendations.
Minister Afridi said that the government had no objection to the referring of the question to the relevant committee.
Minister for local government Arshad Ayub tabled the KP Local Government Amendment Bill, 2025, saying the proposed change is in connection with the authority of the mayors and chairmen. He added that the law was being amended on the recommendations of the local government association.
Minister Afridi laid the KP Tourism Amendment Bill, 2025, and the KP Press Newspapers, News Agencies and Books Registration Bill, 2025, in the house. The chair later put off the session until August 22 due to a lack of quorum.

The situation poses a serious threat to the local population that depends on earning from their crops. The threat of famine looms large as a long dry spell has destroyed crops; and locals have already consumed or disposed of their produce during the period. 
Livestock is the second source of income for many families but, at present, no fodder is available for millions of animals being reared in the region. 
For Tharparkar’s farming and herding communities, rainfall in mid-June and mid-August periods is necessary. The timely rainfall is their lifeline. Adequate amount of rain soaks the soil deep enough enabling the farming community to cultivate crops like guar, bajra, sesame, watermelon etc, besides growing fodder on grazing pastures. 

Growers, herders fear erratic or inadequate rainfall in coming days may invite natural calamity 

This year, clouds have reached the region late and the rainfall has also been inadequate as there were a few spells of light, patchy showers. The amount of rain remained far short of the required level.
Farmers fear that if several spells of heavy rains did not lash the whole region soon, both the Kharif crops and the grasslands will wither beyond recovery.
Most growers and herders fear that such a situation might expose the region to a natural calamity.
Khamiso Jhagoro, a grower and livestock owner, said in his recent observation that this year’s rainfall had barely soaked one foot of the upper soil layer which was not sufficient enough for cultivation. Thar needs at least three spells of heavy rain, ideally between mid-June and mid-August, to saturate the soil to a depth of four to five feet. 
Partab Meghwar, a farmer, said that erratic rains were often more harmful than no rain. “When scant showers fall, the seeds of grass in the soil begin to germinate. As the grass grows, livestock rush to the pasturelands and mow it down or trample over it. This leaves people and their livestock vulnerable once again,” he explained.
Once the germinated grass is trampled over, grazed or uprooted, it will not grow again until the next rainfall and its place is often taken over by toxic and useless bushes — harmful for animals’ health. Overgrazing also accelerates desertification, according to Meghwar.
Man Singh Bheel, a well-experienced herder, is of the view that consecutive droughts, changing rainfall patterns, illegal farming on pasturelands and overgrazing are destroying Thar’s ecology and land fertility. He observed that the region’s natural beauty, wildlife and grass cover had declined to an alarming level. He called for sustainable land management to prevent desertification and mitigate the risks and effects of drought.
Mubeen Saand, another prominent herder, said that until a few years back, fodder was available near his
village, but now he and his family had to travel long distances to bring the same. 
In his view, mechanical farming was harming Thar’s ecology. “For instance, cultivator, a commonly used farm implement, harms soil because its use increases erosion and land degradation by uprooting bushes and plants that once helped prevent erosion.

“Delay in adjudication carries severe macroeconomic and societal consequences: it deters investment, renders contracts illusory, and weakens the institutional legitimacy of the judiciary,” observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah.
Justice Shah made the observation while heading a two-judge bench, also comprising Justice Ay­esha A. Malik, which was hearing an appeal filed by Abdul Salam Khan challenging the Peshawar High Court’s Nov 3, 2021 rejection of his plea.
The judge suggested introducing age-tracking protocols to automatically identify dormant cases, along with the judicious use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to assist in scheduling and triage, while preserving judicial discretion.

Justice Shah warns slow adjudication carries severe economic and societal consequences

“Such a system must, at a minimum, ensure: the early fixing of cases on a non-discriminatory basis; the elimination of “queue-jumping” and preferential scheduling; and the prioritisation of matters involving constitutional, economic, or national importance without compromising the timely resolution of individual claims,” Justice Shah emphasised.
The case arose from a challenge to the auction of an immovable property by a bank in execution of a money decree dated April 26, 2010. The auction was held in 2011. The petitioner filed objections the same year, which were dismissed. An appeal before the PHC remained pending for ten years, culminating in the 2021 decision. The matter reached the Supreme Court in 2022 and was taken up now, three years later, in 2025.
 
 

The court noted that the issue was not limited to the validity of the auction but extended to whether any meaningful relief could be granted after 14 years. Even if the petitioner’s claim had merit, the sands of time have all but eroded its potency, Justice Shah remarked.
Though the Supreme Court also rejected the appeal, it observed that a justice system’s credibility rests not only on the fairness of its decisions but also on the timeliness of those decisions. The matter, it noted, was not merely administrative but constitutional, with the right to access to justice guaranteed by articles 4, 9, and 10A of the Constitution.
This right, the court said, encompassed a fair and timely trial, and delays that render a remedy ineffective amount to a denial of due process.
“Justice, to be real, must be both just and timely,” Justice Shah stressed, adding that statistics speak for themselves.
Over 2.2 million cases are currently pending before courts across the country, including about 55,941 in the Supreme Court alone, despite the increase in the number of judges to 24.
These figures are not abstract; they represent disputes suspended in time. Delay in adjudication is not merely a by-product of docket congestion or lower-level inefficiencies but a deeper, structural challenge of judicial governance, Justice Shah said. The judiciary, as a matter of institutional policy and constitutional responsibility, must urgently move toward a modern, responsive, and intelligent case management framework.
The judgement noted that judicial systems worldwide have shown that delay is not an intractable inevitability but a solvable institutional challenge. Countries such as Singapore, the United Kingdom, Brazil, Estonia, Canada, China, Denmark, and Australia have implemented reforms combining technology, structural innovation, and procedural discipline to reduce backlog and improve efficiency.
Through tools such as e-filing, real-time dashboards, automated scheduling, and transparent digital oversight, these jurisdictions have evolved from passive custodians of dockets to active managers of justice delivery, the judgement said.
 
 

These international experiences underscore a basic truth: delays in justice are not inevitable; they are the product of institutional design and can be remedied with vision, planning, and resolve, it added.
Pakistan’s judiciary must draw upon these global lessons and commit to transformative reforms integrating technological innovation, administrative restructuring, and disciplined case management, so that courts become engines of timely, transparent, and citizen-focused justice, Justice Shah observed.

A two-judge bench of BHC, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Sardar Ahmad Halimi, issued the directives while hearing a petition challenging the government’s shutdown orders.
The petition was filed by Khair Muhammad Shaheen, chairman of the Balochistan Consumer Civil Society.
The Additional Chief Secretary for Home Muhammad Hamza Shafqat informed the court that public transport services were temporarily suspended.
The court found this justification for halting public transport services to be unreasonable and ordered the immediate withdrawal of the suspension order.
 
 

Regarding the mobile network shutdown, scheduled to last until Aug 31, the court instructed the government to reconsider its province-wide ban. The bench directed officials to restore services in all areas where specific security threats do not exist.
During the hearing, additional chief Secretary (home) and Advo­cate General (AG) Adnan Basharat acknowledged that security threats were concentrated in certain areas, not the entire province.
The hearing was adjourned until Aug 21.

LAHORE: Dijikot police have registered two cases against 300 people on terrorism charges for setting two worship places of the Ahmadi community on fire in Faisalabad, on the eve of Independence Day.
As many as 47 men were nominated, while 300 others remain unidentified in both cases. The cases were registered under Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, and sections 295, 425, 446, 380, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
According to the FIRs, Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) ticket-holder Hafiz Rafaqat led the mob, which was armed with rods and bricks. The attackers gathered outside one of the larger Ahmadi worship places and pelted it with bricks. Members of the community who tried to resist were severely beaten, leaving several injured.
The mob, under the cover of Independence Day processions, delivered hate speeches and incited violence against the Ahmadiyya community. At 275-Kartarpur, they targeted two Ahmadi worship places, tearing down the minarets and completely setting on them ablaze. These worship places had been built before 1984.
The attackers also targeted nearby Ahmadi homes, hurling stones that shattered windows and terrified families, injuring several residents.
Ahmadiyya community spokesperson Aamir Mahmood condemned the attacks, stating that community members had been celebrating Independence Day when the mob struck. “This is not the freedom Pakistan’s founders envisioned. Until those who commit such acts face justice, intolerance will grow. Authorities must act swiftly to protect all citizens,” he said.
He demanded strict action against the people involved in the attack and called for adequate protection for the Ahmadiyya community.
Faisalabad City Police Officer Sah­ibzada Bilal Omer was not available for comment.
 
 

However, another police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that 25 people had been arrested in the case and efforts were underway to arrest the rest.
The police official did not reveal the names of the arrested persons and confirm whether they were among the nominated suspects.
Just a day ago,  the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had deplored the recent derogatory remarks made by a cleric against places of worship belonging to non-Muslim communities, including Christians.
“We urge the state to ensure accountability for hate speech in all its forms by implementing the 2014 Supreme Court judgement and call on civil society to reject narratives that endanger peaceful coexistence and equal citizenship,” the statement concluded.

• Two excise officials targeted near Dera-Daraban bypass
PESHAWAR: Five people, including two personnel from the paramilitary Frontier Corps (FC) and two Excise Department officials, were martyred, while three militants were killed in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, official sources said.
Counter-Terrorism Department officials said their team ambushed a group of militants affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in an intelligence-based operation carried out in Regi Lalma, on the outskirts of the provincial capital, on Thursday night.
They said the CTD had been tracking the group, which was involved in 18 different attacks on police and citizens. These attacks took place along Peshawar’s northern border with Mohmand district, southern border with Kohat district, eastern border with Khyber district and western border with Nowshera district.
The ambush was based on technical surveillance, the officials said, adding that the militants’ identities were verified.
 
 

The officials said the group was planning an attack on the border between Peshawar and Khyber districts, adding that the militants opened indiscriminate fire when intercepted by a SWAT team. In the battle, CTD gunned down three militants while four others fled.
The officials said one of the killed militants was identified as Abdullah, alias Jawad, an Afghan national, confirmed through his Afghan citizenship card recovered from him. He was a wanted militant, while the identities of the other two are being determined.
The officials said technical investigations linked the group to at least 18 militant attacks in Peshawar. “Preliminary intelligence confirms the militants were part of a banned TTP-linked cell operating under foreign-based, foreign-funded handlers, with active plans to escalate attacks on security forces, public infrastructure, and pro-state individuals,” the officials said.
FC men martyred
In Lakki Marwat, two FC personnel and a civilian were martyred when three armed men targeted an FC official and his brother while they were returning home from a hotel on the Indus Highway in the Wanda Karim Khan area.
The FC official’s brother, Ihsanullah, initially survived but later succumbed to his injuries. He told police that his brother had returned to the village on leave a week ago and that they were walking home when armed men suddenly attacked them with assault rifles.
 
 

“We were injured and fell to the ground while the assailants fled,” he said, adding that his brother died upon reaching the hospital.
Police said another FC official also died in the attack, and his body was taken by relatives from the crime scene.
Police registered a case under relevant sections of law at Shaheed Haibat Ali Khan police station in Darra Pezu and launched an investigation.
Excise team targeted
In another militant attack in Dera Ismail Khan, two Excise Department officials were slain, and a hotel owner injured, when unidentified assailants opened fire near Hashim Hotel on the Dera-Daraban bypass on Friday.
According to police, excise and taxation officer Faridullah Khan reported that ASI Syed Ali Shah of the Excise Police Station South Region, along with volunteer Abideen, son of Amir Muhammad Banuchi from Bannu, had left for duty in an official vehicle.
While stopping at Hashim Hotel for breakfast and waiting for other staff, two unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire. The ASI and volunteer died on the spot. The hotel owner, Hashim, 47, of Bhakkar, sustained injuries.
Police termed the incident an act of terror and said it was part of a recent wave of targeted assaults on law enforcement personnel. The area was cordoned off, and a search operation was launched to trace the assailants.
