However, he was unaware that the wedding ceremony of his younger son would bring lifelong pain and grief, costing him almost all his close relatives.
An explosion reportedly caused by gas leakage killed at least eight people, including four of Mr Masih immediate family members, in Sector G-7 of the federal capital and left several others injured on Sunday morning.
Talking to media persons, Hanif said he was in a room constructed adjacent to the house, while all other family members were inside the main house.

What began as a wedding celebration for Hanif Masih ended in tragedy when a gas blast in G-7 sectordestroyed his family

“At around 7:15am, I heard a blast. I rushed towards the house and saw that everything had been destroyed. A large number of guests were already present because of my son’s marriage ceremony. Due to the blast, I have lost many relatives, including my newlywed son, his wife, my wife and my other daughter-in-law, while my daughter has been seriously injured,” he said.
Replying to a question, he said that since the guests had remained awake until around 3am, most of them were sleeping at the time of the incident.

Sohail Romi, who was present at the site of the incident, told Dawn that both the bride and groom were his relatives.
“The baraat had arrived from Gujrat on Saturday night at 66 Quarters in G-7/2, Islamabad, and the walima reception was scheduled for Sunday noon. To my knowledge, the gas remained open during the night, and in the morning someone lit a matchstick, which caused the gas to catch fire and led to the explosion,” he said.
Mr Romi, who is also the General Secretary of the PPP Minority Wing Rawalpindi, said the bride’s family had already booked a bus from Gujrat to attend the walima and had planned to take the bride with them for a few days.
“However, after receiving the tragic news, they delayed their departure from Gujrat and reached Islamabad by 3pm in the same bus. It was decided to bury six bodies on Sunday at the Christian graveyard in Sector H-8. The remaining two bodies were to be buried on Monday [today],” he said.
William Pervez, a resident of the area, told Dawn that the worst affected was Yaqoob Masih, a resident of a neighbouring house, who lost his two sons.
“Yaqoob was out of the city. His two sons were sleeping in their house when the roof suddenly collapsed due to the blast, killing both on the spot. It was decided that the burial of Yaqoob’s two sons would be held on Monday [today],” he said.

“The leaders of Iran called” yesterday, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that “a meeting is being set up… They want to negotiate.”
However, Trump added that “we may have to act before a meeting“.
With Iran’s government facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Trump has repeatedly threatened to get involved if force is used on protesters.

 

Iran has not given an official casualty toll for the protests, and Reuters was unable to independently verify tallies of rights groups.
The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices, before turning against the authorities in Iran, which has governed since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Near paralysis
In Tehran, an AFP journalist described a city in a state of near paralysis.
The price of meat has nearly doubled since the start of the protests, and many shops are closed. Those that do open must close at around 4:00 or 5:00pm, when security forces deploy en masse.
There were fewer videos showing protests on social media Sunday, but it was not clear to what extent that was due to the internet shutdown.
One widely shared video showed protesters again gathering in the Pounak district of Tehran shouting slogans in favour of the ousted monarchy.
The protests have become one of the biggest challenges to the rule of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, 86, coming in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic republic in June, which was backed by the United States.
State TV has aired images of burning buildings, including a mosque, as well as funeral processions for security personnel.
But after three days of mass actions, state outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic on Sunday.
Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”.
The Iranian government on Sunday declared three days of national mourning for “martyrs” including members of the security forces killed.
President Masoud Pezeshkian also urged Iranians to join a “national resistance march” Monday to denounce the violence.
In response to Trump’s repeated threats to intervene, Iran’s parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said Iran would hit back, calling US military and shipping “legitimate targets” in comments broadcast by state TV.
Trump says he will talk to Musk about restoring internet in Iran​
Trump also said that he plans to speak with billionaire Elon Musk about restoring internet in Iran, where authorities have blacked out services for four days.
“He’s very good at that kind of thing, he’s got a very good company,” Trump told reporters in response to a question about whether he would engage with Musk’s SpaceX company, which offers a satellite internet service called Starlink that has been used in Iran.







Musk and SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday.
Son of ousted Iran shah urges security forces to ‘stand with the people’
The US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah urged Iranian government workers and security forces to join the swelling protest movement in the Islamic Republic.
“Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, have a choice: stand with the people and become allies of the nation, or choose complicity with the murderers of the people,” Reza Pahlavi posted on social media.
Pahlavi, who has emerged as an opposition figurehead, also called for replacing the flags outside of Iranian embassies with the pre-Islamic revolution flag.
“The time has come for them to be adorned with Iran’s national flag, in place of the disgraceful banner of the Islamic Republic,” he said.
In London, protesters managed to swap out the Iranian embassy flag over the weekend, hoisting in its place the tri-coloured banner used under the last Shah.
The ceremonial, pre-revolution flag has become an emblem of the global rallies that have mushroomed in support of Iran’s demonstrations.
The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned the British ambassador in Tehran on Sunday over the flag swapping, according to the official IRNA outlet.</p><small>2026-01-12 04:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/12094434790bf94.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966544/bannu-ctd-kills-two-terrorists-in-ibo' target='_blank'><strong>Bannu CTD kills two terrorists in IBO</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: During ongoing operations against militants in Bannu, the Counter-Terrorism Department’s Bannu region, in coordination with local police, carried out a successful intelligence-based operation (IBO), killing two terrorists.
According to police, the operation was conducted within the jurisdiction of Mirakhel Police Station on Jhandokhel Road near Shagi Machankhel.
Acting on credible intelligence, CTD Bannu’s Special Weapons and Tactics teams, along with Bannu Police, cordoned off the area and launched the operation. During the action, the terrorists opened fire, prompting effective retaliatory fire by the police and CTD personnel.
Following an exchange of fire, two terrorists were found dead during a search operation. They were identified as Suhail Khan alias Sangri and Ismail alias Usman.
Police stated that both terrorists were involved in attacks on Sheikh Landik and Fateh Khel police check posts, in which eight police constables were injured. They were also involved in attacks on security forces’ convoys and an IED attack on the under-construction Rescue 1122 building.
Weapons and ammunition recovered from the slain terrorists included two Kalashnikov rifles, one pistol, multiple rounds of ammunition, a motorcycle, two mobile phones, two national identity cards, and a card belonging to the proscribed TTP.
Inspector General of Police Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Zulfiqar Hameed, along with the Additional IG CTD, commended the Bannu Police and CTD SWAT teams for the successful operation.
The IGP KP stated that intelligence-based targeted operations will continue uninterrupted across the province until terrorism is completely eliminated.
In a separate incident, militants launched an attack on the Nala Kasho police checkpost, using light and heavy weapons.
However, the attack was foiled after retaliatory action by police personnel.
As soon as information about the attack was received, police contingents from Domel and Town Police Station, along with other security forces, immediately reached the site of the incident.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during 2025, according to the “Pakistan Security Report 2025” report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS).
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-12 04:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/69646ddea5ced.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966531/macabre-concessions-at-sost-dry-port' target='_blank'><strong>Macabre concessions at Sost Dry Port</strong></a><br><p>Despite complaints by some disgruntled residents, the Pakistani government has always endeavored to take cognizance of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) issues and resolve them. Sost Dry Port in GB is a crucial trade hub, primarily facilitating trade between China and Pakistan.
Recently, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) issued statutory regulatory order (SRO) 2488 ostensibly to placate the protests of some residents of GB. The SRO states, “Sales tax, income tax, and federal excise duty payable on imports covered under this notification shall not be levied”.
The notified SRO — which could damage the textile sector — was issued on January 1, 2026. As per the SRO, “The benefit of non-levy of sales tax, income tax, and federal excise duty shall be extended by the Collector of Customs on a ‘first come, first serve’ basis within the approved quota limit for goods imported for consumption within the GB region”.
The icing on the cake is that “The GB government shall ensure that all goods imported under this notification are exclusively used within [its] territory”. How? Does GB administration have the critical mass to ‘ensure’ that the facility will not be abused? In addition, “Special procedures shall also be devised by the FBR to effectively identify, track, and clear goods which are imported via Sost for the rest of the country from the goods cleared under this notification.” But, how effective have policies like this been in the past?

‘Past experience clearly demonstrates that similar region-specific tax concession regimes have been repeatedly misused’

The SRO covers every item and gives carte blanche to GB traders to buy whatever they want from China and get it cleared at Sost Dry Port. Notwithstanding the fact that bilateral trade figures between Pakistan and China are heavily tilted in favour of China, this new open permission could further widen the trade gap.
The SRO specified, “The cumulative amounts of sales tax, income tax, and federal excise duty as chargeable under the Sales Tax, 1990 (VII of 1990), Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, and Federal Excise Act, 2005 shall not exceed the limit of Rs4 billion in a fiscal year, as calculated in the Customs Computerised Clearance System.” A generous and merciful assurance for the trade and industry of Pakistan.
Facilitating and encouraging residents are responsibilities of the state, but the modus operandi should always be that other provinces or areas should not be affected. The draft SRO was issued at the fag end of 2025 and, surprisingly, the FBR only allowed three days for objections or comments (25th was a national holiday, 26th was a Friday when establishments in many areas remained closed or worked half the day, and 27th was a Saturday).
Trade and Industry representatives are up in arms and term this SRO as sounding the death knell for Pakistani industries. Take textile, for example. There are 236 importable textile items. Anwer Aziz, Regional Chairman, All Pakistan Textile Processing Mills Association, took exception to allowing textile products, especially those manufactured domestically and sold to local and foreign customers. As an example, he remarked that unbleached and bleached fabrics will enjoy the benefits of the SRO.
Mr Aziz asked, “How many textile processing mills are based in GB?” He added that despite so-called firewalls to check the inflow of imports, there is no guarantee that these fabrics would not find a way to Faisalabad, Lahore, or Karachi, as is the norm under the Afghan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement.
Although facilitating GB traders is welcomed, the point is that this facility should also be provided for local manufacturers to sell to GB under exempted sales tax and other taxes. If the cap of Rs4bn is enforced, then local goods could be categorised as ‘exports’ to GB and enjoy the exemptions. There is always the apprehension that this cap could be enhanced in the future to mollify protestors. A senior industrialist noted that the Rs4bn exemptions translate into imports of Rs16–18bn, about $65m. Do GB denizens have the capacity to buy this imported quantity?
Anjum Nisar, former chairman of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry, said, “Past experience clearly demonstrates that similar region-specific tax concession regimes have been repeatedly misused. Earlier exemptions granted to erstwhile federally and provincially administered tribal regions were also subject to conditions and monitoring requirements, yet duty- and tax-free goods found their way across the country, damaging local industries, and causing significant revenue losses.”

Usually, temperatures drop to minus degree Celsius in the twin cities in December and January, but this year it remained between 1 and 2 degrees. However, Sunday was the coldest day recorded so far in the current season by Pakistan Meteorological Department.
The coldest ever day in Islamabad was recorded on December 15, 1984, when the temperature dropped to -4.3 degrees.
“It was the coldest day of this winter season as temperature dropped to zero degree Celsius on January 11,” said the forecasting officer at Met Office while talking to Dawn.
She said that the temperature was likely to rise in the next 24 hours due to clouds and fog. Frost and fog are likely to grip the twin cities in different patches.

Temperature drops to zero degree in twin cities

She said there were no chances of further cold wave from the north, adding the intensity of the cold would decrease in coming week.
“Continental air is prevailing over most parts of the country, whereas a shallow westerly wave is likely to prevail over western and upper parts of the country on Monday,” she said.

 

The official said mainly cold and dry weather was expected over most parts of the country, while very cold in hilly areas. However, she said partly cloudy weather was expected in upper parts with chances of light rain/light snow in Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir and adjoining areas.
“Moderate to dense fog is likely to persist over Punjab, upper Sindh and plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Frost may occur at isolated places in Potohar region and Kashmir during morning hours,” she said.
The Met Office recorded the lowest minimum temperature in Skardu -14 degrees - Leh -13, Astore -11, Gupis -09, Gilgit -08, Ziarat, Qalat -07, Kalam, Hunza -06, Dera, Rawalakot and Parachinar -04 degree Celsius.
Meanwhile, the residents faced problems due to low gas pressure in many parts of the garrison city. Many people were using gas compressors, adding to hardships of others.
Due to the biting cold, children and elderly people are getting fever and other cold ailments.
Meanwhile, the number of people complaining of cold-related ailments has also shot up in the last few days. Doctors say most of the patients were children and elderly persons.
According to doctors, people should increase intake of liquid, especially soup and cover their heads and ears to beat the cold. On the other hand, the cold wave has increased the sale of winter dishes and other edibles.
However, unlike the past years when stalls of traditional food items at Bhabara Bazaar, Saddar and Commercial Market pulled crowds, no such rush has been seen in these areas due to high prices.

The project titled “Punjab Affordable Housing Programme (PAHP)” — a World Bank-funded hybrid housing scheme worth US$250 million over five years, has been designed to strengthen housing institutions and significantly enhance the quantity and quality of affordable housing in Punjab.
“The PAHP targets delivery of 37,000 housing units, of which 20,000 units will be constructed on state land using World Bank financing, while the remaining units will be delivered through private sector engagement, ensuring a blended and sustainable delivery model,” says an internal report presented to the Punjab government.
The project implementation is being carried out through a structured institutional arrangement by Urban Unit and the Punjab Housing & Town Planning Agency (PH&TPA) via the Programme Management & Implementation Unit (PMIU). To ensure implementation readiness, 41 state-owned sites across Punjab have been identified with the help of land record and revenue authorities.
Comprehensive field verification has been completed whereas district administrations have also been taken on board as required under the World Bank protocols for establishing a strong foundation for phased execution.
The report further states that in a bid to raise the depleting water table, the government, in principle, has decided to construct as many as 1,000 groundwater recharge wells across the province this year.

41 govt-owned sites identified across province for the WB-funded hybrid project

The construction of wells will be initiated by the Water and Sanitation Agencies (Wasas) in all districts. The initiative introduces modern engineering solutions to address declining groundwater tables caused by urbanisation and excessive extraction.
The programme has already been initiated in Lahore as a pilot project and is planned for expansion across all districts under a phased manner, ensuring province-wide impact. In Lahore, three recharge wells have already been made functional and more than 15 locations would soon have more wells.
The report states that the Parks and Horticulture Authorities (PHAs) in several districts have been assigned the task to lower greenbelts — a smart engineering approach to address urban flooding challenges associated with conventional greenbelt designs. In Lahore, the work has been kicked off formally.
“Traditionally, the elevated greenbelts along roads and highways have unintentionally contributed to waterlogging during heavy rainfall, as excessive height restricts natural drainage and causes rainwater to accumulate on road surfaces. Recognising this challenge, the government has shifted towards scientifically designed greenbelts that support effective storm water management,” the report explains, adding that all new greenbelts developed across Punjab will be constructed at optimised, lower levels, in accordance with international best practices, to facilitate natural water flow and reduce urban flooding risks. “This approach ensures that environmental objectives are achieved without compromising existing infrastructure or causing avoidable disruption.”
It says that the work on Lungs of Lahore & Ring Road Forestation project —a pioneering, environment-friendly initiative aimed at combating smog, improving air quality, and promoting sustainable urban development has been accelerated, as it reflects a proactive and science-based response to Lahore’s long-standing environmental challenges.
The project envisages the creation of a forest-like green boundary around Lahore through large-scale ring forestation, establishing a natural environmental buffer against air pollution and unchecked urban sprawl.
“This project is designed to serve as a permanent ecological asset for the city, positioning Lahore among global cities adopting nature-based solutions for environmental resilience,” the report reads. The project is also planned to be replicated by the PHAs in other districts.
It further states that Punjab’s flagship housing initiative, Apni Chhat Apna Ghar (ACAG), has achieved a major milestone with the completion of over 50,000 homes in 2025, marking a significant step toward addressing Punjab’s long-standing housing deficit for low-income families. The programme provides zero-interest, zero-fee housing loans, reflecting a strong commitment to affordability and financial inclusion. It has demonstrated social outreach, with widows, persons with disabilities, and minority community families among direct beneficiaries.
It mentioned that the Apni Zameen Apna Ghar (AZAG) programme has also been launched to secure land ownership for landless families. The digital-first approach enabled as many as 367,000 people to apply online across Punjab. The programme entered its implementation phase with first-digital balloting of 2,000 free residential plots across 19 districts including Kasur, Faisalabad, Attock, Sargodha, Jhelum, Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin Chiniot, Jhang, Okara, Bhakkar, Khushab, Layyah, Vehari, Lodhran, Sahiwal, Rajanpur, Bahawalpur and Bahawalnagar.

Over the same period, Bangladesh has crossed $50bn, while Vietnam now exceeds $350bn. This widening gap is not the result of global shocks or bad luck. It reflects domestic policy choices that have made exporting costly, uncertain, and unrewarding — while protecting inefficiency at home.
Macroeconomic instability as a built-in disadvantage
Successful exporters require stable costs and predictable policy. Pakistan offers neither. Recurrent balance-of-payments crises trigger abrupt stabilisation programmes, policy reversals, and stop-start incentives.
Exchange-rate management has been particularly damaging. Periodic overvaluation to contain inflation acts as a hidden tax on exports, eroding competitiveness. When corrections eventually occur, they are sharp and disruptive, driving up input costs and debt servicing. Exporters are forced to operate in an environment where profitability can disappear overnight.
Exporters taxed as revenue sources
Pakistan’s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed. This effectively turns exporters into involuntary lenders to the state, tying up working capital and raising borrowing costs. Smaller and mid-sized exporters — essential for diversification — are hit hardest.
In competing economies, exports are genuinely zero-rated, with automated refunds and minimal compliance burdens. In Pakistan, exporters are taxed first and refunded later — if at all — despite already having to self-provide basic infrastructure, security, and logistics. This fiscal approach treats exports as a short-term revenue stream rather than a long-term growth strategy.
Energy costs that destroy competitiveness
High and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation. Penalising captive power to force grid usage has reduced industrial flexibility while merely shifting circular debt from electricity to gas. Given Pakistan’s concentration in low value-added exports, where energy is a large cost component, this disadvantage is decisive.
Low value-added exports
Pakistan’s export base remains narrow and low value. Textiles dominate, but largely at the yarn, fabric, and basic garment level — segments with thin margins and intense competition. Some firms have exited higher value-added apparel altogether, whilst others are contemplating relocating production abroad. By contrast, Bangladesh invested in scale, compliance, and female labour participation to move up the garment value chain, while Vietnam diversified into electronics, engineering, and services.

 

Global demand is also shifting away from cotton toward man-made fibres, weakening Pakistan’s traditional advantage. Without deliberate upgrading, innovation, and branding, export diversification will remain elusive — even as Pakistan’s land, water, and human capital offer opportunities in horticulture, livestock, dairy, seafood, minerals, information technology, and professional services.
Weak standards
Food and agricultural exports face persistent quality and hygiene challenges. Inadequate domestic testing facilities force exporters to rely on foreign laboratories, raising costs and delays. Training and certification infrastructure remain underdeveloped. While exporters are allowed to open overseas marketing offices, funding limits are too low to support brand development or to secure shelf space. As a result, Pakistani brands have minimal global presence outside diaspora markets.
Protectionism that rewards inefficiency
High tariffs and ad-hoc import restrictions raise input costs and disrupt supply chains. Recent changes under the Export Facilitation Scheme — denying refunds on certain imported inputs — further penalise exporters.
Protection has encouraged firms to prioritise secure domestic margins over global competitiveness. Medium-sized exporters, lacking inventory buffers, suffer most. Domestic consumers pay higher prices for lower-quality goods, while protected firms rarely evolve into serious exporters.
Productivity and skills gaps
No incentive can compensate for low productivity. Pakistani firms face unreliable energy, inefficient logistics, and shortages of technical, managerial, and digital skills. While Vietnam benefits from a disciplined workforce and Bangladesh from broad labour participation, Pakistan continues to underinvest in human capital limiting its ability to upgrade exports.
Policy inconsistency and weak credibility
Perhaps the most damaging constraint is policy credibility. Export policies are announced without consultation, applied unevenly, and reversed under fiscal pressure. Temporary incentives and shifting rules discourage long-term investment. Export growth requires confidence that policies will endure beyond the next crisis.
Both the government and businesses must change
While policy failures dominate, the private sector also bears responsibility. Too many firms focus on lobbying for protection rather than investing in competitiveness, innovation, and new markets. Despite duty-free access to the European Union and UK, Pakistan’s textile market share has stagnated, while China and Vietnam, despite tariffs, have expanded through superior cost, quality, and reliability.
Pakistan will not scale exports through episodic devaluations, temporary incentives, or punitive taxation disguised as reform. What is needed is macroeconomic stability, a predictable and competitive exchange rate, affordable energy, rationalised tariffs, a truly zero-rated export regime with automatic refunds, and sustained investment in skills. Until exports are treated as central to economic survival rather than a revenue afterthought, ambitious targets — such as $63bn — will remain out of reach.

Pakistan’s agriculture sector is undergoing a structural change: farm sizes are shrinking at an alarming rate. This is thanks to intergenerational land division driven by high population growth and the encroachment of rapidly expanding — predominantly horizontal — housing colonies onto agricultural land, in almost every city and town.
The 7th Agricultural Census of Pakistan 2024 reveals that the number of farms has increased from 8.26 million (2010) to 11.7m (2024), while the average farm size has shrunk to just 5.1 acres. Currently, 97 per cent of farmers own less than 12.5 acres, and around 61pc cultivate even less than 2.5 acres. In other words, with the exception of roughly 3pc, Pakistan’s agriculture sector is now entirely comprised of small farms.
This reality has important implications for Pakistan’s agricultural policymaking. The challenges faced by smallholders are fundamentally different from those faced by medium and large farmers. Moreover, their challenges are intensifying day by day due to technological changes, climate change, rising production costs, and shifting market dynamics. Therefore, the business-as-usual approach will not work, and the time has come for a paradigm shift away from the decades-old approach that has traditionally served medium and large farmers.
The need for such a policy shift becomes clearer through two examples. After discontinuing the wheat support price and withdrawing from direct procurement from farmers, Punjab — which produces about 76pc of the country’s wheat — is now relying on the electronic warehouse receipt system (EWR) to fill the policy vacuum left by the government’s exit.

Tractor distributions are not enough, especially for the often overlooked millions of farmers with land under 2.5 acres

However, by its very design — including warehouse locations and procedural requirements — the EWR is better suited to large farmers and stockists. Smallholders, who often have less than a truckload of saleable quantities, find it difficult to participate. As a result, the EWR fails to serve smallholders, who continue to look to the government for marketing support that can protect them from exploitative middlemen and arthees, as well as from market risks, particularly since they lack both financial resources and storage facilities to hold their crops.
Another major challenge for most small farmers is the lack of two basic necessities: a tubewell for irrigation and a tractor for land preparation. Due to limited financial capacity and low utilisation factor, most smallholders cannot justify such investments. Consequently, they rely on costly rental services, which significantly increase their production costs. Moreover, service providers of combine harvesters, rice harvesters, and other expensive machinery often give low priority to smallholders, provide services late, charge higher rates, or supply poorly maintained old machines, resulting in high harvest losses.
The government’s ballot-based distribution of a few thousand tractors — available to farmers owning five-plus acres — does not solve the smallholders’ problems. A tractor alone is not sufficient; farmers also need expensive implements costing millions, like cultivators, disc harrows, and rotavators. High maintenance costs further make tractor ownership a major challenge for smallholders.
The challenges faced by smallholders do not end here. They have limited access to finance and extension services, and often receive poor-quality seeds and spurious agricultural inputs that adversely affect crop yields and, consequently, their profitability.
Therefore, in this evolving agricultural landscape, where farm sizes are steadily shrinking, Pakistan needs smallholder-centric policies that address their specific challenges, safeguard their interests, and promote their well-being.

 

Given the millions of farms, the government is increasingly constrained in service delivery. Smallholders, therefore, need to be connected through an organisational framework that enhances their market access, enables shared resources, and strengthens collective bargaining.
To that end, in Pakistan’s context, the government should promote at least the following two:
First, contract farming is a private sector led business model. The model has already been successfully adopted in Pakistan by several national and multinational companies, including Rafhan Maize, sugar mills, PepsiCo, seed companies, and others, proving that it has the potential to address many smallholder challenges.
Under contract farming, companies typically provide farmers with quality seeds, inputs, and advisory services, while procuring produce at pre-determined rates. It is now imperative for the government to formulate policies that create an enabling environment for contract farming in the country; in particular, a speedy, out-of-court conflict resolution mechanism.
Second, the decades-old cooperative system. This is a time-tested concept successfully practised in several countries, including India. In Pakistan, while the concept is not new, there is a need to introduce new customised variants for the country’s evolving agricultural landscape.
Cooperatives enable joint ownership of machinery and equipment, as well as collective purchasing of inputs and marketing of produce, which enhances farmers’ bargaining power and helps secure better prices. In Pakistan, social divisions such as ethnicity, language, caste, or political differences may sometimes hinder farmers from collaborating. However, in several countries, the day-to-day management of sizeable cooperatives is handled by professional managers rather than by the farmers themselves.
In Pakistan, alongside the already cultivated areas, millions of acres remain barren and underdeveloped in regions such as Cholistan, Thal, Tharparkar, Balochistan, etc. Developing these lands is beyond the capacity of smallholders and is feasible only through corporate farming, as companies possess both the technical expertise and financial resources to do so on a large scale.

“Once normal supply levels resume, pressure tightness is anticipated to ease, restoring full service to households across Sindh and Balochistan,” it said.
A gas utility spokesperson said that as an unexpected cold snap swept across Pakistan, households in Sindh and Balochistan faced a sudden surge in natural gas demand, pushing the SSGC into emergency measures to protect the domestic supply.
She said that the winter spike, driven largely by increased use of geysers and space heaters, raised overall consumption by roughly 10per cent. “To bridge the gap, SSGC diverted about 90MMCFD of reliquefied natural gas into the network,” she said.
However, the spokesperson said a rapid temperature drop in recent days caused a further, unanticipated rise in household demand, extending cooking hours and intensifying morning and evening peaks.
She said that an upstream technical issue cut supply by an estimated 30MMCFD, compounding the situation and creating a shortfall that lowered distribution pressures in several tail-end localities.
“In response, SSGC activated its government-approved load management plan, which includes curtailing gas to fertiliser plants and enforcing weekly industrial closures to prioritise residential consumers,” she added.
The spokesperson said that domestic supply remained the gas utility’s first priority, in line with the prime minister’s directives and the approved load management framework. “The company pledges to maintain uninterrupted service from 5 am to 10pm daily, while deploying special 24-hour teams to address low-pressure complaints across the franchise areas,” she added.

During periods of balance-of-payment stresses, declining exports, and constrained external financing, inflows from overseas Pakistanis have repeatedly provided critical breathing space.
According to State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) data, remittances reached an unprecedented $38.3 billion in FY25, surging over 26 per cent from the previous year. While this influx has bolstered foreign exchange reserves and sustained household consumption, it simultaneously revi­ves a pressing and uncomfortable inquiry: what are the long-term consequences of excessive dependence on such transfers?
A comparison with merchandise exports starkly illustrates the scale of this reliance. SBP balance-of-payments data reveals a persistent pattern where remittances consistently rival or surpass export earnings — an unusual structural imbalance for a large developing economy.
In FY25, remittances at $38.3bn decisively outstripped exports, which grew modestly to approximately $32.3bn. This trend, evident over several years, signals a growth model where foreign exchange earned abroad by individuals is supplanting income generated through productive, export-oriented activity.

Remittances effectively create a parallel welfare system that mitigates immediate hardship but also allows systemic governance failures to persist unchallenged

Remittances, while offering short-term stability, are no substitute for genuine economic productivity in the home country of a nation’s diaspora. Such inflows predominantly fuel consumption rather than long-term investment, unless channelled by robust domestic institutions. In Pakistan’s context, abundant remittances have frequently coincided with anaemic industrial growth and stagnant export diversification.
Steady inflows of remittances can inadvertently reduce the urgency for policymakers to enact politically challenging reforms in taxation, energy, industrial policy, and export competitiveness, thereby perpetuating underlying weaknesses.
Further economic costs reside in the allocation of remittance income itself. Household-level research, including studies in the Pakistan Social Sciences Review, indicates that most funds are directed towards daily consumption, housing, healthcare, and education.
While these expenditures undeniably improve welfare, relatively little is invested in entrepreneurship, productivity-enhancing assets, or technological upgrading. This consumption-heavy allocation gradually erodes the economy’s capacity to gen­­e­rate broad-based employment and expo­rtable surpluses, perpetuating dependency.
Moreover, remittance dependence distorts exchange-rate dynamics. Persistent dollar inflows, unaccompanied by commensurate export growth, can sustain an overvalued real exchange rate. This undermines the international competitiveness of domestic producers. The economy thus risks a vicious cycle: weakened exports lead to a wider trade gap, which in turn necessitates ever-greater remittance inflows to finance the gap, further entrenching the structural imbalance.
Beyond economics, the social costs of migration-driven remittances are profound yet frequently overlooked. Prolonged overseas employment fractures family structures, inducing emotional stress and altering household dynamics. Increased psychological pressures on left-behind spouses and children, alongside shifting gender roles for which some communities are often unprepared, create multiple social issues.
These gradual social adjustments in the era of constantly growing remittances carry significant long-term implications for societal cohesion and collective well-being. In Pakistan’s case, this poses greater risks because remittances’ growth is more due to the departure of a higher number of Pakistanis abroad and not due to an increase in per-capita remittances.

 

Sustained remittance flows also risk fostering a culture of dependency. In communities where migration becomes the paramount aspiration, youth may prioritise emigration over local skills development, entrepreneurship, or participation in the domestic labour market. This gradually weakens local economic ecosystems and reinforces the very conditions that drive outward migration.
Furthermore, remittances tend to be geographically and socially concentrated, exacerbating inequalities between recipient and non-recipient communities, thereby creating new socio-economic fissures.
The political implications, though subtler, are equally significant. When private remittances enable households to access essential services like health and education, public pressure on the state to deliver these services diminishes. This erosion of the social contract weakens demands for governmental accountability, institutional reform, and performance. Remittances effectively create a parallel welfare system that mitigates immediate hardship but also allows systemic governance failures to persist unchallenged.
At a macro-political level, the stabilising function of remittances can cultivate policy complacency. Since inflows steady forex reserves and finance imports, successive governments postpone arduous reforms essential for boosting export competitiveness, industrial upgrading, and job creation. This trade-off — prioritising short-term stability over long-term restructuring — has fundamentally constrained Pakistan’s development trajectory.
None of this negates the immense value of remittances. They embody the sacrifices of millions of overseas Pakistanis and remain a crucial buffer for both the national treasury and household resilience. In FY25, record inflows were instrumental in alleviating external pressures at a critical juncture.
Nevertheless, an economy that leans more on its diaspora than on its domestic productive capacity faces severe long-term vulnerabilities. Remittances must function as a bridge toward a productivity-driven economy — not as a crutch.
Without deliberate policies to channel these flows into productive investment, revive exports, and rebuild the state-citizen compact, Pakistan risks exchanging temporary relief for permanent structural fragility.

The officials said the deceased also included the bride and the groom.
According to Pak­is­tan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) spokesperson Dr Aneeza Jalil, six bodies and 11 injured people were brought to the hospital, where the injured were being provided medical treatment.
She told Dawn that an emergency was imposed in Pims after the incident on the directives of Executive Director (ED) Dr Rana Imran Sikander.
One of the injured was being treated at the hospital’s burns centre as he had sustained 20 per cent burn injuries, she said.
Dr Aneeza later told Dawn that nine of the 11 injured had been discharged, and among the two at the hospital, the condition of one was “unstable”.
The victim would have to undergo surgery, she added.
Meanwhile, Islamabad Additional Deputy Commissioner (General) Sahibzada Yusuf reached the site of the incident after the explosion on the directives of Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon.
He said while speaking to the media that at least four houses had been damaged by the explosion and confirmed that the deceased included the bride and the groom.
Moreover, he told media persons that apart from the bodies and injured taken to Pims, two other bodies and an injured person were taken to the Capital Hospital.
The explosion occurred at a wedding venue, where guests were also present, he said, adding that all those trapped had been rescued from the rubble by means of “advanced technology”.
The rescue team was conducting further checks using specialised equipment, ADC Yusuf said, further stating that an inquiry had been ordered to determine the exact cause of the explosion. However, he added, the incident seemed to be that of a gas cylinder explosion.
Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa also spoke to the media and said the explosion appeared to be a result of a gas leak.
“So far, we have concluded that this explosion occurred due to a gas leakage,” he said. “Nonetheless, we will carry out an independent probe into it. We‘ve received instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office to launch a proper inquiry and find out the reasons as to why this incident happened.”
When asked about compensating the victims’ families, Randhawa said, “It’s not possible that there would be any delay in compensating them. However, the verification process may take four to five days.”
He added that one of the houses had been completely destroyed in the explosion, and arrangements had been made for the dead bodies to be brought to a ground near the site of the incident. They would then be taken to a graveyard, he said.
Hanif Masih, the father of the deceased groom, said while speaking to the media that his son’s wedding was held on Saturday, and they had reached home the night before.
“At the time of the incident (explosion), I was present at home but sleeping in a separate room adjacent to the house. I woke up after hearing a loud explosion and rushed to the place of the incident, but by that time everything had already been destroyed,” he said.
He said apart from his son and daughter-in-law, his sister-in-law was also among the deceased, and his daughter and other family members were admitted to the hospital.
Masih excused himself from speaking any further, saying that he was overcome with grief.
A statement issued by the Senate Secretariat said that Senate Chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani had expressed grief over the incident that took place “during a wedding”.
He expressed sorrow over the loss of lives and extended condolences to the families of the deceased.
“This is a heart-wrenching incident that turned celebrations into mourning for a family,” the statement quoted him as saying, adding that he expressed concern over gas cylinder explosions.
“Such incidents demand that relevant departments fulfil their responsibilities seriously and ensure safety measures,” he said, stressing the need for an effective strategy to curb the “unsafe use of gas cylinders”. In this connection, he called for ensuring compliance with laws and educating the public about safety measures.
PM Shehbaz expresses grief, orders probe
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief over the loss of precious lives, prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and expressed condolences to the bereaved families.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), PM Shehbaz directed the federal minister for Health, the secretary of health, and the administration of Pims to remain on high alert and ensure that quality medical facilities were provided to the injured until their recovery.
He also directed the secretary Interior to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter and submit a detailed report to determine the causes of the incident and assign responsibility.</p><small>2026-01-12 03:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/69643520ad510.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966452/mental-health-in-a-broken-world' target='_blank'><strong>Mental health in a broken world</strong></a><br><p>“The stark reality for the vast majority of people in the non-Western world, transcending everything, is poverty. Currently one quarter of the global population lives in near destitution and 3.5 million children die of starvation annually. What is ‘mental health’ in this broken social world?” (Summerfield, 2012)
IN recent years, mental health has been attracting a lot of attention — globally as well as in Pakis­tan. Terms like ‘anxiety’, ‘depression’, ‘trauma’, ‘neurodivergence’ and ‘well-being’ frequently come up for discussion on public forums and social me­­dia.
In Pakistan “increasing awareness and decr­e­­asing stigma” about mental health has become quite fashionable. Telepsychiatry, helplines, on­­line platforms for connecting with psychologists and counsellors are making mental healthcare much more accessible to people.
On the surface, all this seems promising, but it begs a deeper que­stion: are we medicalising human suffering and distress in ways that obscure its social origins? A new book, provocatively titled Searching for Normal by Dr Sami Timimi, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and psychotherapist in UK’s National Health Service invites us to consider precisely this: how we understand and conceptualise distress, what are its root causes and how we respond to it.
Timimi describes a global mental health system in which distress and behavioural differences are increasingly framed as medical disorders requiring diagnosis and treatment.
Rather than viewing emotional suffering as a natural response to adverse social and economic conditions, we are encouraged to see it as a pathology — something inside the individual that needs fixing. Timimi calls this a “mental health industrial complex” (much like the military-industrial complex) and highlights how diagnoses, therapies, medications and self-help markets form a complex network of interests that benefit from ever-expanding definitions of illness.
Over the last few decades, the number of psychiatric diagnostic labels has multiplied exponentially — from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) to autism spectrum disorders to new stress and trauma classifications. While some help guide support for genuinely disabling experiences, they are also cultural constructions rather than discrete biological entities with clear tests, like diabetes or tuberculosis. Timimi points out that psychiatric diagnoses are not grounded in objective biomarkers but in symptom clusters that vary across cultures. What counts as a ‘disorder’ is shaped by cultural and economic forces, not just science.
The dramatic rise in the diagnosis of ADHD and autism in recent years, Timimi observes, is linked to incentives and structures of profit-making, wherein market forces, pharmaceutical interests, and diagnostic expansion intersect. We are already seeing a similar trend in Pakistan as people are increasingly self-diagnosing based on checklists freely available on the internet and asking to be put on medication. This is not only pathologising, but is reducing complex social realities into ‘conditions’ to be treated.

The medical model of mental health thrives on individualisation of systemic problems.

This is not to deny the reality of suffering or a criticism of therapy or to be psychiatric care per se. Distress is real and suicide, self-harm, anxiety and depression affect individuals and families deeply; some individuals benefit from clinical support, and severe psychiatric conditions exist and deserve compassionate, evidence-based care. But when ordinary distress — sadness after loss, anxiety during economic struggle, restlessness in adolescence — begins to be treated as a diagnosable disorder, we must ask how we understand and respond to that suffering. Should mental healthcare be primarily about diagnosing and treating individuals or also about reshaping the social world in which they live?
A mental health strategy that focuses on treating symptoms with medication and therapy, that ignores the conditions that produce those symptoms, also ignores prevention. It forces mental health professionals to treat symptoms without improving the lives of people in meaningful ways. Societies facing economic hardship do not need more medicalisation; they need jobs, food, housing, safety and security.
The medical model of mental health thrives on individualisation of systemic problems. Focusing on individual self-management, self-care, or ‘fixing the chemical imbalance’ in the brain deflects attention from collective and structural solutions, including human rights, economic reforms, and social and economic justice.
Timimi’s book urges us to view people not through the lens of pathology with the goal of returning them to a vague ‘normal’, but to ask what is “normal in a broken social world?” It means taking an approach that goes beyond “raising awareness, decreasing stigma or including mental health in primary care” and to also focus on social welfare, education and economic opportunity. It suggests that schools, workplaces, mosques and neighbourhoods should be part of a collective mental well-being ecosystem, not just referral points to clinicians.
For Pakistan, this has important implications, as social determinants — poverty, unemployment, violence, widespread disparity, social and economic injustice, institutional corruption and lack of social protections — are powerful drivers of distress. Research shows that inequality and insecurity are strongly linked to poor mental health outcomes. In communities affected by conflict, natural disasters or chronic poverty, emotional suffering is often a response to external conditions, not an internal defect. Framing this distress as a mental abnormality diverts attention from policies that should address their root social causes.
Importantly, it forces us to question how we conceptualise distress in countries like Pakistan and whether we are conflating distress with clinical states of depression and anxiety. If distress is framed primarily in clinical terms, then we seek a medical solution — medications or counselling/ therapy (or both) — while people continue to battle the same social conditions that caused their distress in the first place.
A humane, contextual approach to mental health acknowledges that suffering is often a response to lived conditions — poverty, violence, marginalisation — much more than some chemical imbalance in the brain. It calls for policies that address these conditions upstream, while also providing care that is compassionate, culturally grounded, and socially informed.
There is need for broadening our vision — thinking of mental well-being not as a product of individual pathology, but a reflection of societal conditions. Only then can we move towards creating a society where healing is shaped by justice, solidarity and care.

Rival merchant groups were bidding up the cost of spices in Asia, squeezing profits at home, while the war for independence from Spain made overseas trade inseparable from nat­i­onal security.
The answer was the Vereenigde Oostindische Comp­agnie, or VOC: a single chartered company with a monopoly on Dutch trade east of the Cape, and a mandate to defend it. Over the next two centuries, the VOC built a network of forts, factories and settlements from southern Africa across the Indian Ocean to Japan. It also created something that looks uncannily familiar: permanent share capital, tradable stock, a central board, reg­ional chambers, layers of overseas management, and a culture that treated distance as a problem to be solved by paperwork. This is why the VOC is often described as the world’s first multinational corporation, even if its rise came with an older, darker inh­eritance of coercion and conquest.
Dutch vs English
The VOC has rivals for the title of “first”. The English East India Company was founded earlier, in 1600. But historians often point to the Dutch firm as the first multinational in a distinctly modern sense: it moved from temporary, single-voyage ventures to a permanent, centralised corporation designed to operate across borders for decades, funded by a broad shareholder base.
Dutch merchants had been pushing into Asian trade since the late 16th century through voyage-specific partnerships. By 1602, a flurry of expeditions had proved the profits were real, but also that competition among Dutch syndicates was self-defeating. The States General backed a merger that brought the pre-companies into one united enterprise, and granted it a renewable 21-year monopoly over Dutch trade in a vast maritime zone. The purpose was commercial and political at once: protect trade routes, squeeze out rivals, and help fund a young republic at war.

Investors received shares that could be transferred, which helped turn Amsterdam into an early centre of securities trading

The structure mattered as much as the monopoly. The VOC raised capital from the public and locked it into the company rather than tying it to individual voyages. Investors received shares that could be transferred, which helped turn Amsterdam into an early centre of securities trading. The crucial shift was continuity: the company could keep operating even as ownership changed hands.
Limited liability
Early modern trade was hazardous, and investors had good reason to fear that one shipwreck could ruin them. One of the VOC’s foundational contributions to corporate practice was to normalise a principle that now underpins modern company law: shareholders’ risk was limited to what they had invested. The company, meanwhile, could survive the failure of individual voyages, borrow money, hold assets, and keep trading.
This legal and financial design accelerated a second shift that defines corporate culture today: the separation of ownership from control. Shareholders did not sail the ships or negotiate in Asian ports. They delegated authority to directors and managers, who delegated further to factors, clerks, captains, and soldiers spread across continents. That chain of delegation created scale, but it also created the perennial corporate problem: how to supervise managers who operate far from scrutiny, and how to reassure investors who can see little of what they own. At home, the VOC was organised into six chambers in Dutch port cities. Their delegates formed the Heeren XVII, the central board that set strategy and tried to supervise a far-flung organisation of warehouses, ships and personnel. This arrangement resembles a modern multinational’s mix of powerful regional offices and a central board that controls capital allocation, priorities and policy.
Overseas, the company’s answer to distance was bureaucracy. Letters, reports, account books and rules were the tools that turned scattered outposts into something that behaved like a single entity. It was corporate governance by paperwork, and it worked well enough to sustain an empire of trade for generations.
Issuance of first IPO
The VOC is widely recognised as the first company to issue publicly tradable shares at scale, a step that helped create the architecture of the modern stock market. It did not merely ask a handful of merchants to underwrite one expedition. It gathered funds from a broad investor base and made ownership liquid.
That liquidity changed the relationship between the company and the shareholders. Shares could be bought and sold, and price movements became a running verdict on confidence, rumour and expectation. Early Amsterdam trading produced practices that feel familiar: speculation, sophisticated contracts, and disputes about whether market activity helped discipline management or destabilised it. Just as today, the existence of shareholders did not guarantee control, only pressure.
Forgotten footprint
One of the most striking reminders of the VOC’s global network sits not in the Netherlands, but in Bengal.
A seventeenth-century Dutch trading post at Hooghly Chinsurah became the base of the VOC in Bengal, staffed by dozens of Dutch employees and more than a hundred local workers, and focused on commodities that modern multinationals would recognise as supply chain essentials: silk, textiles, opium and saltpetre. This matters for two reasons. First, it underlines the company’s multinational character. Bengal was not a marginal stop. It was a managed node in a corporate system that linked European capital to Asian production and global distribution. The VOC did not simply “trade with Asia” as a single market. It operated a network of regional hubs, each with its own specialised procurement role, feeding into wider corporate objectives.
Second, it ties the world’s first multinational corporation to Bengal’s economic history. The Hooghly lodge, depicted in a well-known painting now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, shows the VOC not just as a maritime trader but as an employer, administrator and armed presence in the region. It also points to the human cost: the museum notes that in the seventeenth century, Bengal was among the places where the VOC and its employees bought large numbers of enslaved people, who were transported to other company outposts around the Indian Ocean.
Legacy in today’s corporate culture
The VOC’s early success did not make it immortal. Over time, it became more deeply entangled in the politics and landholding of its Asian possessions. Costs rose, competition intensified, corruption spread, and the burden of defence and administration grew heavier. By the end of the 18th century, the company was heavily indebted, and in 1799 its charter ended, with its assets and liabilities absorbed by the Dutch state.
Yet the VOC’s legacy remains visible in the architecture of modern corporate life. It normalised the idea that a company could be bigger than its founders, with ownership dispersed among large numbers of investors and management delegated to professionals. It embedded the boardroom as a centre of power, balancing regional interests, political pressure and shareholder expectations. It showed how standardised branding and documentation could turn a far-flung trading network into a single corporate identity. It also revealed how monopoly privilege and state support can accelerate corporate growth, and how weak oversight can invite abuses.
Most importantly, the VOC demonstrated that a company could operate as a global system: capital raised in one country, decisions made by a central board, procurement organised through regional directorates, and risk pushed down supply chains spanning continents. That is the multinational corporation as we still recognise it.

 

The VOC’s legacy, in the end, cannot be separated from the methods used to sustain its profits. Monopoly in a world of competing powers often meant coercion. In the Banda Islands, the nutmeg-rich archipelago the company was determined to control, the campaign culminated in 1621 when Jan Pieterszoon Coen ordered the capture of the Banda Archipelago, an episode Cambridge University Press describes as genocide that destroyed Bandanese civilisation and secured a VOC monopoly over nutmeg and mace production.
The costs were profound and not incidental. The same tools that enabled scale, limited liability, delegated authority and monopoly power also enabled exploitation, opacity and violence. The modern corporate world inherited the structures the VOC helped pioneer, and it inherited the moral arguments that follow them.

In a recent interview with The New York Times, the US president argued that international law, treaties and institutions apply only when he decides they do. The argument has surface appeal. Rules are slow, alliances awkward and multilateral bodies frustrating. Why should a superpower bind itself when it can act?
Yet this view misunderstands the purpose of law. Rules between states were not created because leaders are naturally wise or restrained. They were created because history shows us what happens when power goes unchecked. Mr Trump’s remarks suggest that these limits are optional. If international law aligns with US interests, it applies. If it does not, it can be ignored, redefined or brushed aside.
Mr Trump’s worldview is straightforward. Strength decides outcomes; law follows later, if at all. This thinking was visible across the interview. Greenland was discussed as something to be owned rather than respected as an ally’s territory. Venezuela was treated as a problem to be solved by military action. Throughout the discussion, the underlying view appeared to be that strength gives permission. Except, there exists this contradiction: rivals, he insists, must not use the same logic. China should not act on Taiwan; Russia should not redraw borders. The objections lack principle. Whereas American power is exceptional, making the country’s actions acceptable, others’ is destabilising. Such logic cannot hold. Rules applying only to the weak vanish. Other states will take notes and copy the example. Treaties become temporary and morality becomes whatever the powerful declare it to be.

 

The same pattern appears within the US. Congress is respected until it resists. Courts matter “under certain circumstances”. Emergency powers stretch when challenged. A parallel can be seen closer to home.
Pakistan’s own history shows what happens when power claims to stand above law. Whether under military rulers or hybrid arrangements, decisions have often been justified in the name of stability, security or higher national interest.
Yet this reliance on personal discretion has weakened institutions, blurred accountability and left citizens unsure where authority truly lies. When leaders decide that their judgement is a better safeguard than rules, uncertainty, not order, follows. A system that rests on personal morality is a fragile one. Leaders change. Tempers flare. Incentives shift. What remains is the example set.
If law is treated as optional by those who wrote it, it will soon be ignored by those who did not. The danger is not that America will act forcefully. It always has. The danger is that it will stop explaining why force should be limited at all.

The US has for decades intervened by military force to oust governments and assassinate leaders in the Western Hemisphere. More often than not, it has succeeded. Sometimes it has failed, as in trying to kill and remove Fidel Castro in Cuba epitomised by the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961. This triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis that drove the US and the Soviet Union to the brink of nuclear war.
The US-backed coup in Chile in 1973 involved the assassination of its elected Marxist president Salvador Allende and installation of a brutal regime under Gen Augusto Pinochet. Another CIA-sponsored coup deposed Guatemala’s elected government in 1954. In 1989, the US invaded Panama to oust Manuel Noriega, capture and extradite him to stand trial in America. The US-led invasion of Grenada overthrew its government in 1983. Over 40 US interventions are said to have ‘succeeded’ in the past century and a half. This includes the invasion and capture in the mid-19th century of over half of Mexican territory. The US also engineered regime change and toppled governments in countries beyond Latin America — Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya.
Against the backdrop of this predatory history, the US attack on Venezuela ordered by President Donald Trump followed a well-trodden path. But that didn’t make it any less egregious. President Nicolás Maduro was captured by American forces and taken to the US for trial. The armed intervention was illegal — a breach of international law and norms and violation of Venezuela’s sovereignty. It sent shock waves across the world and invited condemnation from many countries, while legal experts and some Democratic lawmakers called it an “act of war”. Five Latin American countries and Spain issued a joint statement which said, US actions “constitute an extremely dangerous precedent for peace and regional security”. It expressed concern about any “external appropriation of natural or strategic resources”. Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodríguez declared, “we will not be anyone’s colony”.
In a blatant display of imperial ambition, Trump vowed to run Venezuela, “take back” its oil and have American oil companies exploit its oil resources. Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves. This laid bare a key motivation of the intervention, which was not strategic deterrence against drug traffickers but commercial aggrandisement. It was a throwback to the past, when in the so-called ‘banana wars’, US-armed interventions sought to secure its commercial interests. Above all, Trump’s action was about establishing dominance over the Western Hemisphere, signalling Washington would dictate policy there and control its resources.

Trump seeks sole control of the Western Hemisphere and its resources.

The US military action came after months of escalating pressure on Maduro who Trump accused of links with drug smugglers without offering evidence. He also blamed Maduro for the influx of Venezuelan migrants into the US. Maduro’s offer for talks on narco-trafficking and oil was spurned by Washington. Instead, the US carried out strikes on Venezuelan vessels alleged to be transporting drugs and imposed a naval blockade to enforce an embargo on oil exports. Maduro accused Washington of aiming to overthrow him and take control of his country’s vast oil reserves.
The attack on Venezuela can be understood in the context of the Trump administration’s recently released National Security Strategy (NSS). This made enforcing the so-called ‘Trump corollary’ of the Monroe Doctrine in the Western Hemisphere a top priority. The original doctrine was to prevent European recolonisation and communist influence in the region. The ‘Trump corollary’ or ‘Donroe doctrine’ is designed to assert a proprietary claim and exclude China (whose trade and investment influence has been growing in Latin America) and other “non-Hemispheric” powers. Trump doesn’t just want the Hemisphere to be in Washington’s sphere of influence but for the US to have sole and exclusive control over its natural resources.
For all Trump’s earlier claims about non-intervention in the internal affairs of countries, also reiterated in the NSS, he has made regime change his policy. He issued warnings to Cuba, Columbia and Mexico about possible action and separately to Iran while repeating the threat to seize Greenland. The latter elicited a response from Denmark that such action will spell the end of Nato.

 

America’s experience with regime change has hardly been edifying, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya. It has always ended badly for the US and brought grief and suffering to those countries and shed so much of their blood. When the US tried to ‘run Iraq’ it proved a disaster. No wonder that a majority of Americans express fears about the US getting ‘too involved’ in the South American country, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll. Alarmingly, the survey also found two-thirds of Republicans supported the attack.
In the UN Security Council emergency meeting called to discuss Venezuela, the US was roundly condemned by China and Russia as well as American allies. Washington was accused of taking the world back to an “era of lawlessness” and undermining the “foundation of world order”. Pakistan’s envoy warned that “unilateral military” actions can lead to “unpredictable and uncontrolled outcomes” for years.
The Trump administration is unconcerned by international criticism. How Trump proposes to “run Venezuela” is the key question. As for his plan to “take over” oil resources, he announced that Venezuelan authorities will hand over up to 50 million barrels of sanctioned crude to the US. The money earned from its sale will be controlled by him. But for American oil companies to reap a bonanza is not simple, given Venezuela’s poor oil infrastructure and need for massive investment. Already US oil giant ExxonMobil has told Trump Venezuela is “uninvestable” without major changes. A private investor is cited in the Financial Times as saying, “No one wants to go in there when a random tweet can change the entire foreign policy of the country”.
The US may have bitten off more than it can chew. Venezuela can descend into chaos and greater regional instability can ensue with the US squandering whatever goodwill it has in the Hemisphere. As the New York Times put it in its editorial, Trump’s action represents “a dangerous and illegal approach to America’s place in the world”. Once again, the tactical success of the US action in Venezuela is likely to end in strategic failure.

Speaking at a party workers’ convention at Kamoke, around 50km from Lahore, he said that the IPP has launched a movement for creation of smaller provinces as an immediate and sustainable solution to problems of people living in far-flung areas.
“We will not change the names of provinces; new provinces should be created like in Punjab as North, South, West, and East Punjab. For this purpose, political parties must rise above narrow-mindedness and show magnanimity as it is in everyone’s own interest,” he said.

 

Welcoming support from MQM and other political parties for the proposal of new provinces, he said this would save people’s time and energy and allow their issues to be resolved closer to their doorstep.

Parties must show magnanimity to back the proposal: Aleem

He said that not only Punjab, but Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should also be divided into four provinces each with a new name.
The IPP leader announced linking cities of Kamoke and Gujranwala with the Lahore-Sialkot-Kharian Motorway which will provide these cities access to Islamabad via the Motorway network.
He also announced widening of this Motorway from four to six lanes which will benefit Gujranwala division in general and Kamoke city in particular.
The minister said that the prime minister would be invited to Kamoke and Gujranwala to inaugurate the link Motorway. He said the communications department has carried out important development works in Kamoke, including U-turns and that further projects will be added in future.
He demanded fixing of the minimum price of wheat for farmers at Rs4,000 per maund. He said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should take personal interest in reducing tax rates for the business community so that wheels of industry can move faster.
He said the youth are our future and providing them with dignified employment is our national responsibility.
If all-round development takes place, jobs will be created for the youth through the private sector for which business activities must be accelerated.
The minister also praised the leadership of the Pakistan armed forces for humbling the enemy and earning global respect for the country.

The significant delay in utilising the loan is mainly due to the failure of the Tranche III road project to begin, resulting from controversies in the bidding process discussed in five parliamentary standing committee meetings.
Without immediate acc­ele­ration by the National Highway Authority (NHA), the funds will expire without the completion of the Tranche-III road project, which involves widening sections of the N55 Highway.
In a letter seen by Dawn, the ADB warned the economic affairs division that based on current progress, there was a significant risk the approved $360m under the Multi-tranche Finan­cing Facility (MFF) would not be fully utilised by the expiration date of Dec 31, 2027.
The project has been stalled for eight months following controversies surrounding the bidding process.
Although bids were opened in February 2025 and approved by the ADB shortly thereafter, the process faced scrutiny from five parliamentary panels and Public Procurement Regulatory Authority.
Despite the administrative hurdles, the Islamabad High Court recently ordered that work be awarded without further delay. The court noted that continued stalling could result in loan cancellation, cost escalation and “serious reputational damage” to the national exchequer.
The total of the project cost is estimated at Rs170bn, which includes land acquisition, consultancy and taxes while the lowest bid received by the NHA for the project was of Rs147 billion.
The ADB covers Rs108bn of the total, with the government of Pakistan funding the remaining balance.
Officials indicate the NHA is in a difficult position regarding fund utilisation. Rebidding is considered unfeasible, as obtaining new approvals from the ADB and Ecnec would take more time, while the ADB stressed that its 2027 deadline is “firm, with no possibility of extension”.
“We seek EAD’s support in assisting NHA to expedite implementation, complete pending procurements, and ensure full utilisation of the loan proceeds within the MFF period,” the ADB stated.
The Ecnec has approved the bids from a joint venture comprising NXCC, Dynamic Constructor and Rustam Associates even though parliamentary committees and the PPRA expressed concerns.
The NHA defended the choice, stating that allegations of non-performance against the lead partner “did not reach finality in accordance with the procedure and rules”, and the firm was never blacklisted by any agency.
The ADB confirmed it has no objection to awarding the contracts to the lowest evaluated bidder across four specific lots:
Lot 1: Rajanpur to Jam­pur (57.5km) for Rs23.5bn; Lot 2: Jampur to Dera Gh­azi Khan (64km) for Rs29.1bn; Lot 3: Dera Ghazi Khan to Tibi Qaisrani (111.7km) for Rs52bn; Lot 4: Tibi Qaisrani to Dera Ismail Khan (96.2km) for Rs42bn.
IHC rejected PPRA’s petition on the Rs172bn Carec Tranch-III award to JV. In its verdict, the court warned that the regulator’s recent decisions “may also lead to the refusal of the finance facility agreed by the ADB,” and declared the petitions infructuous.

PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi has found himself in the centre of a legal controversy after a forensic report, submitted by the prosecution to the anti-terrorism court in the Radio Pakistan attack case, identified him as one of the suspects seen in the purported video clips of the incident.
The report prepared by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) is based on the footage of the ransacking of the Radio Pakistan office in Peshawar after the arrest of ex-prime minister Imran Khan in May 2023. Last month, the court ordered that the clips be sent for examination and a report be submitted.
At the time, the defence had not questioned the relevance or the legitimacy of the footage.
The authorities had provided the video clips and the pictures of CM Afridi, former provincial ministers Taimur Saleem Jhagra and Kamran Bangash, and two other PTI leaders, Irfan Saleem and Amir Khan Chamkani, for analysis. None of them had been nominated in the case.
In the report, the PFSA gave its opinion on two points: whether the videos in the USB were genuine and whether the persons whose profile pictures had been shared appeared in the clips. It said the five individuals, including the CM, were seen in the clips, but did not clarify if the videos were related to the Radio Pakistan attack or any other event.
It, however, said the clips were not edited except for the merger of multiple video clips of different camera views.
A legal expert, privy to the case, said the investigating officer, after this ‘evidence’ could nominate more accused through a supplementary report to the ATC. However, the court can also take cognisance of the matter. Similarly, the Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC) could also submit an application for the inclusion of the accused persons in light of the forensic report.
‘Unrelated clips’
Soon after the details of the report went viral on social media, several PTI leaders stated that these clips didn’t show the Radio Pakistan occurrence, which took place on May 10, 2023, after PTI founder Imran Khan was arrested in Islamabad.
PTI leader Taimur Jhagra said it was interesting that this campaign was against the CM and other individuals never nominated in this case. “The posts with screenshots are very interesting because they have nothing to do with Radio Pakistan. I believe the Punjab lab is simply commenting on whether it thinks the videos are genuine or not. My first video screenshot is of a video that is not even shot in Peshawar… The video is of my condemnation of Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, while in Islamabad,” he mentioned.
The ATC has fixed Jan 26 for the next hearing in the trial.
The ATC is conducting the trial, with 75 accused, including some present and former lawmakers, being indicted on June 3, 2025, on multiple counts. The FIR was registered at the East Cantonment police station on May 10, 2023.
‘Irrefutable evidence’
Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that the incidents involving arson attacks on Radio Pakistan and toll plazas by the PTI in Peshawar were part of a well-planned conspiracy, and “irrefutable evidence” has surfaced in the forensic report.
Ms Bokhari said the report included a complete forensic analysis of the Peshawar incidents, supported by videos and photographic evidence. She stated that all this evidence was admissible in any court of law, and those involved in rioting would be brought to justice.

The opposition leader issue is expected to resurface after PTI’s Omar Ayub withdrew his petitions in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal.
Before the petition was withdrawn, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said he couldn’t begin the appointment process as the issue was sub judice.

 

With the summoning of the assembly, Speaker Sadiq is expected to ask the opposition to follow the process for appointing a new leader.
The opposition has repe­atedly accused the government of delaying the appo­intment process and nominated Pasht­unkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Achakzai as the opposition leader.
Rule 39 of the “Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly 2007” confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.
However, the opposition has already submitted the name of Achakzai to the speaker’s office rather than presenting it to the speaker personally.
The rule also states the speaker must verify the signatures of all opposition members voting in favour of the candidate.
Rule 39, titled “Decla­ration of Leader of the Opposition,” states that after each general election — and at any time thereafter — the National Assembly speaker must declare the opposition leader as soon as possible following the election of the prime minister.

• Seeks tariff overhaul to lift exports beyond $60bn in three years
• Highlights cross-cutting barriers across 20 export products
• Notes ‘policy unpredictability’ undermines investor, buyer confidence               
ISLAMABAD: A body constituted by the prime minister and led by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal has called for urgent reforms to improve the ease of doing business and for a serious restructuring and rationalisation of tariffs — both energy prices and trade duties — to more than double exports to over $60 billion within three years.
The committee was formed to devise a strategy for avoiding another IMF programme once the current $8.4bn arrangement expires at the end of 2027, amid mounting pressure from persistently weak economic indicators.
According to synopses compiled after week-long consultations with public and private sector stakeholders from Jan 5 to 9, the panel concluded that the current state of affairs was not capable of driving a fast-growing population of 250 million towards sustained prosperity because of cross-cutting constra­ints affecting “all 20 priority export products and six export drivers”.
Ironically, most of these constraints are generally well known, but the government’s inability, despite special interventions here and there, including through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), to create a conducive working environment in a fair, equitable, rule-based and transparent manner, has hampered sustainable growth path beyond stabilisation under a restrictive programme volunteered to the IMF.
The plan proposed easing electricity and gas prices through debt refinancing and rationalising price build-ups. It was found that “export competitiveness is undermined by high and volatile energy costs, with electricity and gas tariffs remaining above regional benchmarks and subject to frequent changes”.
It warned that volatility was inflating production costs across manufacturing, agro-processing, minerals, fisheries, and services, eroding margins and diverting orders to competing countries.
The Planning Commission also pointed out that the cost of doing business in Pakistan remained “structurally high due to fragmented and distortionary taxation, inverted input tariffs, advance income tax deductions, delayed sales tax refunds and persistent working capital lockups”.
It said these issues disproportionately affected exporters and were particularly binding for small and medium enterprises across manufacturing and agri-based value chains.
The panel said that policy unpredictability was also weakening investment and buyer confidence. “Frequent changes in tax policy, energy pricing, tariff structures, export incentives and regulatory regimes, often announced late in the business cycle, constrain forward planning, capacity expansion and scaling, particularly around annual export order booking cycles,” it said.
The synopses also highlighted institutional fragmentation and regulatory burdens. They said inconsistent definitions of SMEs across the State Bank of Pakistan, SMEDA, the Federal Board of Revenue and provincial authorities restricted access to finance, incentives and support schemes. Overlapping mandates, discretionary enforcement, excessive audits and weak inter-agency coordination increased compliance costs and uncertainty, the panel said.
Moreover, exporters also faced weak domestic quality, testing and compliance infrastructure, increasing reliance on overseas laboratories for certification and testing, it said, adding: “This raises costs, lengthens lead times and elevates rejection risks in regulated export markets, constraining movement into higher value products and destinations.”
Limited access to affordable finance was also highlighted as a constraint on upgrading and value addition. The panel said export credit, insurance, guarantees, and long-term financing instruments remained underdeveloped, while high interest rates, collateral requirements, and liquidity constraints curtailed SME investment in technology, compliance, and scaling.
The committee also questioned the implementation of export facilitation and input schemes, including the Export Facilitation Scheme, saying procedural delays, higher input costs and working-capital pressures were limiting effective sourcing of raw materials and intermediate inputs.
In addition, it cited logistics and trade facilitation bottlenecks, including high inland freight costs, underutilised rail, port congestion, slow customs clearance, inadequate cold-chain infrastructure and weak courier and postal systems for SMEs.
It noted that at Port Qasim, the absence of dedicated export terminals, limited handling infrastructure, inadequate covered storage and constrained evacuation arrangements increased dwell time, handling costs and shipment uncertainty. It also pointed to skills gaps, low value addition and weak branding as barriers to moving into higher-value segments.
Based on consultations, the Planning Commission is now collecting additional information through a private-sector survey to refine inputs and develop a data-driven, sector-specific technical roadmap to enhance exports under the Uraan Pakistan strategic plan.
“Pakistan’s development, economic sovereignty and even national security now hinge on one thing: how fast we can grow our exports and move to an export-led growth model,” Mr Iqbal said at the conclusion of the consultations.
He added that “the only way to break free from foreign crutches and avoid the next IMF programme is to rapidly increase our exports and build strong foreign exchange reserves”.
The 20 products covered during these engagements included copper, gems and jewellery, software and IT services, fish and fish preparations, rice, fruits and vegetables, meat and meat preparations, guar gum and its products, handicrafts, textile and apparel, sports goods, leather and leather products, surgical instruments, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, cement, carpets and rugs, engineering goods, footwear, plastic material and cutlery.
Pakistan currently exports about $30-35bn worth of goods, against Planning Commission estimates of an untapped annual potential of over $60bn.
The findings and recommendations will be consolidated into product-wise diagnostics and a targeted facilitation framework for submission to the prime minister. Their implementation would be subject to clearance under the tight requirements of the IMF conditions.

The 37-year-old batting maestro, who had scored 376 in his last four ODI innings, anchored India’s chase of 301 with a sublime knock of 93 featuring eight boundaries and a six, but he was dismissed by Kyle Jamieson when a landmark century was within reach.
The Vadodara crowd’s disappointment was palpable as their hero departed, but they rose to applaud Kohli, who achieved another milestone by becoming the second-highest run scorer in international cricket across all formats.
With his 77th ODI fifty, Kohli moved on to 28,068 runs and surpassed Sri Lankan great Kumar Sangakkara (28,016) to sit behind only Indian icon Sachin Tendulkar’s 34,357.
“If I look back at my whole journey, it’s nothing short of a dream come true for me,” Kohli said on moving one step closer to his mentor Tendulkar.
“I’ve always known my abilities, how much ability I had when I came in, and I had to work for a lot more to get to the place I am today. God has blessed me with way too much for me to complain about anything.
“I always look back at my whole journey with a lot of grace, a lot of gratitude in my heart, and I feel proud about it.”

NZ openers frustrate India
Earlier, India won the toss and elected to field, factoring in dew conditions for the second innings, but New Zealand’s openers Devon Conway (56) and Henry Nicholls (62) frustrated the hosts with a commanding 117-run opening stand.
Harshit Rana provided the breakthrough, striking twice in consecutive overs to dismiss both openers and apply the brakes on New Zealand’s scoring rate.
The middle order failed to capitalise on promising starts, with only Daryl Mitchell making a significant contribution, while skipper Michael Bracewell was run out from a direct hit by Shreyas Iyer.
Mitchell blazed his way to 84 with five boundaries and three sixes before being trapped leg-before to Prasidh Krishna while attempting another big shot. Kristian Clarke’s unbeaten 24 helped New Zealand add 50 runs in the final five overs to reach 300.
Kohli and Gill build parnership
India’s chase got off to a rocky start when opener Rohit Sharma fell for 26, but Kohli and captain Shubman Gill steadied the ship with a crucial 118-run partnership.
“I’m not thinking about the milestones at all. If we were batting first today, I would have probably gone harder. Even with the chase, because there was a total on the board, I had to kind of buckle down and play the situation,” Kohli added.
Gill contributed a patient 56 but fell shortly after receiving treatment on his back before Jamieson (4-41) then turned the match on its head with a devastating spell.He removed Ravindra Jadeja in the same over as Kohli before clean-bowling Iyer for 49, his off stump knocked out of the ground as India slumped to 242-5.
Enter Rana, who counter-attacked brilliantly and was fortunate to survive a dropped catch at long-on when on 12. He made New Zealand pay, scoring 29 before being caught behind, keeping India in the hunt.
With pressure mounting and India needing to maintain a run-a-ball rate, KL Rahul held his nerve to guide the hosts home with an unbeaten 29, sealing victory with two fours and a six in the penultimate over.
The victory gives India a 1-0 lead in the series ahead of the second game in Rajkot on Wednesday.</p><small>2026-01-11 21:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/11232450688edee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966345/cm-afridi-briefly-addresses-crowd-near-mazar-i-quaid-pti-claims-hurdles-shelling-at-workers' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi briefly addresses crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid; PTI claims hurdles, shelling at workers</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Sunday briefly addressed hundreds gathered near Mazar-i-Quaid for the party’s rally, while the PTI claimed it faced hurdles in reaching the venue and its supporters were met with shelling by the police.
The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue, saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid.
During the day, PTI supporters gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the police employed shelling. Disturbances were also reported near Numaish Chowrangi as police dispersed crowds, while media vehicles were also vandalised.
“I am deeply grateful to all Pakistanis and the people of Sindh for honouring us with enormous respect and esteem,” CM Afridi said while addressing a huge crowd near Mazar-i-Quaid late on Sunday night.







“We can never forget the respect we received from the people of Sindh. But you all must not forgive the Sindh government for the disrespect they have shown towards the Sindhi cap and Ajrak,” the PTI leader added.
“We will not allow anyone to steal our mandate, to snatch our rights, or to further keep our leader Imran Khan sahib in prison wrongfully,” Afridi said.
The KP CM said: “Those who used to say ‘we will end PTI’ and who were thinking that Imran Khan’s politics will be eradicated, they should come here and see these youngsters here.
“They should consider that these people have come for only a jalsa, then what will happen the day my leader (Imran Khan) issues a formal call for a street movement,” he added.
“You must stand prepared against this oppression and fascism. Whenever my leader issues a call, we will act as per his wishes,” the PTI leader said.
Afridi reiterated his claims of the Sindh government “leaving us stranded on deserted roads in the dark of the night” while returning from Hyderabad to Karachi.
However, a provincial minister refuted the claims, saying that a police accompanied the KP CM on his way to Karachi via the “safest routes”.

 

“Shelling was also done at our sisters, children, workers here […] all routes were blocked, police baton-charged [supporters],” CM Afridi claimed in his brief address.
The chief minister further alleged that “they (authorities) also damaged the media’s vehicles”.
Afridi said the Sindh government “repeated” what its Punjab counterpart had done when he visited Lahore last month, calling both governments “fake”.
The gathering was a part of the KP CM’s four-day visit to Sindh, who is leading his party’s street mobilisation movement.
“God willing, our next stop will be Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and we will continue the same momentum in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” CM Afridi announced.
The KP CM also raised slogans of “every chowk is D-Chowk”.



‘Delays due to obstructions, public welcomes’
Earlier at 7:44pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said CM Afridi’s convoy was facing delays “due to obstructions at various places, and the public’s affection, welcomes and responses at numerous places”.
At around 9pm, Sheikh said the KP CM would reach the venue in five minutes, and lashed out at the Sindh police and government for their actions. At around 10:30pm, he shared footage of the caravan at Numaish Chowrangi, where Afridi also addressed the crowd.







The PTI also shared visuals of the welcome accorded to the party caravan by their supporters in Baldia Town and Ittehad Town‘s Khyber Chowk.







At around 6:40pm, the PTI said the Sindh police had “attempted to prevent” CM Afridi’s convoy from moving forward, but the party leaders “had the path reopened with the help of party workers”.
The video showed party leaders, including Shafiullah Jan, speaking to the police before the convoy’s vehicles were allowed to move ahead.







The PTI also shared videos of hundreds gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah by the evening, with supporters chanting “Jiye Imran” and “Tera yaar, mera yaar, Qaidi No. 804”.







In a video recorded while on his way to the venue, Afridi said his convoy would reach Mazar-i-Quaid after going through Baldia Town, Keamari, Banaras Chowk, Golimar and Gurumandir so PTI supporters could join the caravan.
Former MNA Faheem Khan said, “Ten of our vehicles were intercepted. But no worries; I am reaching the rally venue with another vehicle equipped with a sound system.”







In a statement on X, the PTI hailed the public for its “historic display of public power and expression of love for Imran Khan”.
“Despite all the fascism, violence, arrests and obstructions by the Sindh government through its police, thousands of people have gathered inside and around Karachi’s Bagh-i-Jinnah and on the surrounding streets at the moment,” it said.
“This is the scene that serves as a clear message to those with fascist mindsets that public power cannot be stopped by walls and batons,” the PTI asserted.
“This gathering is a renewal of the pledge that we are ready to give every sacrifice for Imran Khan, Pakistan, true freedom, supremacy of the Constitution and law, independence of the judiciary, and our basic rights.”







Shelling, roadblocks at venue: PTI
Shortly after 4pm, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared a video on X wherein a woman said police have resorted to shelling at party supporters at “Mazar-i-Quaid’s garden”.







Video footage aired by DawnNewsTV showed multiple police vans at Bagh-i-Jinnah and cops employing shelling, with people gathered there retaliating by pelting stones.



Pictures from Numaish Chowrangi showed cops with batons detaining multiple individuals as PTI supporters gathered to make their way to Bagh-i-Jinnah.

A video shared with Dawn showed dozens gathered at an unknown location, with people pushing aside containers that had been placed to block a route.

The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — an ally of the PTI under an opposition alliance — also said its leader Allama Sadiq Jafri and others had reached “Jinnah Ground”, possibly referring to Bagh-i-Jinnah.







PTI spokesperson Mohammad Ali Bozdar told Dawn that police had blocked roads and were not allowing party workers to enter Bagh-i-Jinnah, where the government had previously allowed the party to hold the rally.
He reiterated his allegation that police had blocked roads in various areas and were preventing PTI workers from reaching the new venue of Mazar-i-Quaid’s VIP gate as well.
Bozdar said CM Afridi would pay his respects at the mausoleum and later on, he would address party workers from a truck, the arrangements for which had been completed.
‘Attack’ on mediapersons
Separately, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took notice of an “attack“ on Aaj News’ vehicle near Gurumandir Chowrangi.
He also directed the East district senior superintendent of police (SSP) to immediately provide details on “police action”.
“Miscreant elements will be dealt with firmly. We will not let anyone sabotage law and order,” Lanjar asserted.
The minister said the perpetrators would be arrested by tracing them using the modern monitoring system.

In a statement, PTI’s Bozdar also condemned the attack on mediapersons and said action should be taken if someone had “attacked the media”.
“The PTI’s workers are peaceful. No one is allowed to take the law into their hands,” he stated. “The media is the public’s voice; attacks on media will not be tolerated under any circumstances,” he added.
The board members of Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the “attack of a charged crowd on media; violence against journalists, cameramen and staff; and damage caused to DSNGs”.
“How can this group declare themselves pro-democratic after attacking the media?” said a joint statement by KUJ President Ejaz Ahmad and others.
“What message did they try to convey by targeting the media?”
The KUJ demanded that the Sindh government trace the perpetrators through CCTV footage and bring them to justice.
The Crime Reporters Association (CRA) also strongly condemned the vandalism incidents, adding that there was a “clash between political workers and police” during coverage at Bagh-i-Jinnah.
“Media representatives busy in fulfilling their duties got caught in the middle of this chaos and were targeted, while the vehicles (DSNGs) and equipment of many media houses were damaged,” the CRA stated.
Sindh government spokesperson Sadia Javed, in a statement, said there were “attacks on multiple news channels’ vehicles and pelting”. The vehicles of GNN and Aaj News were among those damaged, while a worker of Channel 5 was reportedly assaulted.
In his statement, PPP Karachi General Secretary Rauf Ahmed Nagori alleged that PTI workers “vandalised citizen vehicles during their protest”.
PTI changes rally venue
The PTI had initially planned to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah, and the PPP-led Sindh government had even issued a no-objection certificate for it despite objections from the PML-N.
But the party blamed the Sindh administration for “wasting their time” and announced that the public meeting would now be held in front of the Quaid’s mausoleum.

In a video statement, Sheikh criticised the Sindh government for allegedly blocking the rally. He recalled that Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani had welcomed the KP CM at the Karachi airport and presented a Sindh cap and Ajrak to him.
“Was that a pretence?” he questioned, slamming the Sindh government for its “shamelessness”.
On the party’s decision to hold a gathering outside one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid, he said, “Holding a rally at a public gate does not block any route.”
Sheikh alleged the NOC for the rally had been deliberately delayed, further questioning that when the Sindh government had granted permission for the rally, “why was our vendor beaten and made to flee?”
He decried that the PPP was no longer late prime minister Benazir Bhutto’s party.







“Police brutality and blocking of roads cannot dampen the morale of the people,” PTI Karachi President Raja Azhar said in a statement, adding that the rally would prove to be the “public’s referendum against cruelty”.
Similarly, party member Faheem Khan urged people to participate in the rally and termed the alleged blocking of roads “an attack on the rights of the people”.
Late on Saturday, Sheikh said that while the PTI had announced Mazar-i-Quaid as the venue as the NOC had not been issued by then, the party had again decided to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah after getting the permission.







PTI alleges arrests at Bagh-i-Jinnah
Separately, the PTI alleged that authorities had raided Bagh-i-Jinnah, subjected its workers to violence and also arrested several of them.
Party spokesperson Bozdar, while speaking to Dawn, alleged that when workers reached Bagh-i-Jinnah around 2am on Sunday for rally arrangements and preparations, around 15 to 20 police mobiles reached the spot and law enforcement personnel resorted to baton-charge. They detained over a dozen PTI workers, he claimed.
At around 2:30am, PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui posted on X that the Sindh government wasted their time as the deputy commissioner East had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) on Saturday evening at 6:30pm.
“The public power witnessed in Karachi yesterday has frightened them; they can’t decide what to do now. The people of Karachi will be at the Mazar-i-Quaid public gate at 2pm with our guest, the chief minister of KP, Sohail Afridi. We will hold a public meeting at the VIP gate at 2pm,” she stated.
But the Sindh home minister warned of strict action if any public meeting was held on the road. “No one is allowed to challenge the writ of the government,” Lanjar said in a statement.
In one of her posts at around 4:30am, Siddiqui said that containers had been parked around Jinnah Ground and police personnel were present at the site in large numbers.







In another post, she alleged police had “attacked” Bagh-i-Jinnah, arrested several PTI workers, and their belongings had been confiscated.







Similarly, Sheikh said in a post on X at around 2:30am that “this fascism against peaceful workers was unfortunate. The PPP and Sindh government, which harp about democracy, should feel ashamed“.







In other posts, he decried the alleged police raid at Bagh-i-Jinnah and claimed PTI workers had been subjected to violence.







PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, speaking to the media at Karachi Press Club today, decried the “barbarity” that PTI members had been subjected to.
“Cars were smashed, and two dozen members have been detained unlawfully. A lawyer of ours was detained this morning at Bagh-i-Jinnah. It is cordoned off by police right now,” he said, adding that the PTI had the NOC for the rally.
“So the rally will happen,” he asserted.
In response to a Dawn query, police sources denied detaining any PTI workers this morning and said they just removed them from Mazar-i-Quaid. The sources said police took action to disperse the party workers, alleging that they had blocked a main road.
The sources also said that while there would be no restriction on the movement of KP CM Afridi, PTI workers would not be allowed at Mazar-i-Quaid.
KP CM claims routes blocked from Hyderabad to Karachi
Earlier on Sunday, CM Afridi claimed in a post on X that “upon my return from Hyderabad, all routes for me and my entire team have been blocked. For the past four hours, I’ve been switching between different routes. At 4:23am, we’ve now set off toward Karachi on a deserted road“.
“The Sindh government is not only playing with my life but also with the lives of my team members,” he said, warning that the precedent of such treatment being meted out to the CM of one province in other provinces would “prove highly detrimental in the near future”.
“Pakistan belongs to all of us. Do not spread hatred here to such an extent that it becomes impossible to return from that point. Fake democratic forces are not leaving any stone unturned in this. This is extremely shameful,” he said.







However, Hyderabad SSP Adeel Chandio told Dawn that “no obstruction was created in the convoy and rally of KP CM in Hyderabad until he left the city”. “And he left the city safely,” he added.
Later, in a video message shared on PTI’s X account, the CM said: “We reached Karachi around 7:15pm […] We will definitely hold a rally today. It took us seven and a half hours to reach Karachi from Hyderabad.
“They had blocked the route at different places and we were compelled to travel on a deserted route. This was tantamount to putting my and my team’s lives at risk, as anything could have happened there.”
He urged Karachiites to come out for the rally today, adding that “they (the Sindh government) are afraid of the rally, but it will be held”.







Raja also posted on X that he had reached Karachi from Hyderabad after “seven hours, driving through jungles in the CM KPK’s vehicle”.
“Motorway closed. The fascist state lost its nerve after seeing the massive response of the people, given two days of freedom and human dignity,” he said.







PTI not abiding by assurances, claims Sharjeel Inam
From the Sindh government, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon maintained that his provincial government had warmly welcomed Afridi and provided him with complete security.
“The post of chief minister is a constitutional post and constitutional posts have been fully respected,” he said in a statement, maintaining that the PTI was in constant touch with the Sindh government.
He then accused the opposition party of “not abiding by the assurances” it had given, but did not specify any guarantees.
“It was clearly said on the very first day that they are allowed to hold a rally. It is inappropriate to make allegations against the Sindh government despite this,” he said, maintaining that no one had stopped the PTI from holding a rally in the ground.
However, the manner in which rallies and processions were being taken out on the roads was causing severe traffic disruption and common citizens were facing difficulties, he said.
“Karachi is a metropolitan city; traffic problems arise here even when a few hundred people gather,” he said. “We want the KP chief minister to complete his visit in a peaceful manner.”
He said that PTI workers should not take the law into their own hands and should follow the guidelines given by the government. The movement of common people should not be affected and violation of laws should be avoided, he added.
Memon said a security alert had also been issued regarding the rally, and a security plan had been devised.
“Unfortunately, the security plan is not being followed,” he claimed, further maintaining that complete security had been provided by Sindh police in connection with the rally.
“In view of security concerns, the instructions of the Sindh government should be followed, and only routes allocated by the government should be used,” he said.
Memon claimed that the route designated for the PTI in Hyderabad had not been followed and they took a route of their own choice.
“It is not correct to say that the convoy of the chief minister of KP was stopped on its return from Hyderabad,” he said. “The place where the convoy faced difficulty is the National Highway Authority bridge, where traffic congestions are frequent.”

His statements came after the PTI claimed its convoy was facing hurdles while on its way to Mazar-i-Quaid for a rally, and CM Afridi said he had to use risky routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad.
“I personally apologise if something [unpleasant] happened somewhere, as this should not happen,” Shah said during Geo News’ programme ‘Naya Pakistan’.
’’He is the chief minister of a province and whatever we did, the welcome and all, was in respect of the people of KP as he had their mandate,“ the PPP leader added.
Asked about the apparent change in the Sindh government’s attitude, Shah highlighted that the guests were “welcomed and taken care of”. He noted that the PTI sought permission to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah from the Sindh government “even though it falls under the federal government’s jurisdiction”.
He acknowledged that the PTI “adopted the proper procedure” to seek a no-objection certificate (NOC), which he said also caused delays. Then, the minister said, the issues arose when the NOC got delayed by about 1-1.5 hours, and the PTI announced that they would “hold the rally on a road”.
Shah added that the Sindh government had even offered the PTI to connect them to their vendors if the preparations were lacking.



The minister then pointed out CM Afridi’s “certain” statements, including one about President Asif Ali Zardari’s politics.
“There are no differences. Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari sahib and President Asif Ali Zardari sahib are our PPP, the Sindh government. There is one stance,” he asserted.
Shah added that if President Zardari did not wish so, the PTI guests would not have been welcomed at the airport or facilitated. He said the PTI started making harsh statements, which also upset party members who noted the criticism despite offering them support.

 

Asked about the police action against PTI workers at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the early hours of Sunday, Shah said an inquiry was underway about what led to it.
He said the PTI was being urged to arrange the setup in the ground, but they were insistent on holding a gathering on the road.
On CM Afridi’s claims about his convoy being forced to take dangerous routes on his way to Karachi from Hyderabad, Shah said: “He had complete protocol, and as per the security threat issued, he was brought via the safest routes.
“Those were the safest routes, and police protection was with him,“ the PPP leader asserted.
“How could he have returned if there were pickets and if roads were blocked?” Shah asked rhetorically.
“As per the reports the administration has given, this protocol was adopted for their security and safety,“ the minister replied to a question about the police pickets set up.
On reports of shelling at Bagh-i-Jinnah during the day despite the NOC, Shah said, “Something unpleasant happened there.”
Criticising Zardari is our democratic right: Qaiser
Responding to Shah on the same show, senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser said, “We think that Sindh’s people and government respect democracy and […] they respect their opponents.”
He acknowledged that the PTI had differences with the PPP and concerns about it. “In our opinion, the illegitimate government in power right now is so because of their support,” he said.
“The legislation that they are doing. [Criticising it] is our stance. It is our democratic right to have whatever stance we want,” Qaiser stressed.
To a question raised by the host, Qaiser responded: “You and he (Shah) both understand what is happening from where. Will a democratic political party take instructions in this manner? Will we not have a say?”
Qaiser said the PTI respected the PPP, adding: “Even if you say that we criticised Zardari sahib, that is our democratic right.”



“Will this attitude continue? Is this democracy? […] Tell me, what unlawful [incident] has occurred over the past two days?“ Qaiser asked. He stressed the vendors needed two to three days to make arrangements at the venue, adding that there was “no lighting” at Bagh-i-Jinnah and that the Sindh government would be responsible for any unfortunate incident.
Responding to Qaiser, Shah pointed out the welcome accorded to CM Afridi on Friday, asking if it would have been given “if there were some instructions from somewhere”.
Shah also denied that the PPP “changed its strategy” because of the PML-N reportedly being criticised for its attitude towards the KP CM during his Lahore visit.
Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.</p><small>2026-01-11 20:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644543-passengers-appreciate-recently-launched-electric-bus-service-in-jhelum-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Passengers appreciate recently-launched electric bus service in Jhelum: minister</strong></a><br><p>

The officers would be deployed on Sunday and Monday to bolster the safety of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol officials already in Minnesota, Noem said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” programme.
Some 2,000 federal officers have already been dispatched to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in what DHS has called its largest operation ever.
The new deployments were scheduled to begin even as more than 1,000 rallies were planned nationwide this weekend to protest the federal government’s deportation push and Wednesday’s fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an ICE officer.
Minnesota officials have called the shooting unjustified, pointing to bystander video they say showed Good’s vehicle turning away from the agent as he fired.
Noem and other US officials have maintained that the agent acted in self-defence because Good, a volunteer in a community network that monitors and records ICE operations in Minneapolis, drove forward in the direction of the agent who then shot her, after another agent had approached the driver’s side and told her to get out of the car.
In a separate Sunday appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Noem said other video footage showed Good protesting ICE agents at other locations earlier on Wednesday morning, but did not say if or when it would be publicly released.
Minnesota authorities on Friday said they were opening their own criminal investigation into the incident, after some state law enforcement officials said the FBI was refusing to cooperate with state investigators.
White House Border Security Czar Tom Homan said on “Fox News Sunday” that he wanted to let the investigation play out, but that he “truly believe that officer thought his life was in danger to take that action.”</p><small>2026-01-11 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1123044908746a3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966385/religious-ministry-organises-second-training-session-for-haj-2026-pilgrims' target='_blank'><strong>Religious ministry organises second training session for Haj 2026 pilgrims</strong></a><br><p>Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony on Sunday organised the second phase of the training session for Haj 2026 pilgrims at the Haji Camp in Islamabad.
According to the ministry’s spokesperson, the primary objective of this programme was to “provide comprehensive awareness regarding the various stages of the pilgrimage, necessary precautionary measures, and the obligatory acts (Faraiz and Wajibat) of Haj and Umrah,” the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
During the session, Deputy Director of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, Umar Butt, briefed the participants on administrative matters, departure procedures, and accommodation in Makkah and Madinah.
Master Trainer Tanveer Asghar provided technical training on the methods of performing Haj and Umrah, highlighting the religious obligations.
The event was attended by the Director of Haji Complex Islamabad, Qazi Sami-ur-Rehman, Deputy Director Hakim Khan Khattak, and other senior officials.
“Pilgrims were advised to improve their physical fitness by walking two to three kilometres daily. Essential travel documents, including the original passport, computer national identity card (CNIC), flight ticket, visa copies, and vaccination cards (for meningitis, flu, and polio) must be kept ready,” the report said.
A strict warning was issued against carrying prohibited items such as narcotics, naswar, cigarettes, and unverified medicines, it added.
The ministry has made the Pak Haj App” mandatory for all pilgrims to access flight schedules, accommodation details, and group information.
Furthermore, the procedure for remote biometric verification via the “Saudi Visa Bio” app was explained in detail, the APP said.
For those arriving directly in Madinah, the stay will range from three to eight days before proceeding to Makkah.
In Makkah, approximately 250 buildings have been arranged for accommodation, with a 24-hour free shuttle bus service available to transport pilgrims to the Haram Sharif.
The session covered the pillars of Umrah (Ihram, Niyyat, Tawaf, Sa’i, and Halq/Qasr) and the three Faraiz (obligatory acts) of Haj: Ihram, Wuquf-e-Arafat, and Tawaf-e-Ziyarat. The Wajibat (essential acts), such as the stay at Muzdalifah, Ramy al-Jamarat (stoning the devil), Qurbani (sacrifice), and the Tawaf-i-Wida were also explained.
Due to expected extreme weather, pilgrims were instructed to use umbrellas, spray bottles, and ORS to prevent heatstroke.
In case of emergencies, they were advised to contact the Saudi helpline 937 for medical assistance and 911 for security matters.
The Ministry of Religious Affairs urged the pilgrims to maintain discipline, patience, and compassion throughout the sacred journey, the report said.
The session concluded with a detailed Q&A segment, where officials and trainers addressed specific concerns regarding administrative and travel arrangements, ensuring the pilgrims are fully prepared for their journey.
In July 2025, the federal cabinet formally approved the Haj Policy 2026, outlining key procedural, financial, and logistical measures for the pilgrimage season. The following month, the government started accepting Haj applications.
The Kingdom has allocated a total quota of 179,210 pilgrims for Pakistan — 119,210 under the government scheme and 60,000 for private operators, according to the ministry.

“Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target,” said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards.
With the country’s government facing the biggest demonstrations since 2022, Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if force is used on protesters.
Authorities intensify crackdown
The protests began on December 28 in response to soaring prices. Authorities accuse the US and Israel of fomenting unrest. Iran’s police chief Ahmad-Reza Radan said security forces had stepped up efforts to confront “rioters”.
The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout since Thursday.
Footage posted on social media on Saturday from Tehran showed large crowds marching along a street at night, clapping and chanting. The crowd “has no end nor beginning,” a man is heard saying.
In footage from the northeastern city of Mashhad, smoke can be seen billowing into the night sky from fires in the street, masked protesters, and a road strewn with debris, another video posted on Saturday showed. Explosions could be heard.
Reuters verified the locations.
State TV aired footage of dozens of body bags on the ground at the Tehran coroner’s office on Sunday, saying the dead were victims of events caused by “armed terrorists”.
Three Israeli sources, who were present for Israeli security consultations over the weekend, said Israel was on a high-alert footing for the possibility of any US intervention.
An Israeli military official said the protests were an internal Iranian matter, but Israel’s military was monitoring developments and was ready to respond “with power if need be”.
An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment.Israel and Iran fought a 12-day war in June last year, which the United States briefly joined by attacking key nuclear installations.
Iran retaliated by firing missiles at Israel and an American air base in Qatar.
Iran denounces ‘rioters and terrorists’
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, in a TV interview, said Israel and the US were masterminding destabilisation and that Iran’s enemies had brought in “terrorists … who set mosques on fire …. attack banks, and public properties”.
“Families, I ask you: do not allow your young children to join rioters and terrorists who behead people and kill others,” he said, adding that the government was ready to listen to the people and to resolve economic problems.
Alan Eyre, a former US diplomat and Iran expert, thought it unlikely the protests would topple Iran’s ruling establishment.
“I think it is more likely that it puts these protests down eventually, but emerges from the process far weaker,” he told Reuters, noting that Iran’s ruling elite still appeared cohesive and there was no organised opposition.
Iranian state TV broadcast funeral processions in western cities such as Gachsaran and Yasuj for security personnel killed in protests.
State TV said 30 members of the security forces would be buried in the central city of Isfahan and that six more were killed by “rioters” in Kermanshah in the west.
Us ready to help, says Trump
Trump, posting on social media on Saturday, said: “Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!”
In a phone call on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed the possibility of US intervention in Iran, according to an Israeli source present for the conversation.
Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, said Trump had observed Iranians’ “indescribable bravery”. “Do not abandon the streets,” Pahlavi, who is based in the US, wrote on X.
Netanyahu, speaking during a cabinet meeting, said Israel was closely monitoring developments. “We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be freed from the yoke of tyranny,” he said.
Pakistan embassy in Tehran establishes crisis cell
The Pakistan embassy in Tehran has established a crisis management unit to facilitate its citizens, Pakistan’s envoy to Iran Mudassir Tipu said on X.

World number three Orfi was up against Malaysia’s Sivasangari Subramaniam, who she demolished 3-0 to take an expected victory with a scoreline of 11-8, 11-2, 11-7.
“The final is never an easy match,” the 18-year-old said after her 38-minute match that saw her win her fourth title of the season.
“Me and Siva have played several times this season, I know how dangerous she is; I just have to prepare in this sport very well.
“Thanks to the fans for supporting us, they’ve built the atmosphere and it made me happy to see the crowd here today cheering for both of us,” Orfi said.

Her compatriots stayed true to saving the best for last as Zakaria and Aly Abou Eleinen put on a show for the crowd in a dazzling 100-minute match.
The first game saw Eleinen prevail 11-9 after a series of minutes-long rallies that saw the two slipping on their own sweat.
Zakaria was trailing Eleinen 7-3 in the second game but finally found his rhythm and won 11-9 against his 26-year-old opponent, despite a break in play for a cut on his knee to be attended to by courtside medics.
Victory belonged to Zakaria in the third game as well – or so he thought. He had removed his protective eyewear and exited the court but Eleinen had already called for a player review that proved inconclusive. The two were neck-and-neck in the lengthy game that lasted 27 minutes before Eleinen switched gears and won 14-12 in a brutal, high-quality rally that delighted the crowd on Sunday evening.
Both players seemed tired by the time the fourth game rolled around, but Zakaria took the game 11-7 to level the score 2-2.
Eleinen was cramping up in the fifth game that saw Zakaria pull ahead, but not before hitting three costly errors. He nevertheless finished strong to seal his victory 11-7, not once, but twice. Another player review from Eleinen at the final point saw the referee shushing the crowd that cheered for Zakaria’s championship win.
The seconds ticked by, Zakaria had already dropped his racket and glasses to the floor and was waiting for a verdict when the referee upheld his decision that saw Zakaria win the biggest title of his career so far.
“I made it to the fifth game and I wasn’t tired, so I’m most impressed with my physical side this time because I’ve worked really hard on it,” Zakaria said after the match.
“I just won my first gold level event at 18 so I’m over the moon,” the ginger-haired teenager said to applause from the crowd.
“I grew up playing with Aly in Alexandria, so this was a proud moment for us to be playing a major final together,” Zakaria said.
Speaking to Dawn after the final, Eleinen echoed the same sentiment of Zakaria, “who I consider my younger brother.
“I’m eight years older but we grew up together and it’s amazing to see him doing so well,” Eleinen said of the teenager, who achieved his career-best ranking of 11 just last month.
“We always dreamed of playing major finals together, and today is hopefully a good step towards more battles that people can enjoy, and I’m sure people back home are proud of us.”</p><small>2026-01-11 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644518-72-students-leave-for-pakistan-amid-protests-in-iran-confirms-envoy' target='_blank'><strong>72 Pakistani students head home as protests rage in Iran, confirms envoy</strong></a><br><p>

The tech companies have countered that the package of 83 security standards, which would also include a requirement to alert the government to major software updates, lacks any global precedent and risks revealing proprietary details, according to four people familiar with the discussions and a Reuters review of confidential government and industry documents.
The plan is part of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to boost the security of user data as online fraud and data breaches increase in the world’s second-largest smartphone market, with nearly 750 million phones.

 

IT Secretary S. Krishnan told Reuters that “any legitimate concerns of the industry will be addressed with an open mind”, adding it was “premature to read more into it”.
A ministry spokesperson said it could not comment further due to ongoing consultation with tech companies on the proposals.
Ongoing tug of war over govt requirements
Apple, South Korea’s Samsung, Google, China’s Xiaomi and MAIT, the Indian industry group that represents the firms, did not respond to requests for comment.
Indian government requirements have irked technology firms before.
Last month, it revoked an order mandating a state-run cyber safety app on phones amid concerns over surveillance. But the government brushed aside lobbying last year and required rigorous testing for security cameras over fears of Chinese spying.
Xiaomi and Samsung — whose phones use Google’s Android operating system — hold 19 and 15 per cent, respectively, of India’s market share and Apple 5pc, Counterpoint Research estimates.
Among the most sensitive requirements in the new Indian Telecom Security Assurance Requirements is access to source code — the underlying programming instructions that make phones work. This would be analysed and possibly tested at designated Indian labs, the documents show.
The Indian proposals also require companies to make software changes to allow pre-installed apps to be uninstalled and to block apps from using cameras and microphones in the background to “avoid malicious usage”.
“Industry raised concerns that globally security requirement have not been mandated by any country,” said a December IT ministry document detailing meetings that officials held with Apple, Samsung, Google and Xiaomi.
The security standards, drafted in 2023, are in the spotlight now as the government is considering imposing them legally. IT ministry and tech executives are due to meet on Tuesday for more discussions, sources said.
Companies say source code review, analysis ‘not possible’
Smartphone makers closely guard their source code. Apple declined China’s request for source code between 2014 and 2016, and US law enforcement has also tried and failed to get it.
India’s proposals for “vulnerability analysis” and “source code review” would require smartphone makers to perform a “complete security assessment”, after which test labs in India could check their claims through source code review and analysis.
“This is not possible … due to secrecy and privacy,” MAIT said in a confidential document drafted in response to the government proposal, and seen by Reuters.
“Major countries in the EU, North America, Australia and Africa do not mandate these requirements.”

 

MAIT asked the ministry last week to drop the proposal, a source with direct knowledge said.
The Indian proposals would mandate automatic and periodic malware scanning on phones.
Device makers would also have to inform the National Centre for Communication Security about major software updates and security patches before releasing them to users, and the centre would have the right to test them.
MAIT’s document says regular malware scanning significantly drains a phone’s battery and seeking government approval for software updates is “impractical” as they need to be issued promptly.
India also wants the phone’s logs — digital records of its system activity — to be stored for at least 12 months on the device.
“There is not enough room on device [sic] to store one-year log events,” MAIT said in the document.</p><small>2026-01-11 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644500-punjab-forensic-lab-confirms-kp-cm-pti-leaders-in-may-9-visuals' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab forensic lab confirms KP CM, PTI leaders in May 9 visuals</strong></a><br><p>

There have been no signs of Russian or Chinese ships or submarines around Greenland in recent years, the FT said, citing two senior Nordic diplomats with access to NATO intelligence briefings.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The White House and NATO did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
It is simply not true that the Chinese and Russians are there. I have seen the intelligence. There are no ships, no submarines, the FT quoted one senior diplomat as saying.
Another Nordic diplomat said claims that waters around Greenland were crawling with Russian and Chinese vessels were unfounded, adding that such activity was on the Russian side of the Arctic.Trump has repeatedly said Russian and Chinese vessels are operating near Greenland, a claim Denmark disputes. He has not provided evidence to support it.Trump said on Friday the US must own Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and mineral-rich territory.“The image that’s being painted of Russian and Chinese ships right inside the Nuuk fjord and massive Chinese investments being made is not correct,” Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said earlier this week.Vessel tracking data from MarineTraffic and LSEG show no Chinese or Russian ship presence near Greenland.Greenland’s assembly said late on Friday it would bring forward a meeting to discuss its response to US threats to take control of the island.Trump’s renewed push for Greenland, after US military intervention in Venezuela, worries many of the island’s 57,000 inhabitants, whose widely held goal is to eventually become an independent nation.</p><small>2026-01-11 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/11105801cffbac2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966362/israels-recognition-of-somaliland-an-act-of-political-aggression-says-dar-at-oic-moot' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s recognition of ‘Somaliland’ an act of ‘political aggression’, says Dar at OIC moot</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Sunday that Pakistan believed the recognition of the so-called “Somaliland” as an independent state by Israel was an act of “political aggression that sets a perilous precedent, threatening peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea region, and beyond”.
Dar said this while addressing the extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers in Saudi Arabia.
His statement follows a joint statement by the OIC, which initiated its 22nd extraordinary session in Jeddah on Saturday. The moot has been convened against the backdrop of Israel recognising Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, with Soma­liland’s president, Abdira­hman Mohamed Abdul­lahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
Later, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”.
Dar expressed Pakistan’s “unwavering support for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia” in his address today.
“We strongly condemn the illegal and unlawful recognition by Israel of the Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia and the subsequent unwarranted and highly provocative visit of its foreign minister to Somaliland,” he said.
He added that Pakistan also voiced its firm support for Somalia and condemned Israel’s actions during the UN Security Council’s briefing on the issue.
“We identify this development as a direct assault on Somalia’s internationally recognised borders, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law,” Dar said.
“The principle of state sovereignty and territorial integrity constitutes a peremptory norm of international law from which no deviation or derogation is permitted.”
Dar called the internationally-recognised borders of Somalia “sacrosanct and inviolable” and said that the Somaliland region remained an “integral, inseparable and inalienable part of Somalia”.
“No external actor has either the legal standing or the moral authority to alter that fundamental reality,” he said. “Any act, statement or recognition thereof by a state or an external entity regarding any part of the Federal Republic of Somalia should therefore be considered null and void, producing no political or legal effects.”
He added, “We believe that such recognition of an integral part of a sovereign state is not a diplomatic act, but an act of political aggression that sets a perilous precedent, threatening peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea region, and beyond.”
The foreign minister added that Pakistan joined the group of OIC countries in “unequivocally rejecting the unlawful Israeli move” through the joint statement released in the immediate aftermath of the supposed Israeli recognition of Somaliland.
The joint statement termed the recognition of “parts of states” a violation of the cardinal principles of international law and the UN Charter and noted the Israeli action’s potential “serious repercussions” for the Horn of Africa region, the Red Sea region and for international security as a whole, he said.
“The OIC and the wider international community’s firm rejection of this unlawful overture by Israel is, therefore, vital so that the impudent Israeli act does not set a precedent for other countries,” Dar added.
He said that the developments in the region were “particularly alarming at a time when Somalia is demonstrating encouraging and tangible progress on its political and institutional trajectory”, pointing out that the Federal Republic of Somalia had made notable strides in national reconciliation, constitutional reform and the revitalisation of state institutions.
“Positive trends in the financial sector, particularly the efforts related to economic legislation and the move towards an inclusive one-person-one-vote election, represent important steps towards consolidating Somalian democracy and stability,” he added.
“These gains reflect a Somali-owned and Somali-led path towards political reconciliation and cooperation,” he said.
“This positive momentum must be protected and reinforced, not sabotaged and undermined by actions that risk fragmenting the country and reversing hard-earned progress across the entire milieu of national indicators.”
In addition, he said that Pakistan also recognised the sacrifices and resilience of the Somali people and its security forces in thwarting the consistent threat posed by Al-Shabab and its affiliates.
“Israel’s brazen recklessness undermines regional and international efforts aimed at combating terrorism in a region beset with this challenge.
“It also opens the door to the creation of fragile environments susceptible to infiltration and exploitation by extremist groups, thereby negatively impacting regional and global security,” the foreign minister said, adding that in this context, continued support for Somalia’s security and stabilisation efforts remained “indispensable”.
“At this pivotal juncture, when Somalia is focused on defeating extremism, any action that deflects attention, weakens cohesion or fuels division is profoundly irresponsible,” Dar said.
He said that Pakistan fully aligned itself with the OIC’s call “for all states and organisations to refrain from any form of formal, semi-formal, or informal engagement with the authorities of Somaliland”, and to ensure that any engagement strictly respected the sovereignty and unity of Somalia.
“Pakistan categorically rejects any proposal or plan aimed at the forced displacement of Palestinians and linkages of Somaliland region of Federal Republic of Somalia with any such illegal action,” he added.
“Any action that advocates or implies the displacement or relocation of Palestinians not only violates international law but also undermines the prospect of a just and lasting peace in the region.”
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast support for the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for self-determination, saying that the only path to lasting peace and stability lay in the realisation of an “independent, contiguous and sovereign” state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders and with Al-Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
Dar added that as a “frontline supporter” of the UNSCR 2803 and the “Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict”, Pakistan reiterated the intention to contribute to its successful implementation thereof, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the ceasefire, bringing an end to the conflict in Gaza, to secure a “dignified life” for the Palestinian people who had endured prolonged humanitarian suffering, and leading to a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.
“As a non-permanent member of the UNSC, Pakistan will continue to work with the OIC and Arab partners to mobilise global support for the Palestinian right to self-determination, justice and peace,” he said.
On the topic of India-occupied Kashmir, the foreign minister said that the unresolved dispute remained the “primary source of conflict in South Asia and a nuclear flash point”.
He stressed the urgent need for renewed and concerted efforts under the UN auspices to secure a “just, lasting, and peaceful resolution of the dispute“, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
Dar also appreciated the “strong, unwavering and consistent support that the OIC has always afforded to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters”. Nevertheless, he urged the OIC to step up its efforts to support a just resolution of the dispute.
Dar called upon the OIC and the broader international community to “speak with one voice” and firmly reject all actions that undermined Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
“This meeting today is a resounding manifestation of our collective solidarity with Somalia against a blatant transgression of its sovereignty by a decidedly unconscientious actor,” he said.
“On our part, Pakistan remains resolutely committed to standing with the government and people of Somalia as the country continues its advances towards continued peace and progress.”</p><small>2026-01-11 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644476-pti-workers-face-arrests-amid-police-crackdown-ahead-of-bagh-e-jinnah-power-show' target='_blank'><strong>At Karachi rally, KP CM vows to expand PTI street movement nationwide</strong></a><br><p>
