The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges, adding that it could be “self-choreographed”.
“We believe that what has happened is to divert attention — I am talking of Pahalgam — from India’s internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,” Dar said.
“Don’t forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,” he added, referring to the upcoming polls in Bihar in October.
“This brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India’s borders,” the deputy PM warned, calling India’s actions “unilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative”.
He noted: “There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern — level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.”
In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be “sacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains”.
“This is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,” the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace: “We will support all efforts towards de-escalation.”
“Analysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,” echoing Pakistani leaders’ previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a “false flag operation”.
 


“How can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? […] Come on. Nobody’s a fool,” Dar quipped.
“International dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them — great friends — suggested to me, ‘Can you try and help the perpetrators be caught?’ I said ‘come on, do you know the distance where it happened and where’s the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.”
“I cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties’ dictionary. The word suspension is there.”
China reaffirms ‘time-tested friendship’ with Pakistan
Earlier today, China reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India as President Asif Ali Zardari met with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong.

During today’s meeting at Aiwan-i-Sadr, Zardari expressed concern over the recent “irresponsible and aggressive rhetoric by the Indian government”, saying that such actions threaten regional peace and stability.
The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the “enduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan”, describing the relationship as one of “ironclad brothers” who have always supported each other in challenging times.
He thanked Zardari for sharing Pakistan’s perspective, and emphasised that China would always support its ally to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.
 
 

Zaradari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its “consistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times”.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked China’s envoy for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack.
Last week, China had urged both India and Pakistan to “exercise restraint” as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).
As Pakistan continues diplomatic engagement with various countries to brief them on the ongoing situation, PM Shehbaz yesterday spoke to his Malaysian counterpart, while Dar spoke to the foreign ministers of Malaysia and Russia.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has also arrived in Islamabad, and is expected to visit India later in the week to de-escalate the situation.
Info minister visits LoC, debunks claims of ‘terrorist hideouts’
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar visited the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir with local and foreign media and dismissed India’s allegations of “terrorist hideouts” there, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.

The visit facilitated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was aimed at exposing the “false and baseless Indian propaganda”, the report said, pointing out that media representatives were taken to specific locations that India had allegedly “labelled as terrorist hideouts”.
“By witnessing the ground situation, hearing from the local population, and observing the environment firsthand, the media got the opportunity to assess the truth behind India’s claims,” Radio Pakistan noted.
Speaking on the occasion, Tarar said: “India is now claiming the presence of training camps in Bela Noor Shah, which is near Pir Chinasi, and that they were used in the Pahalgam attack.
“This area is 26 kilometres away from the LoC and the purpose of coming here is to show that Indian propaganda is false, fake, and concocted,” he added.
“India’s narrative has failed miserably, and the international media has not picked it up. There are contradictions in India’s response and they are not able to provide evidence,” the minister said.
He asserted: “There are no terrorist camps here. There are beautiful mountains and people [only].”
 
 

“Don’t resort to any misadventure,” Tarar warned, adding that Pakistan would give a befitting response to any Indian aggression and would go to any extent to defend its sovereignty.
Echoing Deputy PM Dar’s statements, Tarar said India uses propaganda to “hide its internal failures”.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Army responded to unprovoked firing by the Indian army along the Line of Control (LoC) overnight, state broadcaster PTV News reported.
According to security sources, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked firing on multiple Pakistani military posts in Nakyal, Khuiratta, Sharda, Kel, Neelum and Haji Pir sectors along the LoC.
The action was responded to in a befitting manner by the Pakistan Army, PTV News added. It quoted security sources as saying that the armed forces were “fully alert”.
 


Pakistan to brief UNSC on latest regional developments
A day ago, Islamabad decided to seek an immediate session of the United Nations Security Council to apprise world powers about the recent tensions with India.
In a statement, the Foreign Office said FM Dar has issued directions to Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.
The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar said Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India’s aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.
“This important diplomatic move is part of Pakistan’s efforts to present true facts before the international community,” the statement said, adding that Pakistan decided to formally brief the UNSC on the latest situation in the region, as well as India’s aggressive steps and provocative statements.
It said Pakistan would specifically highlight the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India.</p><small>2025-05-05 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/05141231c9eb281.jpg?r=141236' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908601/sbp-cuts-interest-rate-by-100bps-to-11pc' target='_blank'><strong>SBP cuts interest rate by 100bps to 11pc</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announced on Monday that it has decided to cut the policy rate to 11 per cent, amid trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.
The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in six intervals, previously stood at 12pc.
April inflation stood at a low of 0.3pc, largely due to a high base a year ago. The reduction is also primarily attributed to lower prices of key food staples such as wheat and its derivatives, onions, potatoes and certain pulses, as well as a cut in electricity and fuel charges. These items carry significant weight in the inflation basket — the Consumer Price Index (CPI) — meaning minor price changes can heavily influence the overall rate.
According to a notification issued by the SBP today, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to cut the interest rate, noting that inflation in April turned out to be lower than expected, mainly due to a drop in prices of perishable food items and electricity and fuel charges.
Earlier, it noted that despite a long-term decline in inflation and real interest rates above 11pc, opinions on the central bank’s likely decision on the policy rate were divided, with trade and industry sectors advocating for a significant cut.
Researchers had conducted polls to gauge market sentiment, but the 0.3pc inflation in April has caused division among those who were confident there would be no change in the interest rate.
However, many experts believed the SBP would cut the rate by 50bps. Some have also found reasons for a likely status quo as they feel the war-like situation between India and Pakistan has created uncertainty that may escalate prices.
This situation may force the central bank to adopt a cautious approach in the face of sudden shocks of higher inflation.
The SBP’s MPC met today to set the key interest rate for the next two months. In March, the central bank delivered a surprise by leaving its policy rate unchanged in the last review, disappointing the business community.</p><small>2025-05-05 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0514263823197ca.jpg?r=142854' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908603/india-starts-work-on-hydro-projects-after-suspending-treaty-with-pakistan-say-sources' target='_blank'><strong>India starts work on hydro projects after suspending treaty with Pakistan, say sources</strong></a><br><p>India has begun work to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects in the India-occupied Kashmir, sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, after fresh escalation with Pakistan led it to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty.
Tensions between the two countries have spiked following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, marking one of the deadliest assaults in the region since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan vehemently rejected the allegation and called for a neutral probe.
A “reservoir flushing” process to remove sediment began on Thursday, carried out by India’s biggest hydropower company, the state-run NHPC and authorities in the India-occupied Kashmir, the three sources said, according to Reuters.
They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media.
The work may not immediately threaten supply to Pakistan, which depends on rivers flowing through India for much of its irrigation and hydropower, but it could eventually be affected if other projects launch similar efforts.
There are more than half a dozen such projects in the region.
India did not inform Pakistan about the work at the Salal and Baglihar projects, which is being done for the first time since they were built in 1987 and 2008-2009, respectively, as the treaty had blocked such work, the sources added.
India’s NHPC and the neighbouring governments did not reply to emails from Reuters to seek comment.
The flushing operation ran for three days from May 1, the sources said.
“This is the first time such an exercise has taken place and will help in more efficient power generation and prevent damage to turbines,” one of the sources told Reuters.
“We were also asked to open the adjustable gates for cleaning, which we did from May 1,” the source said, adding that the effort aimed to free the dam operation from any restrictions.
People living on the banks of the Chenab river in the India-occupied Kashmir said they noticed water had been released from both Salal and Baglihar dams from Thursday to Saturday.
Separately, Press Trust of India posted a video on its X account reporting that India has restricted the flow of water through the Balighar dam on the Chenab River.
 






‘Suspension of treaty means free will’
The flushing of hydropower projects requires nearly emptying a reservoir to force out sediments whose build-up is a major cause of decline in output.
For example, two of the sources said that power delivered by the 690-megawatt Salal project was far below its capacity, because Pakistan had prevented such flushing, while silting also hit output at the 900-MW Baglihar project.
“Flushing is not a common thing because it leads to a lot of water wastage,” said one of the sources. “Downstream countries are expected to be informed in case it leads to any inundation.”
Building both projects had required extensive back and forth with Pakistan, which worries about losing out on its share of water.
Under the 1960 treaty, which split the Indus and its tributaries between the neighbours, India had also shared data such as hydrological flows at various spots on the rivers flowing through India and issued flood warnings.
India’s water minister has vowed to “ensure no drop of the Indus river’s water reaches Pakistan”.
Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately. The treaty has allowed it only to build hydropower plants without significant storage dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.
The suspension means India “can now pursue our projects at free will”, said Kushvinder Vohra, a recently retired head of India’s Central Water Commission who worked on Indus disputes with Pakistan.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has sought to renegotiate the treaty in recent years, and the two countries have tried to settle some of their differences at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague.
These concerns relate to the size of the water storage area at the region’s Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric plants.</p><small>2025-05-05 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/05144648b3eb2d1.jpg?r=144651' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908608/escalating-tensions-with-india-to-impact-pakistans-economic-growth-moodys' target='_blank'><strong>Escalating tensions with India to impact Pakistan’s economic growth: Moody’s</strong></a><br><p>Global rating agency Moody’s on Monday said that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan would weigh on Pakistan’s economic growth.
An attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
In a note, the rating agency stated: “Sustained escalation in tensions with India would likely weigh on Pakistan’s growth and hamper the government’s ongoing fiscal consolidation, setting back Pakistan’s progress in achieving macroeconomic stability.”
 
 

On Pakistan’s economic trajectory, it said that its macroeconomic indicators had been improving, with growth gradually rising, inflationary pressure easing and foreign exchange reserves increasing amid “continued progress” in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.
However, the agency noted that “a persistent increase in tensions could also impair Pakistan’s access to external financing and pressure its foreign exchange reserves, which remain well below what is required to meet its external debt payment needs for the next few years”.
“India and Pakistan’s diplomatic relations have deteriorated,” the agency said, recalling Information Minister Attaullah Tarar’s statement that Pakistan expected a military action by India.
Notably, the agency warned that India’s suspension of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty could “severely reduce Pakistan’s water supply”.
In comparison, Moody’s said that the macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable, propelled by “moderating but still high levels of growth amid strong public investment and healthy private consumption”.
“In a scenario of sustained escalation in localised tensions, we do not expect major disruptions to India’s economic activity because it has minimal economic relations with Pakistan,” it said, adding that the country accounted for less than 0.5 per cent of India’s total exports in 2024.
 
 

However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact on India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.
“Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses,” it said.
It predicted that flare-ups “will occur periodically” as they have throughout the neighbouring countries’ post-independence history. However, they will not lead to an “outright, broad-based military conflict”, it added.</p><small>2025-05-05 10:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603221-sindh-to-impose-ban-on-plastic-bags-from-june-15' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh to impose ban on plastic bags from June 15</strong></a><br><p>

The test launch comes amid heightened tensions between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi’s aggressive measures in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,” the ISPR statement read.
 






The training launch was witnessed by senior officers of the army , as well as officers, scientists and engineers from Pakistan’s strategic organisations, the military’s media wing said.
The chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and the army chief congratulated the participating troops, scientists, and engineers.
“They expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of [the] Pakistan Army to thwart any aggression against the territorial integrity of Pakistan,” the ISPR added.
President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated scientists and engineers, as well as the nation, on the successful test of the Fatah missile, according to a post on X by the PPP.
“The president appreciated the efforts of the security forces, scientists and engineers to strengthen the country’s defense.
“[He] reiterated national commitment to ensure national security and defence.”
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the efforts of the chairman joint chiefs of staff, the army chief, and the scientists and engineers involved in preparation for the launch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office.
“The success of the training launch clearly shows that Pakistan’s defence is in strong hands.
“The prime minister expressed satisfaction over the professional capabilities of the Pakistan Army and its full preparedness for national defense,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the ISPR said that Pakistan had conducted a successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450km.
In May last year, the army conducted a test-launch of Fatah-II guided rocket system which had a range of 400 kilometres.
The guidance system makes this rocket a precision weapon enhancing its lethality and efficacy, while the trajectory mode and terminal guidance technology enables it to evade the enemy’s anti-ballistic missile systems.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. Pakistan witnessed shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) in AJK for a week since April 25, with the Pakistan Army responding to unprovoked Indian firing.
 
 

A day ago, ISPR Director General Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar briefed members of political parties on national security during an in-camera session in Islamabad.
“If aggression is imposed on Pakistan, then the forces are ready to give a befitting reply to the enemy,” PTV News quoted the DG ISPR as saying.
It added that during the in-camera session, the information minister also informed the political leaders about the government’s diplomatic measures and the country’s stance.</p><small>2025-05-05 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/051351220fc5570.png?r=135837' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908598/poliovirus-detected-in-sewage-samples-from-18-districts-across-country' target='_blank'><strong>Poliovirus detected in sewage samples from 18 districts across country</strong></a><br><p>Environmental samples collected from 18 districts across the country have been found positive for poliovirus, the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) said on Monday.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
“[A total of] 38 environmental [sewage] samples collected from 31 districts between April 7 and April 17 were tested at the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad,” the statement from the NEOC said.
“The lab confirmed detection of wild poliovirus type 1 in sewage samples of Loralai, Quetta, Zhob, Islamabad, Abbottabad, Bannu, DI Khan, Peshawar, Tank, North Waziristan, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Badin, Jamshoro, Hyderabad, Kashmore, Karachi, and Sukkur,” it added.
⁠Whereas samples collected from Noshki, Sibi, Islamabad, Charsadda, Lower Dir, Mansehra, Swat, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Rajanpur tested negative with no poliovirus detected, according to the NEOC.
“The Polio Programme is implementing a rigorous vaccination schedule to protect children from paralytic polio and interrupt virus transmission. Thanks to high-quality campaigns since September 2024, polio cases nationwide have declined,” the statement continued.
It added that the second nationwide polio vaccination campaign of 2025 was successfully conducted across the country from April 21 to 27, “achieving the target of vaccinating 45.4 million children under the age of five”.
“This remarkable milestone was made possible through the collective efforts of frontline polio workers, the Government of Pakistan, law enforcement agencies, health officials, and, most importantly, the commitment of parents who ensured their children received the vaccine.”
The next nationwide campaign is scheduled from May 26 to June 1, aiming to vaccinate 45.4 million children under the age of five across the country.
The statement urged all parents to vaccinate their children against polio every time the vaccine is offered, adding, “repeated vaccination strengthens children’s immunity and protects them from the crippling poliovirus”.
It added that it is the prime responsibility of parents and community members to ensure that no child in their homes or neighbourhoods is left unvaccinated. Every missed child is at risk and can contribute to the continued spread of the poliovirus. Protecting children from polio is a shared duty and starts with timely vaccination.
In a separate development, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Emergency Operations Centre has enhanced the coverage of vaccination from 93 per cent in February’s polio campaign to 98 per cent in April in province, according to data.
Late last month, over 800,000 children were vaccinated during the week-long anti-polio drive that ended in Rawalpindi district on April 27, health officials had said.</p><small>2025-05-05 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/05134630765c53a.jpg?r=140221' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908599/boxing-champion-usman-wazeer-lauded-by-sindh-cm-for-victory-over-indian-opponent' target='_blank'><strong>Boxing champion Usman Wazeer lauded by Sindh CM for victory over Indian opponent</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Monday met with boxing champion Usman Wazeer to congratulate him on his recent victory over an Indian opponent at an international tournament in Bangkok.
The meeting took place at the CM House and was also attended by Sindh Sports Minister Mohammad Bux Khan Mahar, MPA Asif Musa, and Secretary to the CM Rahim Shaikh.
Wazeer had scored a knockout against India’s S. Eswaran in the first round.
Murad described the victory as “Pakistan’s first major sporting achievement during India’s war hysteria”. He praised Wazeer’s accomplishment as a moment of national pride, announcing the provincial government’s full support.
He revealed plans to send Wazeer for competing in the World Open Championship, stating that participation at that level would significantly enhance his international ranking.
He further announced financial assistance and access to modern training facilities for the boxer.
The chief minister also directed the sports minister to provide him with the best training, according to state-run PTV News.
In a symbolic gesture, Wazeer presented his winning boxing gloves to the CM as a gift.
“I am truly proud of your hard work and victory.

Sudan has dragged the UAE before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, arguing it is supplying weapons to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been battling the Sudanese army since 2023.
The UAE denies supporting the rebels and has dismissed Sudan’s case as “political theatre” distracting from efforts to end a war that has killed tens of thousands.
Since April 2023, Sudan has been torn apart by a power struggle between army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo.
The war has triggered what aid agencies describe as the world’s largest displacement and hunger crises. Famine has officially hit five areas across Sudan, according to a UN-backed assessment.
The North Darfur region has been a particular battleground, with at least 542 civilians killed in the past three weeks, according to the United Nations.
A world away from the horrors on the ground, lawyers in robes and wigs thrashed out legal arguments in hearings last month in the panelled splendour of the ICJ’s Peace Palace.
Muawia Osman, Sudan’s acting justice minister, told the court, “[The] ongoing genocide would not be possible without UAE complicity, including the shipment of arms to the RSF.”
“The direct logistical and other support that the UAE has provided and continues to provide to the RSF has been and continues to be the primary driving force behind the genocide now taking place, including killing, rape, forced displacement and looting,” he added.
Responding for the UAE, top foreign ministry official Reem Ketait said Sudan’s allegations were “at best misleading and at worst pure fabrications”.
“This case is the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE,” added Ketait.
Full reparations
In the end, legal experts say Sudan’s case may flounder on technical jurisdictional issues.
When the UAE signed up for the UN’s Genocide Convention in 2005, it entered a “reservation” to a key clause that allows countries to sue others at the ICJ over disputes.
“There is clearly no basis for the court’s jurisdiction in this case,” the UAE’s Ketait told the judges.
The UAE called for the case to be thrown out and removed from the court’s list.
Sudan argued the UAE’s reservation was “incompatible” with the purpose of the Genocide Convention, which emphasises global collective responsibility to prevent the world’s worst crimes.
Khartoum wants ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war.
The rulings of the ICJ, which hears disputes between states, are final and binding, but the court has no means to ensure compliance.
Judges ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine to no avail, for example, and ruled that Israel’s 57-year occupation of Palestinian land was illegal.</p><small>2025-05-05 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603204-pti-stands-united-with-army-against-indian-aggression' target='_blank'><strong>PTI stands united with army against Indian aggression</strong></a><br><p>

She congratulated the minister of education on the enrollment of 1.1 million out-of-school children under the Punjab Education Foundation, says a handout.
The CM directed School Management Councils to provide necessary facilities in schools worth Rs 10 billion within 90 days. She also directed them to build required classrooms in all schools within a year, and said, “Repair 580 most dilapidated and 2,770 precarious school buildings.” She added the construction and repair of schools is among our top priorities.

She set a target of spoken English training of 500,000 children of government schools from English trainers. She directed the relevant authorities to expand the scope of school meal programme to other districts and tehsils keeping in view the number of children suffering from malnutrition there. She also directed them to build Nawaz Sharif School of Eminence for girls and boys in every district, and set a target of upgrade of 1,750 schools in five years.
She was told the upgrade of 250 schools will be done in the next financial year, and 300 Tech-Ed schools will be built in 10 tehsils of Punjab.
MINISTER: Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari strongly condemned Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s decision to boycott the national security briefing, calling it a clear demonstration of their anti-state mentality.

This development has brought relief to cotton ginners are grappling with a prolonged period of low demand and declining prices.
The recent slump in local cotton prices was primarily due to record imports of sales tax-free cotton, cotton yarn and grey cloth under the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS). This influx of imported material severely hampered local cotton sales, pushing numerous ginning factories and textile mills towards inactivity due to a severe financial crunch.
However, the tide seems to have turned in the past week. Reports of restored trade relations between China and the United States, coupled with a sharp decline in the US Dollar Index, triggered a substantial surge in cotton prices in international markets. Notably, the New York Cotton Exchange saw its July futures contract jump by a record 2.75 cents per pound in a single day, reaching a multi-month high of 68.41 cents per pound.
The upward trend is expected to continue this week, subsequently impacting domestic prices.
In Pakistan, this global rally has translated into a price increase of approximately Rs500 per maund (40kg), bringing the current cotton price to around Rs17,500 per maund. The renewed buying interest from textile mills has instilled a sense of optimism among cotton ginners.
Meanwhile, despite a consistent failure to achieve cotton cultivation and production targets in recent years, the Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA) has, once again, set an ambitious and seemingly unattainable production target of 10.18 million bales for the Cotton Year 2025-26. For the first time, however, the FCA has not yet specified the production targets for individual provinces.

Big-name multinationals, right down to niche e-commerce players last week cut sales targets, warned of job cuts and reviewed their business plans, while major economies revised down growth prospects amid bleak data read-outs.
While financial markets are betting that US and China will pull back from an all-out trade war and that Trump will cut deals to avert higher tariffs on others, the sheer uncertainty of where this ends has become a major drag factor in itself.
“US tariff policy is a serious negative shock for the world in the near term,” said Isabelle Mateos y Lago, group chief economist at French bank BNP Paribas.
 
 

“The US tariffs end-game may be further away and at a higher level than previously thought,” she said of blanket US tariffs currently set at a baseline of 10 per cent alongside higher, sector-specific charges on products such as steel, aluminium and autos.
Beijing said on Friday it was evaluating an offer from Washington to hold talks over 145pc US tariffs, to which it has responded with 125pc levies. Trump’s administration has also suggested it is close to deals with countries including India, South Korea and Japan to avert more tariffs in weeks to come.
In the meantime, companies such as Swedish appliances maker Electrolux  slashed its outlook while Volvo Cars, computer gadget maker Logitech and drinks giant Diageo abandoned their targets on the uncertainty.
Last week’s removal of the “de minimis” duty-free treatment of e-commerce packages worth less than $800 for products from China is a hammer-blow for many smaller players.
“We’re going from zero to 145pc, which is really untenable for companies and untenable for customers,” said Cindy Allen, CEO of Trade Force Multiplier, a global trade consultancy.
“I’ve seen a lot of small to medium-sized businesses just choose to exit the market altogether.”
Silver lining
The tariff outlook prompted the Bank of Japan to cut its growth forecasts last week, while trade tensions were cited by forecasters in growth outlook downgrades for the Netherlands and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.
While the official measures of activity in top economies are still catching up with the downbeat mood, it is surfacing in the closely-watched surveys of purchasing managers at factories around the world.
China’s factory activity contracted at the fastest pace in 16 months in April, one such survey showed last week, while a similar UK readout showed British factory exports last month shrinking at their sharpest pace in almost five years.
Economists were quick to caution that a stronger-looking read-out from export-focused Germany might largely be due to factories front-loading business to get it out of the door before the tariffs took effect.
“[This] means that there might be a backlash in the coming months,” warned Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank AG.
However, while front-loading may also have helped India to a 10-month high in manufacturing growth in April, analysts noted the country — which faces lower tariffs than China and towards which Apple has shifted some output — could end up a genuine winner.
“India is well positioned to be an alternative to China as a supplier of goods to the US in the immediate term,” emerging markets economist Shilan Shah at Capital Economics said, predicting punitive tariffs on China were “here to stay”.
For now, most economists are calling the Trump tariff gambit a “demand shock” to the world economy, which by making imports more expensive for American businesses and consumers, will sap activity elsewhere.
The silver lining could be that this reduces inflationary pressures and so will give central banks elsewhere greater scope to boost the economy with interest rate cuts — something the Bank of England is seen taking advantage of this week.

But what is yet to play out is whether Trump’s bid to re-balance the trading system in America’s favour finally prompts others to revamp their own economies: for example, if China moves to raise stimulus for its domestic economy, or euro zone countries remove the barriers that still hold back their single market.</p><small>2025-05-05 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603200-modis-war-rhetoric-threatens-mental-wellbeing-of-millions-say-experts' target='_blank'><strong>Modi's war rhetoric threatens mental wellbeing of millions, say experts</strong></a><br><p>

Per the ADB’s latest ‘At a Glance’ report (2023), 17 per cent of the Bank’s total lending and investments globally are directed toward the energy sector, underscoring its significant role in financing power generation and infrastructure — including fossil fuel projects in countries like Pakistan.
The NGO Forum on ADB estimates that the Bank has invested $15.28 billion in 74 energy projects in Pakistan, and its focus on conventional energy over renewables raises concerns. While 50.5pc of the funds were earmarked for modernising the national grid, 17pc support conventional energy expansion (1,330 MW). Meanwhile, renewable projects receive minimal funding. Wind and solar allocations remain unspecified.
Simply put, the ADB’s continued investment in fossil fuels contradicts its sustainability commitments, potentially undermining Pakistan’s energy security and environmental goals. Fossil fuel financing also impacts air quality, with rising levels of particulate matter (PM 2.5), tropospheric ozone and nitrous oxide, disproportionately burdening the country with public health crises, environmental degradation and economic loss.
 
 

Policy and practice
The ADB’s 58th annual meeting presents a critical opportunity to address air pollution — a pressing global crisis that remains conspicuously absent from the meeting’s core agenda. While the health and environmental impacts of unchecked emissions are profoundly damaging, the meeting has yet to commit to concrete measures that reduce the pollution footprint of ADB-funded projects or advance technological solutions.
This year’s meeting includes constructive engagement with civil society organisations (CSOs) and affected communities. However, this dialogue must translate into meaningful action.
Air pollution is affecting every corner of the planet, harming biodiversity, undermining public health, and jeopardising the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal. And while the ADB claims its safeguards mitigate environmental harms, there is a significant gap between policy and practice. The Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) aims for standardised climate accountability, yet international financing institutions (IFIs) such as the ADB fall short in aligning their Environmental and Social Framework (ESF) and Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) with these standards.
Where the ETF requires detailed emissions reporting, IFIs like ADB often hide project-level GHG impacts, particularly from coal and gas projects. For instance, ADB-funded coal plants in Pakistan report only aggregated emissions, obscuring local health and ecological damage. Moreover, the Paris Agreement’s focus on CO2 neglects Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs) such as methane and black carbon, which account for around 45pc of global warming and are common in ADB’s fossil fuel investments.
The ADB, a 69-member multilateral lender, has long positioned itself as a ‘Climate Bank’ and champion of sustainable development through its Environmental and Social Framework. However, the ESF’s non-binding enforcement mechanisms have led to inconsistent adherence to safeguards on displacement, pollution, and indigenous rights — limiting its effectiveness in advancing climate and social justice goals. The absence of Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) standards in Pakistan also restricts the Bank’s space in the integration of stringent emissions standards and technical support. This limitation locks the country into high-pollution development pathways despite the ADB’s role as a multilateral development bank (MDB) with an agenda to foster sustainable growth.
In the absence of GHG standards, lack of technical inputs, absence of technology transfer, and non-vital role of the private sector, Pakistan’s reliance on fossil fuel is bound to manifold its environmental and air pollution challenges. Emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter have a direct impact on vulnerable communities, who already lack healthcare facilities, face economic inequality and live in vicious cycles of poverty. Toxic air is compounding respiratory diseases, increasing the disease burden and premature deaths amongst these communities. Over the last two decades, Pakistan has witnessed a sharp rise in disease burden, particularly from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as ischemic heart diseases, strokes, lung disease and cancers, with air pollution being a major risk factor.
These diseases account for over 50pc of total deaths in Pakistan. Premature deaths from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, stroke, and asthma are on the rise. These are largely caused by outdoor fine particles, particularly in major urban centres of Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, where ambient air quality levels exceed World Health Organisation (WHO) safe limits by 10-15 times. As the third most air-polluted country in the world, air pollution in Pakistan traps generations in poverty by harming children’s health and cognitive development, besides hampering their potential. Families struggle to escape as pollution exacerbates unemployment, education gaps, and healthcare access.
Moreover, the ADB’s newly updated Environmental and Social Framework (ESF), launched in 2024, establishes safeguards to minimise environmental harm and protect communities affected by its projects. The framework covers nine key standards: environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, labour conditions, biodiversity, pollution control, and climate resilience.
However, its weak enforcement and loopholes for continued coal financing — lack of meaningful consultation with communities, CSOs, and women’s rights organisations; promotion of resource-intensive and environmentally destructive energy alternatives or “false solutions”; lack of clarity on the extent to which ADB’s safeguards and accountability mechanism — undermine its credibility as a tool for environmental and social justice.
The myth of ‘clean coal’
In recent years, the ADB has sought to justify its continued coal investments in Pakistan by promoting supercritical technology as adequate pollution control. However, this technology does not fully address the health and environmental consequences of coal combustion.
While supercritical plants may offer modest efficiency improvements, they still emit dangerous levels of particulate matter (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) — pollutants directly linked to respiratory diseases, cardiovascular problems, and premature deaths in surrounding communities.
 
 

In practice, most carbon capture projects in Pakistan and elsewhere utilise the trapped CO₂ for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), a process that extends the life of fossil fuel extraction rather than phasing it out. Underground CO₂ storage carries significant risks, including methane leakage — a greenhouse gas 80 times more potent than CO₂ in the short term — and groundwater contamination.
Displacement, land grabbing, and broken promises
ADB-funded fossil fuel projects have also inflicted severe social costs on Pakistani communities. Large-scale coal-linked infrastructure, such as roads and transmission lines, has caused forced evictions in Sindh and Punjab. This has prompted residents of the Karachi Northern Bypass Highway to file complaints over violations of ADB’s resettlement safeguards.
Meanwhile, farmers in Thatta and Badin faced delayed compensation and exclusion from project consultations, sparking protests in 2021. The Bank’s own monitoring has also admitted to “gaps in grievance redressal”.
The ADB’s energy transition mechanism and enhanced transparency framework also have gaps in addressing gendered impacts on health, land rights and land-based livelihoods, unpaid care work, gender-based violence (GBV), energy access, changes to gendered power dynamics in households and communities, employment, and decent work.
On the other hand, labour conditions remain dire, with inadequate contracts, unsafe workplaces, and suppressed rights persisting despite the Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework.
The Bank’s Accountability Mechanism Policy (2012), now under review, must prioritise people. The lender must recognise that project-affected communities bear the brunt of pollution, land loss, and health risks when accountability fails. The mechanism’s redesign must ensure transparency, redressal, and meaningful participation to prevent further harm.
Heat stress, failing crops, and a looming food crisis
Pakistan now faces record-breaking 50°C summers, with ADB-funded coal projects in heat-stressed regions worsening the agricultural crisis. These projects emit methane (CH₄), ozone, and black carbon, byproducts of fossil fuels, and are linked to crop yield losses and diminished crop quality in wheat and rice.
 
 

Simultaneously, PM2.5 from coal and farm fires reduces photosynthesis, while erratic rainfall and heat disrupt growing cycles. Livestock develop pollution-linked respiratory diseases. In the long term, by 2100, South Asia could experience up to a 50pc yield loss in staple crops, with countries like Pakistan especially vulnerable due to reliance on water-intensive crops.
Climate finance and ADB’s clean air agenda
Clean air must be central to the ADB’s climate finance agenda. Less than 1pc of international development funding and only 2pc of international public climate finance was targeted towards air pollution action from 2015 to 2021.
The Bank must bridge this gap by scaling investments in clean energy and pollution control — through solar microgrids and methane capture — instead of just CO₂ cuts. Its energy transition mechanism should tie coal phase-outs to measurable air quality gains, aligning with Pakistan’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and, by extension, its clean air plans. Without binding air quality safeguards, the ADB’s ‘climate finance’ risks fuelling the very crises it claims to solve.
Pakistan is at the forefront of the climate crisis and is trapped in a debt burden. The ADB must prioritise the rights and needs of the Pakistani people over debt servicing. Debt cancellation is critical for Pakistan to build climate-resilient infrastructure, provide clean air, and establish social safety nets for the people of Pakistan.
Integrating the right to clean air
In 2024, Pakistan took a historic step by amending its Constitution to include Article 9A, which guarantees the right to a clean and healthy environment as a fundamental human right. The UN General Assembly’s landmark 2022 resolution explicitly recognises access to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a universal human right. This mandate compels institutions like the ADB to mainstream this principle into their core mission and country strategies.
The ADB must ensure its Just Energy Transition Mechanisms (JETMs) and coal phase-out frameworks — such as the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) — actively safeguard this right.
The global lender must also mandate real-time, project-level disclosure of all GHGs and Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs) — especially methane and black carbon — from its funded projects in Pakistan. This aligns with the Paris Agreement’s Enhanced Transparency Framework and the Global Methane Pledge, which Pakistan joined in 2023.
To effectively reduce fossil fuel dependence and harmful emissions in Pakistan, the ADB must strategically redirect financing toward scalable clean energy technologies while implementing rigorous accountability measures. This shift would align with the ADB’s own 2023–2032 Climate Transition Framework, which prioritises “low-carbon technology transfer” but lacks enforceable benchmarks for fossil fuel phaseouts.
The Bank’s annual meeting offers a crucial opportunity to correct course to shift from funding pollution to financing solutions. For the sake of millions of Pakistanis breathing poisoned air and farming on a heating planet, the answer must be clear.</p><small>2025-05-05 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603202-irsa-starts-providing-indented-supplies-to-four-federating-units' target='_blank'><strong>Irsa releases full indented water shares amid increased river flows</strong></a><br><p>

“I would … I’d like to see it done,” Trump told the NBC News programme “Meet the Press with Kristen Welker” in an interview taped on Friday at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, that is airing across the US on Sunday.
Trump said he had a “sweet spot” for the app after it helped him win over young voters in the 2024 presidential election, adding, “TikTok is — it’s very interesting, but it will be protected”. Trump has already twice granted a reprieve from enforcement of a congressionally mandated ban on TikTok that was initially due to take effect in January.
 


A deal had been in the works that would spin off TikTok’s US operations into a new firm based in the United States and majority-owned and operated by US investors but it was put on hold after China indicated it would not approve it following Trump’s announcements of steep tariffs on Chinese goods.
Democratic senators argue that Trump has no legal authority to extend the deadline, and suggest that the deal that had been under consideration would not meet legal requirements.
One source close to ByteDance’s US investors said last month that work on the prospective deal continues ahead of the June 19 deadline, but the White House and Beijing would need to resolve the tariff dispute first.
Trump told NBC News that China was keen to reach an agreement, citing the impact that 145 per cent tariffs on Chinese goods were having on its economy.
The law required TikTok to stop operating by January 19 unless ByteDance had completed a divestiture of the app’s US assets. Trump began his second term as president on Jan 20 and opted not to enforce it. He first extended the deadline to early April, and then again last month to June 19.

Renowned Pakistan climber Sajid Ali Sadpara completed his acclimatisation rotation on Dhaulagiri, 8,167m peak, the world’s seventh highest mountain in Nepal.
Mr Sadpara had reached the base camp of the peak on April 6 and started his rotation and climbed up to the Camp 3 and descended to the base camp.
Talking to Dawn, he said he had completed the rotation at the peak and now waiting for weather to improve to start his summit push.
He said the summit push would start on May 9 considering weather forecast. He said he would attempt to climb the peak without supplement oxygen and porter support in Alpine style.
Son of legendary mountaineer late Muhammad Ali Sadpara, Sajid has already summited the world’s eight peaks above eight thousand metres, including the world’s second highest peak, K2, Nanga Parbat, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II in Alpine style.
He also took part in rescue operations at many peaks including K2, and plans to summit all 14 eight-thousanders peaks in Alpine style.
After climbing the Dhaulagiri peak without oxygen, he would be the summiteer of nine eight-thousanders peaks without supplement oxygen and porter support.
Naila Kiani aiming to summit Kanchenjunga
Also, renowned Pakistani female mountaineer Naila Kiani started her adventure to climb Kanchenjunga (8,586m), the world’s third-highest mountain, in Nepal.
According to a statement issued on Sunday, she is currently en route to the base camp of Kanchenjunga, an overland journey that will take her seven days to finish.
This expedition marks a significant step in her quest to climb all 14 of the world’s peaks exceeding 8,000m.
Ms Kiani has already summited 11 of the world’s 14 peaks above 8,000m. This includes Everest, K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gashe­rbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II, Annapurna, Lhotse, Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu. She is the first and the only Pakistani woman to achieve this feat.
Sirbaz Khan, Wajidullah Nagri
Likewise, Pakistani climber Sirbaz Khan also started his adventure towards Kanchenjunga peak to attempt summit the peak in Alpine style to compete summit of all 14 eight-thousanders.
He had successfully summited the Annapurna peak in Nepal without using supplementary oxygen on April 7.
Mr Khan is the first Pakistani climber to have summited all the top 14 mountains in the world. He is also the first Pakistani to scale 13 of them in Alpine style — without oxygen support, according to Karrar Haidri, the secretary of the Alpine Club of Pakistan.
The only remaining peak for Mr Khan to complete the list is Kanchenjunga (8,586m), the world’s third-highest mountain, in Nepal.
After climbing the peak, Sirbaz Khan will be first and only Pakistani to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in Alpine style.
Meanwhile, Pakistani mountaineer Wajidullah Nagri also reached the base camp of the Everest to start attempt to summit the peak.
Wajidullah Nagari has already summited K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum-I and Gasherbrum-II in Pakistan.

GCC Secretary-General Jasem Albudaiwi, speaking on behalf of the six-nation bloc, called on both countries to exercise restraint and prioritize diplomacy following a recent deadly attack in the India-occupied region of  Jammu and Kashmir.
Mr Albudaiwi strongly condemned the terrorist attack targeting tourists in Pahalgam,  which resulted in the deaths of 27 Hindus. He reiterated the GCC’s  “principled and consistent  stance in rejecting all forms and manifestations of terrorism.”
“We call for restraint from all parties and urge immediate resumption of  direct talks between Pakistan and India,” Albudaiwi said in statements reflecting the council’s concerns. He stressed the importance of resolving disputes peacefully according to international law and the  UN Charter to ensure regional stability.

The secretary-general also warned against scapegoating and the “rising tide of Islamophobia in the region,” cautioning that discriminatory rhetoric could further inflame tensions.
Serious threat to regional peace
Highlighting the potential impact on global geopolitics, Albudaiwi emphasised that the situation between the nuclear-armed neighbours poses a serious threat to regional peace.
 
 

The  GCC renewed its call for the international community to “intensify its efforts” toward finding a peaceful resolution to the long-standing Jammu and Kashmir issue, underscoring the need to adhere to relevant UN  Security Council resolutions.
The call for dialogue comes amid severely strained relations between India and Pakistan, with diplomatic interactions significantly reduced in recent years.
The  GCC, a political and economic alliance comprising Saudi Arabia, the  United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, and Bahrain, reaffirmed its commitment to supporting regional stability.
Separately, the  Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s human rights arm on Saturday voiced serious alarm over what it described as an alarming rise in  Islamophobia and violence against Muslims in India and India-held  Kashmir after the Pahalgam attack.
The OIC’s Independent Permanent  Human Rights Commission (IPHRC) condemned the “unfounded scapegoating”  of Muslim communities, attributing it to “far-right Hindu nationalist  groups.” The commission urged India to protect its Muslim citizens,  uphold international human rights obligations, and bring perpetrators of hate crimes to justice.
Regarding Kashmir, the IPHRC  reiterated its rejection of India’s “unilateral and illegal actions”  since August 2019, aimed at altering the region’s demography. It called  for international pressure on India to abide by UN resolutions, allow  Kashmiri self-determination, release political prisoners, and permit access for rights groups and fact-finding missions.

ADB President Masato Kanda announced the new target during the bank’s annual meeting in Milan, Italy. The expansion builds on the ADB’s September 2022 pledge to provide $14bn by 2025 to ease a worsening food crisis in the region and improve long-term food security.
By  the end of 2024, the ADB had committed $11bn — about 80 per cent of the  original allocation — with an additional $3.3bn programmed for  2025, the bank said.
“Unprecedented droughts, floods, extreme heat, and degraded natural resources are  undermining agricultural production, while at the same time threatening food security and rural livelihoods,” Mr Kanda said.

Move aims to counter growing threats to food production from climate change impacts and resource degradation

The assistance will fund a programme covering the entire food production process, from farming and processing to distribution and consumption.  Through financing and policy support for governments and companies, the programme aims to help the region generate diverse and nutritious food,  create jobs, reduce environmental impacts and promote resilient agricultural supply chains.
The additional $26bn announced on Sunday will include $18.5bn in direct ADB support for governments and $7.5bn in private sector investments. The ADB aims for private sector investments to account for more than 27pc of the total $40bn programme by 2030.
The programme will work to modernize agricultural value chains to improve access to affordable and healthy food, especially for vulnerable populations. It will also invest in improving soil quality and  conserving biodiversity, which the ADB noted are essential for productive agriculture but increasingly threatened by climate change,  pollution, and habitat loss. Support for digital technology and analytics aims to improve decision-making for farmers, agribusinesses and policymakers.
More than half of the world’s undernourished people live in developing Asia,  according to the ADB. Food systems account for 70pc of global water use,  50pc of habitable land, and 80pc of biodiversity loss, while employing  40pc of the region’s workforce, the bank said.
To aid the effort, the ADB is establishing the Natural Capital Fund, a planned $150 million blended finance vehicle. It has anchor support from the Global Environment Facility and expects contributions from other partners, including the Global Agriculture and Food Security Programme.  This fund will support projects by farmers and innovators focused on sustainable natural capital management.
Food  insecurity threatens to reverse decades of development progress in the  region, where the ADB estimates nearly 1.1bn people lacked healthy  diets due to poverty and high food prices, which soared in 2022.
Global agrifood systems generate hidden environmental, social and health costs estimated at $13 trillion in 2023, or 10pc of global GDP, according to  the Food System Economics Commission. These costs stem from emissions,  land-use changes, water depletion, poverty among workers and diet-related health issues.
The commission noted that productivity losses from poor diets rose 14pc  globally since 2016, with South Asia seeing a 20pc increase,  highlighting the need for reforms beyond traditional production-focused strategies.

The Houthis, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.
The Israeli military said “several attempts were made to intercept” the missile that was launched from Yemen, a rare Houthi attack that penetrated Israel’s air defences.
An Israeli official said the country’s security cabinet would convene in the evening.

Netanyahu blames Iran as defence minister threatens seven times stronger response

A police video showed officers standing on the edge of a deep hole in the ground with the control tower visible behind them. No damage was reported to the airport infrastructure.
The police reported a “missile impact” at Israel’s main international gateway.
An AFP photographer said the missile hit near the parking lots of Terminal 3, the airport’s largest. The crater was just hundreds of metres (yards) from the tarmac.
“You can see the area just behind us: a crater was formed here, several dozen metres (yards) wide and several dozen metres deep,” central Israel’s police chief, Yair Hezroni, said in the video.
 
 

The Israel Airport’s Authority said: “This is the first time a missile has fallen so close to the terminal and the runways.”
“The missile force of the Yemeni armed forces carried out a military operation targeting Ben Gurion airport” with a “hypersonic ballistic missile”, the Houthis said, referring to their forces.
Defence Minister Israel Katz threatened a forceful response, saying: “Anyone who hits us, we will hit them seven times stronger.”
Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to respond to Iran at  “a time and place of our choosing” over the attack  on Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport.
“Attacks  by the Houthis emanate from Iran. Israel will respond to the Houthi  attack against our main airport AND, at a time and place of our  choosing, to their Iranian terror masters,” Netanyahu wrote on X,  reposting a March message by US President Donald Trump also  attributing attacks by the Yemeni group to their Iranian backers.
Palestinians hail attack
Palestinian groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad later hailed the Houthis’ attack on the airport.
Israel’s Magen David Adom emergency service said it had treated at least six people with light to moderate injuries.
An AFP journalist said he heard a “loud bang” at around 9:35 am (0635 GMT), adding the “reverberation was very strong”.
“Security staff immediately asked hundreds of passengers to take shelter, some in bunkers,” the AFP journalist said.
“Many passengers are now waiting for their flights to take off, and others are trying to find alternative flights.” An incoming Air India flight was diverted to Abu Dhabi, an airport official said
It was one of the airlines to suspend Tel Aviv flights until May 6, along with Germany’s Lufthansa Group, which includes Austrian, Eurowings and SWISS.
A passenger said the attack, which came shortly after air raid sirens sounded across parts of Israel, caused “panic”.
An airline official said: “Today was a close call”.
“I have worked at the airport for several years but even I was afraid today,” they said.
Flights resumed after being halted briefly, with the aviation authority saying Ben Gurion was now “open and operational”.
Gaza war expansion
An Israel official said Israel’s security cabinet later met on Sunday, after media reported a planned expansion of the Gaza war with call-up orders issued for tens of thousands of reserve troops.
Several news outlets said the military had begun sending the orders for reservists to replace conscripts and active-duty soldiers in Israel and the occupied West Bank so they can be redeployed to Gaza.
A military spokesperson neither confirmed nor denied the reports but Israel’s public broadcaster said the security cabinet would meet to discuss the expanded offensive.
Israel resumed major operations across Gaza on March 18 amid deadlock over how to proceed with a two-month ceasefire that had largely stopped the Gaza war.
Sunday’s attack on Israel was the fourth the Houthis have claimed in three days.
Israel claims to have intercepted most of the Houthis’ missiles fired since the Gaza war started.
In March, the Houthis threatened to resume attacks on shipping over Israel’s aid blockade on Gaza after a suspension of attacks during the truce.
The US military has been hammering Houthis with near-daily strikes since March 15.

Though the Commi­ssioner for Indus Waters was not available to comment, a source privy to the development said that the report sent by the commission to government mentions a massive breach of the treaty in the form of construction of three hydroelectric plants / projects at the western rivers, including Jhelum and Chenab. The construction of the 450MW had reportedly been started at Chenab basin in 2005, followed by 330MW Kishan Ganga Hydropower Project in 2010 at Jhelum river basin. The construction of 850MW Ratle Hydropower project is yet to be initiated.
“The report also contains the information about other violations of the treaty by India such as delaying or avoiding giving information regarding release of floodwater during monsoon in rivers, including Ravi and Satluj. Besides these, there are a series of violations India committed already,” said the source while talking to this scribe.
He further said a very recent major violation committed by India was holding the treaty in abeyance that is not at all allowed.
He further said the report also mentioned that New Delhi suspended the treaty unilaterally on the pretext of the Pahalgam attack last month.
 
 

According to another source, India always faced defeat whenever Pakistan challenged and raised objections on the design of the aforementioned projects and took up these issues on relevant forums, including neutral expert or international court of arbitration.
“The proceedings on a couple of projects including Ratle are still underway at the Permanent Court of Arbitration, a non-UN intergovernmental organisation located in The Hague,” he said.
Talking to Dawn, Syed Jamat Ali Shah, a former commissioner on Indus Waters said in fact the draft of treaty finalised in 1960 gave no privilege to India to use waters of western rivers—Indus, Jhelum and Chenab on which Pakistan had the full right to use.
“India had full right to use  the water of eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas and Satluj) whether through construction of dams (for water storage and power generation) or other purposes.”
He added that a few months before signing of the treaty, India had started building pressure on the authorities concerned to also allow it to construct run-of-the river hydropower projects and small storages for irrigation purposes in the catchment areas of the western rivers.
He said since a lot of work has already been done on the treaty and there was no time to further delay, it was decided to allow India do so, but with some restrictions / conditions such as consulting Pakistan while finalising design of the projects etc.
He urged the government to brief the UNSC in detail about a series of violations of the treaty India committed.
“The Pakistani team may also take up this issue with the World Bank immediately in a bid to get the India’s unilateral decision of holding treaty in abeyance scrapped,” he urged.

Users accessing both accounts in India see a mes­sage stating the acco­unts were withheld “in response to a legal demand”.
PPP condemned India’s move to block the account of the party chairman. In a statement on Sunday, a PPP spokesperson said India’s action was a retaliation for Mr Bhutto-Zar­dari’s “unequivocal and bold stance on the Pahalgam incident” which he had presented before the international community.
The press release issued by the Bilawal House media cell said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was afraid of Mr Bhutto-Zardari. “It also proves that India is an undemocratic country and its prime minister is an extremely cowardly person,” the statement added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s narrative on the Pahalgam attack “unsettled the Indian prime minister”, the PPP spokesperson said, adding that it was Mr Bhutto-Zardari who first exposed the “Butcher of Gujarat” before the world, and he would continue to hold up a mirror to Mr Modi’s war-mongering mindset.
Since the Pahalgam attack on April 22, the Indian government has blocked a number of social media accounts belonging to the Pakistan government, news channels, content creators, film stars, sportspersons  and journalists. The accounts were blocked on YouTube, X and Instagram.
X, formerly Twitter, has been banned in Pakistan since February 2024.

The political leaders made this pledge during an in-camera briefing by the civil and military leadership on Sunday, in which the army spokesperson apprised the mainstream political parties about the latest situation in the region and the preparedness of the country’s armed forces to avert any misadventure by the neighbouring country.
The in-camera briefing was given by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar. However, the main opposition party, PTI, did not attend the huddle.
A source privy to the huddle proceedings told Dawn that the political parties were of the view that they stood by the armed forces to foil any attempt by India to spoil regional peace. Before the briefing, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the main objective of the huddle was to get feedback from the political forces in light of tensions with India.

Participants told India wanted to divert water, intensify Kashmir oppression using Pahalgam

Another source told Dawn that the participants were briefed about how India “prepared and implemented its false flag operation” in Pahalgam. The meeting was informed that India could not sell its narrative to the world and that Pakistan’s stance had emerged stronger in the aftermath of the attack. The participants were also apprised of the preparedness of the armed forces to foil any kind of misadventure by India.
 
 

Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir, who attended the briefing, said that the meeting was informed about how and why India conducted the attack in Pahalgam. Senator Qadir said, as per information shared with the political leaders, the primary objective of the operation was to further divert Indus water, intensify aggression in held Kashmir, and camouflage Indian terrorism with the help of the Afghan Taliban.
With the help of video clips, the participants were given a briefing about Indian involvement in terrorism in Pakistan, especially Balochistan, he added.
PPP leaders Raja Pervez Ashraf, Qamar Zaman Kaira, and Shazia Marri; PML-N’s Barrister Aqeel and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Tallal Chaudhry; PM’s aide Pervez Khattak; MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar; and Kashmiri leader Shah Ghulam Qadir, among others, were in attendance.
Tension between the two nuclear states escalated soon after the Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed on April 22.
Soon after the attack, India blamed Pakistan for being involved in the attack. On the other hand, Pakistan termed the attack a false flag operation by India and called for a neutral probe.

Riyadh has been at the forefront of this effort and has been shouldering the major weight of the Opec+ output cut mechanism. 
In recent months, Opec+ cut its crude oil output by over five million barrels, some five per cent of the global supply. Saudi Arabia was contributing two-fifths of this output cut.
The effort, aimed at propping up the global oil market prices, was essential to meet the ever-growing budgetary requirements of major oil producers, Saudi Arabia included. Most Opec economies are often termed as single-product economies, with oil earnings staying crucial to meeting the needs of these petro-states.
But Riyadh now seems fed up with its act of propping up the oil markets by playing the role of a swing producer. Reuters reported last week that Saudi officials have been briefing allies and industry experts in recent days that they were unwilling to prop up oil markets with further supply cuts.

Inventories may increase by about 200m barrels over the next three quarters, which could drive crude toward the low $50s

There seems to be some logic behind the Saudi desperation. Despite the Opec+ output cuts, markets have not been able to stabilise much. Crude has shed about 19pc this year, briefly touching a four-year low last month, as the Trump administration’s tariffs fanned concerns that energy demand will fall.
However, to some extent, oil busters within Opec+ had to be blamed for this market weakness. Some Opec+ members have been overshooting their allocated output quotas — apparently at Riyadh’s cost.
Saudi Arabia is not ready to tolerate it any further. “Opec’s decision framework appears to be fueled by persistent cheating, particularly from the likes of Iraq, Kazakhstan, and Russia, among others,” TD Cowen strategists, including Dan Ghali and Bart Melek, said in a note to clients. 
Inventories may increase by about 200m barrels over the next three quarters, which could drive crude toward the low $50s, Bloomberg quoted them as saying in the note. Riyadh is also not ready to concede its market share any further.
This carries ramifications for the health of the oil markets and the oil revenues of the major producers over the coming months. Many years back, while Ali Al-Naimi was at the helm of the Saudi Petroleum Ministry and fed up with quota cheating by other Opec oil producers, Riyadh had to adopt the same path to protect its market share. 
The growing shale output from the US was also an apparent target of the Saudi policymakers then. Mr Naimi had told American drillers in February 2016 that they could “lower costs, borrow cash or liquidate” in the face of sub-$50-a-barrel prices.  
The result was disastrous in some sense. Market prices collapsed. This ultimately resulted in a ceasefire among the producers.
Today can’t be any different. Saudis are not ready to continue sharing the burden of the oil output cut, almost single-handedly, any further. With several fellow Opec+ members failing to adhere to their output targets and to compensate for oversupply in recent months, a frustrated Riyadh is changing tack, Opec+ sources told Reuters.
This possible shift in Saudi policy could suggest a move toward producing more and expanding its market share, a major change after five years spent balancing the market through deep output as a leader of the Opec+ group of oil producers.
Despite its dependence on cash flow from oil sales, Saudi officials have been emphasising in recent weeks that the kingdom can live with the fall in prices by raising borrowing and cutting costs, media reports said, quoting several sources. “The Saudis are ready for lower prices and may need to pull back on some major projects,” one of the sources said.
Saudi Arabia needs oil prices above $90 to balance its budget, higher than other large Opec producers, such as the United Arab Emirates, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Theories on the reasons behind the apparent change in Saudi strategy range from punishing Opec+ members for exceeding their quotas to a move to fight for market share after ceding ground to non-Opec producers such as the United States and Guyana.
Higher output may also be a fillip to US President Donald Trump, who has called for Opec to boost output to help keep US gasoline prices down. Some feel that Riyadh needs to oblige President Trump for political reasons. That may also have pushed Riyadh to change its track on crude output.
All these have an impact on the economies of the major oil producers. The IMF has downgraded its economic growth forecast for the oil exporters in the Middle East to 2.3pc from 4pc projected last October due to the slide in oil prices.
“Across the region, rising trade tensions and policy uncertainty are adding to the impact of conflicts and extended oil production cuts to weaken growth prospects,” the IMF said in its Regional Economic Outlook for the Middle East and Central Asia.
In the meantime, the IMF has also downgraded Saudi Arabia’s GDP growth forecast to 3.0pc this year, lower than a previous forecast of 3.3pc economic growth, following the 13pc decline in oil prices over the past month.
In a welcome change, the projected lower oil prices could take some pressure off the balance of payments of oil consumers, like Pakistan.

The devotees, including women and children, arrived from all over Pakistan and abroad for the three-day pilgrimage at the temple located in the mountains, around 140km west of Uthal.
It is considered one of the largest pilgrimage sites in Hindu civilisation.
The opening ceremony of the religious festival was held on April 2.
According to the organisers of the religious festival, a record turnout was witnessed this year, with around 200,000 pilgrims attending the festival across three days.

Three-day event concludes with record turnout of pilgrims

Pilgrims participated in various religious rituals, including the sacred bath in the Hingol River, offerings at the Chandragup mud volcano and worship inside the Hinglaj Mata cave temple.
The Shri Hinglaj Mata Welfare Mandli had set up round-the-clock food and drink stalls (Bhandara) for pilgrims, especially those who arrived barefoot, to fulfil their spiritual vows.
Senator Danesh Kumar, Lasbela Deputy Comm­issioner Humaira Baloch, Lasbela SSP Atif Ameer, tribal elders and senior government officials visited the festival and reviewed administrative and security arrangements.
Senator Kumar, who attended the closing ceremony, said the successful Hinglaj Mata festival and the participation of thousands of Hindu pilgrims proved that all minorities were enjoying religious freedom in Pakistan.
He said the Hindu community has three elected representatives in the Balochistan Assembly, with him representing the community in the Senate.
He said the Balochistan government made foolproof security arrangements for the festival and over 1,100 personnel of army, Frontier Corps, police and Levies were deployed for the participants’ safety.
He said the Lasbela district administration exten­ded full cooperation to the organisers.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority had made extensive arrangements for the event.
Pakistan Coast Guards also held a four-day free medical camp where male and female doctors treated pilgrims and provided free 
medicines.
The 5,000-year-old temple holds great reverence for Hindus worldwide. In 2006, former Indian foreign minister Jaswant Singh also visited the temple during his goodwill visit to Pakistan.
The annual festival at the holy site is a spiritual cornerstone for Pakistan’s Hindu community and a powerful symbol of interfaith harmony. Local Muslim tribes host and assist pilgrims, reflecting a long-standing tradition of religious tolerance and coexistence in the region.

An attack on April 22 in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, both nations have imposed tit-for-tat measures on each other in a tug-of-war started by India.
The notification, which has been seen by Dawn.com, stated that these bans would not be applicable to goods for which a bill of lading or letter of credit had already been issued.
The ministry banned, “the import of Indian origin goods by third countries via sea, land and air; transiting through Pakistan; goods imported from India by third countries via sea, land and air, transiting through Pakistan; [and] the exports of third countries, to India via sea, land and air, transiting through Pakistan”.
The notification stated that the federal government issued the orders “in the interest of national security and in public interest”.
Late on Saturday night, Pakistan banned the use of its ports by Indian flag carriers in a tit-for-tat response to India announcing that Pakistani-flagged ships would not be allowed to visit any of its ports, and Indian flagged-ships would not visit any ports in Pakistan.
An order issued by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs’ Ports and Shipping Wing said: “In view of the recent development of maritime situation with neighbouring country, Pakistan in order to safeguard maritime sovereignty, economic interest and national security enforces following measures with immediate effect: Indian flag carriers shall not be allowed to visit any Pakistani port, Pakistani flag carriers shall not visit any Indian port [and] any exemption or dispensation shall be examined and decided on case to case basis.”
Trade between the two nations has dwindled over the last few years.
In August 2019, Pakistan had already formally downgraded its trade relations with India to the level of Israel, with which Islamabad has no trade ties at all, in reaction to New Delhi’s decision to revoke Article 370 of its constitution that granted occupied Kashmir a special status.</p><small>2025-05-04 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603149-pakistan-india-tensions-dg-ispr-info-minister-brief-political-leaders-on-security-situation' target='_blank'><strong>'Pakistan Army fully prepared to respond to Indian aggression': DG ISPR briefs political parties</strong></a><br><p>
