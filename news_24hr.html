The plan hinged on a “secure neighbourhood” registration drive, called the ICT (Islamabad Capital Territory) Household Survey. It was designed to collect information about who was occupying every house, shop or office across the city.
Officials framed it as a necessary response to a fast-changing city. Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon, during a press briefing, said residents could fill the digital form themselves by downloading an app. However, survey teams, along with police, would still visit door-to-door. He added that the system would flag households with incomplete information, which the administration would retrieve, whether by “force or other means”.
Memon’s warning was not rhetorical.
On November 23, state-owned Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported that survey teams had recorded 5,553 households in person, while 2,592 residents submitted their information via the mobile app. The combined approach ensured coverage for residents with limited internet access or digital literacy, and officials said participation through the app had been steadily rising.
In Islamabad’s Sector I-8, Asad Shahid recalled hesitating when surveyors knocked on his door. “I was reluctant to share the details when the team visited my house,” he told Dawn.
Yet the dynamic shifted when he saw a policeman accompanying the survey team.
“One of my neighbours refused to cooperate with the team, so they called the police. When I saw this, I shared my information.”
Such scenes deepened a longstanding divide in how residents saw these periodic data drives, a practice Islamabad had revived multiple times since 2009.
Residents who supported the survey said it was a long-overdue attempt to understand who lived in the capital, especially after years of unregulated internal migration. Critics, on the other hand, viewed it as a “forced intrusion” lacking a legal framework and no guarantees of data protection.
Authorities insisted the purpose was straightforward. Per police and city administration officials, the survey was meant to provide comprehensive security for Islamabad’s residents, with one policeman, speaking anonymously, noting that a surge of newcomers from across Pakistan had increased the possibility that “militants and terrorists were among them and staying in the capital in rented houses”.
Officials admitted there was “no law to ask the details from the landlord and the tenants,” which was why the district magistrate was asked to issue compulsory orders.
The city had attempted similar surveys in 2009, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2023 and again in April 2024. Each cycle followed a familiar pattern: a security incident, an administrative push, and public resistance.
For some residents, the newest version was simply common sense.
“At the end of the day, I think it’s a good initiative,” said a resident of Sector F-8, who requested not to be named. “I checked with some of my connections, and it seems legit. It doesn’t seem to cause any harm, other than the fact that I don’t trust people with my private data. But with the app, if I can submit it online safely, I am fine with it. Mostly, I’ve heard the authorities want to kick out illegal residents.”
In Barakahu, Rayan Abbasi also welcomed the effort. “The government should know who is residing in a house. There are a large number of natives of the neighbouring country in my area, and no one knows what they do for a living or the number of their family members,” he said.
Residents of Shalimar and Mehran apartments said the survey could help curb the use of residential flats as boys’ hostels or for “late-night activities” where “residents never know who is coming”.
Faisal Khan, a resident of F-10, said the apartment he purchased in E-11/4 had become “notorious for parties and other illegal activities”.
“The resale value had gone down because the apartment building had been maligned. I am glad this initiative has been taken so we find out who is doing illegal stuff,” he added.
Arqam Naveed from Sector G-13, told Dawn, “I was hesitant initially when the survey team came, but my neighbour downstairs was giving the information, so I didn’t mind either.” He, however, added that the team “needs to show credentials or an authority letter.”
But not everyone was comfortable with the survey.
“Those living in posh and semi-posh areas are afraid of sharing their details,” one summary of resident feedback said, a worry repeated across Islamabad’s more affluent neighbourhoods.
Adnan from Sector F-7, who chose to be identified by his first name only, opined that the plan was “just for optics.”“The government does not care about our privacy or security. This is just being done to calm the public down.”
Civil liberties groups were far more direct.
“Such campaigns could normalise extralegal surveillance, setting a precedent for unchecked government intrusion into private lives,” warned Haroon Baloch of Bytes for All, an NGO that advocates for digital rights, privacy, and freedom of expression in Pakistan.
He argued that the practice “undermines constitutional protections including Article 14 of Pakistan’s Constitution on dignity and privacy,” risks creating “a chilling effect,” and could easily become “a tool for political control, such as targeting dissenters, journalists, or minorities”.
Lawyers, too, saw legal chaos beneath the administrative confidence.
“It is a good initiative as far as the safety and security of citizens is concerned … But the biggest issue is the way they are collecting the data,” said Waiza Rafique, a high court lawyer.
“As of now, there is no law in Pakistan regarding data protection … no clear privacy protocols … and no defined punishments if those protocols are breached,” she warned.
“You can give Rs2,000 or even Rs500 to someone, and they can access all the history, data and everything. Privacy is compromised,” she said.
Political voices zeroed in on the same issue.
Senator Palwasha Khan, speaking in parliament, asked: “Under which law does the chairman allow harassment by ringing people’s doorbells and forcibly collecting private information? If this data is sold on the dark web for Rs100 … who will stop it?”
Even veteran rights advocates viewed the move as part of a wider pattern of intrusive governance.
“I think there’s already a lot of intrusion in the private lives of citizens by the state,” Harris Khalique, Secretary General of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), told Dawn. He argued that with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) already possessing extensive citizen data, further household-level probing was unnecessary.
“There has to be some kind of a limit. This is not how crime is dealt with in other countries.”
The city administration, however, remained firm in its defence.
“People’s apprehensions about privacy invasion are baseless because their personal data already exists with Nadra,” DC Memon told Dawn. He insisted the survey is “standard practice worldwide” and added that so far, “our survey teams have been receiving cooperation from the public”.
Dawn also reached out to the Minister of State for Interior, Tallal Chaudhry, for a comment, but he did not respond.
Others preferred the government take a different route altogether.
Tariq Afghan, a high court advocate, said incidents like the court blast “once again exposed the gaps in our national security framework”. Instead of ad-hoc responses, he argued, the state must “fully and transparently implement the National Action Plan in letter and spirit” and craft uniform national security protocols with provinces.
As the survey continued, the city remained caught between cooperation and caution, leaving the balance between vigilance and intrusion unsettled.

ISLAMABAD: Building the case on overburdening and rising debt servicing costs post-2010, the federal government on Thursday proposed mobilising additional consolidated revenues amounting to more than five per cent of GDP over the next three years (roughly Rs6.5 trillion per annum at the current exchange rate).
The suggestion came during the much-delayed inaugural meeting of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC), which also sought legal opinion on whether provinces are bound by federal expenditure priorities.
The Centre urged the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by 3 to 3.5 percentage points from around 10pc at present in three years and asked the provinces to enhance their share of revenues to 3pc of GDP — through taxes on property, agriculture income and sales tax on services — from the existing 0.28pc.
It argued that the measure was necessary to stabilise the rising fiscal deficit, which had gone up from close to 4pc to over 6.6pc now after the fiscal imbalance created since 2010 under the 7th NFC award, resulting in massive deterioration of the debt-to-GDP ratio.
The meeting, held over an official lunch in a “very good atmosphere”, was chaired by Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb and was attended by the chief ministers of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (both holding the finance minister portfolio), finance ministers of Punjab and Balochistan, four provincial non-statutory NFC members, KP chief minister’s adviser Muzammil Aslam, and federal and provincial finance secretaries.







Participants told journalists outside the Ministry of Finance that there was no demand for reducing the provincial share in the divisible pool from the existing 57.5pc as being speculated, nor any discussion about more or less responsibilities, as they were subjects of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and the National Economic Council (NEC).
Fiscal requirements of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan would also be deliberated at a working-group level.
The participants decided with consensus to form seven different thematic working groups and call a second meeting of the NFC between Jan 8 and 15, depending on the reports of working groups before Jan 8.
These groups would deliberate on horizontal and vertical distribution of resources, how the provinces should advance taxation policies based on the latest experiences, impacts of debt servicing, poverty and so on.
A special working group was also agreed upon on the request of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as to the fiscal and social impact of the merger of tribal districts and how to move forward with adequate resources.

 

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the meeting was held in a very good environment and all stakeholders — the Centre and the provinces — explained their fiscal positions.
“It was agreed to form six to seven working groups. They will continue their consultations to take the process forward before the next NFC meeting,” he said, adding that a joint statement would be issued by the federal finance ministry.
Mr Aslam, the KP chief minister’s adviser on finance, said the beauty of the inaugural meeting was that the Centre acknowledged the issues facing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s merged districts (formerly Fata), and the larger provinces — Sindh and Punjab — supported KP’s cause in this regard.
He said the Sindh chief minister raised the issue of questions and discussions in certain quarters on provincial expenditures.
Mr Shah reminded that under Article 160 of the Constitution, the NFC was a forum of only revenue sharing and the provinces were not bound to follow “federal dictations” on the expenditure side, meaning that provinces were autonomous in setting their spending priorities. Their item-wise expenditure details are publicly available through respective budget documents and official websites.
Federal Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal reportedly suggested that a legal opinion might be required from the Attorney General of Pakistan for interpreting the constitutional provision and whether the provincial and federal spending priorities are in national alignment, and if a reduction or an increase in shares means absolute numbers or a percentage of the pie.
Centre’s fiscal challenges
The Centre put on the table its fiscal challenges following the 7th NFC award in 2010 and its continuation for more than 15 years, putting a squeeze on the country’s defence and development expenditure that compromised infrastructure development and social standards, as a major part of the resources went into interest payments. This financially weakened the Centre and, as a result, the provinces as well.
This could only be addressed with the best revenue efforts, both by the Centre and the provinces. All participants agreed that a strong federation could transform strong federating units and vice versa.
Earlier, Finance Minister Aurangzeb recalled the constitutional importance and collaborative spirit of the NFC process and noted the inaugural gathering reflected a shared resolve to fulfil a vital constitutional responsibility. He promised Centre’s commitment to transparent and sincere dialogue, ready to listen to the provinces and work collectively in the national interest, an official statement said.
He also commended the provinces for their cooperation in signing the National Fiscal Pact and in achieving mandatory fiscal surpluses to support Pakistan’s compliance with IMF requirements.
KP CM thanks Centre
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was quoted as expressing gratitude to the federal government for holding the NFC meeting. “A strong federation and strong provinces will guarantee a strong and united Pakistan,” he said.







He highlighted the sacrifices of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa made in the ‘war on terror’, which he said had resurfaced again.
Mr Afridi hoped the NFC would “address the ultra vires of the 7th NFC since June 2018 and include the population and other variables of the newly merged districts in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and update the share of the province to give them due representation”.
Punjab’s Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman also emphasised the need for consensus but stressed that “consensus-building will take a lot of effort on everyone’s part”, according to the statement.
Balochistan’s Finance Minister Shoaib Nosherwani said the province would continue the path of cooperation and consensus and mentioned his province’s efforts in strengthening the federation through projects like Sui Gas, Saindak and Reko Diq.
After the meeting, KP Chief Minister Afridi told reporters that it was held in a cordial atmosphere and a decision was taken to form sub-committees for different issues, including the merged districts’ share.
“I raised the issue and said that it was unconstitutional to deprive KP of its due share. It was decided that the next meeting will be held in January,” he said.
When asked why the PTI government did not address the issue of provincial share when it was in power, he said it was because his party’s government, which came to power in 2018, was toppled in 2022.

ISLAMABAD: Field Marshal Asim Munir was named the country’s first chief of defence forces (CDF) on Thurs­day, in the most sweeping restructuring of the military command since the 1970s.
The announcement came after the president approved the appointment, on the advice of PM Shehbaz Sharif.
“President Asif Ali Zardari approved the appointment of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir as COAS concurrently as CDF for five years,” the Presidency said in a statement, formally ending days of speculation over the delay in notification.







Earlier in the evening, PM Shehbaz had advised the president to appoint Field Marshal Munir to the newly created, dual-hatted office.

 

“The prime minister has forwarded to the Presidency the summary approving the appointment of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir as Chief of the Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces,” the Prime Minister’s Office said.
The new arrangement consolidates operational, administrative and strategic authority in a single office established through amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution under the 27th Amendment.
The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, shall appoint the chief of the army staff, who will concurrently serve as the chief of defence forces.
The amendment also abolished the office of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC), dismantling the tri-service coordination system in place since 1976 and transferring joint command integration to the CDF.
Five-year tenure reset
To translate the constitutional overhaul into the military’s legal framework, the government amended the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) of 1952 in the wake of the 27th Amendment.
Sub-section (i) of PAA’s Article 8A now states that “for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces […], the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
It explains that upon the issuance of the notification for the first COAS-plus-CDF, the “existing tenure of the incumbent chief of the army staff shall be deemed to have recommenced from the date of such notification”.
Under sub-section (iii) of Article 8A, the “terms and conditions” of the COAS concurrently with the CDF shall be determined by the president on the prime minister’s advice.
Field Marshal Munir was appointed army chief on Nov 29, 2022, becoming the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
In November 2024, the government brought changes to the PAA, extending the tenure for all three services chiefs from three to five years, keeping the CJCSC’s tenure unchanged at three years. The same amendments allowed the services chiefs to be reappointed and/or their tenures to be extended for up to five years, instead of up to three years.
Therefore, in line with the restructuring under the 27th Amendment, the recent PAA changes allow the president, on the prime minister’s advice, to reappoint the COAS-plus-CDF for another five years, or extend his tenure by up to five years, creating legal space for him to retain his position till December 2035.
Delay in notification
The prolonged delay in issuing the notification had triggered intense speculation, especially after the post of CJCSC was abolished on Nov 27 when Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza retired.
The absence of a notification on Nov 29, the date when Field Marshal Munir’s original three-year term as army chief (prior to last year’s amendment) ended, fuelled further uncertainty about whether the government was holding back the appointment to negotiate upcoming four-star postings.
Political circles suggested the delay may have been used to bargain over the selection of the new Commander National Strategic Command (CNSC), the Vice Chief of the Army Staff (VCOAS) and potentially a future ISI chief.
The army had already clarified that no VCOAS was being appointed. Under the amended law, the appointments of the CNSC and any VCOAS are tied to the CDF’s recommendations.
Government officials repeatedly denied any tensions with the military, maintaining that procedural requirements and the prime minister’s travel itinerary dictated the timeline. None­t­heless, the silence was widely viewed as unusual, especially after the speed with which the 27th Amendment was rushed through parliament.
The amendment also empowers the federal government to define the CDF’s functions, including multi-domain integration, restructuring and enhancing jointness across services.
New organogram
Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the defence ministry is finalising a new organogram for the CDF and had shared a draft with the Prime Minister’s Office a day earlier.
He dispelled the impression of differences over a CDF notification, stressing that it was delayed since the premier was out of the country.
Officials say the organogram will lay out the command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly established strategic command.
Along with approving the CDF appointment, President Zardari also endorsed the prime minister’s advice regarding the leadership of the air force. “President Asif Ali Zardari approved a two-year extension for Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu from March 19, 2026,” the Presidency said.
The extension will take effect upon completion of his current five-year term in Mar­­ch next year, keeping him in office until March 2028.

The effort is led by Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Congressman Greg Casar, and includes signatures from Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, two Muslim members of the House known for their advocacy on Palestinian and other Muslim issues.
In the letter, made public on Wednesday, the lawmakers called for targeted measures, including visa bans and asset freezes on officials responsible for threatening US citizens and residents who criticise Pakistan’s military establishment, as well as their family members in Pakistan.
There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, or the embassy in Washington.

More than 40 lawmakers write to Marco Rubio, ask for sanctions against officials involved in ‘transnational repression’

The letter emphasises the need for Washington to act against those who “weaponise state power to jail political opponents, intimidate citizens abroad, and crush democratic freedoms”, said First Pakistan Global, a rights group sympathetic to the PTI, which distributed the letter.
“In recent years, US citizens and residents who have spoken out against authoritarian abuses in Pakistan have faced threats, intimidation, and harassment — often extending to their families in Pakistan. These tactics include arbitrary detentions, coercion, and retaliatory violence, targeting diaspora individuals and their relatives,” the letter stated.
The lawmakers warned that Pakistan was experiencing a deepening authoritarian crisis: opposition leaders have been detained without charge, journalists intimidated or forced into exile, and ordinary citizens arrested for social media activity. Women, religious minorities, and ethnic communities — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate repression, they claimed.
“This authoritarian system in Pakistan is sustained through relentless repression. Opposition leaders are held without charge, denied fair trial, and kept in indefinite pretrial detention. Independent journalists are harassed, abducted, or forced into exile. Ordinary citizens are arrested for social media posts, while women, religious minorities, and marginalised ethnic groups — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate violence and surveillance,” the letter read.
The lawmakers cited specific cases, including that of Virginia-based investigative journalist Ahmad Noorani, whose brothers were allegedly abducted and held for over a month after his reporting on military corruption.
They also raised concerns about the 2024 elections, noting irregularities documented by independent observation reports.
The US State Department had previously expressed concern over these irregularities and called for a full investigation.
The letter urged the US administration to impose measures such as Global Magnitsky sanctions, visa bans, and asset freezes against officials credibly perpetrating systematic and transnational repression.
It also called for the release of former prime minister Imran Khan and other political prisoners. “Such steps would reinforce US commitment to human rights, protect American citizens from transnational repression, and promote regional stability,” the lawmakers wrote.
To strengthen congressional oversight, the lawmakers submitted five detailed questions to the State Department regarding sanctions, conditions for targeted measures, and steps to protect US residents from threats directed at their families abroad. The lawmakers have requested a response from Secretary Rubio by Dec 17, 2025.
Earlier this year, more than 50 lawmakers submitted another resolution in the House, named the “Pakistan Freedom and Accountability Act”. It sought legal sanctions against those responsible for “undermining democracy in Pakistan”.
That resolution, HR 5271, is in queue for voting at the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
Published in Dawn, December 5th, 2025</p><small>2025-12-05 02:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959259/us-asylum-freeze' target='_blank'><strong>US asylum freeze</strong></a><br><p>IT is clear that the Trump administration is using last week’s shooting incident, in which two National Guard troopers were targeted, to further clamp down on asylum and immigration. The suspected shooter, a former Afghan security man with ties to US forces, came to America in 2021. In the wake of the Washington shooting, the US has suspended all asylum claims, while people from 19 “high-risk” countries will have their immigration status reviewed retroactively.
Moreover, the US travel ban could be extended to more than 30 countries — mostly ‘Third World’ states in the words of the US president. According to the US homeland security secretary, “foreign invaders” who “snatch the benefits owed to Americans” are not welcome. Yet much of this xenophobic rhetoric conveniently overlooks one crucial fact: many of the asylum seekers and migrants heading to American shores come from countries that the US and its Western allies have themselves helped destroy through military interventions.
Out of the 19 states under particular scrutiny, Afghanistan, Libya, Cuba, Yemen and Venezuela have all suffered from regime change attempts or armed attacks by the US; some of the ‘enemy’ governments have fallen, others have not. From Latin America to the Middle East, the US and its allies have for decades indulged in destabilising behaviour to bring unyielding governments to heel. Many of these states, such as Syria and Iraq, not to mention Afghanistan, have been destroyed in the process.
Now, if people from these broken states head to the US or Europe, they are being told to stay away. It is even more ironic that those who helped the US during the Afghan occupation may also be sent back. Considered ‘collaborators’ by the Afghan Taliban regime, deporting these individuals, as well as rights activists, to Afghanistan would be the equivalent of a death sentence.

 

Mr Trump’s dislike of immigrants is well-known. In his first term, he championed the border wall with Mexico. He has also termed migrants ‘killers’ and ‘rapists’. Yet he has opened America’s doors for Afrikaners to escape an imagined ‘white genocide’ in South Africa. The anti-migrant stances seem to be coloured by racism, as it is easy to blame others, particularly people of colour, for one’s own failings. Far-right forces across the Western world are echoing similar sentiments.
While those individuals that break the law must surely be held to account, it would be unwise for the West to launch sweeping anti-migrant pogroms. Especially so when it is Western states that have helped destroy the migrants’ home countries. In particular, the US and other Western states have a moral responsibility to take in Afghan asylum-seekers — including those residing in Pakistan at the moment — who worked with foreign forces during the US-led occupation of Afghanistan.

At least nine higher education institutions have placed the two countries in a “high-risk” category for student visas and have tightened their enrolment policies to protect their ability to sponsor international applicants, according to the report published on Thursday.
The move follows a surge in asylum claims lodged by international students, prompting UK ministers to warn that the study route “must not be used as a backdoor” to settlement.
Among the universities taking action, the University of Chester has suspended recruitment from Pakistan until autumn 2026, citing a “recent and unexpected rise in visa refusals”.
The University of Wolverhampton is not accepting undergraduate applications from either Pakistan or Bangladesh, while the University of East London has paused recruitment from Pakistan altogether.
Other institutions, including Sunderland, Coventry, Hertfordshire, Oxford Brookes, Glasgow Caledonian and private provider BPP University, have also halted or scaled back admissions from the two countries under what they describe as risk-mitigation measures.
The restrictions come after a regulatory overhaul that took effect in September, reducing the maximum visa refusal rate allowed for institutions sponsoring international students from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
However, refusal rates for Pakistani and Bangladeshi student visa applications stand at 18pc and 22pc respectively, far exceeding the new limit, FT reported.
Together, applicants from the two countries make up half of the 23,036 student visa refusals recorded by the Home Office in the year to September 2025.
Asylum claims from both nationalities have also risen, many involving students who first entered the UK on study or work visas.
International higher education consultant Vincenzo Raimo told FT the crackdown had created a “real dilemma” for lower-fee universities heavily dependent on overseas enrolments. Even limited numbers of problematic cases, he warned, could jeopardise compliance with the tightened thresholds.
The measures have drawn frustration from education advisers. Maryem Abbas, founder of Lahore-based Edvance Advisors, described the decisions as “heartbreaking” for genuine students whose applications were being rejected at the final stage.
She argued that weak oversight of recruitment agents had contributed to the rise in misuse of the student route, turning it into a “moneymaking business”.
Universities UK International said some institutions would need to diversify international recruitment and strengthen application checks to retain their sponsorship rights. While the new rules may prove “challenging”, it said they were essential to maintain confidence in the system.
A Home Office spokesperson told FT that the government “strongly values” international students but is tightening rules to ensure those who come to Britain are genuine and that education providers uphold their responsibilities.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041837543a280bd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959169/govt-rules-out-meetings-for-uzma-khan-other-violators-of-prison-code' target='_blank'><strong>Govt rules out meetings for Uzma Khan, other violators of prison code</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Thursday ruled out any further meetings for Uzma Khanum and others who violated the prison code while meeting PTI founder Imran Khan.
Uzma met the party founder in prison on Tuesday after weeks of effort. The meeting took place as rumours regarding Imran’s health began circulating in local and foreign media, despite claims by the government and PTI leaders that the former prime minister was in good health.
These speculations, however, gained traction due to the government’s reluctance to let visitors, including his family members and legal team, meet Imran over the past few weeks. Uzma subsequently detailed instructions from Imran to the party regarding political and other matters.
Addressing a press conference with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on the entire situation, the information minister announced: “There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen.”

He added that reports of incitement against the state and its officials had surfaced. “Meetings are banned for anyone who violates the rules,” Attaullah said, adding that it was not right for people to hold meetings and then go on to peddle “Indian and Afghan stances and orchestrate posts against the army and the army chief”.
The minister added that a chance was provided, and now “the meeting has been banned for whoever committed the violation.”
Attaullah said the government would tolerate no more violations and would deal with anyone who did so with an iron hand.
“There is zero room for a circus.”
The law minister also said that the prison rules for allowing meetings were the same as always and laid out specific provisions that contained restrictions on how they should be conducted.
PTI slams press conference against Imran’s family
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram lashed out at what he described as “political clowns and puppets” for their “relentless campaign” against Imran and his family.
He said the onslaught “exposes the imposed and petrified regime’s sheer desperation to divert public attention from the chronic crises the country is grappling with as a result of its myopic, shortsighted, and self-serving policies”.
The PTI spokesperson expressed his astonishment that the “Sharif courtiers and political pawns” would now “presume to distribute certificates of patriotism and nationalism”, even though, he said, they were the very ones who hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Jati Umra and attended his family’s wedding functions.
Akram emphasised that the PTI founder never hosted any Pakistani adversaries in Bani Gala, nor did he establish business links with anti-Pakistani elements. He alleged that it was only the Sharif dynasty that compromised the country and state interests for its personal and business gains, showing little regard for the nation itself.
He made it clear that the “imposed regime’s false and fabricated rhetoric” was nothing more than a “desperate attempt to divert media and public attention, as self-serving sycophants have plunged the country headlong into the whirlwinds of economic, political, social and constitutional crises”.
Akram said that “disinformation minister Atta Tarar’s press conference was completely devoid of facts, driven by panic and dripping with political vengeance,” adding that it was a reflection of the ruling circle’s “fear” and what he called “Imran Khan phobia”.
He vowed that the “daily circus of jokers” unleashed to spew venom against Imran and the PTI may pollute the political environment, but it could no longer fool a nation that was now wide awake, fully aware of the real culprits and how state power was being weaponised for revenge.
Commenting on the government’s claims of providing all facilities to Imran, the PTI spokesperson asserted that the PTI patron-in-chief was kept in arbitrary detention under death-cell conditions in solitary confinement, being denied all entitlements as per jail rules.
He also blasted the “hybrid regime” for repeatedly denying meetings between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Imran, refusing access to personal physicians and preventing his sons from speaking with him for several months.
Akram stated that the hue and cry was a clear reflection that Imran remained a nightmare for them, so much so that they could not even sleep peacefully due to their “fear”.
He vowed that neither the nation’s leader nor the now-awakened public would allow these “fraudulently imposed rulers” to escape accountability for their crimes.
The PTI spokesperson asserted that the days of this “cabal of crooks” were numbered, and that soon the public would punish them for their “transgressions, corruption, theft of the public mandate, and tyranny”.
Akram reaffirmed that Imran and his party, together with the nation, would continue their just struggle to uphold democracy, the rule of law, constitutional supremacy and the independence of the judiciary.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637437-sindh-launches-e-marking-system-to-minimise-errors-in-examination-results' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh launches e-marking system to minimise errors in examination results</strong></a><br><p>

Two days after the envoys met Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Treasury Department partially suspended measures that Trump had announced in October when he finally vowed to get tough on Moscow.
The Treasury Department suspended until at least April 29 economic sanctions against Lukoil-branded gas stations outside of Russia.
A ban remains on place to prevent the money from flowing back to Russia, which has been under sweeping US and EU sanctions since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Trump’s sanctions had been one of the most concrete means to pressure Russia, which European diplomats accuse of trying to avoid pressure by pursuing negotiations.
Easing isolation
Steve Witkoff, Trump’s business partner-turned-roving global ambassador, and Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, will meet in the Miami area for dinner late Thursday with the top Ukrainian negotiator, Rustem Umerov, a US official said.
The gathering, which will be closed to the press, came two days after the Trump duo met with Putin for five hours, stretching into the early morning, in Moscow.
Trump said the envoys had a “reasonably good meeting” with Putin.Pressed on whether Witkoff and Kushner got any sense that Putin genuinely wanted to halt Russia’s nearly four-yearinvasion, Trump replied: “He would like to end the war. That was their impression.” But Putin showed no public signs of budging, as Russia makes slow but steady progress seizing land in eastern Ukraine.
“This is a complex task and a challenging mission that President Trump took upon himself,” Putin said of the diplomacy in an interview as he visited India.
“Achieving consensus among competing parties is no easy task, but President Trump, truly, I believe – he sincerely tries to do this,” he said, according to magazine India Today.
“I think we should engage with this effort rather than obstruct it.” Putin’s visit to India, a historic partner of Russia, comes as international isolation of him gradually eases.
Trump in August welcomed Putin to Alaska where they made no clear progress on ending the Ukraine conflict.
Critical time for Ukraine
Trump has previously mused that Russia will inevitably win more land and that Ukraine would be better off settling.
A first draft of the US plan would see Ukraine surrendering land that Russia has not been able to win on the battleground in return for security promises that fall short of Ukraine’s aspirations to join NATO.
Witkoff and Kushner have been working on modifications since meeting with the Ukrainians on November 23 in Geneva. The two sides met again the following week in Miami alongside Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
The talks come at a delicate time for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was hailed as a hero in the West at the start of the war but has had a tumultuous relationship with Trump.
Zelensky last week removed his top aide and negotiator Andriy Yermak, who days earlier had negotiated with Witkoff, as he came under investigation in a corruption scandal.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637438-rise-in-mild-karachi-earthquakes-prompts-calls-for-disaster-preparedness' target='_blank'><strong>Rise in mild Karachi earthquakes prompts calls for disaster preparedness</strong></a><br><p>

According to a senior intelligence officer, who spoke to Dawn on condition of anonymity, the report was an “an attempt to malign Pakistan”.
“There is not an iota of truth in it,” he stressed.
The official was referring to a claim made in the Amnesty International investigation, titled “Intellexa Leaks”, which described the story of a human rights lawyer based in Pakistan. The lawyer, according to the report, had approached Amnesty International in the summer of 2025 after receiving a suspicious link on WhatsApp from an unknown number.
Amnesty Security Lab investigated the link and identified it as a Predator attack attempt based on the technical behaviour of the infection server. Predator is a highly invasive spyware manufactured by the Israeli company Intellexa.
According to Amnesty International, the investigation was based on a combination of highly sensitive documents and other material leaked from the company, including internal company documents, sales and marketing materials, and training videos.
The months-long investigation was published in collaboration with Inside Story in Greece, Haaretz in Israel, and WAV Research Collective in Switzerland.
In 2023, Intellexa was fined by the Greek Data Protection Authority for failing to comply with its investigations into the company.
Google started sending spyware threat notifications to several hundred of its users across various countries, including Pakistan. The accounts were identified as Predator spyware targets.
How Predator works
Intellexa’s Predator relies on “1-click” attacks to infect a device, which require a malicious link to be opened in the target’s phone. The malicious link then loads a browser exploit for Chrome or Safari to gain initial access to the device and download the full spyware payload.
Once the spyware is installed, it can access encrypted instant messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, audio recordings, emails, device locations, screenshots and camera photos, stored passwords, contacts, and call logs. It also activates the device’s microphone.
The spyware then communicates with, and uploads surveillance data to, a Predator backend server physically located in the customer’s country.
All data from the spyware is first relayed through a chain of anonymization servers, termed the “CNC Anonymization Network” to prevent the risk of exposure for the operator with the 1-click attack link.
The surveillance company overcame the limitation of exposure by using different approaches to trigger the opening of an infection link on the target’s phone, without requiring the target to manually click the link.
Intellexa also developed a strategic infection vector, ‘Aladdin,’ which could enable silent zero-click infections of target devices anywhere in the world. The vector exploits the commercial mobile advertising ecosystem to carry out these infections.
Intellexa is a surveillance company that develops spyware, with Predator as its signature product, and sells it for use by governments. According to the investigation, the company’s internal operations remained largely unknown to researchers.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041813492133ed2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959155/in-meeting-with-uk-high-commissioner-naqvi-hands-over-extradition-papers-for-shahzad-akbar-and-adil-raja' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with UK high commissioner, Naqvi hands over extradition papers for Shahzad Akbar and Adil Raja</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met United Kingdom (UK) High Commissioner Jane Marriott on Thursday, where he handed over the extradition papers for former special assistant to the prime minister Shahzad Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja.
The development comes three days after Naqvi announced a crackdown on those involved in fake news, declaring that the government would repatriate from the UK YouTubers involved in this activity or the targeting of state institutions.
Currently, no formal extradition treaty exists between Pakistan and the UK, though Section 194 of the UK Extradition Act 2003 contains provisions for special “ad hoc” extradition arrangements.
According to a statement released by the interior ministry, Naqvi held an “important” meeting with Marriott in Islamabad, where the two discussed Pak-UK relations, security cooperation and issues of mutual interest.
Federal Secretary for Interior Muhammad Khurram Agha and other relevant officers were also present, it said. They also discussed the return of Pakistanis illegally residing in the UK, it added.
“The extradition papers for Akbar and Raja from the government of Pakistan were handed over [to Marriott],” the statement said.
“Both individuals are wanted in Pakistan. They should be handed over to Pakistan immediately,” Naqvi was quoted as saying.
He also provided evidence against Pakistani citizens who were spreading propaganda, the statement said.
“I fully believe in freedom of expression, but fake news is a problem for every country,” he said, as per the statement.
“No country can allow slander and defamation against state institutions from those sitting abroad,” the minister said. Naqvi also said that Pakistan would welcome British cooperation for the return of those who “spread anti-Pakistan propaganda”.
The statement further said that the interior ministry had initiated the extradition process through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Reacting to the news, Akbar took to social media platform x, “It has become increasingly clear that my publications, broadcasts, and political commentary on human rights abuses in Pakistan, the rise of authoritarianism, unconstitutional amendments, and the current impasse over military appointments have deeply angered the regime.”
Tagging Marriott as well as the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), he said, “I urge you to note that, as I have repeatedly stated, the worst forms of retaliation have already been used against me, including the abduction of my family members in Pakistan and an acid attack against me here in the UK.”
In 2023, Akbar said he was attacked at his England home, adding that “acidic liquid” was thrown at him. He had initiated legal action against the Pakistan government last year, after which the Foreign Office said the claims by Akbar were “simply preposterous”.
“I trust that UK authorities will uphold due process, rule of law, and human-rights obligations,” he said.







“The Pakistani regime’s standing on the world stage is reflected in its failing economy, rampant corruption, and poor governance — all of which were detailed in the recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) review,” said Raja, while responding to Akbar.
“They may call the British High Commissioner to complain, but such a complaint is itself unlawful under UK statutes, as we have committed no wrongdoing,” he said.







Both Akbar and Raja have been residing in the UK. Raja, who is also a former Pakistan Army officer and has positioned himself as a whistleblower, was ordered to pay £350,000 in damages and legal costs after a London high court ruled he had defamed a former intelligence officer with unfounded allegations of corruption and electoral interference.
Akbar also runs his own YouTube channel, where he comments on Pakistan’s political developments.
Naqvi announces crackdown on fake news mongers
In his press conference on Monday, the interior minister had said the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) and the information ministry will jointly initiate action on a massive scale against those spreading fake news.
“The state will no longer allow individuals to declare a living person dead, a dead person alive (a reference to fake news about the health of Imran Khan), or make any allegation they please without evidence. Since the past few days, 90 per cent news on social media was fake,” Naqvi told a press conference in Lahore.
The remarks had come as social media was abuzz with reports about the health of former prime minister Imran Khan.
Naqvi had singled out some so-called social media journalists for spreading fake news.
“Mainstream journalists are a part of a strong editorial system unlike those on social media who spread fake news. We will not allow anyone to create panic in the garb of journalism on social media. Those who spread fake news are not journalists for us. The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) takes action on incorrect reporting in the mainstream media but social media lacks accountability mechanisms,” he explained and added that a regulatory body for online content was being established.
When asked about criticism directed towards Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Gen Asim Munir, Naqvi said: “The state is clear. We will not spare them. The other day someone was saying in London that there was a dispute within the institutions. This will have to stop. Those sitting out there (UK) will be brought back soon.”</p><small>2025-12-04 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/04221352049af93.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959164/russias-putin-in-india-for-defence-trade-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Russia’s Putin in India for defence, trade talks</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in India on Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at deepening defence ties, as New Delhi faces heavy US pressure to stop buying oil from Moscow.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at the airport to welcome the Russian leader in person, greeting him on the red carpet with a hug, before riding together in the same car.

Putin, on his first visit to India since the Ukraine war, is accompanied by his Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, with possible deals on fighter jets and air defence systems expected to be discussed.
In an interview with India Today, Putin said he was “very happy” to be meeting “my friend” Modi.
“The range of our cooperation with India is huge,” he said in remarks translated by the broadcaster, citing ship and aircraft manufacturing, nuclear energy and space exploration.
The Indian premier said he was “delighted to welcome my friend, President Putin to India”.
“Looking forward to our interactions later this evening and tomorrow,” Modi said in a post on X.
He will host Putin for a private dinner on Thursday evening, followed by a summit meeting on Friday.
“India-Russia friendship is a time tested one that has greatly benefitted our people,” Modi added, posting a picture of them from inside the car.
Trade relations are expected to feature prominently as India walks a diplomatic tightrope – relying on strategic Russian oil imports while trying not to provoke US President Donald Trump during ongoing tariff negotiations.
Energy imports
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said talks to expand the supply of Russia’s advanced S-400 air defence systems had an “important place on the agenda”.
Indian media reports suggested Moscow may also offer co-production of Russia’s Su-57 fighter jets.
India is one of the world’s top arms importers, and Russia has long been a principal supplier.
But New Delhi has also sought alternative suppliers, as well as boosting domestic production – with the Russian share of India’s arms imports falling from 76 percent in 2009-13 to 36 percent in 2019-23, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
Putin’s visit comes after Trump imposed 50-percent tariffs on most Indian products in August, citing Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil – revenue Washington argues helps fund the war in Ukraine.
India, the world’s most populous nation, has become a major buyer of Russian oil, saving itself billions of dollars and providing Moscow with a much-needed export market after it was cut off from traditional buyers in Europe because of the war.
But Delhi has recently cut down on crude imports under pressure from sanctions on Russia’s top oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil.
The Indian government fears any fresh energy or defence deals with Russia could irk Trump, with possible ramifications on trade negotiations with Washington.
Peskov said Moscow wanted to “maintain and increase the volume of our bilateral business with India, without allowing anyone to interfere”.
Nandan Unnikrishnan, of the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation, told AFP: “There may be some reduction in energy purchases – under US pressure – but the overall direction of the ties will be maintained because both countries need each other at the strategic level.”
‘Critical moment’
A senior Indian foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a need to address the trade imbalance “one way or the other”.
Bilateral trade reached $68.7 billion in 2024-25 – almost six times higher than the pre-pandemic levels – but Indian exports accounted for only $4.88 billion.

Delhi has been pressing Moscow for expanded market access for its key industries including pharmaceuticals, automobiles and the service sector.
Harsh V Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London, said the visit was an attempt by “to reset their relationship at a critical geopolitical moment for both”.
“For India, the optics is a statement of intent for strategic autonomy, and Putin, who rarely travels, is sending a message about the importance of the relationship by travelling here,” Pant told AFP.
The Indian foreign ministry official described the ties between Moscow and Delhi as the “most stable relationship in modern times”.
The official acknowledged the global geopolitical significance, but insisted that the meeting should seen in the context as “just another annual summit”.</p><small>2025-12-04 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637432-cdf-field-marshal-asim-munir-a-brief-profile' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Asim Munir — a brief profile</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement from the Chief Minister’s Secretariat, the decision was made during a high-level meeting under the chairmanship of CM Sarfaraz Bugti. During the meeting, officials presented evidence of links between overseas leadership of banned outfits and their local networks through call recordings.
“After reviewing the material, the provincial government approved stringent and extraordinary measures to dismantle the outfits and tighten the noose around their operatives.
“The provincial government, therefore, decided that it would seek Interpol’s assistance to nab the suspected terrorists who took refuge outside Pakistan,” the statement said.
Interpol, or the International Criminal Police Organisation, is the world’s largest international police body, dedicated to helping police in 196 member countries cooperate to combat crime and promote security.
During the meeting, it was also decided to expedite registered cases against the leadership of banned groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), United Baloch Army, Baloch Revolution Group and Lashkar-i-Balochistan.
“The chief minister directed relevant departments to speed up the process of issuing Interpol red notices with support from the interior and foreign ministries,” the statement added.
The crackdown, it added, will target both local facilitators and commanders operating from abroad, under the guidelines provided in the Provincial Action Plan.
CM Bugti instructed the home department to activate the specialised cell set up under the plan, enforce new anti-terrorism laws, and compile a complete list of leaders and facilitators, ensuring that evidence becomes part of the official record.
Bugti said that the provincial government, in coordination with the centre, would present the evidence at international forums to initiate strong legal action.
“Eliminating the elements challenging the writ of the state has become inevitable and has entered a decisive stage,” the statement quoted him as saying.
“There will be no compromise on peace, protection of citizens, and the dignity of the state,” he said.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened over the last few months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. Last Sunday, the Frontier Corps headquarters in Nokundi, a town in Chagai district, came under attack.</p><small>2025-12-04 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0416452432431d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959160/police-block-routes-to-karachi-press-club-detain-activist-ahead-of-aurat-march-press-conference' target='_blank'><strong>Police block routes to Karachi Press Club, detain activist ahead of Aurat March press conference</strong></a><br><p>Police on Thursday blocked routes leading to the Karachi Press Club ahead of a press conference by Aurat March over the alleged “abduction” of two Baloch girls and briefly detained an activist, with organisers claiming that other members were also manhandled.
Aurat March, a women’s rights group, was set to hold a press conference at 3pm over the alleged “abduction” of two Baloch girls — 15-year-old Nasreen Baloch and 24-year-old Mahjabeen Baloch.
Authorities closed off roads leading to KPC ahead of the press conference, which eventually began with a delay of approximately 20 minutes as the organisers said they were “stopped by the police” at the gate of the press club.
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) member Qazi Khizar said an activist named Sara was taken by the police from outside the KPC. Within a few hours, Aurat March confirmed to Dawn that she had been released.
Dawn has reached out to the police for a comment on the detention.
Senior journalist Dodal Chandio said in a post on Facebook that “police stopped the Aurat March women who were to hold a press conference” outside the KPC.



The police “misbehaved” with activist Sheema Kirmani, he added. In the video he shared, Kirmani could be heard saying, “You have no right to touch me. How dare you touch me?”
The video also showed policewomen grabbing another woman’s hand to detain her, as Kirmani told the cops that the woman was a reporter. As the tussle between them and the police continued, the woman said, “Let go of my hand. This is not a legal process.”
In other videos that surfaced on social media, the woman identified herself as Shakeela and a member of “JMDC, Joint Minority Development”. She showed a “slip” issued to her for the press conference, which was being attended by “10 people” from her group.







Journalist Zofeen Ebrahim, who was barred from attending the press conference, recalled to Dawn: “Police stationed outside KPC stopped me and asked me where I was going.
“I told them I am here for the press conference, to which they said that it is not going to happen,” she continued.
Ebrahim said that when she tried to make her way towards the KPC and was stopped by the police, she called the organisers to ask whether the press conference had been cancelled. “They also did not know what was going on,” she said.
“Some other women who were trying to enter were stopped at the gate as well,” the journalist added.
She also shared a video on X, asking, “What’s happening to my city, my country?”







Prior to the press conference, the Karachi police also heightened security outside the KPC, with a considerable number of women personnel present, a Dawn correspondent reported. The nearby roads that had been shut to traffic were reopened by about 5pm.
In a press release issued yesterday, Aurat March had said their press conference would “address the escalating pattern of enforced disappearances in Balochistan — particularly the alarming rise in the abduction of Baloch women and girls”.
“The 4th Schedule has become a tool of coercion in Balochistan, with women — many of them entirely unaffiliated with activism — being placed on the list and denied freedom of movement,” the statement read.
On November 27, police had detained 24 PTI leaders and workers following a protest at KPC to voice their concerns over former prime minister Imran Khan’s well-being.
A week before that, the police had detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the venue of a scheduled protest by the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) against the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In March, Karachi police had arrested six people at Fawara Chowk as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) attempted to reach the KPC for a protest against the arrests of its leadership.
Civil society seeks recovery of Mahjabeen Baloch, teenage Nasreen Baloch
Aurat March’s press conference highlighted two cases — one of Nasreen who the group said was “abducted from Hub” in Balochistan in November, and another of Mahjabeen who was “taken from Quetta” earlier this year.
Mahjabeen, the daughter of Ghulam Mustafa and a student of the University of Balochistan, was picked up from Quetta’s Civil Hospital in May, as per the Voice for Baloch Missing Persons (VBMP) Chairman Nasrullah Baloch.

At the outset of the press conference, Kirmani said she was “grabbed and pushed around” by police outside and questioned why the state was stopping them from holding a press conference.
“What right did the state have to stop them from demanding the recovery of young Baloch girls?” she asked.
“Are you a fascist government or a democratic government? What are you scared of?” Kirmani said furiously, adding that by meting out such treatment, the state was creating an atmosphere of hatred.
Aurat March organiser Moneeza Ahmed asked, “Why are the families of Nasreena and Mahjabeen not even being allowed to ask the state about the whereabouts of their daughters?”
She alleged that the state was attempting to intimidate activists and families of the missing young girls. “To what extent is the state willing to go?” Ahmed wondered.
Kirmani claimed that police had also attempted to arrest BYC activist Sammi Deen Baloch as she made her way to the press conference.

 

“The Baloch women have repeatedly stated that they have no relation to BLA, yet the state continues to harass them,” she lamented, referring to the banned so-called Baloch Liberation Army.
Addressing the press conference, Khizer noted that “at the moment, KPC is surrounded by police from every corner”. “This is fear,” the vice chairman of the HRCP’s Sindh chapter added.
He stressed that the “young Baloch girls fighting for their rights and those [militants] in remote mountains were not the same”.
“The state has now resorted to picking up young girls,” he alleged, expressing his disappointment.
Kirmani called on the government to “negotiate”, asking, “Why should they not know where their daughters are?”

 

“Seven months have gone by ever since she has been gone, and we don’t know anything,” she said, referring to Mahjabeen. “Why are we not allowed to ask about their whereabouts?” she questioned.
The activists demanded the “immediate recovery and safe return of both the girls, an end to enforced disappearances, protection for families of missing persons, and transparency from state institutions”.</p><small>2025-12-04 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0420494094a36f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959179/saudi-arabia-rolls-over-3bn-deposit-for-another-year' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia rolls over $3bn deposit for another year</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Thursday that Saudi Arabia has agreed to extend the $3 billion deposit held with the bank for another year.

“The extension of the term of the deposit is a continuation of the support provided by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which will help in strengthening the foreign exchange reserves of Pakistan and contribute to the country’s economic growth and development,” the bank said.







The $3bn deposit was initially agreed upon in 2021 and rolled over in 2022, 2023 and 2024.
Last week, the SBP said its forei­­gn exchange reserves rose by a meagre $9 million to $14.560bn during the week ending Nov 21.
However, the country’s total liquid foreign reserves decreased to $19.605bn from the previous week’s $19.738bn due to a decline in commercial banks’ foreign exchange holdings, which fell from $5.186bn to $5.044bn in the latest week.

Starc’s six-wicket haul on day one of the second Ashes Test in Brisbane gave him 418 Test wickets, four more than Wasim.
“Wasim’s still a far better bowler than I am,” said Starc.
“So as far as I’m concerned, he’s still the pinnacle of left-armers and certainly he’s right up there with the best bowlers to ever play the game.
“It’s nice to be spoken of up around that, but I’ll just try to keep churning a few out.” Starc led the Australian attack in the day-night match at the Gabba in the absence of his usual strike partners Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, who are injured, and spinner Nathan Lyon, who was dropped.







“I don’t think I’ve ever played in an attack without one of the three of them playing,” Starc said. “So it’s a little bit different in that regard.”
The 35-year-old, who has taken 16 wickets in the series, was the only Australian bowler to trouble the English batsmen consistently on Thursday.
Starc went past Wasim’s mark when he bagged England’s Harry Brook, caught at slip, for his 415th wicket and third of the innings.
Wasim, widely recognised as the greatest left-arm bowler the sport has seen, played 104 Tests for his 414 wickets.
Starc, who made his debut at the Gabba 14 years ago, was playing his 102nd Test and shows no sign of slowing down.
He took a career-best 7-58 in the first innings of the opening Ashes Test at Perth.
Starc is now 15th on the all-time wicket-taker list after moving above Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh’s total of 417.
He now has South Africa’s Shaun Pollock (421) in his sights and New Zealand’s Richard Hadlee (431).
He needs just 16 more wickets to go past the most prolific left-arm bowler of all-time — Sri Lanka spinner Rangana Herath, who claimed 433 wickets.</p><small>2025-12-04 14:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637401-karachi-to-get-another-nadra-mega-centre' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to get another Nadra mega centre</strong></a><br><p>

Jaan Shah Shafi, who entered the US in 2021 under former president Joe Biden’s Operation Allies Welcome, “provided support to the ISIS-K. He also provided weapons to his father, who is a commander of a militia group in Afghanistan,” the press release stated.
It further stated that Shafi applied for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), but his application was terminated once DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ended TPS for Afghans. He was arrested in Waynesboro, Virginia.
The Trump administration halted the Afghan refugee resettlement program on January 20 and suspended the entry of Afghan nationals, for “protection and safety of Americans”.
Nearly 190,000 Afghan nationals entered the US during Biden administration, the statement read.
Lakanwal, who worked alongside US forces in Afghanistan, is accused of shooting two National Guard soldiers near White House last week, according to US media.
Another Afghan man Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was charged with threatening to build a bomb and carry out a suicide attack, according to the US officials.</p><small>2025-12-04 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/04164416b5ea3e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959163/kp-cm-sohail-afridi-denied-access-for-9th-time-to-meet-imran-khan-at-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Sohail Afridi denied access for ‘9th’ time to meet Imran Khan at Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was prevented for the ninth time by prison authorities from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail on Thursday.
Imran’s sister Uzma Khan met the party founder in prison on Tuesday after weeks of effort, with CM Afridi and other party leaders scheduled to meet him today. The meeting took place as rumours regarding Imran’s health began circulating in local and foreign media, despite claims by the government and PTI leaders that the former prime minister was in good health.
These speculations, however, gained traction due to the government’s reluctance to let visitors, including his family members and legal team, meet Imran over the past few weeks.
According to a post on X by the PTI, CM Afridi went to Adiala jail to visit Imran, but access was not granted.
Afridi addressed the media outside the prison after the continued lack of access. He said he would update the media on the immediate course of action — whether he would stage a sit-in or not.







The PTI also shared a video of the KP CM and his delegation in a waiting room, saying that today was the ninth instance of Afridi not being allowed to meet Imran.







In a talk with the media after exiting the room, CM Afridi said: “I think the meeting is not being allowed. Today is the ninth time I have come; a chief minister of a province is repeatedly coming, but even a five-minute meeting is not being allowed. The whole world is witnessing this discriminatory treatment, and their actions are being noted and will be remembered.”
“This government won’t remain forever and then no one will get a chance to complain.”
When asked if he planned to spend another night outside the prison in protest, he said that Imran’s good physical health had been confirmed in the meeting with Uzma. He added that the party would now devise its next course of action regarding concerns about the party founder’s mental duress.
“I have been told to play on the front foot, and there are instructions that the umpires are colluding, so be careful. So we will play on the front foot and also keep a watch on the umpires.”
The provincial chief executive said the continued denial of a meeting showed that “our coming here pains them, so we will mete out that pain again and again.” CM Afridi said street protests were certainly an option for the party, as per the law and Constitution.
On a question about the possible imposition of governor’s rule in KP, Afridi responded: “What are they waiting for … impose it today. We are not afraid of any governor’s rule.”
“They will not be able to control and handle the conditions that I am foreseeing,” warned KP CM.
He also lashed out at the government for not being able to tolerate and bear a chief minister from the tribal areas for the first time. Afridi said removing him would cause anger and frustration among the people from the tribal belt.
“The people of KP and Pakistan see their future in me,” Afridi claimed, adding that the governor’s rule would be a “win-win” situation for him since he would be able to operate freely.
The KP CM said he would visit Punjab soon.



Visuals shared by the party showed a large group of supporters gathered outside the prison as well.

An initial statement by the rescue service said, “As soon as the Central Command and Control of the Rescue 1122 received the information, a fire and rescue team, along with an ambulance and a fire brigade truck, were dispatched to the scene.”
It added that the team was trying to bring the fire under control.
An update by Rescue 1122 later said the factory’s building had collapsed due to the intensity of the fire, adding that two firefighters had been injured due to the collapse.
They were being provided first aid, the statement said.
Separately, a statement by Sukkan police said that the fire erupted in a warehouse and no casualties had been reported thus far.
Further investigation was under way, the statement added.

The premier made the remarks as he addressed the media in Islamabad alongside Kyrgyzstan President Sadyr Zhaparov, following discussions between the two leaders.
Zhaparov arrived in Islamabad yesterday on a two-day maiden visit to Pakistan. PM Shehbaz said in a post on X that the visit was the first by a Kyrgyz president in 20 years.
Detailing the discussions held today, the prime minister said that Kyrgyzstan was a landlocked country and therefore, “Pakistan stands ready to provide Kyrgyz Republic access to regional and global markets through our ports of Karachi, Bin Qasim and Gwadar”.

“During our fruitful discussions today, we had a detailed exchange on […] bilateral relations as well as important regional and international developments,” PM Shehbaz said about his meeting with Zharapov.
Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, intelligence chief and National Security Adviser Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik, and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, alongside others, were present at that and another delegation-level meeting, visuals showed.







“We have reaffirmed today, and of course in no uncertain terms, our shared resolve to elevate Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan relations to a much higher level by enhancing collaboration in political, trade, connectivity, energy, agriculture, education, defence, and of course, in cultural domains.”
The prime minister noted that a business forum would be held later today to “chart new pathways for proactive collaboration in vital sectors of economic cooperation”.
PM Shehbaz said that the business forum, comprising the business community from both sides, will be akin to “signing an MoU which is worth $200 million”, pledging to increase mutual trade from the current $15-16m to $200m in the next two years.
The bilateral trade volume had declined significantly from $11.2m in 2022-23 to $5.18m in 2024-25.

 

PM Shehbaz called Islamabad the Kyrgyz president’s “second home”. “There cannot be a better moment of joy and bliss for all of us.”
Noting that a Kyrgyz president was visiting Pakistan after a period of 20 years, the premier said that “this gap between two brotherly countries is not acceptable”. “As I said, it’s never too late,” he added, extending the visiting dignitary a warm welcome.
Stating that the two nations had “timeless” links, the prime minister said the people of both countries were connected “not only by geography but by centuries of caravans, and ideas of faiths and friendships”.
“Our discussions also highlighted the need to strengthen people-to-people exchanges through cultural initiatives, tourism promotion, and academic partnerships,” the premier said, adding that they agreed to hold cultural events in Islamabad and other parts of Pakistan, as well as similar activities in Bishkek.
“Our interaction today is far more than a meeting between two brothers whose hearts beat in unison. It is as though the ancient Karakoram and the majestic Ala-Too stretch out across the horizon to embrace one another,” PM Shehbaz said.
He expressed the confidence that the visit will “most definitely give a fresh impetus to our already strong bilateral relations in all fields of mutual interaction”.
The prime minister thanked the Kyrgyz president and his delegation for their “commitment to strengthening our bilateral relations”.
“May the radiant sun of Kyrgyzstan and the guiding glow of Pakistan’s crescent and star unite to illuminate a future between our two countries of enduring peace, shared prosperity and hope for both the peoples and, of course our region, and the world beyond.”
Zhaparov calls Pakistan ‘important partner’
In his remarks, President Zhaparov appreciated the Pakistani government and its people for their “warm reception and generous hospitality”. He also confirmed that his visit was the first by a head of Kyrgyzstan in 20 years.
“I would like to emphasise that Pakistan is an important partner of Kyrgyzstan in South Asia,” Zhaparov said. He later also termed Pakistan a “brotherly country and a reliable partner”.
“I view Pakistan’s dynamic development, its growing economic potential and its ambitious infrastructure projects as a testament to the prime minister’s effective leadership,” he added.



Zhaparov noted that he and PM Shehbaz held “extensive discussions on the current agenda and future prospects of the Kyrgyz-Pakistani cooperation”.
“We paid special attention to activating collaboration in trade, economy, investment, transport, logistics, education and science,” he detailed. “We attach particular importance to further developing the Kyrgyz-Pakistan Business Council as an effective mechanism for bringing together the business communities of both countries.”
The visiting dignitary further said he considered the “full use of the transport and transit potential of Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan to be one of the most important areas of our partnership”.
Zhaparov also mentioned the Central Asia-South Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project (CASA-1000), saying it would “serve as a cornerstone in establishing a unified energy system between Central and South Asia”.

 

The $1.2 billion regional power project — designed to bring the benefits of interconnectivity to Tajikistan, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan — is expected to become operational by January 2027, as per a Tajik minister.
Speaking on academic cooperation, Zhaparov noted that more than 12,000 Pakistani students were studying at higher education institutions in Kyrgyzstan.
“In the field of security, we reaffirmed our shared commitment to combating terrorism, extremism and transnational crime,” he said, adding that both countries also agreed to strengthen coordination between the “competent authorities to ensure peace, stability and security in the region”.
Zhaparov extended an invitation to PM Shehbaz to pay a state visit to Kyrgyzstan when convenient for him.
He also invited the prime minister as a guest of honour to the 2026 Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit that will take place in Bishkek, as well as to the World Nomad Games 2026.
15 MoUs signed
Separately, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan signed 15 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) in various fields, including commerce, energy and health, to boost bilateral cooperation between the two nations.
The exchange of MoUs took place in Islamabad, with PM Shehbaz, Zhaparov and ministers from both sides present at the signing ceremony.

Following the inking of the MoUs, PM Shehbaz and Zhaparov also signed a joint statement on the strengthening of “comprehensive cooperation” in the interest of both countries.
The prime minister said the MoUs would “serve as a framework for structured result-oriented engagement and closer institutional linkages between our two countries”.
An MoU between Pakistan’s Foreign Services Academy and the Diplomatic Academy of Kyrgyzstan was exchanged by Foreign Minister Dar and his Kyrgyz counterpart Zheenbek Kulubayev.
Kulubayev also exchanged an MoU in the field of mining and geosciences with Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik.
Power Minister Awais Leghari also exchanged an MoU with Energy Minister Taalaibek Ibraev on cooperation in the energy sector.

 

An MoU between both countries’ commerce ministries was exchanged by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan and his Kyrgyz counterpart Bakyt Sydykov.
Sydykov and Railways Minister Bilal Azhar Kayani also inked an MoU for cooperation in utilising Pakistan’s ports for regional connectivity.
The Kyrgyz FM exchanged an MoU with Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Khan Cheema on cooperation in agriculture, and another pact with Kamal on the establishment of an electronic data interchange between the customs services of both countries.
An agreement was also exchanged by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Kyrgyz Prosecutor General Maksat Asanaliev on the transfer of convicted persons to prisons to serve their sentence.
Sydykov also exchanged an MoU with Rana Sanaullah, minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC), on cooperation in the sphere of tourism.

 

Another pact was signed about surgical instruments, exchanged by Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath, minister of state for National Health Services, and Kulubayev.
An agreement in the field of culture was inked by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and his Kyrgyz counterpart Mirbek Mambetaliev.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar exchanged an MoU with Kulubayev for cooperation between the justice ministries of the two countries.
A pact was signed to establish sister city relations between both countries’ federal capitals, exchanged by Chaudhry and Bishkek Mayor Aibek Junushaliev.







An MoU was exchanged between the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme and Kyrgyzstan’s Culture, Information and Youth Policy Ministry, signed by the programme’s head, Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan, and Mambetaliev.
Finally, the director of the National University of Modern Languages (NUML), retired Major Gen Shahid Mahmood Kayani, and Kyrgyz Ambassador to Pakistan Kylychbek Sultan exchanged an MoU between NUML and the Diplomatic Academy of the Kyrgyz foreign ministry.
In the morning, a formal welcome ceremony in honour of Zhaparov was held at Prime Minister House in Islamabad, Radio Pakistan reported. PM Shehbaz received the Kyrgyz president upon his arrival.
A smartly turned out contingent of armed forces presented a guard of honour to the visiting dignitary, and both countries’ national anthems were played on the occasion.



Dar meets Kyrgyz president
Earlier today, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met Zhaparov and reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
Dar called on President Zhaparov and welcomed his delegation to Pakistan, the FO said in a post on X. It added that Dar conveyed the “warm greetings” of President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz.







“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong commitment, at the highest political level, to further strengthening Pak–Kyrgyz relations in all areas of mutual interest,” the FO added.
Dar also briefed Zhaparov on his planned engagements with Pakistan’s leadership, interactions with both countries’ business communities, and discussions aimed at advancing broad-based bilateral cooperation.
Dar had also welcomed Kyrgyz FM Zheenbek Kulubaev at the FO yesterday, where the two held “important consultations ranging over areas of mutual interest”.







Pakistan and the Kyrgyz Republic share longstanding relations, founded on deep-rooted cultural, historical, and spiritual affinities.
The two countries had agreed to promote bilateral cooperation in cryptocurrency, blockchain technology and digital finance in August.
In July, they reaffirmed an agreement to increase bilateral trade to $100 million at a session of their intergovernmental commission.
Alongside bilateral relations, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan are both members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa­tion, a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose other members include China, Russia, India, and Iran.</p><small>2025-12-04 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041602065d59cdc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959158/whats-in-a-name-how-koreans-faked-their-way-to-kim-lee-and-park' target='_blank'><strong>What’s in a name? How Koreans faked their way to Kim, Lee and Park</strong></a><br><p>If you meet a South Korean, there‘s a 45 per cent chance that their surname is either Kim, Lee or Park. And there’s an even higher probability — some say nearly 90 per cent — that their surname originates from a bogus family tree.
According to the latest census data from Statistics Korea, these three surnames account for nearly half the population, which is over 20 million people. Expand that to the top 10 surnames, and you’re looking at 64 per cent of the population.
This remarkable concentration has given rise to the Korean expression, “finding Mr Kim in Seoul,” to describe an impossible task — something akin to finding a needle in a haystack.
Name game
Korean family names may seem simple at first glance. Most are a single syllable, with a staggering concentration of a few popular names rarely seen elsewhere.
However, there are many sub-branches even within the same surname. Each surname is associated with a clan name, which indicates the name‘s regional origin or ancestral hometown. Although there are traditionally only 288 surnames, they are connected to over 4,000 different clans.
For example, a person surnamed Kim could belong to the Gimhae Kim clan, the Gyeongju Kim clan or the Andong Kim clan, each representing the supposed birthplace of the first ancestor to ever bear the name.
Many families keep family records known as “jokbo” to trace this intricate genealogy dating back centuries or even millennia. But the accuracy of these cherished family trees is often, shall we say, questionable.
Questionable because, for much of the Korean Peninsula‘s 5,000-year history, most people lived without surnames.
According to historians, in ancient times, family names were reserved exclusively for royals and nobles. It wasn‘t until the Goryeo era (918-1392) that surnames began to filter down to the general population.
By the late 10th century, even most commoners had acquired at least a clan name, if not a proper surname. But the lowest class, including slaves, butchers and shamans, remained without surnames or clan names until much later.
Enter the early Joseon era (1392–1910), a period marked by the transition to a Neo-Confucian hierarchy with four classes, devastating wars and some seriously creative record-keeping.
As the kingdom struggled to fill the coffers after major conflicts like the Imjin War (1592-1598) and the Qing invasion of 1636, they hit upon a novel idea: selling positions and aristocrat status to commoners.
Following the aftermath of the Imjin War, the government, desperate for funds, began selling away government positions in earnest. This practice expanded significantly over subsequent decades, particularly during times of crisis or conflict when the state coffers ran low.
By the late 17th century, the floodgates had opened. Men with enough resources could buy their way into the privileged “yangban” class, complete with exemptions from taxes, military service and other pesky obligations.
And what better way for a man to cement his newly purchased status than by cooking up an illustrious family history?
Fabricating family trees, or jokbo, hence became a popular practice among the masses from the middle to the end of the Joseon era. The newly minted yangban began inserting their names into others‘ prominent family trees, claiming ancestry from prestigious clans and regions.
The more creative among them listed their earliest ancestors as hailing from China —  a convenient way to avoid any awkward cross-checking.
By the late Joseon era, jokbo forgery had become a full-blown industry. The Veritable Records of the Joseon Dynasty even document a case from 1764 where a bureaucrat was caught running a full-blown counterfeiting operation.
Every man’s surname
More importantly, this period of flux also saw the expansion of surname usage to the lowest classes.
As the government‘s practice of selling positions extended to men at all levels of society, those in the lowest class found an unprecedented opportunity. For a payment in kind, they could now purchase commoner status, which came with the right to adopt surnames.
This development marked a significant erosion of the class hierarchy that had defined the early Joseon era. By the time its class system was officially abolished in 1894, nearly everyone had a surname as we know it today.
This trend is evident in historical records: A longitudinal study of the Danseong prefecture (now Sancheong-gun, South Gyeongsang Province) census register shows that the percentage of households without surnames dropped from 45 per cent in 1681 to just 6 per cent in 1816.
In the end, while most Koreans now share a handful of common surnames, these names carry within them a legacy of striving for social mobility and reinvention — faking it if necessary.
For those who might wonder if Koreans today care about the authenticity of their genealogy, the answer is: not so much. With so many people sharing the same family names, distinctions based on claims of Joseon-era noble status — genuine or not — have diminished in importance.
After all, in contemporary Korea, social status tends to depend less on one‘s great-great-grandfather’s titles and more on the wealth of one‘s parents, one’s educational background and professional achievements.
So, the next time you meet a Kim, Lee or Park here — which will probably be within the next minute — just remember their ancestral claims might be a bit more imaginative than they appear.

Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka, who was presiding over the proceedings, also rejected an application moved by Mazari and her husband, co-accused Hadi Ali Chattha, challenging the appointment of a counsel by the state to represent them in the case registered with the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA).
Both of them have been accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
At the hearing today, Mazari and Chattha, along with lawyer Sher Afzal Marwat, Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) President Naeem Ali Gujjar, Islamabad Bar Council member Raja Aleem Abbasi and other legal representatives, appeared before the court.
The court’s previous orders were read out to Marwat, who presented arguments challenging the appointment of a counsel by the state to represent Mazari and Chattha.
He contended that under relevant rules, a lawyer should have at least five years of practice in criminal cases for such an appointment. He further argued that the accused, too, must have confidence in the counsel appointed for them.
Marwat cited several Supreme Court judgments in support of his arguments.
Abbasi endorsed the arguments presented by Marwat, pointing out that the accused had “explicitly expressed a lack of confidence” in the state-appointed counsel.
Mazari and Chattha have been objecting to the appointment of a counsel by the state to represent them in the case, with Mazari even alleging at one instance that the court had “forcibly appointed [a] state defence counsel”.
During a previous hearing on November 29, she had a heated exchange with the state-appointed counsel and accused him of being a “tout”.
The examination of the prosecution’s witnesses was also completed during that hearing.
Abbasi, however, urged the court today to recall the prosecution’s witnesses, saying that the defence should be allowed to conduct a “surgery” through proper cross-examination.
For his part, Gujjar complained about “heavy police presence and the treatment of lawyers” at previous hearings.
He requested the court to treat the case against Mazari and Chattha “as a routine case” and summon the witnesses again to “ensure fairness”.
Then, Marwat sought more time from the court, saying that “things might improve if proceedings are reset”.
After the completion of arguments on the application challenging the appointment of a counsel by the state for Mazari and Chattha, the court reserved its decision on the matter and later dismissed it.
Subsequently, it also dismissed an application submitted by Mazari at the hearing on November 29 for her acquittal. The court has already rejected Chattha’s acquittal application.
Separately, IBA President Gujjar submitted a power of attorney to the court to represent Mazari and Chattha.
At that instance, Judge Majoka also enquired about the recording of statements by the accused under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
Before concluding the November 29 hearing, Judge Majoka had directed the prosecution to prepare and submit the questionnaire under Section 342 of the CrPC to the accused by December 4 (today) and instructed Mazari and Chattha to submit their replies.
Upon his enquiry today, Chattha told him that they had not received a copy of the questionnaire yet. At that, the judge assured that a typed copy would be provided to the accused by 10am.
The next hearing of the case will be held tomorrow.
Mazari urges SC to urgently take up plea against denial of interim relief
Separately, Mazari today rushed an application before the SC, urging it to take up, preferably by tomorrow, her and Chattha’s joint appeal against the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) denial of interim relief to them in the social media post case.
On December 1, the IHC had issued notices but denied ad-interim relief of staying the trial without a just legal cause.
Subsequently, Mazari and Chattha had moved a joint appeal yesterday before the SC through their counsel Faisal Siddiqi under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, seeking to set aside the IHC order.
Now in their fresh application before the SC, the lawyers reiterated their request before the SC and pleaded that the criminal trial against them was at its concluding stage, highlighting extreme urgency in the matter.
Therefore, Mazari and Chattha urged the SC to fix the hearing by December 5 (tomorrow).

 

The application contended that the petitioners had filed a criminal revision before the IHC to question the trial proceedings in view of violations of due process as prescribed under CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in the absence of the petitioners.
The plea argued that the petitioners have a clear prima facie case because the recording of evidence in their absence was not only a violation of Section 353 (evidence to be taken in presence of accused) of the CrPC, but also their due process and fair trial rights under Article 10A of the Constitution.
As the criminal trial is at its concluding stage, the balance of convenience is in favour of the petitioners because the prosecution would not be prejudiced if the trial is delayed for two weeks, the application argued.
However, it added, the criminal revision application filed by the petitioners before the IHC would become infructuous due to the lack of a grant of ad-interim relief to stay the trial.
Thus, the petitioners would suffer irreparable loss not only because the criminal revision application would become infructuous, but more importantly because of the gross violations of due process and principles of fair trial.
It is obvious and apparent that this unfair trial is leading to a criminal conviction of the petitioners, the application said.

 

It recalled Judge Majoka’s November 29 order — wherein Chattha’s acquittal plea had been denied — and said it “clearly showed” that the criminal trial was at the stage of recording of statements under Section 342 of CrPC, adding that there was a “clear and present danger” that this unfair trial would conclude in Mazari and her husband’s criminal conviction.
Thus, the present criminal appeal will become infructuous, the application argued.
It highlighted that in terms of Section 7 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, it is expressly stated that any application pleading urgency will be fixed for hearing within a period of 14 days.
Even otherwise, this is a criminal appeal involving the liberty of the petitioners and therefore should be treated urgently in terms of the policy of urgent applications before the SC, the plea contended.
“Failing an urgency being allowed by this court, the interest of justice will seriously be prejudiced and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioners in the form of possible criminal convictions,” it asserted.
On August 12, the NCCIA had registered a case against Mazari and Chattha before the Cyber Crime Reporting Centre of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca).</p><small>2025-12-04 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637338-govt-initiates-process-for-shahzad-akbar-adil-rajas-extradition-from-uk' target='_blank'><strong>Govt initiates process for Shahzad Akbar, Adil Raja's extradition from UK</strong></a><br><p>

“He is not [a] Pakistani national or [of] Pakistan origin. He is an Afghan, spent a few years as a refugee [in Pakistan] and then went to the US, where he spent most of his life,” Andrabi said in a statement shared with journalists.
His clarification came after several media reports, including those from Indian and American news outlets, identified the suspect as a man of Pakistani origin.
A USA Today report said the arrested man, Luqman Khan, was a Pakistan-born US citizen, who was arrested on November 24.
Similarly, reports by the New York Post and India’s Hindustan Times and Times of India, among others, also identified him as a Pakistani immigrant.
According to a report by The Associated Press from earlier today, which also does not identify Khan as a man of Pakistani origin, the suspect was a student of the University of Delaware.
Meanwhile, a press release issued by the US Department of Justice on Dec 1 detailing charges against Khan identified him as a resident of Delaware’s Wilmington city and did not make any mention of his nationality.
It said that Khan was stopped by police at a traffic stop on November 24, and when he refused to comply, was arrested.
“During their investigation, officers discovered in Khan’s vehicle a .357 caliber Glock handgun loaded with 27 rounds,” it said. It added that officials also discovered a handwritten notebook, in which Khan discussed “additional weapons and firearms, how they could be used in an attack, and how law enforcement detection could be avoided once an attack was carried out”.
“The notebook referenced a member of the University of Delaware’s Police Department by name, and included a layout of a building with entry and exit points under which the words ‘UD Police Station’ were printed,” it said.
It added that later, law enforcement searched his residence and recovered “a Glock 19 9mm handgun equipped with an illegal machinegun conversion device, commonly called a ‘switch’”.
“Law enforcement also recovered a .556 rifle with a scope and a red dot sight, eleven more extended magazines, hollow point rounds of ammunition, and a two-plate tactical vest equipped with a single ballistic plate,” the department said.
According to the Department of Justice press release, Khan was charged with illegally possessing a machine gun on November 26.
“If convicted of the charge, Khan faces a maximum penalty of 10 years of imprisonment. If Khan is ultimately convicted, a federal district court judge will determine any sentence after taking into account the US Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors,” it said.</p><small>2025-12-04 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637307-man-arrested-in-us-is-afghan-national-not-pakistani-foreign-office' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested in US is Afghan national, not Pakistani: Foreign Office</strong></a><br><p>

A supermoon occurs when the moon reaches its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, causing it to appear unusually large and bright — up to 14 per cent larger and nearly 30pc brighter than a typical full moon.
The final supermoon of the year, known as the Cold Moon, will be visible across Pakistan tonight and tomorrow night, Radio Pakistan said, quoting the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco).
“It marks the third consecutive supermoon of the year and the last supermoon of 2025,” it said.
Suparco encourages the public, astronomy enthusiasts, students, and families to observe this natural spectacle, the report said.
“No special equipment is required; the supermoon will be easily visible to the naked eye, provided the skies remain clear,” it added.
According to CNN, the moniker ‘Cold Moon’ indicates that it’s the full moon event closest to the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.
The first of the three supermoons lit up the country’s skies on October 7, followed by another on November 5, called the Beaver Supermoon, which was “the closest, biggest, and brightest full moon of the year,” as per the space agency.
In September, a rare blood moon — a total lunar eclipse — eluded Karachi stargazers as heavy cloud cover blocked the view.</p><small>2025-12-04 06:22</small></div><hr>
