The bill, when enacted, will overhaul the government’s Medicaid healthcare programme that covers around 71 million low-income Americans, introducing changes including mandatory work requirements that are expected to leave nearly 12 million people uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
Republicans have said the legislation will lower taxes for Americans across the income spectrum and spur economic growth. According to the CBO, the bill would lower tax revenue by $4.5 trillion over 10 years and cut spending by $1.1tr. Much of those spending cuts come from Medicaid.
Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association, an influential US doctors’ group, warned that the Medicaid cuts would limit access to care by leaving millions without health insurance and make it harder for them to see doctors.
“It will make it more likely that acute, treatable illnesses will turn into life-threatening or costly chronic conditions. That is disappointing, maddening, and unacceptable,” he said.
The Alliance of Community Health Plans, which represents local, nonprofit health plans, also rebuked the bill’s passage, saying it would drive up consumer costs while slashing federal health spending to historic levels.
The group pledged to work with policymakers to minimise disruption for communities.
Greg Kelley, president of the Service Employees International Union’s healthcare branch, representing Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, and Kansas, called the bill a “moral failure” that threatened healthcare access, jobs, and the stability of the healthcare system.
Craig Garthwaite, director of the healthcare programme at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management, said their research showed such cuts would hurt patient health. He said expanding Medicaid had saved lives and cutting it back was likely to have the opposite impact.
Ge Bai, a Johns Hopkins health policy professor and adviser to the conservative Paragon Health Institute, said she expected the private market would step in as able-bodied adults lose Medicaid and subsidies.
“These people will come back to the private market,” she said. “The financial burden to purchase insurance will be shifted away from US taxpayers to these people’s shoulders.”</p><small>2025-07-04 06:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/041123571a9b18a.png?r=112721' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922044/pakistan-claim-stunning-victory-over-maldives-to-win-asian-youth-netball-championship' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan claim stunning victory over Maldives to win Asian Youth Netball Championship</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan thrashed the Maldives 60-35 in the final to win the Asian Youth Netball Championship on Friday and maintain its winning streak throughout the tournament being held in South Korea, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Chairman of the Pakistan Netball Federation Mudassir Arian, along with President Sameen Malik and Secretary General Muhammad Riaz, extended their congratulations to the team.
A day earlier, the Green Shirts clinched their spot in the final after defeating Japan 64-39. In the quarter-finals, Pakistan defeated the Maldives 49-39 to advance to the semi-finals.
The tournament was taking place from June 27 to July 4 at the Jeonju Hwasan Gymnasium in South Korea.
Eleven teams were participating in the championship and had been  divided into two groups. Group A: Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and India. Group-B: Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea, Pakistan, Maldives and Saudi Arabia .

Local authorities have been directed to ensure the readiness of response teams, drainage clearance and public awa­re­ness campaigns. Motorists have been warned to avoid driving through flooded roads and underpasses. Emergency services remain on high alert for potential rescue and evacuation operations.
 
 

The NDMA asked citizens to monitor its advisories and use the ‘Pak NDMA Disaster Alert’ app for real-time weather updates and safety information.
Punjab on high alert
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Punjab has issued its own alert ahead of expected monsoon rains from July 5 to 10, warning of urban flooding and rising river levels.
It said the second monsoon spell is expected to affect most districts, including Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazirabad, Lahore, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Sahiwal and Faisalabad. Thunderstorms with heavy downpours are predicted in Okara, Kasur, Khushab, Sargodha, Bhakkar, Mianwali and southern districts such as Bahawalpur, Multan and Dera Ghazi Khan.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia warned of potential flooding in hill torrents and rain drains from July 7 onwards. Urban flooding may also impact northern and central Punjab.
Departments including the Water and Sanitation Agency, Rescue 1122, health, irrigation and local government have been directed to remain on high alert. Citizens have been advised to stay indoors during storms, avoid travel and keep children away from waterlogged areas and electrical hazards.
PDMA’s recent rainfall data shows Jhelum recorded the highest precipitation at 31 millimetres in the past 24 hours, followed by Mangla (29mm) and Attock (14mm), with minimal rainfall in Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Sialkot and Multan.

A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) read that on the nights of July 2 and July 3, “Movement of a large group of khwarij, belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was detected by the security forces in general area Hassan Khel, North Waziristan district.”
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna al Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
As per the ISPR, “all 30 Indian sponsored khawarij were sent to hell,” as a result of the military’s “prices and and skillful engagement” as the security forces foiled their attempt to infiltrate the border.
“A large number of weapons, explosives and ammunition have been recovered from the slain terrorists,” the statement added.
The ISPR appreciated the “exceptional professionalism, vigilance & preparedness” displayed by the security forces in preventing a “potential catastrophe.”
The military’s media wing urged the Afghan government to “check and prevent the use of Afghan soil by ‘foreign proxies’ for orchestrating terrorist activities against Pakistan”.
“The security forces of Pakistan remain resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers and to eradicate the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the statement added.
President Asif Ali Zardari lauded the security forces for their bravery and  reaffirmed the country’s “unwavering” resolve to curb terrorism.
“Security operations will continue until the terrorists are eliminated completely,” he said, according to a statement issued by the president’s office.
While commending the intelligence-based operation, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said, “[our] brave armed forces of Pakistan are standing like a solid wall to protect the country,” the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“The entire nation salutes the security forces”, he added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. The engagement comes only days after security forces killed two terrorists during an operation in Balochistan’s Duki district.
In May, the monthly security assessment issued by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) recorded 85 militant attacks resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members.</p><small>2025-07-04 06:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/04105039646fe09.jpg?r=105134' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922033/peshawar-high-court-orders-panel-to-submit-report-on-swat-deaths' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar High Court orders panel to submit report on Swat deaths</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Peshawar High Court on Thursday directed an inquiry committee, probing recent multiple deaths due to flooding in Swat, to submit report after its finalisation.
A bench consisting of PHC Chief Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah and Justice Mohammad Faheem Wali ordered the government to conduct an impartial and across the board operation for removing encroachments along the Swat River.
The bench was informed by head of three-member inquiry committee Khayyam Hassan Khan that they had visited Swat and had been probing the incident for the last four days.
He said that they had observed lapses on part of some of individuals and departments during flash floods in Swat and would highlight it in the report.

Committee head says he will highlight negligence by some individuals and depts

The bench was hearing two petitions related to the Swat incident of June 27, during which 13 persons stuck in gushing floodwater were killed near Fizzagut, Swat.
One of the petitions is filed by a lawyer Naeem Ahmad Khattak, seeking directives of court for respondents including government to take effective measures and remove obstacles/encroachments throughout KP near riverbeds.
 
 

Another petition is filed by a citizen, Amir Alam, for ordering a judicial inquiry into the ‘circumstances’ that led to deaths of several people during the floods in Swat as well as a probe into the alleged misuse of Rescue 1122 vehicles by the provincial government for ‘political’ purposes.
The petitioner has sought directives for law enforcement agencies and accountability authorities to look into alleged misuse of Rescue 1122 vehicles and resources by the provincial executive for political purposes and proceed strictly in accordance with law if cognisable offences were committed.
Advocates Babar Khan Yousafzai and Nasir Khan appeared for the petitioners, whereas KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel appeared for the government.
The chairman of the inquiry committee, Khayyam Hassan, also turned up along with some of divisional commissioners.
When the bench inquired who was the inquiry officer probing the incident, Mr Khayyam, the chairman of Provincial Inspection Team, informed the bench that provincial government had constituted the inquiry committee under his chairmanship.
He stated that the other two members of the committee were the inspector general of prisons, Mohammad Usman, and the director (admin) of excise and taxation department, Sheharyar Qamar. He said that according to the notification, the committee had to complete its probe within seven days.
Mr Khayyam said that according to terms of reference of the committee, they had to inquire into multiple aspects of the incident. He said that they were assigned to conduct thorough and impartial investigation into the flash flood incident, which had resulted into loss of precious lives.
He said that that they would assess and identify lapses or negligence on part of government functionaries and tourists. He said that they would also identify the individuals or institutions involved in any lapse regarding compliance of safety and fix responsibilities.
He said that they would put forward recommendations in order to avoid such tragic incidents in future and ensure strict adherence to safety measures.
Shah Faisal Uthmankhel informed the bench that government and administration in Swat had started an anti-encroachments drive along the Swat River that was facing certain hurdles.
The PHC chief justice observed that the court was aware that certain quarters would be exerting pressure in the drive. The bench directed him to continue with the operation without extending favour to any person.
The petitioners’ lawyers stated that government was having two helicopters and if it intended it could have saved lives of the deceased persons. The petitioners have also requested the court to issue directives for the respondents to cancel all mining activities, carried out through auction or otherwise, in the Swat River.
They said that the failure of Rescue 1122 and provincial authorities to respond timely and effectively caused unnecessary and avoidable loss of lives.

• Regrets how petition by death row prisoner received first hearing seven years after it was filed
• Criticises abysmal conditions in overcrowded prisons across the country
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Wednesday expressed regret over the inordinate delays plaguing the country’s criminal justice system, warning that such inefficiencies are eroding public confidence in the judiciary and amount to a form of “unauthorised punishment”.
In a detailed judgement, Justice Athar Minallah called for the urgent completion of appeal processes and said the abysmal conditions in overcrowded prisons across the country add to the unimaginable suffering of prisoners — especially those on death row. These conditions become “a form of unauthorised punishment not intended by the legislature”, he wrote.
He emphasised that it was the constitutional duty of every organ of the state — the executive, the judiciary and the legislature — to take urgent steps for ensuring that the criminal justice system serves the people of this country and they repose their trust and confidence in its fairness, impartiality and independence.
Justice Minallah presided over a three-member bench hearing the appeal of Tahir alias Tahri, who had challenged a 2014 Lahore High Court (LHC) decision upholding his conviction and death sentence for the murder of five individuals.
Justice Minallah observed that a weak and compromised criminal justice system undermines the rule of law and thus encourages corruption, authoritarianism and the rule of the powerful and privileged instead. “An effective and responsive criminal justice system, free from political interference and corruption, is a fundamental right of every citizen, while inexpensive and expeditious justice is a commitment of the state under the Constitution,” he wrote.
He conceded that judiciary was also responsible when the process of appeal exceeds the necessary and reasonable time required for its completion, but other branches of the state — the executive and legislature — were equally responsible for ensuring that the conditions in the prisons were humane and that the treatment of prisoners was not cruel, inhumane and degrading.
In the case at hand, Justice Minallah regretted that the appellant was sentenced to death by the trial court on Sept 3, 2008, and the appeal was preferred within time. The LHC decided the appeal on Sept 18, 2014, and the reference was answered in the affirmative, and thus, the sentence of death was confirmed.
But there was a six-year delay in deciding the appeal of a prisoner who has been handed down a death sentence, which cannot be justified when the necessary time for taking up the appeal and its ultimate disposal should not have been more than a year, Justice Minallah bemoaned.
The appellant had then sought leave by filing a petition before the Supreme Court, and the necessary and reasonable time required for its final disposal should not have been more than 12 months, he wrote.
The petition, which was filed in 2014, was fixed for hearing for the first time after seven years — on March 22, 2021 — and finally on Jan 29, 2025. It took more than 17 years to complete the appeal process from the date when the death sentence was handed down, the judgement regretted.
Throughout this time, the prisoner remained in a death cell, despite having no role in the delay nor any control over the procedural hurdles. Justice Minallah said such delays grossly exceed the “necessary and reasonable” time that should be required for appellate procedures.

Speaking at a press conference at KCCI, President Jawed Bilwani said the chamber, along with all seven industrial associations, would back any unified strike call against these provisions. “Posting banners and holding press conferences are just the beginning — protests will intensify until the government repeals Sections 37A and 37B entirely,” he warned.
Bilwani revealed that officials from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) had contacted him to discuss the formulation of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for implementing Section 37A. However, he categorically rejected any such proposals, stating, “In line with the unanimous demand of the business community, we reject SOPs and reiterate our sole demand: complete repeal of Section 37A.”
On the timeline for a potential strike, Bilwani said a final decision would be made following meetings with other chambers, trade bodies, and relevant stakeholders.

Demand repeal of Sections 37A and 37B; caution against investor exodus and rising protests

Criticising the sweeping arrest powers granted to FBR officials under the contentious provisions, he said these laws undermine Pakistan’s reputation as a business-friendly destination and risk scaring off both local and foreign investors.
“Section 37A is incompatible with doing business in Pakistan,” he said, adding that KCCI continues to receive complaints from business owners concerned about the psychological pressure and constant threat posed by these sections.
Bilwani stressed that the law unfairly targets already compliant taxpayers rather than addressing root causes of tax evasion. “Only 40pc of Pakistan’s economy is documented, of which barely 2pc may be involved in malpractice — yet 98pc of tax-compliant businesses are now subject to harassment,” he said. He added that the focus should be on those issuing fake or flying invoices, not those already in the tax net.
Highlighting the FBR’s poor enforcement record, he said most court verdicts in such cases have favoured taxpayers, with only a small fraction decided in favour of tax authorities.
KCCI has identified 30 anomalies in the tax framework, with five or six deemed critical enough to make return filing practically impossible. These, Bilwani stressed, need immediate rectification through urgent legislative amendments.
Businessmen Group Chairman Zubair Motiwala echoed Bilwani’s concerns, warning that unchecked arrest powers would lead to widespread harassment and open the door to corruption. “Officials vested with arrest powers may misuse them for personal gain, forcing law-abiding taxpayers to comply with unlawful demands just to safeguard their dignity,” he said.
He urged the government to target those outside the tax net rather than burdening the already documented segment.

The images that circulated last week of an entire family being stranded for hours in Swat waiting for a rescue operation that never came were both tragic and farcical.
Despite how much our rulers and the ‘experts’ alike now deploy rhetoric about climate change, the Pakistani state is not interested in changing very much. In both of the mountainous highlands of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), we have been warned to expect intensification of glacial lake outburst floods, the flash flooding caused by permanent glacier melt. This process has been underway for decades, and every year it becomes more acute.
 
 

The rising temperatures that trigger glacier melt are explained largely by the excesses of industrial capitalism in the Western world, including the colonisation of much of Asia, Africa and Latin America. We cannot reverse this history, but some measure of justice can be done by demanding, as most non-Western countries are doing, that the emitters end their addiction to fossil fuels whilst also paying reparations.
But Pakistani capitalism is also contributing to warming temperatures. The fact that our rulers continue to largely externalise the climate crisis is duplicitous; there is no political will to keep large parts of this country habitable for future generations.

There’s no political will to keep the country habitable.

The developmental regime that has been championed in KP and GB for too long, and which is becoming even more entrenched, prioritises big infrastructure, including road-building, the felling of forests, and, increasingly, the mining of so-called critical minerals. Marx would call many of these processes primitive accumulation. They dispossess local people of their livelihoods, whilst also exacerbating warming temperatures and eliminating natural protections like forest cover against floods.
Then there is the political economy of tourism, widely promoted by the state only to be selectively vilified when flood-related disasters take place. There is nothing wrong with ordinary people from mainland Pakistan going up north; the problem is when the authorities facilitate ecocide in the name of tourism. It is often the case that the least well-to-do hoteliers are blamed when floods ravage popular tourist locations like Swat, Naran and Hunza. But what about luxury hotels like the Luxus Resort in Attabad (Hunza) which was caught red-handed dumping sewage water into a fresh lake?
A bigger class story is hidden behind the veil of tourism. Why are there no other meaningful livelihood options beyond tourism in the highlands? By promoting primitive accumulation and dispossessing working people of their traditional livelihoods — including grazing lands, pastures and smallholding agriculture — the mafias that masquerade as our rulers are not only devastating vulnerable ecosystems but also waging class war.
Even those state departments that offered a modicum of public service under the guise of tourism, without ravaging the natural landscape like the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation have been taken over by bodies like the SIFC that operate without any oversight in terms of class and ecological impact. It is also noteworthy that activists in KP and GB challenging ecocide and class war are being criminalised. Meanwhile, drone strikes and targeted killings are proliferating in districts like Waziristan, indicating where the state’s priorities lie.
The situation south of KP and GB is a little different. The war on nature and working masses carr­ies on under the guise of development. If there is flooding in the mountainous highlands, the Indus plains are unlikely to be spared. This year’s monsoon has been preceded by protracted heatwaves — these too, are becoming more intense and last longer with each passing year.
Every once in a while, like during the smog season in Lahore, there are proclamations that things will change. Ham-fisted closures of brick kilns and rickshaws end up forcing the burden of ecocide onto the working class. If we want farmers to stop engaging in slash-and-burn agriculture, we need to consider how to generate meaningful livelihood alternatives. Meanwhile, sales of SUVs continue to rise, newer roads continue to be built, and behemoths like the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project continue to be championed.
The 2022 monsoon was said to be a watershed moment. The floods which displaced almost 40 million working people and inundated much of Sindh, eastern Balochistan and the Seraiki belt are now a global case study. That man-made disaster too was at least partially caused by our own militarised ruling class, and three years later, there is no evidence that things are shifting. The status quo is, in fact, becoming even more entrenched.

But behind this illusion of calm lies a hollow economy, ie, exports remain stagnant, competitiveness is deteriorating, and industrial confidence is eroding. Is this the success of prudent macroeconomic stewardship or the triumph of administrative sleight of hand?
Despite the painful experience of at least six major currency crises, the state continues to obsessively fix the nominal rate. From 2023 to 2025, the authorities indeed managed to stabilise the currency and rebuild reserves. But at what cost?
The apparent stability has been engineered not through market trust or export dynamism, but through an elaborate system of administrative controls and currency rationing.
Today, Pakistan operates two distinct foreign exchange markets — one official, the other informal. This duality is a product of a long-standing desire to control the rupee.
The interbank market is tightly supervised by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), which apparently takes an upfront share of all foreign currency inflows from exports and remittances, and dictates to banks how much they may allocate towards import payments.
Letters of credit (LCs), particularly for so-called non-essential goods, are heavily restricted. The result is a deliberate throttling of demand, carefully orchestrated to sustain an artificial exchange rate.
The illusion is sustained by rising remittances, which have surged over the past two years. This rise is less a triumph of policy and more a symptom of a broken domestic economy.
A growing exodus of skilled and unskilled Pakistanis, unable to find opportunities at home, are sending more money back because inflation has increased the financial burden for families at home.
And in many cases, families that had once migrated have returned to Pakistan due to rising global living costs, prompting the bread earner to support them locally. These remittances have become the lifeline of our foreign exchange position, but are rooted in economic despair, not development.

Despite at least six major currency crises, the state continues to obsessively fix the nominal rate.

On the demand side, dollar outflows have contracted. The relocation of kosher capital (to escape an encumbering tax environment and the excessive and unpredictable cost of doing business) and capital flight driven by tax evasion, corruption and drug proceeds, has slowed due to tighter scrutiny in offshore jurisdictions.
Under-invoiced imports and smuggling, previously encouraged by high duties and GST, have receded in the face of weak consumer demand and a stagnating economy.
Foreign travel for education, pilgrimage and leisure has dipped due to the rupee’s depreciation and inflationary pressures, leading to an uptick in domestic tourism and greater reliance on private local universities. These declines, however, reflect contraction, not correction.
Increases in duties have often been employed as stopgap measures to suppress import demand and relieve pressure on the exchange rate. By raising tariffs, in particular on consumer and ‘non-essential’ goods, the government aims to reduce the outflow of foreign exchange, artificially easing the trade deficit.
This tactic, however, functions more as a tool of exchange rate defence than sound trade policy. While it may temporarily slow imports and delay the rupee’s depreciation, it raises input costs for domestic producers, discourages export competitiveness, and entrenches inefficiencies, ultimately undermining the very stability it seeks to preserve.
Meanwhile, enforcement has been used to fill the vacuum left by policy. The SBP has imposed hard caps on currency dealers, while the FIA conducts raids on the informal market — a theatre of suppression that conveniently lines the pockets of some enforcement personnel. It is a fragile peace, maintained through force and friction, not reform.
To justify the controls, the SBP continues to tout its Real Effective Exchange Rate as evidence of an undervalued rupee. Analysts quote it with reverence, but it is a meaningless number.
When trade is restricted, imports are rationed, and price signals are distorted, REER becomes little more than a statistical hallucination. Open up the market and the real rate will quickly emerge.
What we have, then, is not stability but suspension. The rupee’s apparent strength is not grounded in productivity, efficiency or a booming export sector. It is built on repression, rationing through administrative controls and borrowed credibility.
Exporters face rising input costs, shipment delays and disruptions in raw material supply chains, while international buyers grow wary of Pakistan’s reliability as a trading partner. The country is not becoming more competitive; it is simply freezing in place.
The question before us is not whether the rupee can hold its position. It is whether holding it in this manner serves the economic good. The longer we pretend that this engineered calm is sustainable, the more we strangle our industry, discourage investment and defer the inevitable reckoning. This is not macroeconomic management; it is macroeconomic theatre.
If Pakistan genuinely wants lasting stability, it must abandon its fixation with optics and return to the fundamentals. The foreign exchange market must be liberalised. Import restrictions through LC associated rationing must be replaced with prudent current account oversight.
Exporters must be supported with the real enablers of competitiveness, ie, energy, inputs, a rationalised import tariff configuration, logistics and regulatory certainty. Above all, the SBP must operate with transparency, not through coercion.
Ultimately, a lasting way to stabilise the exchange rate in Pakistan lies in credible fiscal correction. By curbing unnecessary spending, and improving a transparent and equitable tax structure with fair and consistent processes, the government can lower its reliance on external borrowing and money printing — two key drivers of currency pressure.
A sound fiscal position builds investor confidence, eases inflationary expectations and reduces the demand for foreign exchange, creating a more durable foundation for exchange rate stability than administrative controls or temporary inflows.
Until then, the rupee is simply a house of sand held together by borrowed time, borrowed dollars, and borrowed ideas. And sand, as we know, always slips through the cracks.

The threats affected operations at six of the major airports, causing delays and confusion for thousands of passengers ahead of the long weekend.
According to NAV CANADA, the national air navigation service provider, the threats were received in the early hours of the morning and were directed at control centres in Ottawa, Montreal, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Vancouver.
As a precaution, air traffic control towers at these airports were evacuated, and a ground stop was put in place, temporarily halting all departing flights.
Ottawa International Airport was one of the first to confirm the disruption. In a statement, airport authorities said they were “investigating a security incident” and warned travellers that operations could be affected.
 
 

Similar messages were posted on the websites and social media channels of the other affected airports. Passengers arriving at terminals were met with long lines, limited information, and significant delays as staff worked to manage the situation.
The US Federal Aviation Administration also responded to the threat, briefly issuing a ground stop for flights departing from Ottawa and Montreal.
The order was lifted later in the morning after local authorities carried out safety inspections and determined there was no immediate danger.
Airport officials in Toronto said operations at Pearson remained normal, but acknowledged that some delays were expected as aircraft and crews were repositioned.
Airlines responded by issuing travel advisories and encouraging passengers to verify their flight status before leaving for the airport. Air Canada posted alerts urging flexibility and patience, and said they were offering fee waivers for flight changes caused by the incident.
By mid-morning, NAV CANADA confirmed that air traffic operations had resumed at all affected airports, and that no suspicious devices had been found. The agency said it was working closely with law enforcement and airport security teams to determine the origin of the threats.
Officials did not comment on whether they believed the threats to be coordinated or credible but stressed that all responses had been precautionary and followed national security protocols.

“Minus Imran Khan is the government trying to minus him. Is it not minusing that they imprisoned him?”
Ms Khan made the clarification while speaking to reporters outside Adiala Jail after not being allowed to meet her brother on Thursday.
“Who’s doing the minus? Who’s in pain? If [the] government is not afraid, Imran Khan should not be in jail.”
She claimed her words were taken out of context by the media, adding that her brother remains open to any political resolution, but on his own terms.

Says her brother wants to negotiate with those who ‘Trump spoke to’

She then pivoted to her brother’s position on dialogue, saying he would only negotiate with Pakistan’s powerful establishment — the same officials she said US President Donald Trump has engaged with.
“Imran said that we should talk to those whom Donald Trump has been talking to,” Aleema said. “Trump knows that the current government cannot take decisions and there is martial law in the country.”
Another member of Mr Khan’s family, Noreen Niazi, reinforced the message, saying: “Imran Khan will only talk to those with whom Trump talked.”
When a reporter countered, saying that those in power have asked Mr Khan to speak with the government, Ms Khan was dismissive. “Why? When they don’t have any power and they know they are lost and dragged, Imran Khan will only talk to those with whom Trump spoke,” she said.
In the past, the PTI founder had signalled his willingness to negotiate with powerful quarters, but military figures repeatedly rebuffed his overtures. Famously, the military’s chief spokesperson demanded an apology over the events of May 9, 2023, when his supporters attacked military installations after his initial arrest.
But Mr Khan has refused, instead demanding the return of what he called his “stolen mandate”, and the provision of CCTV evidence to prove his party’s involvement in the targeting of military installations on May 9.
Aleema Khan had sparked controversy last month by claiming that her brother had been sidelined, following the unexpected passage of the KP budget.
“I think so he has been minused,” she had said when questioned whether Mr Khan had been excluded from the decision-making process over the provincial budget.
This was interpreted by many as an allegation against elements within the party. But on Thursday, she sought to dispel this impression.
She claimed she was only delivering Imran Khan’s message for members “playing on both sides”, suggesting that the PTI founder understood the pressure they faced, but expected them to stand firm or step aside.
She also expressed frustration with the PTI leadership for failing to organise protests outside the jail.

On Wednesday, key figures publicly reaffirmed their loyalty to the party’s jailed chief, sending “a message of strength” to their supporters. The meeting came amidst growing speculation that the KP government may be at risk. “We will defend the KP government at all costs. Anyone attempting a no-confidence motion should first secure the numbers,” PTI chairman Gohar Ali Khan told the media afterwards.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur underlined that his government held a full and legitimate constitutional mandate which cannot be altered without unconstitutional measures. That may be so, but the law has not always proved to be a sufficient check on the government’s ambitions. Perhaps this realisation might have prompted the PTI to close ranks.
 
 

There are, of course, lawful means of removing a government. The most straightforward one requires holding a vote of no-confidence and is a prerogative of representatives directly elected by the public.
No one outside the elected House has any business intervening directly or indirectly in such a matter.
This observation follows claims by KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi that the prime minister had tasked him with leading a regime change campaign.
Mr Kundi on Thursday warned of a looming vote of no-confidence against the KP government even as spokespersons for the federal government issued denials of involvement.
Senator Irfan Siddiqui, for example, stated that “We will not resort to any such tactic that could plunge Khyber Pakhtunkhwa into a crisis.” That seems to be a very reasonable position to take.
The country is still reeling from the economic and sociopolitical fallout of the last ‘regime change’. There is no good reason, therefore, for the powerful to be entertaining ideas about another one.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent meetings with key individuals from KP had given air to speculation that the federation would like to replace the government in Peshawar with a surrogate; most likely, a coalition of its allies and other provincial stakeholders. The PML-N-led coalition at the centre believes the PTI has ‘failed to deliver’ in the province for over a decade, and ‘failed to protect its people’.
While the party’s achievements, or the lack of them, can certainly be debated, it should be borne in mind that the majority of voters in KP voted the PTI into power, and the electorate’s choice should not be trivialised.
This principle would apply to any party in any province. As uncertainty prevails about the government’s intentions, it is useful to remember that the political and social blowback from any engineered upheaval could destabilise an already volatile region.

The designations, announced by the State Department and the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), target a network of shipping and management firms accused of helping Iran covertly move oil and petrochemicals in violation of US sanctions.
The latest measures come weeks after Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and reflect Washington’s resolve to enforce the Trump administration’s “maximum pressure” policy.
“The Treasury will continue to target Tehran’s revenue sources and intensify economic pressure to disrupt the regime’s access to the financial resources that fuel its destabilizing activities,” said US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a statement.
 
 

Among those sanctioned is SAI Saburi Consulting Services, a New Delhi-based company that served as the commercial manager of two LPG tankers, BATELEUR and NEEL.
According to the Treasury, in September 2022, BATELEUR transported petroleum products from Iran on behalf of Alliance Energy Co., a previously sanctioned entity.
Alliance Energy Pvt Ltd, based in Lahore, Pakistan, was also sanctioned for its role in the Iranian oil trade. The company had already been blacklisted for violating US sanctions.
Other entities targeted include UAE, Iran and Panama-based firms and the vessels they operate.

The plan is subject to approval by both parties involved in the conflict. US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators have been working to secure agreement.
According to an official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, the plan includes provisions for negotiation on a permanent end to hostilities in the Palestinian territory.
Under the current draft, 10 Israeli prisoners would be returned along with the bodies of 18 others, according to the following schedule: Day 1: 8 prisoners — Day 7: 5 bodies — Day 30: 5 bodies — Day 50: 2 prisoners — Day 60: 8 bodies.  The swaps will take place without any ceremonies or parades.
On Day 10, Hamas would be expected to provide information and evidence that confirm which remaining prisoners are alive or dead, plus medical reports.
In turn, Israel will provide full information about Palestinian prisoners from Gaza detained since October 7, 2023.
As per practice, Hamas will release prisoners in exchange for Israel releasing detained Palestinians.
 
 

Israel says that of the 50 prisoners held by Hamas and its allies, about 20 are believed to be alive.
In addition, aid will immediately enter Gaza in sufficient amounts with the involvement of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross, in accordance with a January 19 agreement.
After the first eight Israeli prisoners are released, the Israeli army will withdraw from parts of northern Gaza as per maps that will be agreed upon.
On the seventh day, Israelis will withdraw from parts of the south.
A technical team will work on drawing boundaries for withdrawals during rapid negotiations that will take place after agreement on the framework of the proposal.
Negotiations will also start on a permanent ceasefire with key points that include: Remaining prisoner exchanges, long-term security arrangements for Gaza, and the declaration of a permanent ceasefire. If an agreement is reached, all remaining Palestinian prisoners detained from Gaza since October 7, 2023, will be released.
The proposal guarantees US President Donald Trump’s commitment to the agreement. If negotiations during the 60-day ceasefire are successful, they will lead to a permanent end to the conflict. The mediators will guarantee serious negotiations take place during the pause.

Moscow’s special representative for Afghanistan, Zamir Kabulov, told the state news agency Ria Novosti that the government had “recognised” the Taliban.
In a statement issued after it accepted the credentials of a new ambassador from Kabul, the foreign ministry said the move would give impetus to the development of productive bilateral cooperation between our countries in various fields.
No other country has formally recognised the Taliban government that seized power in August 2021 after US-led forces staged a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years of war.
However, China, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Pakistan have all designated ambassadors to Kabul, in a step towards recognition.
The Russian move represents a major milestone for the Taliban administration as it seeks to ease its international isolation.
It is likely to be closely watched by Washington, which has frozen billions in Afghanistan’s central bank assets and enforced sanctions on some senior leaders in the Taliban that contributed to Afgha­nis­tan’s banking sector being largely cut off from the international financial system.
In April of this year, Russia’s top court had suspended the ban on the Afghan Taliban and removed its designation as a terrorist organisation.
At the time, the move was seen as a step towards Moscow normalising ties with the de facto rulers of Afghanistan.
Recently, shared security interests — including the fight against the so-called Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) have drawn Russia and the Taliban closer.
Reacting to the development, Afghanistan’s foreign minister said on Thursday that Russia’s decision to become the first country to recognise their government was a “brave decision”.
“This brave decision will be an example for others… Now that the process of recognition has started, Russia was ahead of everyone,” Amir Khan Muttaqi said in a video of a meeting with Dmitry Zhirnov, the Russian ambassador to Kabul, posted on X.

• ANP’s application for proportional allocation of seats referred to election commission for further action
PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Thursday vacated its stay order on the oath-taking of MPAs on reserved seats for women and non-Muslims, a move which would boost the stre­ngth of opposition parties in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
The court had granted a stay order on the petition of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P), formed by former PTI leader and KP chief minister Pervez Khattak, and stopped the speaker from administering oath to MPAs-elect on reserved seats.
 
 

On Thursday, a two-member PHC bench, comprising justices Syed Arshad Ali and Dr Khurshid Iqbal, resumed the hearing on PTI-P application and a similar plea filed by ANP.
The petitioners had sought directives for the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to recalculate their share of reserved seats in proportion to their general seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
They had requested the court to set aside two notifications issued by the ECP on Mar 4, 2024, notifying the names of returned candidates of different political parties on seats reserved for women and non-Muslims.
Both PTI-P and ANP claimed they were allocated one seat each out of the total 26 seats reserved for women, whereas not a single seat was allotted to them against the four seats reserved for non-Muslims.
They claimed that they were entitled to three seats each for women and one seat each for non-Muslims.
ECP special secretary Mohammad Arshad informed the bench that PTI-P had earlier submitted a similar application to the commission but it was turned down.
He stated the party then challenged the issue before the Islamabad High Court, where the matter was still pending.
The bench questioned PTI-P’s counsel about how the plea could be filed in the PHC when the issue had already been challenged in the Islamabad High Court.
Advocate Sultan Mohammad Khan stated the petition was filed by the PTI-P parliamentary leader, Arbab Mohammad Waseem, who was unaware of the pending litigation in the IHC.
After a short break in the proceedings, Advocate Khan informed the court his client wanted to withdraw the petition.
Subsequently, the bench dismissed the petition and recalled its stay order granted on July 1.
ANP’s petition
Meanwhile, Advocate Babar Khan Yousafzai, who appeared on behalf of ANP, said the party has also challenged the allocation of reserved seats.
He said the party has two general seats in the KP Assembly and under the system of proportional representation of allocation of reserved seats, it was entitled to three seats reserved for women and one for non-Muslims.
The ECP special secretary contended ANP’s case was “different” as it won a single seat in the February 8, 2024, general election and then another in a by-election.
He stated that the reserved seats were allocated on the basis of seats won by a political party in the general election.
The ECP official added that if seats were allocated on the basis of by-election results, it would result in complications and disrupt the existing process. The bench referred ANP’s plea to the ECP with directives to decide the matter within 10 days.
Last year, the ECP had allocated 10 seats reserved for women to JUI-F, eight to PML-N, six to PPP and one each to ANP and PTIP.
Similarly, two seats reserved for non-Muslims were allotted to JUI-F and one each to PML-N and PPPP.
The number of seats held by opposition parties in the KP Assembly is expected to jump from 27 to 52 following the Constitutional Bench’s decision to render the PTI ineligible for reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies.
The judgement, issued last month, restored several March 2024 notifications of the ECP declaring 25 candidates of opposition parties elected to reserved seats in the provincial assembly.
Currently, the 120-strong house has 93 PTI-backed MPAs, who were elected as independents, while the 25 reserved seats were vacant.
On Wednesday, the ECP allocated reserved seats in the Punjab and Sindh assemblies, boosting the tallies of all major political parties, except the PTI.

The observation came during a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Commit­tee on Climate Change, held at the National Disaster Manag­ement Authority (NDMA) He­­ad­quarters, where lawmakers received a briefing on the cou­ntry’s evolving disaster landscape and climate-induced chal­lenges.
Chaired by MNA Munaza Hassan, the sitting underscored that the country was ranked among the most climate vulnerable and water-scarce nations in the world. 
Members of the committee expressed concern that provincial and district authorities remained under-resourced to act on the NDMA’s warnings. 

Standing Committee on Climate Change stresses need for better coordination

“Empowering provincial and district authorities with better federal support is non-negotiable,” said Ms Hassan. 
She proposed mobilising overseas Pakistanis for both funding and volunteer response. The committee also recommended stronger coordination between NDMA and elected representatives on disaster warnings and relief.
NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik presented the Authority’s Disaster Cale­ndar 2025 and plans which integrated forecasts of floods, heat waves, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), and sea level rise. 
Drawing on 300 satellite feeds and an in-house Global Glacier Monitoring Portal, NDMA highlighted its early warning systems, the Integ­rated National Search and Rescue (INSaR) platform, and training initiatives of over twomillion responders. 
Yet, the committee lamen­ted that provincial and district authorities often lacked capacity. “We need a federal response framework to back up the PDMAs’ actions on the ground,” Ms Hassan stressed.
The committee was infor­med that NDMA had identified prime sites for rainwater reservoirs but provincial land acquisition delays were stalling progress. Members also raised concerns over sea water intrusion in Sindh and flood and erosion damage in district of Layyah calling for a national strategy beyond provincial jurisdictions.
The meeting was attended by MNAs Musarrat Asif Kha­waja, Syeda Shehla Raza, Sha­gufta Jumani, Rana Ansar, Ghu­lam Muhammad, Mus­sa­rat, Rafique Mahesar, Sahib­zada Sibghatullah, Shahzada Muhammad Gushtasap Khan, Awais Haider Jakhar and Ayesha Nazir along with Ministers of Water Resources, Science and Technology, Energy and National Food.

The Republican-controlled House of Representatives earlier launched a final yes-or-no vote on the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ after the chamber’s top Democrat delayed action with a record-breaking speech that lasted more than eight hours.
Republicans called the vote after a marathon overnight session in which they cleared a procedural hurdle, setting the stage for final passage.
“Now we are finally ready to fulfil our promise to the American people,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said on the House floor.
Republicans control the chamber 220-212 and can afford to lose no more than three votes from their side.
The bill would extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, cut healthcare and food safety net programmes, fund the president’s immigration crackdown and eliminate many green-energy incentives.
It also includes a $5 trillion increase in the nation’s debt ceiling, which lawmakers must address in the coming months to avert a devastating default.
Republicans broadly support the bill, which contains most of Trump’s domestic priorities, saying it would spur economic growth and deliver tax breaks to Americans across the economic spectrum.
Democrats are united in opposition to the bill but lack the votes to stop it.
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries blasted the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy in an eight-hour, 46-minute speech that set a new record for the chamber.
“This disgusting abomination is not about improving the quality of life of the American people,” he said. “The focus of this bill, the justification for all of the cuts that will hurt everyday Americans, is to provide massive tax breaks for billionaires.”
Jeffries’ speech recalled a record-setting April speech by Democratic Senator Cory Booker that accused Trump of “recklessly” challenging the nation’s democratic institutions.
The past two weeks have shown deep Republican divides on the bill, which would add $3.4tr to the nation’s $36.2tr debt. That debt has grown steadily over the past two decades, regardless of which party was in control in Washington.
The bill also makes major cuts to social programmes, including Medicaid, ultimately leaving nearly 12 million Americans without health insurance. Rural hospitals have warned that this could force them to scale back service, prompting Republicans to add $50 billion to help keep them afloat.
A handful of Republican holdouts have objected to the bill. One, Senator Thom Tillis, opted not to seek re-election after voting against it.
Nonetheless, Trump has succeeded in getting the votes to advance the legislation at each step of the way. The Senate passed the legislation by the narrowest possible margin on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-07-03 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612277-czech-mountaineer-dies-during-nanga-parbat-expedition' target='_blank'><strong>Czech mountaineer dies during Nanga Parbat expedition</strong></a><br><p>

The Nanga Parbat — the world’s ninth-highest mountain — is notoriously known as the “Killer Mountain”, earning its grisly nickname after more than 30 climbers died trying to conquer it before the first successful summit in 1953.
Muhammad Qasim, coordinator to the GB chief minister, told Dawn.com: “A tragic incident occurred at the Nanga Parbat base camp around 4am as a foreign tourist, Kolouchava Klara from the Czech Republic died.”
He had attributed her death to an oxygen cylinder explosion. However, Diamer Additional Deputy Commissioner Nizamuddin told Dawn.com the climber fell from a height between Camp One and Camp Two. He said the location where she fell would be traced and the recovery operation would begin thereafter.
“The team accompanying the climber had come to the base camp and informed about her death,” the official said.
“There were initial reports that the woman had died due to an oxygen cylinder explosion, but it was later confirmed that she had fallen into a ravine, which was the cause of her death.”
Qasim said she was staying in Chilas with her team since June 15 and departed for the base camp with it on June 16.  They had reached Bonner Base Camp on June 17, he added.
He added that the authorities launched an investigation into the incident following the GB government’s direction and all possible assistance was being provided to the victim’s team.
A rescue operation using a helicopter was planned for tomorrow to search for Klara, he added.
In May, two climbers died on Mount Everest in the March-May climbing season of the world’s highest peak.
Last August, a climber from Skardu, Murad Sadpara, succumbed to his injuries, a day after the Pakistan Army had launched an operation to rescue him from GB’s Broad Peak.</p><small>2025-07-03 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/032306046347c0d.jpg?r=230610' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921893/lhc-holds-imran-responsible-for-conspiracy-and-abetment-in-may-9-riots' target='_blank'><strong>LHC holds Imran responsible for ‘conspiracy and abetment’ in May 9 riots</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore High Court on Thursday ruled that the prosecution evidence concerning offences attributed to jailed PTI founder Imran Khan in connection with the May 9, 2023, riots amounted to “conspiracy and abetment”.
Following the arrest of the ex-premier on May 9, 2023, from the Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) premises, riots erupted across the country and went on for at least 24 hours. Protesters vandalised and torched government buildings and military installations, while also breaking into the residence of the Lahore corps commander. The state subsequently launched a crackdown against him and his party, filing several other cases against Imran since the events of May 9, in many of which he has been acquitted.
Imran had approached the LHC seeking post-arrest bail in eight cases of the May 9 riots, including an attack on the corps commander’s residence, in January. The other cases involve attacks on Askari Tower at Liberty, PML-N offices in Model Town, Shadman police station, the burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House and violence at Sherpao Bridge. Previously, an antiterrorism court had on Nov 27, 2024, denied bail to the former prime minister in these cases. The LHC had also denied the request last week in a short order.
In their detailed verdict issued today, Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and Justice Tariq Mahmood Bajwa said: “In this view of the matter argument furnished by learned counsel for the petitioner (Imran Khan) to the effect that on May 9, 2023, the petitioner was in jail is of no help to him.”
In its detailed verdict, the bench reproduced the statements of two police officials, the prosecution witnesses, who claimed to have secretly attended the meetings of the PTI wherein the party’s founder allegedly gave instructions to other party leaders to attack military installations in case of his imminent arrest from the IHC.
The bench observed that the statements of the witnesses were not to be termed as belated.
It said the role assigned to the petitioner, evident from the statements of the witnesses, attracted the provisions of Section 120-B (punishment for criminal conspiracy) and 121-A (conspiracy to commit offence of waging or attempting to wage war against the country) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The bench held that the statements of the witnesses prima facie reflected that the conspiracy and abetment for the offences committed on May 9 were perpetrated by the petitioner on May 4 at Chakri rest area, Rawalpindi, on May 7 and on May 9 at Lahore.
“We have also noticed that the effect of the petitioner’s criminal conspiracy/abetment and the words uttered by him resulted in loss of lives and the state property. The petitioner’s case being the leader of the all co-accused is distinguishable from those who have been granted bail by different courts,” the judges of the bench observed.
The bench noted that the prosecution was equipped with the audio, video clips and transcripts prepared by the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, which required forensic analysis.
However, it said that despite successive efforts by the investigating officer, Imran had declined to make himself available for the purpose of polygraph and photogrammetric tests, which, prima facie, hindered the process of investigation, reflecting his evasive conduct.
With these observations, the judges observed, “We are not inclined to grant post-arrest bail to the petitioner and being so, this petition is dismissed.”</p><small>2025-07-03 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0319213952c7a69.jpg?r=192358' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921880/iran-diplomat-says-open-to-talks-if-us-rules-out-military-action' target='_blank'><strong>Iran diplomat says open to talks if US rules out military action</strong></a><br><p>A senior Iranian diplomat said on Thursday his country remains open to diplomacy provided the United States offers guarantees it will not resort to military action against the Islamic Republic.
The remarks came as US news website Axios, citing two unidentified sources, reported that White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was planning to meet Iran’s foreign minister and chief negotiator, Abbas Araghchi, in Oslo next week.
Neither Tehran nor Washington confirmed the Axios report, which said a final date for the talks has yet to be set.
“We are for diplomacy,” Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi told NBC News, adding that the US should “convince us that they are not going to use military force while we are negotiating”.
“That is an essential element for our leadership to be in a position to decide about the future round of talks,” he added.
Tehran and Washington had held five rounds of nuclear talks since April 12 and were set to hold a new round two days before Israel launched a bombing campaign against Iran on June 13.
 
 

The Israeli strikes targeted Iranian nuclear sites and killed several senior military officials and nuclear scientists.
On June 22, the US launched unprecedented strikes of its own on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz.
More than 900 people were killed in Iran during the conflict, according to the judiciary.
The Israeli attacks drew waves of retaliatory drone and missile fire, killing 28 people in Israel, according to authorities.
 
 

A ceasefire between Iran and Israel was agreed on June 24.
During the nuclear talks, which were stalled because of the fighting, Iran and the US had been at sharp odds over Iran’s uranium enrichment, which Tehran considers a “non-negotiable” right and which Washington has called a “red line”.
Iran has insisted on its right to enrich uranium even after the 12-day war with Israel.
“Our policy has not changed on enrichment,” Takht-Ravanchi told NBC News.
“Iran has every right to do enrichment within its territory. The only thing that we have to observe is not to go for militarisation. “
At the same time, Iran affirmed its commitment to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), as it accused Germany of “malice” over its criticism of Tehran’s decision to suspend cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog.
“Iran remains committed to the NPT and its Safeguards Agreement,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X.
“The explicit German support for the bombing of Iran has obliterated the notion that the German regime harbours anything but malice towards Iranians,” he added in response to a German foreign office post criticising the move.
 






On Wednesday, Iran officially suspended its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, citing the agency’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.
In a post on X, Germany’s foreign office called on Iran to “reverse this decision,” saying it sends a “devastating message”.
“It eliminates any possibility of international oversight of the Iranian nuclear programme, which is crucial for a diplomatic solution,” it added.
 






Araghchi lambasted what he called Germany’s “explicit support for Israel’s unlawful attack on Iran” on June 13, killing top Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists.
On June 17, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Israel was doing the “dirty work … for all of us” by targeting Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.</p><small>2025-07-03 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/03200109f7be491.jpg?r=200939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921883/manga-doomsday-prediction-spooks-tourists-to-japan' target='_blank'><strong>Manga doomsday prediction spooks tourists to Japan</strong></a><br><p>Viral rumours of impending disaster stemming from a comic book prediction have taken the sheen off Japan’s tourism boom, with some airlines cancelling flights from Hong Kong where passenger numbers have plunged.
Japan has seen record numbers of visitors this year, with April setting an all-time monthly high of 3.9 million travellers.
That dipped in May, however, with arrivals from Hong Kong — the superstitious Chinese-controlled city where the rumours have circulated widely — down 11 per cent year-on-year, according to the latest data.
Steve Huen of Hong Kong-based travel agency EGL Tours blamed a flurry of social media predictions tied to a manga that depicts a dream of a massive earthquake and tsunami hitting Japan and neighbouring countries in July 2025.
“The rumours have had a significant impact,” said Huen, adding that his firm had seen its Japan-related business halve. Discounts and the introduction of earthquake insurance had “prevented Japan-bound travel from dropping to zero,” he added.
Branden Choi, a 28-year-old Hong Kong resident, said he was a frequent traveller to Japan but was hesitant to visit the country during July and August due to the manga prediction.
“If possible, I might delay my trip and go after September”, he said.
Ryo Tatsuki, the artist behind the manga titled The Future I Saw, first published in 1999 and then re-released in 2021, has tried to dampen the speculation, saying in a statement issued by her publisher that she was “not a prophet”.
The first edition of the manga warned of a major natural disaster in March 2011. That was the month and year when a massive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster struck Japan’s northeastern coast, killing thousands.
Some have interpreted the latest edition as predicting a catastrophic event specifically on July 5, 2025, although Tatsuki has denied this.
Situated within the Pacific Ocean’s ‘Ring of Fire’, Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In recent days, there have been more than 900 earthquakes, most of them small tremors, on islands off the southern tip of Kyushu.
But Robert Geller, a professor at the University of Tokyo who has studied seismology since 1971, said even scientifically-based earthquake prediction was “impossible”.
“None of the predictions I’ve experienced in my scientific career have come close at all,” he said.
Nevertheless, low-cost carrier Greater Bay Airlines became the latest Hong Kong airline on Wednesday to cancel flights to Japan due to low demand, saying it would indefinitely suspend its service to Tokushima in western Japan from September.
Serena Peng, 30, a visitor to Tokyo from Seattle, had initially tried to talk her husband out of visiting Japan after seeing the social media speculation.
“I’m not super worried right now, but I was before,” she said, speaking outside Tokyo’s bustling Senso-ji temple.
5.5-magnitude quake hits Japan island
Meanwhile, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.5 hit a remote island in southwestern Japan today, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.
The earthquake’s epicentre was off the coast of the Tokara island chain in Kagoshima prefecture, nearly 1,200 kilometres from Tokyo, the agency said, adding that a tsunami warning had not been issued.
 






The quake hit at a depth of 20km, giving it a seismic intensity of ‘6 lower’ on Japan’s 1-7 scale on Akuseki Island, the agency said. Akuseki has a population of 89. The intensity is classified as a level that makes it “difficult to remain standing”, according to the agency.
More than 1,000 tremors with a seismic intensity of 1 or above on the Japanese scale have been detected around the island chain between June 21 and July 3, the agency said.</p><small>2025-07-03 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/03222706c7f6e4a.jpg?r=223312' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921891/putin-tells-trump-he-wont-back-down-from-goals-in-ukraine-kremlin-says' target='_blank'><strong>Putin tells Trump he won’t back down from goals in Ukraine, Kremlin says</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin told United States President Donald Trump in a phone call on Thursday that Moscow wants a negotiated end to the Ukraine war, but will not step back from its original goals, a Kremlin aide said.
In a wide-ranging conversation that also covered Iran and the Middle East, Trump “again raised the issue of an early end to military action” in Ukraine, the aide, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters.
“Vladimir Putin, for his part, noted that we continue to seek a political and negotiated solution to the conflict,” Ushakov said.
Putin briefed Trump on the implementation of agreements reached between Russia and Ukraine last month to exchange prisoners-of-war and dead soldiers, Ushakov said, and told him that Moscow was ready to continue negotiations with Kyiv.
“Our president also said that Russia will achieve the goals it has set: that is, the elimination of the well-known root causes that led to the current state of affairs, to the current acute confrontation, and Russia will not back down from these goals,” he added.
There was nothing in the Kremlin readout to suggest that Putin had made any shift in Moscow’s position during the conversation with Trump, who took office with a promise to end the war swiftly but has voiced frequent frustration with the lack of progress between the two sides.
The phrase “root causes” is shorthand for the Kremlin’s argument that it was compelled to go to war in Ukraine to prevent the country from joining Nato and being used by the Western alliance as a launch pad to attack Russia.
Ukraine and its European allies say that is a specious pretext for what they call an imperial-style war, but Trump in previous public comments has shown sympathy with Moscow’s refusal to accept Nato membership for Ukraine.
Putin and Trump did not talk about the US decision to halt some shipments of critical weapons to Ukraine, Ushakov said.
On Iran, he said, “The Russian side emphasised the importance of resolving all disputes, disagreements and conflict situations exclusively by political and diplomatic means.”
Trump last month sent US stealth bombers to strike three Iranian nuclear sites, in a move condemned by Moscow as unprovoked and illegal.</p><small>2025-07-03 17:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/032211217168ad3.jpg?r=222038' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921828/karachi-police-issue-traffic-plan-for-8-10th-muharram-processions' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police issue traffic plan for 8-10th Muharram processions</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi Traffic Police (KTP) on Thursday issued a traffic plan for 8-10th Muharram, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.
Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), which will be observed on Sunday.
The government today officially notified July 5 and July 6 (Saturday and Sunday) as public holidays on account of Ashura, both for offices observing a five and six-day working week.
 






According to the KTP plan, Muharram processions on all three days will depart Nishtar Park and culminate at Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah after following their traditional fixed routes.
Due to security reasons, MA Jinnah Road will remain closed from Guru Mandir to Tower.
The police broke down the procession routes as follows in a press release:

From Nazimabad Lasbela, Albela, right side Garden Jamaat Khana, Soldier Bazaar No 3 light signal to Numaish
From Liaquatabad, Tin Hatti, Jahangir Road, Guru Mandir to Numaish
From the Society light signal to Numaish
From Gulistan-i-Johar and Gulshan Iqbal, University Road, Old Sabzi Mandi, Kashmir Road and Society light signal to Numaish

Additionally, vehicles performing sabeel, niaz or tabarruk were instructed to enter the procession route at Tower/Memon Mosque.
Offering alternative routes for District Central, the press release said: “People coming from Nazimabad can proceed from Lasbela Chowk to Nishtar Road via Garden towards their destination.”
It said people coming from Liaquatabad could turn right from Tin Hatti to Lasbela Chowk and left to Central Jail via Martin Road.
“People going from Hassan Square to PP Chowrangi can go from Kashmir Road under the Jail Flyover to Society Light Signal (Shahrah-i-Quaideen) and from Jail Flyover to Tin Hatti to Nishtar Road (Lasbela Chowk).”
Outlining routes in District East, the KTP said, “People going from Sharea Faisal to Shahrah-i-Quaideen to Numaish can go from Society Light Signal to Kashmir Road to their destination.”
The press release added that citizens travelling from Central Jail Gate along Jamshed Road to Gurumandir on MA Jinnah Road could go from Gurumandir to Bahadur Yar Jang Road, then on Soldier Bazaar to their destination.
“People going from Garden Zoo to MA Jinnah Road can go to their destination from Uncle Saria, Gul Plaza on the right and Coast Guard Holy Family Hospital on the left,” the press release reads.
The KTP said that heavy traffic going from Super Highway and Gulberg towards MA Jinnah Road would be diverted from Liaquatabad to Nazimabad Chowrangi, travelling via the Habib Bank Flyover to State Avenue Road, Shershah and Maripur.
“The same route will be taken for the return journey,” the police said.
“All heavy or commercial traffic coming from the National Highway towards the city, whether via Sharea Faisal or Rashid Minhas Road, Stadium Road, Sir Shah Suleman Road, Hassan Square, Liaquatabad, Nazimabad Chowrangi, the Habib Bank Flyover, State Avenue Road, or Shershah will be allowed to come to Maripur and the same route will be used for return journeys.”
The press release stated that no traffic would be allowed onto MA Jinnah Road beyond Gurumandir Chowk, unless the vehicle had a sticker to join the procession.
“Vehicles with stickers to join the procession will be allowed to enter via the Shahrah-i-Qaideen Society light signal,” the press release reads.
Separately, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon asserted that the provincial government has adopted foolproof security arrangements for Muharram, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, Memon announced that a total of 49,662 police personnel will be deployed in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas and Shaheed Benazirabad from Muharram 8 to 10 to prevent any untoward incidents.
He noted that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah held meetings with various religious scholars and reviewed the security plan for gatherings and processions.
Providing a breakdown of the security plan, Memon said 14,546 police personnel will be deployed for gatherings and 35,116 for Muharram processions, with over 14,000 additional personnel assigned to ensure the security of all events.
 






For Muharram, Islamabad police have identified 13 points as potential trouble spots, banned the entry of 17 “firebrand” ulema and increased intelligence operations.
 
 

While the Punjab government has imposed certain restrictions under Section 144 across the province till Sunday, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa administration has limited it to sensitive districts. In Karachi, over 20,000 officers and personnel have been deployed till Ashura.
Naqvi meets religious scholars, stresses role in ensuring peace
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi stressed the crucial role of religious scholars in ensuring peace during Muharram.
“It is not enough how much we thank you for your role — the heads and ulema of all sects — in Muharram, as everyone has a role in this,” Naqvi said as he met with scholars from various schools of thought in Islamabad.
 






Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad, chairman of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, were also present during the meeting.
Naqvi highlighted that the efforts of law enforcement agencies during Muharram were as important as those of religious scholars, according to a post on X by the interior ministry.
During the meeting, Naqvi noted that ulema remained in “constant communication” with the administration during Muharram and “solved minor disputes”.
He requested Maulana Azad, as well as other scholars, to collectively offer Zuhr prayers at Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque on August 14. “This will give a message to the whole world that we are all united, and there is no better day than the 14th of August.”
Chaudhry also credited religious scholars for dealing with terrorism, sectarianism, and maintaining peace during the month of Muharram.
On his part, Maulana Azad affirmed that they all were united for the country’s security.
Speaking about the uptick in terrorism in KP, Naqvi called on the ulema to engage with religious scholars in the province, offering his cooperation in the matter.
“This terrorism will only end on the condition that the locals there do not help them,” he said.
 






The interior minister’s remarks come just a day after an assistant commissioner and four others were martyred, while policemen were among 17 others injured as an official vehicle was targeted in Bajaur’s Sadiqabad area.
During the meeting, Naqvi also highlighted the role of the armed forces in the recent Iran-Israel ceasefire, saying Pakistan should be proud of “convincing world leaders” and of playing its role as a Muslim country.
Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif noted that Iran openly thanked the people of Pakistan, its political parties, military, and political leadership for their role in ensuring the ceasefire between the two countries.
83 arrested across Punjab in 4 days for ‘hateful content’
Separately, the Punjab Police said today they had registered 72 cases and arrested 83 individuals over the past four days for sharing “objectionable” content on social media.
Providing the details of the past 24 hours on X, the police said 20 cases had been filed and 24 had been taken into custody for uploading “objectionable and hateful content” on social media platforms.
It warned the public that strict action would be taken against those spreading “sectarian, hateful or inflammatory content” on social media.
 






The Punjab Home Department also said it reported 932 social media accounts to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) for spreading inciteful content.
“The Home Department’s Cyber Patrolling and Quick Response Cell is functioning 24/7, and is monitoring and taking immediate action against sectarian, inciteful and religious hatred-based content,” the department said on X.

Romania has a brown bear population of 10,000 to 13,000, preliminary results of a multi-year DNA study showed this year, and authorities are struggling to keep residents and tourists in mountain towns safe.
Police and emergency services said in a joint statement that tourists had alerted them to Thursday’s attack on the Transfagarasan road in the central county of Arges. The bear had dragged the motorcyclist down a ravine, they said.
There were no details about the motorcyclist’s identity.
Almost 30 people have been killed by bears in Romania over the last two decades, the environment ministry has said. Sightings of bears are common and local media regularly report bear attacks on people and livestock.
Last year, Romania’s parliament doubled the annual bear kill quota to 481 bear kills per year to control the size of the bear population and to remove animals that have become accustomed to entering cities in search of food.
Wildlife experts have said bear attacks have increased because of human behaviour as the shrinking of the animals’ habitats due to construction, logging and climate change.
Many bears are also attracted by rubbish dumps on the outskirts of cities and by discarded food. Officials have not done enough to step up prevention measures, including electric fences and better trash management, wildlife experts said.</p><small>2025-07-03 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612262-ttap-chief-achakzai-offers-pm-talks-on-unity-govt' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP chief Achakzai offers PM talks on unity govt</strong></a><br><p>

In April, Kaspersky — a cybersecurity company that provides antivirus and other security software for computers and mobile devices — said that widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies in recent years has provided “threat actors with sophisticated new tools to perpetrate attacks”.
In a press release issued today, Kaspersky said that based on the “unique malicious and unwanted files” observed, the most common lures for the cyberattacks included Zoom and Microsoft Office, with newer AI-based services such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek being increasingly exploited by attackers.
It said its analysts explored how frequently malicious and unwanted software was disguised as legitimate applications commonly used by SMBs, using a sample of 12 online productivity apps.
“In total, Kaspersky observed more than 4,000 unique malicious and unwanted files disguised as popular apps in 2025. With the growing popularity of AI services, cybercriminals are increasingly disguising malware as AI tools.
“The number of cyberthreats mimicking ChatGPT increased by 115 per cent in the first four months of 2025 compared to the same period last year, reaching 177 unique malicious and unwanted files. Another popular AI tool, DeepSeek, accounted for 83 files. This large language model launched in 2025 immediately appeared on the list of impersonated tools.”
 
 

Vasily Kolesnikov, security expert at Kaspersky, noted that threat actors were rather selective in choosing an AI tool as bait.
“The likelihood that an attacker will use a tool as a disguise for malware or other types of unwanted software directly depends on the service’s popularity and hype around it.”
He added that the more publicity and conversation there was around a tool, the more likely a user would come across a fake package on the internet.
Kolesnikov warned SMB employees to exercise caution when looking for software on the internet or when they encountered “too-good-to-be-true” subscription deals, advising them to check the correct spellings of the websites and links in suspicious emails.
“In many cases, these links may turn out to be phishing or a link that downloads malicious or potentially unwanted software,” he added.
The firm also warned about the growing use of collaboration platform brands to trick users into downloading or launching malware.
“The number of malicious and unwanted software files disguised as Zoom increased by nearly 13pc in 2025, reaching 1,652, while such names as ‘Microsoft Teams’ and ‘Google Drive’ saw increases of 100pc and 12pc, respectively, with 206 and 132 cases,” it said, noting that the pattern likely reflected the normalisation of remote work and geographically distributed teams, which has made these platforms integral to business operations across industries.
The firm said that among the analysed sample, the highest number of files mimicked Zoom, accounting for nearly 41pc of all unique files detected. Of Microsoft Office applications being mimicked, Outlook and PowerPoint each accounted for 16pc, Excel for nearly 12pc, while Word and Teams made up 9pc and 5pc, respectively.
It added that downloaders, trojans and adware were among the top threats targeting SMBs in 2025.
“Apart from malware threats, Kaspersky continues to observe a wide range of phishing and scam schemes targeting SMBs. Attackers aim to steal login credentials for various services — from delivery platforms to banking systems — or manipulate victims into sending them money through deceptive tactics. One example is a phishing attempt targeting Google Accounts. Attackers promise potential victims to increase sales by advertising their company on X, with the ultimate goal of stealing their credentials.
“Beyond phishing, SMBs are flooded with spam emails. Not surprisingly, AI has also made its way into the spam folder — for example, with offers for automating various business processes.”
The firm concluded by advising owners and employees of SMBs to use specialised cybersecurity solutions to mitigate threats, define access rules for corporate resources such as shared folders and documents, and back up important data regularly.
It also recommended establishing clear guidelines for using external services and creating well-defined procedures to implement new software.</p><small>2025-07-03 15:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612246-sindhs-number-plate-drive-fuels-fines-public-anger-processing-delays' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh's number plate drive fuels fines, public anger, processing delays</strong></a><br><p>

On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
An Anti-Terrorism Court in Islamabad had sentenced PTI MNA Abdul Latif and 11 other party members were convicted under various charges on May 30  for attacking the Ramna police station in Islamabad.
Following the verdict, the police took the four of the convicted members present in the court, namely Mira Khan, Muhammad Akram, Shahzeb, and Sohail Khan, into custody.
During today’s hearing, Justice Azam Khan and Justice Khadim Soomro acquitted the four convicts after the prosecution was unable to prove their presence at the scene of the protest based on the witnesses’ accounts.
The convicts had been charged under Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 186 (obstructing official duty), 188 (disobeying order of a public servant), 324 (attempted mu­r­der), 353 (assault on public servants), 436 (arson) and 440 (misch­ief); Sect­ion 144 of CrPC; and Sec­tion 7 of the Anti Terro­rism Act (ATA), 1997.
They were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment under Section 7 ATA, five years under Section 324 of PPC, four under Section 436, two each under sections 353 and 148.
Additionally, the convicts were sentenced to four years in prison and fined Rs40,000 for burning a motorcycle under Section 426 (punishment for mischief); and a separate sentence of four years in prison and a fine of Rs40,000 under Section 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) for vandalising a police station.
A sentence of three-month imprisonment was imposed for interfering in the work of the police under Section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), one month for violating Section 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon), and two years for committing a crime in a group under Section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common object).
The sentences were to run concurrently.
The hearing
PTI lawyer Babar Awan argued that out of the nine prosecution witnesses, only one witness — Assistant Sub-Inspector Muhammad Sharif — was able to identify the accused.
He said, “While it was alleged that the protesters had resorted to firing, no one was injured. The crime must be punished, but the system should not be made into a joke.”
Justice Soomro asked the prosecutor, Nasir Shah, to present the evidence. Shah said that the evidence had been collected but sought more time to present it before the court.
The bench said that if more time was required, then it should have been informed in advance, since now it had heard all the arguments.
It further said that no one was injured, adding that the prosecution should prove the presence of the accused at the scene.
The judges said that the witnesses’ statements did not include any mention that the accused were present at the scene. They questioned whether the court would now hand down sentences based on an identity parade.
Meanwhile, the prosecutor said, “What could be a greater act of terrorism than an attack on a police station?”</p><small>2025-07-03 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/031824564b147a0.jpg?r=183025' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921869/pm-arrives-in-azerbaijan-to-attend-17th-eco-summit' target='_blank'><strong>PM arrives in Azerbaijan to attend 17th ECO Summit</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif arrived in Azerbaijan on Thursday to participate in the 17th Summit of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO).
The summit is set to run from July 3–4 in Khankendi, convening ECO heads of states/governments, ministers, ECO observers, special guests from non-ECO countries and heads of international organisations to achieve development and prosperity through fragile economic integration.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the prime minister during the two-day visit.
The delegation arrived in the city of Shusha for a two-day visit, where it was received by Azerbaijan’s Minister for Culture Adil Karimli, at Fuzuli Airport.
 






Pakistan’s Ambassador to Azerbaijan Qasim Mohiuddin and other senior diplomatic and government officials were also present to welcome the delegation.
 






In a statement ahead of the visit, the Foreign Office had said the prime minister would “share Pakistan’s perspective on key regional and global challenges, reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to the ECO Vision 2025, and advocate for enhanced intra-regional trade, transport connectivity, energy cooperation, and sustainable development”.
He will also hold bilateral meetings with other ECO leaders on the sidelines of the summit to discuss matters of mutual interest, the statement added.
The theme of the summit is ‘New ECO Vision for a Sustainable and Climate Resilient Future’.
According to a statement by ECO, the summit will convene ECO heads of states/governments, ministers, observers, special guests from non-ECO countries and heads of international organisations to achieve development and prosperity through fragile economic integration.
The summit will feature a “dynamic and inclusive ECO Week”, held from July 1–4 across multiple cities in Azerbaijan. The ECO week will include a series of thematic forums aimed at advancing youth engagement, gender inclusion and economic connectivity within the region.
The 16th ECO summit was held from November 9, 2023, in Tashkent, Uzbekistan and attended by then-caretaker prime minister Anwarul Haq Kakar.</p><small>2025-07-03 13:33</small></div><hr>
