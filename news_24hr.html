“I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday,” Trump said during his visit to Qatar.
“I said to him, Tim, you’re my friend, I treated you very good. You’re coming here with $500 billion, but now you’re building all over India,” he said, referring to Apple’s plan announced in February to invest $500bn in the US over the next four years.
 
 

Trump said he informed Cook that he does not want him to build production facilities in India, and that Apple will be “upping their production in the United States”.
The US president claimed that selling American goods in the world’s most populous country is “very difficult” because India has one of the highest tariff barriers in the world.
However, he noted that while the Asian country looks for a deal on import duties, India has offered them a “no-tariff” deal.
Trump’s remarks came after Tim Cook said earlier this month that the majority of Apple’s products to be sold in the US in the coming months will be sourced from India and Vietnam rather than China, which has been the target of US President Donald Trump’s highest tariffs.
“We do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,” Cook said.
The primary production location “for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products sold in the US” will be Vietnam in the meantime.
Cook noted that the great bulk of all products sold outside the US will continue to be manufactured in China.
Apple is among the most impacted tech firms in the US, with its shares falling by around 5.1 per cent since the tariffs were announced.
Due to low production costs, the majority of Apple products are now manufactured in China.
The Trump administration has repeatedly stated that it wants Apple to move production to the US.
Earlier this week, the US and China agreed to a sweeping rollback of punitive tariffs for an initial 90-day period, signalling a rare moment of relief in their protracted trade conflict and raising hopes for longer-term economic stability.</p><small>2025-05-15 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604588-heatwave-to-continue-across-pakistan-until-sunday-met-office' target='_blank'><strong>Heatwave to continue across Pakistan until Sunday, Met office</strong></a><br><p>

The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the Pahalgam attack. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan. According to the government, forty civilians — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives in the Indian aggression, and 121 others sustained injuries.
Speaking to Sky News, DG ISPR warned that by rooting for war, India was carving out a “recipe for mutual destruction,” adding that the world now recognised the extent of the nuclear threat.
“Any sane player like the USA understands this absurdity and what the Indians are trying to do here,” Lt Gen Chaudhry told the publications.
Talking about India’s actions in Kashmir, he accused the country of trying to “internalise the issue and harassing” Kashmiri people with a heavy troop presence.
“It is a problem that has to be resolved by the people of Kashmir as per the United Nations Security Council resolution,” he said.
He continued: “Anyone who tries to violate our territory and integrity and sovereignty, our response will be brutal.”
DG ISPR warned that a “serious escalation between India and Pakistan would destroy both sides” under the concept of mutually assured destruction — a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy which posits that a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by an attacker on a nuclear-armed defender with second-strike capabilities would result in the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.
In a press conference held last week after the ceasefire was brokered, DG ISPR had cautioned that a conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi “can lead to peril of more than 1.6 billion people.”
“In reality, there is no space for war between India and Pakistan,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-15 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15151800e092778.jpg?r=151806' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911203/india-has-offered-us-a-trade-deal-with-no-tariffs-trump' target='_blank'><strong>India has offered US a trade deal with no tariffs: Trump</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “no tariffs” for American goods, while expressing his dissatisfaction with Apple’s (AAPL.O) plans to invest in India.
New Delhi is seeking to clinch a trade deal with the US within the 90-day pause announced by Trump on April 9 on tariff hikes for major trading partners.
“It is very hard to sell in India, and they are offering us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariffs,” Trump said in a meeting with executives in the Qatari capital Doha.
Reuters has reported that New Delhi has offered to reduce duties to zero on 60 per cent of tariff lines in a first phase of the deal under negotiation with Washington, while offering preferential access to nearly 90pc of the merchandise India imports from the US.
India’s equity benchmarks jumped to a seven-month high after Trump’s comment on the deal with India.
The Indian trade ministry did not reply to a mail seeking comments on the proposed deal.
Trump in Doha said he had confronted Apple’s CEO Tim Cook about shifting production to India, as the American company moves to make most of its iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026, and is speeding up those plans to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China.
“Tim, we treated you very good, we put up with all the plants you built in China for years … we are not interested in you building in India, India can take care of themselves, they are doing very well, we want you to build here”, Trump recalled himself telling Cook, who was not in the Doha meeting.
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi has in recent years promoted India as a smartphone manufacturing hub and Apple’s suppliers have ramped up production in the country.
In March, Apple’s main India suppliers Foxconn and Tata shipped nearly $2 billion worth of iPhones to the US, an all-time high, to bypass Trump’s impending tariffs.
The United States is India’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade totalling some $129bn in 2024. The trade balance is currently in favour of India, which runs a $45.7bn surplus with the US.
India’s trade minister Piyush Goyal will lead a trade delegation to the United States starting May 16 to advance trade negotiations, two government officials told Reuters on Tuesday.
India has some of the world’s highest tariffs on imports, and Trump has previously called India a “tariff abuser”.</p><small>2025-05-15 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604581-spectacular-human-formation-of-j-10c-jet-pays-tribute-to-paf-allies' target='_blank'><strong>Spectacular human formation of J-10C jet pays tribute to PAF, allies</strong></a><br><p>

US President Donald Trump, on his Gulf tour, met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Wednesday. Despite concerns within sectors of his administration over Syria’s leaders’ former ties to Al Qaeda, Trump said on Tuesday during a speech in Riyadh that he would lift sanctions on Syria in a major policy shift.
“Pakistan has consistently advocated for constructive engagement and dialogue. The easing of sanctions is expected to facilitate economic growth, improve access to essential services, and support the rebuilding efforts of the Syrian authorities,” the FO statement read.
Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment towards Syria’s unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, the statement said, “Pakistan supports a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned resolution.”
“We commend the commitment of all countries, in particular the US, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, working constructively towards a peaceful Syria,” the statement read.
The decision is a major boost for Sharaa, who has been struggling to bring the country under the control of the Damascus government after toppling former President Bashar al-Assad in December.
According to Al Jazeera, the US was one of many countries that sanctioned Syria under the al-Assad regime (1971–2024). It labelled Syria a “State Sponsor of Terrorism” in 1979, triggering arms and financial restrictions.
Sanctions expanded in 2004 and intensified after the 2011 war, targeting regime-linked individuals, freezing assets, banning US investments, and restricting oil imports.
The US also offered a $10 million reward for Syria’s current leader, al-Sharaa, and designated his former group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a “Foreign Terrorist Organisation”.</p><small>2025-05-15 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15162543b42c813.jpg?r=163912' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911209/swedish-prosecutors-deny-spy-agency-arrests-linked-to-turkish-case' target='_blank'><strong>Swedish prosecutors deny spy agency arrests linked to Turkish case</strong></a><br><p>Swedish prosecutors said on Thursday the intelligence service’s arrests of a Kurdish representative and a Swedish diplomat were not linked to a journalist facing “terror” charges in Turkiye.
Public broadcaster Sveriges Radio had alleged late on Wednesday that one of the suspects was connected to the case of Swedish journalist Joakim Medin, who is currently in custody in Turkey awaiting trial on a charge of belonging to a “terrorist” group.
The Swedish Security Service (Sapo) confirmed to AFP that two people had recently been arrested for “aggravated unauthorised handling of secret information”.
They had since been released but were still suspects, Sapo said. It declined to disclose any details of the case.
Sveriges Radio said one of the suspects in Sapo’s case was a Swedish citizen who was a leading representative for Kurds in Northern Syria. The other was a diplomat at the foreign ministry.
The broadcaster said it was unclear whether the arrests had been made as a result of a request from Turkey or not.
But on Thursday, the Swedish Prosecution Authority published a statement refuting the media reports.
“This is an individual case that has no links to other ongoing investigations or legal proceedings, in Sweden or in other countries,” public prosecutor Mats Ljungqvist said, noting the investigation was in an early stage.
Turkey has accused Medin, who works for Swedish newspaper Dagens ETC, of being a member of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), an allegation he has denied.
Medin was detained at Istanbul airport on March 27 when he flew in to cover mass protests gripping Turkey.
A Turkish court last month handed the 40-year-old an 11-month suspended sentence on charges of insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
In order to persuade Turkey to drop its veto when Sweden applied to join NATO, the countries made a deal that included increased collaboration on “terrorism”.
At the weekend, Sapo arrested a second diplomat on suspicions of spying. That diplomat was also released but remains a suspect, although the intelligence agency told AFP that was related to a separate investigation.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a NATO meeting in Turkey, Swedish Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard confirmed there were two investigations ongoing relating to government employees.
“These are serious accusations but I can’t say more than that,” Stenergard said.
Stenergard said she had spoken to her Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan on Wednesday about Medin’s case.</p><small>2025-05-15 11:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/15162039badf1e7.jpg?r=163054' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911206/bullish-momentum-at-psx-as-shares-gain-1400-points-after-sbp-receives-2nd-imf-tranche' target='_blank'><strong>Bullish momentum at PSX as shares gain 1,400 points after SBP receives 2nd IMF tranche</strong></a><br><p>Bulls took control of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday as shares gained over 1,400 points, bringing calm to yesterday’s heightened volatility.
The positive momentum comes just a day after Pakistan received the second tranche from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), worth $1 billion, under its loan programme.
The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of  858.23 points (0.73 per cent) to stand at 119,394.75 points from the previous close of 118,536.52 at 9:40am.
The intraday high was recorded 119,990.30 points at around 3:18pm, 1,453.78 points (1.23pc) higher than yesterday.
Finally, the KSE-100 closed at 119,961.91 points, with a gain of 1,425.39 points (1.20pc) compared to the previous close.

Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the market was positive due to the recent inflows from the IMF.
He also noted there were “expectations of further inflows on the back of the IMF Board approval”, which on May 9 greenlit the $1bn tranche but also allowed an additional arrangement for $1.4bn climate funds under the Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
 
 

Today’s bullish momentum comes as the market continues to recover from the upheaval brought by the intense military row between Pakistan and India last week, after the two agreed to a ceasefire.
Shares in the subsequent session had gained a record 9pc.
Tariq also mentioned lower yields on treasury bill auctions and expectations of resolution of circular debt in the gas and power sectors.
Last month, the energy ministry had informed the National Assembly that the circular debt had declined by Rs9bn during the first six months of the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-05-15 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604576-pakistan-capable-of-deterring-india-without-nuclear-blackmail' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan capable of 'deterring India without nuclear blackmail'</strong></a><br><p>

The explosion hit Maulana Noorullah’s car near Shahzad Madrassah, adjacent to a police station in the district’s Azam Warsak market. According to a police statement, the bomb attack was carried out to target Maulana Noorullah, who remained unharmed.
Police confirmed the incident and said there were no casualties in the explosion. Security forces cordoned off the area and started an investigation.
According to a video later released by the JUI-F, Maulana Noorullah told his supporters that he was accompanied by local party leaders Maulana Ishaq and Maulana Amanullah when the blast occurred.
“We all are safe,” he told his supporters. “We want peace in the country and protection of religious schools, mosques and all Muslims.”
JUI-F leaders have been targeted in different parts of KP and Balochistan over the past several months.
On March 14 this year, a bomb exploded at a mosque in South Waziristan district during Friday prayers, injuring JUI district chief Abdullah Nadeem and three others, police said. Nadeem was seriously wounded, while three others, also belonging to the JUI, sustained minor injuries.
Local JUI-F leaders have also come under attack in Balochistan. On April 25, a local leader of the JUI-F and two women were killed and five others were injured in a roadside explosion near the Kalat district.
The incident occurred in the Kapootu area when a pickup vehicle carrying eight people was hit by an improvised explosive device (IED) planted on the roadside near Killi Kapootu, according to Levies officials.
The vehicle was coming from Kalat when the blast took place. The pickup was driven by JUI-F local leader and union council member Maulana Abdullah Nachari.
In another incident on March 2, two leaders of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in the Zehri area of Khuzdar district in Balochistan.
The JUI-F leaders, Wadera Ghulam Sarwar and Molvi Amanullah were on their way home in the Tarsani area of Zehri when unknown assailants riding motorcycles opened fire on them with automatic weapons.
Both died on the spot after being shot multiple times, while the security guard of one of the leaders received bullet injuries.</p><small>2025-05-15 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/151316324049da7.jpg?r=131953' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911187/over-300-haj-pilgrims-arrive-in-jeddah-as-2nd-phase-of-road-to-makkah-initiative-launched' target='_blank'><strong>Over 300 Haj pilgrims arrive in Jeddah as 2nd phase of Road to Makkah initiative launched</strong></a><br><p>The first of 180 Pakistani Hajj flights scheduled to fly to Saudi Arabia’s Jeddah — part of the Road to Makkah Initiative — arrived at the King Abdul Aziz International Airport from Islamabad carrying 310 Haj pilgrims, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported today.
Launched in 2019 at the Islamabad airport and later extended to Karachi, the Road to Makkah initiative offers an exemption to Haj pilgrims from the immigration process at Saudi airports by clearing them at their respective airports in Pakistan by Saudi immigration officials before boarding their flights.
Marking the second phase of the initiative, the passengers were received at the airport by Minister of Religious Affairs & Interfaith Harmony Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Consul General of Pakistan in Jeddah Khalid Majid, DG Hajj Abdul Wahab Soomro and the senior officers of the Consulate General of Pakistan. The pilgrims were presented bouqets by the receiving party.
This year, an estimated 50,500 Haj pilgrims will travel to Saudi Arabia under the initiative, with 28,000 departing from Islamabad and 22,500 from Karachi throughout 180 flights, out of which 100 will depart from Islamabad and 80 from Karachi.
Housing and other essential facilities have been arranged for all the pilgrims, including service personnel such as medical staff and officials from the Ministry of Religious Affairs, to facilitate the Haj pilgrims.
In April, a Saudi immigration team arrived in the country to process Pakistani Haj pilgrims at Jinnah International Airport and Islamabad International Airport.
In 2025, Pakistan’s Haj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Haj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-05-15 09:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/151352505a50cf7.jpg?r=135314' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911193/trump-says-us-close-to-a-nuclear-deal-with-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US close to a nuclear deal with Iran</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.
“We’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,” Trump said on a tour of the Gulf, according to a shared pool report by AFP.
“We’re getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this … there [are] two steps to doing this, there is a very, very nice step and there is the violent step, but I don’t want to do it the second way,” he said.
An Iranian source familiar with the negotiations said there were still gaps to bridge in the talks with the United States.
Fresh talks between Iranian and US negotiators to resolve disputes over Tehran’s nuclear programme ended in Oman on Sunday with further negotiations planned, officials said, as Tehran publicly insisted on continuing its uranium enrichment.
Though Tehran and Washington have both said they prefer diplomacy to resolve the decades-long nuclear dispute, they remain divided on several red lines that negotiators will have to circumvent to reach a new deal and avert future military action.
Iran’s president reacted to Trump’s comments on Tuesday, calling Tehran the “most destructive force” in the Middle East.
“Trump thinks he can sanction and threaten us and then talk of human rights. All the crimes and regional instability are caused by them (the United States),” Masoud Pezeshkian said.
“He wants to create instability inside Iran.”
US officials have publicly stated that Iran should halt uranium enrichment, a stance Iranian officials have called a “red line” asserting they will not give up what they view as their right to enrich uranium on Iranian soil.
However, they have indicated a willingness to reduce the level of enrichment.
Iranian officials have also expressed readiness to reduce the amount of highly enriched uranium in storage — uranium enriched beyond the levels typically needed for civilian purposes, such as nuclear power generation.
However, they have said it would not accept lower stockpiles than the amount agreed in a deal with world powers in 2015 — the deal Trump quit.
The Iranian source said that while Iran is prepared to offer what it considers concessions, the “issue is that America is not willing to lift major sanctions in exchange”.
 
 

Western sanctions have severely impacted the Iranian economy.
Regarding the reduction of enriched uranium in storage, the source noted: “Tehran also wants it removed in several stages, which America doesn’t agree with either.”
There is also disagreement over the destination to which the highly enriched uranium would be sent, the source added.</p><small>2025-05-15 08:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604564-pakistan-india-dgmos-hold-third-hotline-contact-after-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India DGMOs 'hold third hotline contact' after ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>

• Petroleum division mulls GST on oil products
ISLAMABAD: For a third time in two months, the government is considering imposing additional costs — this time at the rate of Rs4.12 per litre — on the prices of petroleum products, a move that may deprive consumers of potential relief in prices due to be announced for the next fortnight today (Thursday).
This has been proposed by the petroleum division to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet. The impact of Rs4.12 per unit works out to be around Rs75 billion on an annual basis to be paid to oil marketing companies (OMCs), refineries and retail dealers to meet their demands.
On top of this, the petroleum division has also recommended imposition of general sales tax on petroleum products at the rate of Rs3-5 per litre from July 1, through the finance bill 2025-26.
Without these proposed measures, the prices of petrol and diesel were estimated to decline by about Rs3.5 and Rs7 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight starting May 15, owing to decline in the international market and a slight ease in import premium on petrol. Over the last two months, the government has disallowed about Rs18 per litre potential reduction in petroleum prices to discourage rise in petroleum consumption.
 
 

This was done through increase in petroleum levy, including through a special presidential ordinance, to divert funds for higher subsidy on electricity rates and construction of highways and motorways in Balochistan and Sindh.
According to a summary sent to the ECC, the petroleum division has proposed a Rs1.87 per litre allowance through changes in the pool of inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) to satisfy OMCs and refineries with an estimated financial impact of Rs34bn. In addition, the division has proposed an increase in sale margins to the OMCs at the rate of Rs1.13 and Rs1.12 per litre for petroleum dealers from their existing rates of about Rs8 and Rs8.64 per litre.
On the annual basis, the additional financial impact of the increase in margins is estimated to be more than Rs40bn depending on sales volume.
The division argued that petroleum products (petrol, high speed diesel, kerosene and light diesel oil) had been classified as “exempted” under Finance Act 2024-25. Resultantly, the input sales tax became cost of refineries and OMCs (Rs34bn for FY2024-25) which could not be recovered through the product prices as the petroleum products rates were regulated by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
Strangely, the division claimed that petroleum prices were “being fixed by Ogra under GoP Policy”. It is, however, a matter of record that actually calculations made by Ogra are forwarded by the division to the ministry of finance which itself moves a summary to the prime minister for approval every fortnight.
The major price cuts are then anno­unced by the prime minister himself or his office, otherwise price revisions are announced by the ministry of finance.
 
 

The petroleum division also said a draft proposal to levy 3-5pc sales tax on petrol and HSD was developed in consultation with the oil industry, finance ministry and Federal Board of Revenue which could “not be implemented due to non-agreement with IMF to allow these products be taxed at reduced rates of GST”.
On the other hand, the petrol and diesel price increase due to standard rate of 18pc GST would be around Rs45 per litre, which was not desirable. Any amendment to the sales tax rate will require consultation with IMF and parliament’s approval.
Supply chain
Besides the sales tax issue, OMCs and dealers have requested for enhancement of their margins on petrol and HSD. Ogra has recommended an increase of OMCs and petroleum dealers’ margin by Rs1.13 and Rs1.40/litre, respectively, to ensure sustainability of the supply chain.
However, with partial amendment the summary proposed Rs1.13 per litre additional benefit to OMCs and Rs1.12 per litre to dealers. It said that since petroleum products were exempted from sales tax during current financial year, the refineries and OMCs’ unadjusted sales tax during July 2024-June 2025 on these products may be compensated through IFEM (estimated at Rs34bn).
“For FY2025-26, 3-5pc sales tax on these products may be imposed through Finance Act. However, in case the products remain exempted from sales tax in the FY 2025-26, the unadjusted sales tax may continue to be compensated through IFEM as a fallback option to keep the oil supply chain sustainable,” the petroleum division insisted.

HRW said that “scores of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia die in gruesome yet avoidable workplace-related accidents, including falling from buildings, electrocution, and even decapitation”.
The NGO, which has studied nearly 50 cases of deaths in Saudi Arabia, said Saudi authorities had  “failed to adequately protect workers from preventable deaths, investigate workplace safety incidents, and ensure timely and adequate compensation for families” including through life insurance policies and benefits to survivors.
“The risks of occupational deaths and injuries are further increasing as the Saudi government ramps up construction work for the 2034 World Cup as well as other ‘giga-projects’,” HRW added.
 
 

The Gulf kingdom was handed the right to host the 2034 World Cup at a FIFA Congress last December despite concerns about its human rights record, the risks to migrant labourers and criminalisation of same-sex relationships. It was the only candidate.
The NGO called on FIFA to ensure all work-related deaths in Saudi Arabia are properly investigated and that bereaved families receive compensation.
FIFA has committed to establishing a workers’ welfare system, which it says includes  “dedicated mandatory standards and enforcement mechanisms applicable to all companies and workers involved in… World Cup-related construction and service delivery” in Saudi Arabia.
But HRW said football’s world governing body did not provide  “details on concrete measures to prevent, investigate, and compensate migrant worker deaths such as risk-based heat protection measures or life insurance”.
The NGO claimed  “FIFA is knowingly risking yet another tournament that will unnecessarily come at a grave human cost”, referencing the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
Similar concerns over workers’ welfare dogged Qatar ahead of its hosting of international football’s showpiece tournament.
Amnesty International and other rights groups claimed thousands of migrant workers died in the lead-up to the 2022 tournament, though Doha has said only 37 workers on World Cup projects perished — and only three in work-related accidents.
HRW stated in its report that the majority of migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia are attributed to  “natural causes” and are therefore neither investigated nor compensated.
According to figures provided by the NGO, for example, 74 percent of 1,420 Indian migrant worker deaths recorded at the Indian embassy in Riyadh in 2023 were attributed to natural causes.
HRW added  “even work-related death cases categorised as such in a migrant worker’s death certificate are sometimes not compensated as they should be according to Saudi law and international labour standards”.
“In migrant death cases that are compensated, the process is long and burdensome,” the report said, providing an example of one such compensation process that took a decade to be completed.
“My sons are 11 and 13 years old. When my husband died, they were 11 months and two years old. If we had received compensation right after his death, it would have provided so much relief,” the wife of a deceased worker, who was not named, told HRW.
In response to the report, FIFA shared with AFP a letter it sent last month to HRW from its secretary general Mattias Grafstrom.
The letter says Saudi Arabia has  “in the past years been investing heavily in the development of its society and economy”, using international companies.
Grafstrom notes that Saudi Arabia  “has taken significant steps to reform its labour laws since 2018”, including the abolition of parts of the kafala system which ties workers to their employers, and introducing standardised contracts for workers.
The Saudi government, he says, has also committed to working with the United Nations’ International Labour Organization (ILO)  “on the further expansion and effective implementation of these reforms”.
“In line with its human rights commitments, FIFA seeks to play its part in ensuring strong protections for workers employed by third parties in the construction of FIFA World Cup sites,” Grafstrom adds.
AFP has also contacted the Saudi government for comment.

This information was placed before the National Assembly by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday in a written reply to a question asked by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Sehar Kamran.
The official data provided by the minister shows that a total of 5,402 Pakistanis have been deported from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Malaysia, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since January 2024. As many as 4,850 Pakistani nationals faced deportation from these countries in the year 2024 whereas 552 have returned to Pakistan this year.
The questioner has sought data of the last three years, but the minister provided details of the period starting from January 2024.

Another 369 individuals caught begging in five other countries; nearly 52pc deportees belong to Sindh; Pakistan has expelled over one million illegal Afghans

 
 

Interestingly, the province-wise break-up of the data shows that most of those deported from these countries belong to Sindh province. A total of 2,795 people from the province are among those deported from these countries on begging charges whereas the number of such people belonging to Punjab stands at 1,437.
According to statistics, as many as 1,002 people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 125 from Balochistan, 33 from Azad Kashmir and 10 from Islamabad are among those deported from the six countries.
After Saudi Arabia, the highest number of 247 Pakistanis has been repatriated from Iraq. The UAE, which raised the issue with the Pakistan government more vigorously and imposed strict restrictions on visas for the Pakistani nationals, has so far deported 58 such individuals during this period.
Afghan Refugees
In response to another question asked by Anjum Aqeel Khan of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), the interior minister informed the National Assembly that over one million “illegal Afghans”, including those possessing Afghan Citizen Card (ACC), had been repatriated since November 2023 under the Illegal Foreigner’s Repatriation Plan (IFRP).
“The IFRP has been approved by the federal government. Every sovereign state retains the right to deport illegal foreigners in order to safeguard its borders and national security.
Furthermore, there are no international legal implications for Pakistan, as it is not a signatory to the 1951 UNHCR Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol with respect to Afghan repatriation,“ says the minister in his written reply. He said Pakistan did not intend to extend the duration of ACC holders for further period.
He further said that 1.377 million Afghan refugees, holding POR (Proof of Registration) had been repatriated to Afghanistan through the UNHCR repatriation programme since 2007.
He said there were 813,146 Afghans with ACC and 1.304m POR holders in Pakistan at present.

However, the current PMDC management has distanced itself from the allegations, asserting that any wrongdoing occurred in the past and that new checks and balances have now been introduced.
“It is learnt that there is an organised system of corruption prevalent in PMDC primarily due to excessive discretionary powers and a lack of transparency,” the report stated. “A perception persists that heavy bribe is a norm for recognition of private medical and dental colleges as well as their affiliated teaching hospitals and for their inspections.”
The report further alleged, “Repor­tedly, private medical colleges pay approximately Rs10 million per seat for the allocation of additional student seats. Another avenue for corruption is the recognition of medical journals.”
 
 

The document claimed a probe revealed the “incapacity and inefficiency” of the now-defunct Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) during Bahawalpur Medical College’s (BMC) recognition process and its subsequent withdrawal.
“The recognition of BMC, followed by its abrupt withdrawal, highlights severe lapses in PMC’s regulatory framework. BMC was initially granted recognition based on incomplete documentation and without the mandatory inspection, reportedly in exchange for a bribe,” the report stated.
According to the IB, “Usually, eight-member inspection teams are formed to inspect medical colleges. However, in the case of BMC, only a two-member team was constituted, which actually did not visit the college premises and only signed the pre-drafted inspection report, which led to BMC’s recognition without meeting the required criteria.”
The report added, “Pertinent to mention that multiple investors were initially involved in establishing BMC. However, some of them left after developing differences due to delays in its recognition and operation. Reportedly, one of them filed a complaint against recognition of BMC, which led to the suspension/withdrawal of recognition by PMC.”
“In this regard, overall management of a defunct PMC was responsible for mishandling the issue,” the report alleged. The BMC is no longer functional, as its registration was withdrawn by the federal government last year, and its students were distributed among other medical colleges.

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill granted the permission to the prosecution accepting its written application, which was opposed by the lawyer of the former prime minister.
The judge has ordered completion of the tests within 12 days, saying the prosecution may meet the PTI founding chairman in Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, during that period.
Earlier, the judge heard the concluding arguments of PTI founder’s lawyer, Barrister Salman Safdar, and the prosecution before reserving the verdict.
Barrister Safdar opposed the prosecution request, questioning the police decision to conduct the polygraph and photogrammetric tests 727 days after the May 9 incidents.
The lawyer argued that bail had already been granted to the former prime minister in 21 cases and the statements on the basis of which the police were seeking these tests had already been declared lawful by the Lahore High Court.
He urged the court to dismiss the petition of the prosecution.
Special Prosecutor Rana Aazar stated that the Supreme Court allowed such tests to fulfill investigative requirements. However, he said, the PTI founding chairman refused to undergo these tests in jail without the presence of his lawyer.
He further stated that conducting the voice match test of the accused was a legal requirement.
He asked the court to grant permission to conduct the polygraph, photogrammetric, and voice match tests.
After hearing both sides, the judge reserved his decision on the plea.
In the application, the police sought permission to conduct photogrammetric and polygraph tests of Imran inside Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, where he is currently imprisoned.
The tests are to be carried out in 12 cases, including those pertaining to Jinnah House and Askari Tower attacks.
 
 

Other cases include attacks on Shadman police station and party offices of the PML-N.
MAY 9 TRIALS: The Lahore High Court registrar has issued an amended schedule of the trials of the May 9 cases being conducted at Kot Lakhpat Jail to meet the timeline of four months set by the Supreme Court to conclude these trials.
Last month, a three-judge bench of the SC headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi directed the anti-terrorism courts (ATCs) to conclude May 9 violence trials within four months.
The hearing of May 9 cases would now be heard in jail four days a week — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The jail trials were earlier being held three days a week but have been extended to expedite their disposal.
The ATCs in Lahore are hearing the jail trials of 14 cases including attack on the Jinnah House, which also serves as residence of corps commander.
Several PTI leaders including former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former provincial ministers Dr Yasmin Rashid and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid are facing trials at the Kot Lakhpat jail.

Officials said that the mayor took a serious notice of the growing complaints of people regarding overcharging by private water tanker operators. He also ordered the constitution of a committee to conduct a thorough investigation into the matter.
They said that the three-member committee was directed to investigate and ascertain the identity of the tanker operators and hydrants involved in the unauthorised increase in the rates of water tankers and submit its report within 10 days.
 
 

The water crisis has been making people’s life miserable lately as the city has been receiving nearly half of its routine supply since several main supply lines burst in the past three months, leaving major areas without water supply.

Wahab says any hydrant or tanker found guilty of fleecing citizens will face legal action

The city that requires over 1,200 million gallons of water daily (MGD) gets 400 MGD water or around 40 per cent out of regular supply of 650MGD due to repair work of the ruptured main lines.
Though the water utility always claims that the repair work would be completed in up to 96 hours, but it is never completed in the designated time, piling miseries on people.
 
 

Residents said that the water tanker mafia fleeced people by overcharging whenever there was short supply of water in the city.
A resident of Gulshan-i-Iqbal said that the water tanker operators charged twice of the officially notified rates, taking advantage of the water crisis in the city, leaving people with no option but to pay excessive price for water.
“What will you do when you don’t have any other means to get water for daily use?”, he wondered saying that the people were compelled to pay whatever the price they [tanker operators] demanded.
According to the order issued by the KWSC chief executive officer, the committee will submit detailed information, including the identity of the tanker registration numbers and the names of the drivers involved in the activity.
The order said: “It has come to the attention of the competent authority that tanker operators have unilaterally increased their rates without any prior notice to or approval from the KWSC in clear violation of the terms of their contract. This act is deemed an offence and is entirely unacceptable.”
 
 

It said that a committee to investigate the matter was constituted to investigate the matter and it would submit its final report within 10 working days from the date of issuance of the order.
The sources said that the mayor also instructed the authorities concerned to obtain detailed records and operational data from all tanker operators involved in water distribution.
In a statement, the mayor said that the objective to initiate investigation into overcharging by tanker operators was to ensure transparency and identify those responsible for exploiting citizens.
“The concerns of Karachi’s residents are valid and cannot be ignored. Any operator found guilty of overcharging will face strict legal action,” he added.
The KWSC chairman further said that the city administration would not tolerate any form of exploitation, especially in essential services like water supply. “The inquiry aims to restore public confidence and ensure fair practices in water distribution,” he added.
The mayor reaffirmed his commitment to transparency, public service, and accountability across all sectors of municipal governance.
In another development two days ago, the water utility had replaced the in-charge of Hydrant Services Tanker Operation.
On Wednesday, the chief engineer of the bulk main water supply lines, Zafar Palejo, was also replaced with Superintendent Engineer Syed Muhammad Ijaz.

They said that the body of the 13-year-old Mujeebur Rehman was found inside the seminary in Jameel Colony within the remit of the Gadap City police station.
The corpse was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for a post-mortem examination.
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the body bore multiple marks of injuries. “Findings [of the post-mortem examination] are suggestive of sexual violence,” she said.
DIG-East Usman Ghani told Dawn that the victim boy was a seminary student.

Police arrest madressah teacher after family lodges FIR

Malir SSP Kashif Abbasi said that the police launched an investigation into the incident In a statement, he said that the seminary administration, teachers and students are being questioned about the incident.
 
 

The crime scene unit of the police collected evidence from the spot.
The victim was an orphan, who originally hailed from Pano Aqil.
Later in the evening, the Gadap City police registered an FIR against a seminary teacher on the complaint of a brother of the victim under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 377-B (rape) and 94 (act to which a person is compelled by threats) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The police said that the teacher was formally arrested and he would be produced before a court for remand on Thursday (today).
According to the FIR, the complainant said that his younger brother had been studying at the seminary for the last three years.
The administrator of the seminary phoned him at around 5:30am, asking him to send the location of his house. Despite his insistence, the administrator did not inform him about the reason. At around 6am, the administrator, along with two other persons, came to his house and informed him that his brother died due to a stomach ache.
The complainant said that he and his other relatives met with the teacher, who claimed that he woke up at 3am and took a round of the seminary when he spotted the body of Mujeeb.
He told the family that he brought the body inside the room and found that it bore torture marks and it appeared that he was also subjected to a criminal assault and strangled.
The complainant expressed apprehension over the teacher’s role and nominated him in the FIR.
Suspect killed by firing of accomplice in Quaidabad
A suspected house robber was killed by his own accomplice when he opened indiscriminate  fire that resulted in bullet injuries to a woman passer-by in Sherpao  Colony late on Tuesday night, police said.
Quaidabad SHO Rana  Khushi Mohammed said that two armed men barged into a house for robbery.  They held the family at gunpoint and snatched their cell phones and other valuables.
However, a neighbour raised alarm and when the  robbers came out of the house several residents, who gathered there,  tried to overpower them.
One of the robbers resorted to firing and  fled. However, the bullets hit his accomplice, who died on the spot,  and a passer-by, later identified as Anjum Sardar.
The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.
The  deceased was identified as Nawab Khan. He was declared an absconder by a  court in a robbery case in 2014. He recently returned from Dubai after  spending around 12 years.

The observation came when senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, representing five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges, argued that the real reason behind the transfer of three judges to the IHC was the allegation levelled against intelligence agencies by six IHC judges.
In a joint letter sent to the Supreme Judicial Council on March 25, 2024, the six judges had blamed intelligence agencies for meddling in judicial affairs.
In response to the argument by the senior lawyer, Justice Afghan asked if the allegations were attributed to the intelligence ag­­e­­ncies, why the three high offices were being dragged into the controversy to build a gro­und of malice. He also wondered if the intelligence agencies had demolished the en­­tire appointment procedure when they had no constitutional role in judges’ appointment.

Counsel alleges judges transferred to IHC for ‘extraneous collateral reasons’

Headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, the five-judge constitutional bench was hearing a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
 
 

The counsel said the letter to the SJC triggered a reaction, as a bitter social media campaign against the judges ensued, whereby the degree of a signatory of the letter and the loyalty of another judge were questioned and cameras were allegedly installed in the bedroom of another judge.
He further alleged that this was a conspiracy contrived at the offices of the PM and law ministry to take over the control of IHC and if the president had also applied his mind to this effect, then the entire exercise fell within the category of malice in law.
Since direct proof of malice was always virtually impossible, malice was always drawn by inferences, he said.
At this, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan interjected to make a statement that during his 13-year career as a judge, he was never approached by any intelligence agencies. He also reminded the counsel that soon after the letter by IHC judges, full-court meetings were conducted in all high courts wherein it was resolved that no such interference by intelligence agencies had ever occurred and the problem confined to the IHC only.
Justice Hassan also noted that the allegations of malice against the office of the president and the members of the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan — a body that appoints judges — were very serious in nature.
In response, the counsel cited the example of Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui who was removed as IHC judge and later vindicated by the SJC and also cited interviews of certain government functionaries in the media.
At this, Justice Salahuddin Panwhar questioned if the constitutional bench was bound by the interviews or newspaper clippings.
 
 

The counsel recalled how JCP, while appointing two additional judges in IHC, deliberately left vacant three permanent offices of the judges in the high court. Since the JCP left three seats vacant, the president took it upon himself to fill these seats by invoking Article 200 when the authority to appoint permanent judges rests only with JCP.
According to the counsel, the Constitution does not contemplate filling of vacant seats by invoking Article 200, rather the article should be exercised only for a temporary basis.
Justice Mazhar asked both the counsel and Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan to come up with reasons on the part of the JCP to leave the three offices of the judges vacant while appointing two additional judges.
The counsel said, “A judge on the 16th position in seniority was imported from the Lahore High Court and put in place at the senior-most position in IHC”, adding that after the transfer of the three judges, the administrative and promotion committees of the IHC were also changed.
The transfer of the three judges to the IHC was not in the public interest, but done for extraneous collateral reasons, he alleged.

Trump then flew to Qatar, where he oversaw the signing of a deal for the Gulf Arab country to buy jets from US manufacturer Boeing.
He did not mention a controversial separate offer by Qatar to donate a Boeing jet to serve as the US president’s official airplane. That would be one of the most valuable gifts ever given to the US and it has triggered alarm in Washington over its security and ethics implications.

US president oversees Boeing jets deal during visit to Qatar

After Trump’s declaration that he would lift sanctions on Syria, he met interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who swept to power at the head of a group that Washington has called a terrorist organisation and once pledged allegiance to Al Qaeda.
According to the White House, Trump urged Sharaa to join the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco, which normalised relations with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords in 2020. “I told him, ‘I hope you’re going to join when its straightened out. He said, Yes. But they have a lot of work to do,” Trump said, according to a White House pool report.
Photos posted on Saudi state television showed the two men shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Trump said the meeting with Sharaa, who he described as a young, attractive guy with a very strong past, was  “great”.
 


“He’s got a real shot at holding it together,” said Trump. Trump’s four-day visit highlights the United States’ growing ties to the oil-rich region, where his real-estate company is also developing several projects.
Trump’s Middle East trip — which does not include a visit to Jerusalem — has fuelled doubts in Israel about where the country stands in Washington’s priorities.
Israel opposes lifting sanctions on Syria, which would clear the way for greater engagement by humanitarian organisations and boost foreign investment. But Trump told reporters the fact he has relationships with countries in the Middle East is  “very good for Israel”.

Turkiye and Azerbaijan, popular budget holiday destinations for Indians, issued statements backing Islamabad after India’s air strikes last week. “Bookings for Azerbaijan and Turkiye decreasing by 60 per cent (over the last week) while cancellations have surged by 250pc during the same period,” a spokesperson for MakeMyTrip said.
EaseMyTrip’s Chief Executive Officer, Rikant Pittie, said the platform had seen a 22pc rise in cancellations for Turkiye and 30pc for Azerbaijan “due to recent geopolitical tensions”.
Travellers had switched to Georgia, Serbia, Greece, Thailand and Vietnam, he added. Another ticketing platform, ixigo, earlier said in a post on X that it would be suspending flight and hotel bookings for Turkiye, Azerbaijan and China.
EaseMyTrip’s founder and chairman Nishant Pitti said in a post on X that 287,000 Indians visited Turkiye last year and 243,000 visited Azer­baijan. “When these nations openly support Pakistan, should we fuel their tourism and their economies?” Pitti said.

• Westerly system to hit north on May 19
RAWALPINDI / LAHORE: The country is bracing for its first heatwave of the season, with the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warning that temperatures across much of the country will soar well above seasonal norms from Thursday (today) and persist for three to four days.
According to a PMD advisory, a high-pressure system is likely to grip most parts of the country from May 15 to 20. As a result, daytime temperatures are forecast to remain 4 to 6 degrees Celsius above normal in the southern regions — including Sindh, southern Punjab and Balochistan — throughout the period.
Meanwhile, central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber Pakht­unkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan are likely to experience temperatures 5°C to 7°C above normal from May 15 to 19.
A westerly weather system is also expected to enter the upper parts of the country on the evening or night of May 19. Under its influence, rain, wind and thunderstorms with isolated heavy falls and hailstorms are anticipated in Azad Kashmir, Islamabad, the Pothohar region, northeast Punjab, upper KP and Gilgit-Baltistan on May 19 and 20.
 
 

The PMD has urged the public, especially children, elderly citizens and women, to take precautionary measures during the heatwave, including avoiding direct sun exposure and staying well-hydrated.
Farmers have also been advised to adjust their agricultural activities and take steps to protect livestock. The high temperatures in northern areas may accelerate snowmelt, potentially increasing water flow in rivers. Authorities have been requested to remain alert and take preventive action to avert any emergencies caused by the extreme heat.
Emergency instructions
In Punjab, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has also issued a heatwave alert, instructing commissioners and deputy commissioners across the province to remain vigilant.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed departments including school education, health, transport, local government and Rescue 1122 to initiate precautionary steps. These include the provision of clean drinking water in public areas and first-aid readiness in hospitals and mobile units.
It advised citizens to take care of children, the elderly and outdoor workers, avoid unnecessary travel during peak afternoon hours, wear light-coloured clothing, and cover the head when outdoors.
The PDMA also stressed judicious water use across sectors and urged citizens to stay informed about further updates.
 
 

The National Institute of Health (NIH) had already issued a heatstroke advisory last month, urging both public and private hospitals to prepare for an increase in heat-related illnesses. The advisory noted that climate change and global warming are intensifying the frequency of extreme heat events in Pakistan, leading to a rise in morbidity and mortality.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has highlighted the impact of climate change on human health, including increased frequency and severity of heatwaves. Pakistan has experienced severe heatwaves in recent years, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.
The country’s healthcare system faces challenges in responding to these events, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Heat-related illnesses can have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children and those with pre-existing medical conditions.
The NIH said the objective of its advisory is to sensitise health care authorities to take timely, appropriate actions for preparedness and prevention of heatstroke. Infants, elderly persons, individuals with certain comorbidities, athletes, pregnant females and outdoor workers are at high risk for heatstroke.
 
 

If a person shows signs of possible heatstroke, professional medical treatment should be obtained immediately. The most critical step is lowering the temperature of the patients. The patients should be moved to a shady area, unnecessary clothing should be removed, and cool, tepid water should be applied to the skin while soaking remaining clothes with water.
If the patient can drink liquids, they should be given plenty of cool water or other cool beverages that do not contain alcohol or caffeine. Intravenous fluids should be maintained and the patient should be hospitalised if required.

• GDP growth projected at 3.6pc, inflation at 7.7pc
• Revenue collection forecast to increase by Rs1.4tr
• Fiscal deficit targeted at 5.1pc of GDP
ISLAMABAD: As virtual technical-level discussions on the upcoming federal budget begin, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Pakistan’s total revenue to grow to nearly Rs20 trillion in the next fiscal year, up from the current estimate of less than Rs17.8tr, with an emphasis on tight expenditure controls to ensure sustainable debt servicing.
After three days of technical discussions through video link, formal policy-level negotiations on budget finalisation are set to begin on Monday (May 19) and continue until Friday (May 23). The agreement between the IMF staff mission and the authorities on next year’s budgetary measures and macroeconomic framework would lead to the announcement of the federal budget on June 2.
The IMF has already put on the table its projections for major economic indicators, including fiscal and monetary policies, envisaging an economic growth rate of 3.6 per cent and average inflation of 7.7pc. This means the inflation rate would be significantly higher than the current year’s average of 5.1pc. The combination of economic growth and inflation is expected to jack up revenue collection by more than Rs1.4tr from the current year’s estimated collection of about Rs12.4tr.
 
 

However, besides the FBR’s revenue collection, a major push for expansion in revenue base is being envisaged to come from provincial governments and agriculture income tax would be a key area for additional efforts.
Overall revenues for the next year are targeted to cross Rs19.9tr or 15.2pc of GDP compared to Rs17.8bn of budget estimates for the current year or 15.9pc of GDP.
The Fund expects Pakistani authorities to continue to focus on expenditure control, trimming it from 21.6pc of GDP in the current year to Rs20.3pc next year.
But even then the expenditures would get close to Rs26.57tr next year compared to budget estimates of about Rs18.9tr. The two sides have yet to work out the final numbers on revenue collection and revised expenditures, particularly those that have arisen recently due to the security situation.
The IMF expects Pakistan to reduce its fiscal deficit from 5.6pc of GDP during the current year to 5.1pc next year, or about Rs6.67tr. The government is also being asked to maintain a primary surplus — revenues minus non-interest expenditures — of around Rs2.1tr, a key condition for improving debt sustainability. Achieving this target is anticipated to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from the current 77.6pc to 75.6pc in FY26.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Finance has asked all the ministries and divisions to submit an additional pro forma (Form-III-C) to capture the climate-related component of subsidies to enhance and expand reporting on climate considerations in all allocations of the annual budget.
 
 

“Climate tagging of subsidies is one of the requirements under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreed with IMF,” read a circular issued to all government entities and ministries.
The federal budget is required to map climate relevance in three categories of adaptation, mitigation, and transition.
The public expenditure under the running of civil government and public sector development programme is being tagged and the process is now being extended to other expenditures like grants and subsidies to identify the overall climate-related public expenditure.

• Shares with UN chief concerns about inflammatory remarks by Delhi
• Pakistan returns Indian border guard
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday invited India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The prime minister floated this offer during his visit to the frontline area of Pasrur Cantonment in Sialkot, where he lauded the armed forces for giving an exemplary response to India under the ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ conducted in response to Indian strikes inside Pakistan following the Pahalgam incident. Pakistan had struck 26 Indian military facilities, including its airbases, using jets and missiles.
He said Pakistan’s response to the Indian attack on May 6-7 caused huge losses to the neighbouring country, in which the Pakistan Air Force downed multiple Indian Rafale aircraft. In reference to the Pakistani strikes on 26 military targets, the PM said Pakistan had “avenged” the 1971 war.
 


“You have taken revenge for the 1971 war…and now the whole nation is standing with you,” PM Shehbaz told troops during his address. He warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi against future aggression.
“If you again attack us, you will lose everything…,” the PM said in a warning to his Indian counterpart. “We are ready for war and dialogue. Now the choice is yours,” he said.
With reference to PM Modi’s recent address to the nation, PM Shehbaz said: “Do not dictate us. Water is our red line; don’t even think about diverting our water. Yes, water and blood do not flow together. You have also hit our Neelum-Jhelum water project. If the damage was severe, we could have destroyed your major dams, including Baglihar Dam.”
PM Shehbaz again asked PM Modi to shun differences and sit for a dialogue. “Let us extinguish this fire. Let us sit together to talk on Kashmir and water,” he added.
 
 

After the Pahalgam attack, India put the water treaty with Pakistan in abeyance, prompting a strong response from Pakistan. In an interview with an Indian media outlet last week, World Bank President Ajay Banga said there was no suspension clause in the Indus Waters Treaty.
“There is no provision in the treaty to allow for suspension the way it was drawn up. It either needs to be gone, or replaced by another one, and that requires the two countries to want to agree,” he said. He also said that the bank played no decision-making role and acted solely as a facilitator.
PM Shehbaz said the blatant aggression against innocent civilians resulting in the martyrdom of children, women and the elderly and calling them terrorists was utterly shameful and against all international laws, norms and morality.
According to the PM, despite Pakistan’s offer for a neutral probe, India deliberately evaded this path, as it had nothing to prove, and India launched the offensive based on a false pretext and bloated arrogance and ego, “for which it has got a very befitting response”.
 






During the visit, the prime minister received a comprehensive briefing on the conduct of the battle and the current operational preparedness of the troops. He met the officers and soldiers actively participating in the military operation, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said.
In a show of continued support for all branches of the military, the prime minister is scheduled to visit various air bases and naval bases in coming days to meet troops of the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy.
The PM noted that Pakistan had agreed to the ceasefire understanding in the larger interest of peace in the region. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong resolve to promote peace in South Asia, while defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.
Concerns shared with UN chief
In his afternoon telephone call with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the premier expressed his deep appreciation for the UN secretary general’s leadership and diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation in South Asia.
He stated that the UN chief’s continued engagement and preventive diplomacy demonstrated his enduring commitment to the protection of the UN Charter’s principles and purposes, as well as to fostering peace in South Asia.
This was the third phone call between the two leaders in the last two weeks.
 






He also expressed concern over the continued provocative and inflammatory remarks made by the Indian leadership, which were a threat to the fragile regional peace. He emphasised that the just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, was imperative to ensuring durable peace in South Asia.
The UN secretary general welcomed the ceasefire, while expressing condolences over the loss of civilian lives. He expressed his commitment to continued engagement with both sides to advance regional peace and stability.
Speaks to UAE president
PM Shehbaz held a telephone conversation with Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates.
According to a statement, the PM conveyed profound gratitude for the UAE’s diplomatic efforts and constructive role during the recent crisis. He added that the UAE had stood by Pakistan through thick and thin.
 






PM Shehbaz also met Khazar Farhadov, Ambassador of Azerbaijan to Pakistan, in Islamabad and expressed profound gratitude to President Ilham Aliyev for the unwavering solidarity and support during the recent tensions with India.
 






Indian guard repatriated
Pakistan returned a captured border guard to India on Wednesday, reported AFP. The guard was captured a day after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, which killed 26 people and sparked tit-for-tat missile, drone and fighter jet attacks.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but India blamed Pakistan. Islamabad rejects the accusations and has called for an independent probe.
“Purnam Kumar Shaw, who had been in the custody of Pakistan Rangers since April 23, was handed over to India,” India’s Border Security Force said in a statement.
