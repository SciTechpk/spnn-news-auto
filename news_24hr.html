Visuals aired on DawnNewsTV showed policemen armed with batons attacking journalists on the press club premises. Visuals shared on social media also showed police dragging journalists out of what appeared to be the cafeteria.

Another video shared by a Dawn.com correspondent showed a journalist holding his broken Nikon camera and his shirt ripped across the back.
A statement issued by Naqvi stated that he had taken notice of the “unfortunate” incident and demanded a report from the Islamabad inspector general of police.
“Violence against the journalist community cannot be tolerated under any circumstances,” he was quoted as saying. “Disciplinary action must be taken against officials involved in the incident,” he said.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) President Afzal Butt held a press conference alongside Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry at the National Press Club.
He said that during the police raid, when the press club’s office-bearers tried to intervene and resolve the matter, they were “beaten and tortured”.
“They even arrested two people, who were later released,” Butt added.
He added that multiple people at the scene pointed out that they had to get the police to release them. “Today’s incident is a matter of now or never for us,” Butt said.
He announced that the PFUJ had called an “emergency session”, where “we will consult and chalk out our demands about what the government needs to do to prevent what the police did today.
“We will also decide our course of action and announce it after the meeting.”
Butt said, “We always avoid confrontation with political parties. Our friends were very angry … but I controlled them … Something like this has never happened before.
“That you enter a photographer’s house — the press club is their second home […] that you enter his home without permission, beat him and break his camera and mobile phone. This has never happened before.”
 


Butt alleged that even the members of the press club’s management and its office-bearers were “beaten”.
“This is not only the Islamabad press club’s issue. Press clubs across Pakistan are of the view that if they turn a blind eye to this worst of the worst incident, similar incidents could happen in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar and Quetta.
“That is why we will first consult our friends here and then across Pakistan. We will then decide our plan of action and put forward our demands.”
For his part, Chaudhry said he condemned the incident and apologised for it. “Please consider this when you hold your meeting,” he said, assuring that he was also ready to meet them again after their meeting.
Chaudhry’s office also issued a statement unconditionally apologising for the incident, adding that it happened “suddenly”.
“Some people from the [JAAC] were protesting [and] some of their people had manhandled police personnel,” the statement read. “When they tried to arrest these people, the police chased them. The police came to the Press Club to arrest the protesters who misbehaved with [officers].”
The statement added that Chaudhry had ordered an internal inquiry into the incident.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar called the incident “regrettable” in a statement, vowing that a comprehensive investigation would be carried out.
“Interior Minister Naqvi did not order police to enter the press club,” he was quoted as saying. “The National Press Club is my home and I stand with it,” he said.
Journalist bodies held another press conference at the NPC later, where Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists President Tariq Virk said journalists across the country stood united after the police raid at NPC.
He alleged that “Islamabad police personnel had not come to the press club on their own accord but were sent here”.
“They inflicted violence on journalists inside the press club. They even tortured and arrested an ailing employee of the club,” he alleged, vowing to “adopt such a plan of action” that nobody would resort to this “rogue behaviour” in future.
PFUJ President Butt said today was one of the “darkest days in Pakistan’s history”.
“The attack on the National Press Club was an attack on media freedom,” he said, adding that members of journalist bodies had participated in the meeting held after the police raid. “We will prepare a strategy after consulting all journalist bodies.”
Butt further stated that journalists in other cities had also protested the raid at NPC and that “if the National Press Club was not safe from police, then no other press club was”. Butt reiterated his allegation that cameras and mobile phones were snatched and broken during the incident.
He announced that a “black day” would be observed across the country tomorrow, and black flags would be hoisted at the press clubs all across Pakistan.
“The journalists are very angry at the moment. It has been suggested that we get first information reports registered in which some bigwigs are nominated,” he said.
Journalist’s account of raid
Journalist Shiraz Gardezi, who is associated with Geo News and also the senior joint secretary of the NPC, shared an account of the raid with Dawn.com.
Gardezi said the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) — which has also been holding demonstrations in Azad Kashmir — had issued a call for a protest at the press club. “As soon as the demonstration began, they (police) surrounded the protesters,” he narrated.
Gardezi, who was at the NPC to cover the protest, said police stopped them from doing so. “Because they were torturing, beating and dragging people,” he alleged, adding that they even tried to snatch mobile phones and cameras from some of the journalists.
According to him, they even dragged and tried to take away some of the journalists with them, but they were let go after some other journalists intervened.
“We then asked the journalists to stay on the back foot and keep themselves safe,” he said.
Later, he continued, “We heard loud bangs while sitting inside the press club. They (police) kicked the doors open and stormed inside”.
Shirazi narrated that the police broke various things in the cafeteria and “beat and tortured” people. This time, too, the police tried to take away some journalists, but they were “rescued”.
Police raid termed ‘terrorism’
In a joint statement, the PFUJ, Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors and Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors termed the police raid at the NPC “terrorism”.
They also demanded immediate action against those “involved in the incident”.
The statement said journalist organisations saw this incident as a continuation of a series of actions ongoing against journalists.
It highlighted that for the past few days, advertisements were being run under the title of ‘Have you ever thought what the state of war is?’ They alleged that “government” was behind these advertisements. “Threatening tone is used in these advertisements, and reporters, freelancers and social organisations related to the media are listed as anti-state. Its objective is to tarnish the character of journalists, pressurise them and curb the freedom of expression.”
The journalists’ bodies demanded that the publication of these advertisements should immediately stop.
They also expressed the view that the “excessive use” of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act had proved the concerns of multiple journalists to be true. “The act is being used to employ all tactics for suppressing government critics and curbing the freedom of expression,” they alleged.
The Lahore Press Club also issued a condemnatory statement, demanding from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that police personnel involved in the raid be immediately suspended and arrested. The statement said strict legal action should be taken against them, otherwise journalists across Pakistan would stage protests.
‘Shameful and condemnable’
The incident also sparked outrage on social media as journalists decried the assault. In a post on X, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) condemned the “assault on journalists by Islamabad police” at the National Press Club.
“HRCP strongly condemns the raid on the National Press Club and [the] assault on journalists by the Islamabad police,” the rights group wrote in a post on X. “We demand an immediate inquiry and those responsible brought to book.”
 






Journalist Hamid Mir stated that police were trying to arrest members of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) and that they had “targeted journalists present in the cafeteria”.
 






“This is totally uncalled for and condemnable,” said journalist Syed Talat Hussain.
“As if there aren’t enough fronts open. To treat the National Press Club as a criminal hideout and then use violence on its premises is madness without any method,” he said.
 






Journalist Matiullah Jan condemned the incident in a post on X, calling it “extremely shameful and condemnable”.
“This incident is [a product] of the incompetence and cowardice of the club administration,” Jan wrote. “The press club is the home of journalists, where it is disgraceful for the police to barge into the cafeteria with batons and attack people,” he said.
 






Journalist Anas Mallick, who works with TV channel Asia One, alleged that police had raided the club to arrest Kashmiri journalists covering a “call to protest” by the JAAC, adding that the police were “acting like thugs”.
 






Journalist Zebunnisa Burki called visuals emerging from the raid “insane” and added that journalists were being attacked by police inside the press club itself.
 






PTI MNA from Malakand, Junaid Akbar, also condemned the raid.
“Islamabad police storming the National Press Club and their violence against Kashmiri protesters and journalists is shameful and condemnable. An attack on the press club is an attack on the freedom of expression,” he said in a post on X.
 






Veteran journalist Mazhar Abbas said the police action at the NPC reminded him of the days of military dictators Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf.
“This act, rather an attack, on the Press Club, baton-charge and arrest, including some employees of the club, is simply unacceptable,” he wrote on X.
 






Human rights defender Tahira Abdullah called the incident “shocking,” stressing that a mere verbal apology from federal government representatives was unacceptable, especially when paired with the routine promises of an “inquiry.”
She demanded concrete measures, including the arrest and prosecution of all police personnel involved, along with their superiors who ordered the action; a written apology from the federal interior minister with a guarantee that such violations of press clubs and journalists would never be repeated; and compensation to cover the replacement of damaged cameras, equipment, and furnishings at the NPC.
Prominent human rights lawyer Muhammad Jibran Nasir said that the “government apologised because it was journalists in general who got assaulted in the presence of cameras”.
 






“But they came hunting for activists supporting the protest in AJK. Imagine the barbarity inflicted upon them in the clashes in the past four days. You being a citizen does not matter. You being essential to the State’s cause matters. The State has never apologised for abducting, assaulting and arresting journalists who oppose State policies,” he wrote on X.

Here’s what analysts have to say</strong></a><br><p>American multinational corporation Procter & Gamble said on Thursday that it would wind down its manufacturing and commercial activities in Pakistan and rely on third-party distributors to continue to serve customers as part of a restructuring programme.
The news comes as various multinational corporations (MNCs) have pulled their operations in Pakistan over the past three years, including Eli Lilly, Shell, Microsoft, Uber and Yamaha.
Does this point to a greater trend suggesting that the economic climate in Pakistan is inhospitable for multinationals or are there other reasons? Here’s what analysts have to say:
‘Companies have own reasons for exiting’
Business and economy journalist Khurram Hussain said that companies have “their own reasons” for exiting. “It is not really about Pakistan, but restructuring at their end,” he said.
“Take Shell as an example. They have exited the retail fuel business in Mexico and Indonesia as well as Pakistan, and retail energy more broadly in many other markets,” he said.
“They’re trying to refocus in higher margin areas like liquefied natural gas etc […] their exit from Pakistan was part of this global restructuring,” he said.
‘Exit does not always result in withdrawal of products’
Speaking to Dawn.com, Pakistan Business Council (PBC) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ehsan Malik highlighted several factors leading to the exit of MNCs, stating that it varied from sector to sector.
He said that MNCs in the pharmaceutical sector leave due to delays in price change approvals and poor promotional ethics of some local companies, while companies like Shell and P&G responded to the “global change of focus on categories and geographies”. Others leave due to weak enforcement of intellectual property rights, he added.
He further noted, “Growing competition from local companies, a large informal sector and shrinking margins dilute the group performance, which together with high taxes and a weaker Rupee are factors that also contribute to an exit.”
 
 

Companies often cite “security conditions”, he said, adding that with fewer expatriates, local managements have learnt to cope with the conditions.
“It is important to note that an exit does not always result in the withdrawal of products and brands,” he stated.
“A distributor model can maintain their presence and MNCs can rely on third-party market research and advertising agencies to promote their brands.”
‘Companies relocating as part of strategic shift’
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said, “Many companies are relocating as part of a strategic shift toward operating from regional hubs instead of maintaining manufacturing facilities in every country, enabling them to leverage economies of scale.”
He highlighted “growing efficiencies among local distribution players”, with a more skilled workforce and adoption of advanced technologies, which have facilitated “seamless product distribution” without having a physical presence.</p><small>2025-10-02 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/022320558650ec9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946149/sc-cannot-rewrite-constitution-says-constitutional-bench-in-detailed-order-on-reserved-seats-case' target='_blank'><strong>SC cannot ‘rewrite Constitution’, says Constitutional Bench in detailed order on reserved seats case</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench (CB) on Thursday ruled that the eight-judge  majority judgment announced on July 12, 2024, was not justified in granting relief to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) by invoking Article 187 of the Constitution that empowers the court to do complete justice when no issue regarding the grant of reserved seats to the party was pending before it.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the CB through a short order on June 26 had overturned the July 12, 2024, majority judgment by declaring the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and the provincial assemblies.
In its detailed verdict issued on Thursday, 10 judges of the 12-judge CB held that there was no justification in giving relief to the PTI under Article 187, especially when appeals were filed and pursued by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) under Article 185 (3) of the Constitution.
The facts and circumstances of this case did not require application of Article 187, the detailed judgment said, adding that the exercise of authority purportedly under Article 187 to grant relief to a party that was not before the court, to remove from office MNAs and MPAs who had been declared elected and who were not before the court, and to issue declarations and directives that were outside the scope of the statutory or constitutional authority of this court, was not warranted.
The July 12 judgment, being in excess of the jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court and being contrary to the statutory and constitutional provisions, suffers from errors apparent on the face of the record which float on the surface, the CB observed in its detailed verdict, adding that it therefore had to be set aside.
Apex court must stay within its limits
The apex court, the Constitutional Bench explained, enjoys the jurisdiction to interpret the statutes and the Constitution and its authority remains absolute insofar it remains within limits.
It cannot be called into question by any other department of government or even by another constitutional institution, be it the legislature or the executive, it said, while stressing that the authority to interpret the law and the Constitution does not confer the authority to the top court to rewrite the Constitution or the law.
The CB emphasised that the will of the legislature and the Constitution-makers has to be respected and given effect to. It cannot be negated or usurped by the judiciary by scribing artificial meanings to the clear language of the Constitution or by derogating from the plain meaning of its words.
Any court or judge, including the Supreme Court judges, has no jurisdiction to read their personal likes and dislikes into the Constitution or to ignore or circumvent its commands, the detailed judgement said. The power to interpret is a very wide and formidable power indeed but that power is negated, not enhanced, when the court proceeds, under its guise, to rewrite the Constitution, the CB ruled.
Explaining its stance further, the CB said the July 12 judgment ignored the rights of the returned candidates who were elected on reserved seats in the National Assembly and later took oath. Thus, they enjoy a number of protections as returned candidates under the Constitution and the Elections Act, 2017, but were disregarded, the CB regretted.
These rights ensure that their election could not have been declared void, except through an election petition. Moreover, the review petitioners and several other returned candidates on reserved seats were not a party to the proceedings before the apex court; besides, no one had challenged the election of the petitioners before the court.
The premise for this exercise of authority without any constitutional mooring was that election disputes are not between candidates but are matters that concern the constituency and the nation, the CB explained, adding this was clearly contrary to the explicit language of Article 225 of the Constitution.
It had been observed in the July 12 judgment, the CB observed, that an election case could not be equated to “an ordinary civil case” and “the proceedings therein are inquisitorial in nature.”
The proceedings before the court were two civil appeals under Article 185 of the Constitution, the CB stated in the detailed order. These were adversarial proceedings and were being litigated between parties. No Supreme Court judgment supported the proposition and none was cited in support of the novel proposition that election disputes were inquisitorial not adversarial and were adjudicated and decided as civil disputes, the CB observed.
The CB also held that the order of quashing the notification of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of May 13, 2024, and undoing the election of the notified persons cannot be sustained in law and under the Constitution and is accordingly set aside.
The dissenting note
Meanwhile, Justice Ayesha A Malik and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, who had earlier dismissed the review petitions in liminie, in a six-page note expressed reservations to the constitution of the CB hearing the review petitions.
Originally, the review petition was heard by a 13-judge bench, of which five judges including Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, were available yet they were not included in the bench.
This exclusion is based on Article 191A of the Constitution inserted through the 26th Amendment, which requires the formation of CBs, the note said, adding that the excluded judges were not nominated for CB by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
The note stressed that the JCP, which was established under the Constitution must uphold and safeguard the basic principles and values of the Constitution which include the independence of the judiciary.
The JCP functions within a constitutional scheme predicated upon the rule of law, separation of powers and supremacy of the Constitution, the note said, adding that it was incumbent upon members of the JCP to discharge their functions with integrity and in a manner that exemplifies constitutional propriety ensuring that the independence and integrity of the judiciary is always protected and maintained.
A corresponding constitutional duty is also placed on three-judge committee formed under Article 191A that fixes cases before the CB. When the Constitution of the bench give rise to doubts about fairness, the legitimacy of the entire process is called into question, the note said.</p><small>2025-10-02 18:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0214275745128e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946085/pampg-says-it-is-winding-down-operations-in-pakistan-will-rely-on-third-party-distributors' target='_blank'><strong>P&G says it is winding down operations in Pakistan, will rely on ‘third-party distributors’</strong></a><br><p>American multinational corporation Procter & Gamble said on Thursday that the company would wind down its manufacturing and commercial activities in Pakistan and rely on third-party distributors to continue to serve customers in the country as part of the consumer product group’s global restructuring programme.
“We will continue to operate the business in the ordinary course until the process is complete, which may take several months,” said a statement by P&G.
“Supporting this company decision, P&G Pakistan and the supporting regional teams will begin transition planning immediately, with a focus first on P&G people,” it added.
 
 

According to the statement, employees whose roles are impacted by this decision will be “considered for opportunities in other P&G operations outside Pakistan or will be offered separation packages” in accordance with local laws, company policies, and P&G’s values and principles.
In Pakistan, a number of brands are under the P&G umbrella, including Pampers, Ariel, Always, Safeguard, Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Olay, and Vicks.
Meanwhile, Gillette Pakistan, a subsidiary of P&G, said it would evaluate a potential delisting following a decision by its parent to discontinue its business in Pakistan.
It plans to convene a board meeting shortly to evaluate the actions required for this business discontinuation, including the potential delisting from the Pakistan Stock Exchange, the company said in a filing.
Reacting to the news, former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants Pakistan (ICAP) Asad Ali Shah termed P&G’s exit as “another red flag for investment climate”.
“Procter & Gamble’s decision to leave Pakistan underscores a deeper truth: doing business here has become increasingly unviable — not just for multinationals, but for investors of all kinds,” he posted on X.
“When global giants pack up, it signals that our policy unpredictability, currency risks, and regulatory chaos have outweighed market potential,” he said, adding that this was not about one company but about the growing perception that “Pakistan punishes investment instead of protecting it”.

In 2015, the Economic Coordination Council (ECC) banned the export of donkey hides in the country in view of the sale of donkey meat under the guise of beef and mutton in different cities.
According to the commerce ministry notification, the export of donkey hides shall be allowed only to those “firms [and] companies manufacturing in designated, approved [or] registered donkey slaughterhouses located in [the] Gwadar Free Zone only”.
The notification also stated that the ban on exporting donkey hides would be “omitted” from the Export Policy Order.
Last July, the Senate Standing Committee on Commerce was informed that protocols to export donkey skins and meat to China had been finalised, along with the export of onions, potatoes and chillies.
However, in August this year, a consultative workshop on the role of working equines in supporting livelihoods and addressing emerging threats to donkeys, horses and mules found that of the 55.5 million donkeys in the world, 6 million are killed annually across the globe.
Besides recognising the role of working equines in sustaining the livelihoods of poor and marginalised communities, the workshop also aimed to raise awareness of the ongoing welfare challenges and the emerging threat of the donkey skin trade in Pakistan.</p><small>2025-10-02 18:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/021959408c17ed3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946140/four-policemen-among-nine-injured-in-peshawar-blast-official' target='_blank'><strong>Four policemen among nine injured in Peshawar blast: official</strong></a><br><p>At least nine people, including four law enforcement personnel, were injured in a blast near Peshawar’s Bani Mara area on Thursday, police said.
Statements issued by Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed’s  office confirmed these details.
He separately told Dawn.com that police were targeted in the incident. “Initial investigation shows that the device that caused the blast was planted on the route of a police mobile,” he added.
The CCPO added that the condition of one of the injured was serious. Rescue services shifted the injured to a nearby medical facility after the attack.
He said police were investigation whether the the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device or not.
Following the blast, a large contingent of security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area.
Separately, the city’s Senior Superintendent of Police Operation Masood Bangash told Dawn.com that law enforcers were investigating the incident and evidence from the site of the blast was being collected.
The blast comes less than two months after two people were killed and 20 others, including policemen, were injured in a bomb blast targeting a police vehicle in the Wana tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lower South Waziristan district.
In another incident in Balochistan in July, three cops were injured in an attack on a highway police vehicle in Balochistan’s Nasirabad District.
Reports on terrorism
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Two reports, issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) yesterday, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.
According to PICSS, militant violence dropped significantly in Sept 2025, with both the number of attacks and militant capacity showing sharp declines compared to the record levels seen in Aug. The PICSS Militancy Database recorded 69 militant attacks in Sept — a 52 per cent reduction from August’s 143. These attacks resulted in 135 deaths and 173 injuries, whilst militants abducted at least 27 people.
The fatalities included 61 security personnel, 20 militants, and 54 civilians. Amongst the injured were 74 security personnel and 99 civilians. Compared with August, the number of martyred security personnel declined by 16pc, militant fatalities by 66pc, and civilian deaths by 17pc, reflecting a notable decrease in lethality.
KP remained the most affected province, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.
According to CRSS’s report, Pakistan witnessed an over 46pc surge in overall violence in its security landscape for the third quarter of 2025, with at least 901 fatalities and 599 injuries — amongst civilians, security personnel, and outlaws — resulting from 329 incidents of violence.</p><small>2025-10-02 17:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02142812ccc9cdf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946116/indias-siraj-bumrah-strike-as-west-indies-dismissed-for-162-in-ahmedabad-test' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Siraj, Bumrah strike as West Indies dismissed for 162 in Ahmedabad Test</strong></a><br><p>Red-hot Mohammed Siraj returned figures of 4-40 as India dismissed the West Indies for 162 and then turned the screw with the bat on day one of the first Test on Thursday.
The hosts were 121-2 at stumps with KL Rahul unbeaten on 53 in front of a sparse crowd at the world’s biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.
Rahul reached his 20th Test fifty and stood firm along with skipper Shubman Gill, on 18, at close of play.
A depleted West Indies won the toss but the Indian attack struck regular blows to bowl out the visitors in 44.1 overs in the second session.
 






Siraj drew first blood with the wicket of Tagenarine Chanderpaul for a duck and extended his tally of Test wickets to 27 this year, having played a key role in India’s 2-2 draw in England.
“The England series gave me a lot of confidence,” Siraj said. “It was a competitive cricket series in England against a strong side, so to perform there gives you added confidence.”
On the comparatively inexperienced West Indies batting line-up, Siraj said: “I had to work hard for my wickets just like I did in England. I was denied a five-wicket haul,” he said with a chuckle.
After an initial first spell of 3-19 in seven overs, Siraj returned in the second session to get one more wicket and was ably supported by fellow quick Jasprit Bumrah.
Number seven Justin Greaves top-scored for the West Indies with 32 before being bowled by Bumrah, who took three wickets.
Skipper Roston Chase (24) and Shai Hope attempted to revive the innings after the West Indies slipped to 42-4 in the first hour of play.
‘We have to improve’
Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav bowled Hope for 26 to end the 48-run fifth-wicket stand at the stroke of lunch. He got his second to send back Jomel Warrican for eight and wrap up the innings. Early tea was called.
“Obviously, we have to improve,” vice-captain Warrican said of his team’s batting. “We, as a batting unit, have to come together to score more runs on the board.”
 






West Indies were swept 3-0 at home by Australia this year and were bowled out for 27 in the third match, the second-lowest score in Test history.
They have been forced into late changes after injuries to pace bowlers Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, and are a pale shadow of the team that once dominated cricket.
India are strongly tipped to sweep the two-match series.
The Indian openers started the reply cautiously before Rahul and the left-handed Yashasvi Jaiswal got going in a session interrupted by a brief spell of rain.
West Indies pace spearhead Jayden Seales had Jaiswal caught behind for 36 and Chase trapped Sai Sudharsan lbw for seven with his off-spin.</p><small>2025-10-02 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02200910e66d5bf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946141/in-letter-to-commonwealth-lawyers-activists-express-concern-over-delayed-election-report' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to Commonwealth, lawyers, activists express concern over delayed election report</strong></a><br><p>A letter signed by 130 activists, lawyers, and journalists was submitted to the Commonwealth Secretariat on Thursday, expressing concern over the release of a Commonwealth Observer Group’s (COG) report on the 2024 General Elections after a 19-month delay.
The COG report, released earlier this week, cited “restrictions that curtailed fundamental political rights and hindered one party’s ability to contest fairly”. It also flagged the election-night suspension of cellular services, which undermined transparency and delayed results.
The letter, which has been shared by some of the signatories on social media, expressed grave concern over the “extraordinary” delay in the report’s publication, noting that election reports are published routinely without any delay.
 






“We are not aware that any other COG report has been published 10 months after transmittal of the final report to the Secretariat by the relevant observer group,” the letter read.
The letter noted that in 2013, the general election report was published on June 19 — only 39 days after polling — while in 2018, the report was published within the same year.
“More recent reports for other countries were all published earlier, despite Pakistan’s election having taken place prior,” the letter added. “These include Sri Lanka (published December 2024), Ghana (published March 2025), and Trinidad and Tobago (published July 2025).
“We note that the official report has only now been published by the Commonwealth Secretariat on September 30, following the publication of a leaked copy of the report by an independent news platform, Dropsite News on September 13.”
The reports were both submitted to the secretariat on November 20, 2024, and were signed by all fifteen members of the COG, indicating that the report was finalised and transmitted but was “withheld from the public for 10 months for reasons that require explanation”.
 
 

The letter further noted that withholding the report violated Section 6.3 (the Chair will issue a preliminary statement within 48 hours after polling) of the Revised Commonwealth Guidelines and Section 6.7 (final report) of the Commonwealth Handbook on Election Observation. According to these regulations, election reports “shall be issued in a timely manner … and then made public”.
Moreover, on September 14, the Commonwealth issued a statement acknowledging that the letter had been shared with the federal government and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
“This damning admission that the report was shared with the perpetrators of election fraud but withheld from the victims of that fraud — Pakistani voters, opposition parties and civil society — constitutes a betrayal of the Commonwealth Charter’s commitments to democracy and human rights, and undermines the credibility of election observation itself,” the letter stated.
“The report confirmed that ‘decisions by key institutions consistently limited the ability of one particular party to contest the elections. Ultimately, these decisions impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process,’” the letter read.
Other “worrying observations” made by the signatories included restrictions on fundamental political rights, such as freedom of association; reduced transparency in the electoral process due to telecommunications blackouts; discrepancies in polling results; limiting journalistic freedoms; and the mass arrests of PTI members.
Additionally, the report noted the COG was “immensely concerned by allegations [of judicial interference] and by the possibility that such interference may have occurred in relation to election-related court cases”.
“The foremost duty of the Commonwealth Secretariat in this matter is to uphold the democratic rights of the people of its member state the people of Pakistan,” the letter read.
“Instead, the secretariat has harmed democratic accountability and denied millions of Pakistani citizens the opportunity to seek redress for violations of their democratic rights by withholding the election report for 19 months.”
The letter urged the Commonwealth Secretariat to take the following measures:

Commission an independent inquiry into the 19-month delay in publishing the report
Adopt a policy to automatically publish observer reports within a fixed timeframe
Refer this issue to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group and place it on the agenda at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting
Issue an unequivocal apology to the people of Pakistan for “failing them at a critical moment in their history”

In September, the PTI had called on the COG to release this report, claiming that it laid bare “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting of PTI and its founder, Imran Khan”.
However, in a statement issued on September 14, the COG said it was aware that a version of its report on the 2024 Pakistan general elections was circulating online, but that they did not comment on leaked documents as a matter of policy.
“The government and the Election Commission of Pakis­tan have already received the report. The full report, as we had communicated earlier, will be released later this month, along with a number of COG reports currently in the publication pipeline,” the COG statement said.</p><small>2025-10-02 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/022038316e9287b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946146/karachi-civil-society-protests-detention-of-pakistani-activists-onboard-gaza-flotilla-demands-release' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi civil society protests detention of Pakistani activists onboard Gaza flotilla, demands release</strong></a><br><p>Civil society and advocacy groups gathered on Thursday outside the Karachi Press Club to protest against the detention of activists aboard the Gaza Sumud Flotilla (GSF), calling on the government to demand the release of the Pakistani delegation, led by former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan.
On Wednesday, the GSF, carrying aid to Gaza in its attempt to break Israel’s blockade, was intercepted by Israeli military forces. On board the GSF were over 400 activists from 40 countries, among them a five-member delegation from Pakistan.
Thursday’s demonstration, organised by the Pakistan Palestine Forum (PFF) in collaboration with the Palestine Action Coalition (PAC) and the non-profit organisation Human Rights Council of Pakistan, aimed to mobilise the public against the state’s inaction.
People of all ages gathered, chanting slogans for a free Palestine. The demonstrators demanded the immediate release of the detained Pakistanis and called on the government to take concrete action against Israel.
“It is the responsibility of the government to ensure the safe return of the Pakistani delegation on board the GSF,” said Jamshed Hussain of the Human Rights Council of Pakistan while addressing the crowd.
Hussain recalled that his group, along with PPF, had initially urged the government to facilitate the flotilla, anticipating Israel’s attack; however, “our concerns were ignored,” he said.
“The five Pakistanis on board are our national heroes,” Hussain said, lamenting that “while governments of Italy and France sent fleets to ensure the safe passage of the flotilla, Pakistan — despite being a muslim country — failed to follow suit”.

Anosha Kausar of the PFF echoed similar concerns, telling Dawn.com that “It was particularly distressing for Pakistanis to embark on such missions since there was very little likelihood of governmental support.” Yet, she remained hopeful that “momentum for the movement is building up”.

Speaking to Dawn.com, Hussain called on the people to “stand united in their demand for the Pakistanis on the GSF to be released and brought back home safely,” vowing to continue the protest “lest they suffer any harm.”
Hussain warned that “by ignoring the plight of the Palestinian people, we are setting a dangerous precedent”.
“We must decide which side of history we will choose to stand on,” he said, expressing disappointment at Pakistan’s endorsement of Trump’s Gaza peace plan.
On Monday, Pakistan hailed Trump’s 20-point plan, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcoming it, drawing ire from the political sphere.

Among the many participants was Noureen, a housewife and a caterer, who felt the government’s inaction had forced “ordinary citizens like her to come out on the streets”.
However, speaking to Dawn.com, Naureen remarked, “As a mother, I can not turn away from the suffering of the Palestinian children, just as I can not see my own children harmed.” While another demonstrator, Ehtaram, who had come to attend with his wife and two children, thought that “we must pressurise our government to take stern action against Israel, the way Colombia did”.
Earlier today, Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the expulsion of the entire Israeli diplomatic delegation from Colombia, a move triggered by the detention of two Colombian nationals aboard the Gaza aid flotilla.
The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, departed in late August to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza.</p><small>2025-10-02 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0221281129c3bdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946147/bangladesh-cruise-to-win-over-pakistan-in-womens-cricket-world-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh cruise to win over Pakistan in Women’s Cricket World Cup clash</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh kicked off their 2025 Women’s Cricket World Cup campaign in style, cantering past Pakistan’s modest 129 with seven wickets and 18.5 overs to spare in Colombo on Thursday.
Debuting opener Rubya Haider announced herself with an unbeaten half-century, steering the chase with the composure of a seasoned pro as Bangladesh barely broke sweat in pursuit of the below-par target.
But it was their bowlers who set the tone.
Lone seamer Marufa Akter struck with a double blow in her very first over — two wickets in successive balls — before a spin web tightened the screws on a hesitant Pakistan line-up.
“We are thrilled to get a win under our belt in our first outing,” said Marufa.
“There was a lot of support from my teammates. Special credit to our team analyst who fed me with some valuable input leading into the game.
“We showed lot of energy on the field and we take lot of positives from this game.”
With a rich spin arsenal at their disposal, Bangladesh never let Pakistan off the hook.
Left-arm spinner Nahida Akter snared two quick wickets to leave the opposition tottering at 47-4 inside 14 overs, before leg-spinner Shorna Akter came on to deliver the final nails on the coffin.
Bowling with metronomic accuracy, she cleaned up the tail, returning remarkable figures of 3-5 in 3.3 overs without conceding a run in her first three overs.
Then, Rubya anchored the chase, her half-century carved through cut shots that threaded the gap between point and cover. She looked particularly strong square of the wicket, never needing to go aerial.
Pakistan, by contrast, produced a limp batting display with only two players crossing 20. They must quickly come to grips with the sluggish Colombo surface, where all their matches will be staged.
One silver lining was the spell of seamer Diana Baig, a double international who has also donned Pakistan colours in football.
Her late inswingers kept Bangladesh’s batters guessing, but with no scoreboard pressure to defend, her efforts weren’t enough.
“We just lost too many wickets early on and never recovered,” Pakistan captain Fatima Sana said. “We need to put this defeat behind us now and bounce back stronger. We have a lot of young players in our ranks and the World Cup is their first big tournament and hopefully they will learn from the mistakes.“</p><small>2025-10-02 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/02141141bd3aa04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946087/israels-interception-of-gaza-flotilla-draws-global-ire-as-pakistan-demands-release-of-detained-activists' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s interception of Gaza flotilla draws global ire as Pakistan demands release of detained activists</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and several other countries on Thursday condemned Israel’s “dastardly attack” on the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF) after its forces intercepted the flotilla heading to break Israel’s siege of Gaza and deliver aid.
Hours after Tel Aviv’s move drew global condemnation, the Israeli foreign ministry posted on X that all on board the flotilla were safe would be “deported to Europe”.
The statement said: “The Hamas-Sumud provocation is over. None of the Hamas-Sumud provocation yachts has succeeded in its attempt to enter an active combat zone or breach the lawful naval blockade.
“All the passengers are safe and in good health. They are making their way safely to Israel, from where they will be deported to Europe.”
It added that one last vessel of “this provocation remains at a distance. If it approaches, its attempt to enter an active combat zone and breach the blockade will also be prevented”.
 






Earlier, the flotilla said that Israeli forces began intercepting the flotilla’s latest bid to reach Gaza late last night. Israel intercepted 39 boats with foreign activists on board to Gaza, leaving only one vessel still sailing towards the Palestinian enclave, the flotilla organisers said.
The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians including Greta Thunberg on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine. Former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was also on board.
‘Dastardly attack’
In a post on X during the early hours of Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said: “Pakistan strongly condemns the dastardly attack by Israeli forces on the 40 vessel Samud Gaza flotilla, carrying over 450 humanitarian workers from 44 countries. We hope and pray for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and call for their immediate release.“
“Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” he said. “This barbarity must end. Peace must be given a chance, and humanitarian aid must reach those in need,” the premier asserted.
 






In another post later in the day, he commended the presence of Pakistanis, including former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, on the Global Sumud Flotilla.
They participated in this “great aid mission in line with the principles of humanity”, he said, adding that their initiative reflected Pakistanis’ “peace-loving aspirations, struggle for justice, spirit of helping those in need”, he said.
The PM added that the Pakistan government supported the “principles of respect for human life … and uninterrupted aid. It demands the return of its citizens. It is trying and prays for their safety, dignity, and earliest possible return to the country”.
 






Strong-worded condemnations also poured in from other countries — including the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Turkiye, Spain, Colombia, Brazil and South Africa — with some voicing concern for their citizens part of the mission and held by Israel.
Malaysia’s PM Anwar Ibrahim said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister, as well as the Turkish and Egyptian presidents, to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained“.
Turkiye announced that it had opened an investigation concerning “24 Turkish citizens arrested following the attack carried out by elements of the Israeli navy in international waters“.
South Africa called on Israel to release all activists, including Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile “Mandla” Mandela.
Cameras broadcasting live feeds from the boats, verified by Reuters, showed Israeli soldiers sporting helmets and night vision goggles boarding the ships, while passengers huddled together in life vests with their hands up.
 


A video from the Israeli foreign ministry showed Thunberg, the most prominent of the flotilla’s passengers, sitting on a deck surrounded by soldiers.
According to a tracker on the Global Sumud Flotilla’s website, one of its boats, named Mikeno, had entered Gaza’s territorial waters and was still sailing.
The Palestinian foreign ministry spokesperson condemned the interception of the flotilla as a violation of international law, asserting that Israel had neither authority nor sovereignty over Palestinian “territorial waters”, including those off the coast of the Gaza Strip.
 






Israel’s interception of the flotilla sparked protests in Italy and Colombia, while protests were also called in Greece, Ireland and Turkiye. Italian unions called a general strike for Friday.
At 10:55am PKT, the Israeli foreign ministry said that the detained individuals “were making their way safely and peacefully to Israel, where their deportation procedures to Europe will begin”.
“The passengers are safe and in good health,” it insisted.

The flotilla had earlier vowed to press on with its bid to deliver aid to the devastated coastal territory despite intimidation tactics by the Israeli military.
It said on X that it remained “vigilant as we enter the area where the previous flotillas were intercepted and/or attacked”.
Israel has blocked similar attempts previously as well. In June, aid vessel Madleen, carrying 12 members — 11 activists and one journalist — on their way to break the Gaza siege, was intercepted by Israeli forces.
Deliberate obstruction of humanitarian relief: FO
Separately, the Foreign Office (FO) also strongly condemned the attack, stating: “The unlawful detention of international activists onboard the flotilla constitutes yet another flagrant violation of international law and international humanitarian law by Israel, and endangers the lives of innocent civilians.”
Calling it a deliberate attempt to obstruct humanitarian relief in the Palestinian enclave, the FO said: “This reprehensible act is part of Israel’s ongoing pattern of aggression and its illegal blockade of Gaza, which has caused immense human suffering and deprivation for over two million Palestinians.”
 
 

It demanded the “immediate release of all humanitarian workers and activists on board the flotilla”, urging Israel to respect international law. The FO also called on the international community to hold Israel accountable for its “repeated violations of international law”.
“Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support and solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination and for the establishment of a viable, independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” it added.
 






Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called Israel’s actions against the flotilla “a flagrant violation of international law”, demanding the release of the detained activists.
“Pakistan strongly condemns Israel’s interception of the Global Sumud Flotilla and detention of international activists in flagrant violation of international law. We demand an immediate ceasefire, lifting of the blockade, swift release of activists and unhindered aid to Gaza,“ he wrote on X.
 






Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also condemned the attack, praying for the “safe return of all those aboard the [Sumud] Gaza Flotilla”.
“We strongly condemn the Israeli attack on these peaceful people carrying humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza. Israeli barbarity must end,” the minister said in a post on X.
 






Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani called Israel’s move an act of “state terrorism and barbaric savagery”, urging the international community to take notice.
In a statement issued by his office, Gilani described the assault as “a blatant violation of international law, humanitarian principles, and the dignity of mankind,” adding that the attack has left a “permanent stain on the conscience of the international community”.
“The only ‘crime’ of these innocent and selfless individuals was that they sought to stand by the oppressed Palestinians in the spirit of human compassion,” the Senate chairman said.
“Urgent steps must be taken to ensure uninterrupted delivery of food, water, medicines, and other essentials to the people of Gaza, who are enduring immense hardship under siege,” the statement added.
Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad detained
Former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmad, who is leading the Pakistani delegation on the Global Sumud Flotilla, was also among those taken by Israeli forces, according to advocacy group Pak-Palestine Forum.
 
 

In a post on X, the group said, “Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan arrested by Israel.”
The advocacy group further wrote: “Only one ship has managed to escape, i.e., [the] observer boat, whose duty was to collect information and escape. Our second delegate, Syed Uzair Nizami, was sailing on the observer boat and shared the information regarding the interception of Senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan’s ship.”
 






JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman paid tribute to the activists on board the flotilla, announcing a nationwide protest in a show of solidarity with Gaza.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore, the JI chief said, “We will observe a nationwide protest tomorrow against the attack on the Sumud Gaza Flotilla.”
“We call on our leaders to play their part,” he added.
Former PTI senator Faisal Javed Khan took to X to pray for Khan’s safety, saying, “Let us all condemn the aggression by Israel that has been unleashed upon these peaceful humanitarians, who sought only to deliver aid and amplify the cry for justice.”
 






Lawyer and activist Jibran Nasir took to X to laud the “courage” of the activists on board the flotilla.
“They are carrying nothing but courage in their hearts and aid in their ships,” he said, noting that the Israel Defence Force (IDF) has become “emboldened by the failure and cowardice of the global community.”
“Our only hope is ordinary citizens of the world,” he added.
 






Israel faces international backlash
Malaysia
PM Ibrahim also condemned Israel’s interception of the flotilla, saying that Israeli forces had detained eight Malaysians.
“By blocking a humanitarian mission, Israel has shown utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world,” Anwar said in a statement.
 






In a later post on X, the Malaysian premier said he “held direct discussions” with the Qatari prime minister as well as the presidents of Turkiye and Egypt to “secure their support in demanding the immediate release of Malaysian volunteers and activists unjustly detained”.
“My team and I have also remained in close contact with other key partners, including the United States Secretary of State [Marco Rubio], to press for urgent intervention without delay.
“I reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that the atrocities and acts of aggression committed by the Israeli regime must cease immediately,” Anwar added.
He reiterated his demand for the “immediate and unconditional release of all detainees, and for humanitarian aid to be allowed to reach our brothers and sisters in Gaza swiftly and without obstruction”.
 






Turkiye
Turkiye’s foreign ministry called Israel’s “attack” on the flotilla “an act of terror” that endangered the lives of innocent civilians.
The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said it had launched an investigation into the detention of 24 Turkish citizens on board vessels in the flotilla on charges including deprivation of liberty, seizure of transport vehicles and damage to property, as per Turkiye’s Anadolu Agency.
 






Colombia
Colombian President Gustavo Petro ordered the expulsion of Israel’s entire diplomatic delegation on Wednesday following the detention of two Colombians in the flotilla. Israel has not had an ambassador in Colombia since last year.
Petro called the detentions a potential “new international crime” by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and demanded the release of the Colombians. He also terminated Colombia’s free trade agreement with Israel.
 






Britain
The British government remained “very concerned” about Israel’s interception of the aid flotilla, its foreign office said today, adding that it had made clear to Israel that the situation should be resolved safely.
“We are very concerned about the situation with the Sumud flotilla, we are in touch with the families of a number of British nationals involved,” the British foreign office said in a statement.
“The aid carried by the flotilla should be turned over to humanitarian organisations on the ground to be delivered safely into Gaza,” it added.
Spain
Spain summoned Israel’s top representative in Madrid after Israeli forces intercepted a Gaza-bound flotilla carrying activists and humanitarian aid to the devastated Palestinian territory, Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said.
“Today I summoned the charge d’affaires here in Madrid,” Albares told public broadcaster TVE, saying 65 Spaniards were travelling with the flotilla.
 






Brazil
Brazil also issued a condemnation on the Israeli navy’s interception of the flotilla, with several Brazilian nationals on board, including a lawmaker.
The Brazilian foreign ministry said, “[Brazil] deplores the Israeli government’s military action, which violates rights and endangers the physical well-being of peaceful protesters.”
“The responsibility for the safety of those detained now rests with Israel,” it added.</p><small>2025-10-02 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626676-four-policemen-injured-in-peshawar-ied-blast-official' target='_blank'><strong>Four policemen injured in Peshawar IED blast: official</strong></a><br><p>

The 26th Amendment, passed on Oct 21, 2024, took away the SC’s suo motu powers and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee to nominate the next chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) from among the three most senior SC judges instead of the senior-most one.
The SC is currently seized with multiple petitions urging the constitution of a full court to hear the matter rather than the Constitutional Bench (CB) formed under the 26th Amendment. The CB is set to resume proceedings on the original appeals on October 7 (Tuesday).
“I’ve filed an appeal against the registrar’s decision to return my petition, seeking justice once again. My petition argues that the majority decision of the Practice & Procedure Committee remains valid in law and cases related to the 26th should only be heard by a full court,” Khokhar said on X.
 






The appeal, filed through Advocate Shahid Jamil Khan, requested the SC to set aside the September 19 decision and “register and entertain the said petition in accordance with law”.
The plea was filed under Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules and named the apex court’s registrar office as a respondent.
The appeal contended that the registrar had “no jurisdiction to determine the maintainability or entertainability of a petition under Article 184(3), as such questions can only be decided by this Hon’ble Court in exercise of its judicial authority”.
It argued that even if a petition appeared non-maintainable under the Constitution, law or the SC Rules, the “issue must be placed before the court for adjudication on the judicial side”.
“The registrar, acting on the administrative side, cannot assume or exercise judicial powers, nor can he refuse to receive or register a petition or appeal on the ground of perceived non-maintainability,” the former senator contended.
 
 

CJP Yahya Afridi had ignored a decision made in October 2024 by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment before the full court, according to minutes of the communication exchange between CJP and two senior SC judges.
The committee, which met on Oct 31, 2024 under the Practice and Procedure Act (PPA) 2023, was convened by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. In response, CJP Afridi, who chairs the committee, said he did not find it appropriate to call for a full court hearing.
In separate minutes dated May 20, 2025, Justice Shah stressed the need for meaningful consultation, which he stated was the core purpose of the PPA. Justice Shah noted that delegating powers to the SC’s registrar was not covered by the act.
Since October 2024, multiple petitions have been filed with the SC challenging the amendment, contending that it “abrogates, repeals, alters and destroys the basic features of the Constitution” and “violates” fundamental rights.
An eight-member CB, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, will resume hearing a set of petitions against the 26th Amendment on Tuesday.
The bench also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.</p><small>2025-10-02 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/021814309970e15.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946124/at-least-2-dead-3-wounded-in-uk-synagogue-attack' target='_blank'><strong>At least 2 dead, 3 wounded in UK synagogue attack</strong></a><br><p>At least two people were killed on Thursday and three badly wounded outside a packed synagogue in Manchester in a car and stabbing attack, with the suspect believed to have been shot dead by UK police.
As the Jewish community marked the holiday of Yom Kippur in the northwestern city, police were called to the incident, activating a national terrorism-response protocol.
The attack struck days ahead of the second anniversary of Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which sparked a fierce offensive in Gaza, inflaming passions in Britain.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer swiftly condemned the attack as “horrific”, and announced security was being boosted at UK synagogues. He left a European political summit in Denmark early to chair an emergency security meeting in London.
King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla were “deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the horrific attack in Manchester, especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community”.
Greater Manchester Police declared a “major incident” shortly after 9:30 am (1:30pm PKT) after officers were called to the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in the Crumpsall neighbourhood.
 






The force initially said paramedics were treating four people for “injuries caused by both the vehicle and stab wounds” while confirming firearms officers had shot one man “believed to be the offender”.
Within hours, it announced two people had died and the suspected offender shot by officers was “also believed to be deceased”.
Police said the death could not be confirmed due to “suspicious items on his person”, noting a bomb disposal unit was at the scene.
Three people were also in a “serious condition”, police added.
‘Appalled’
Starmer said he was appalled and pledged to “do everything to keep our Jewish community safe”.
“The fact that this has taken place on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar, makes it all the more horrific,” he added.
Israel’s embassy in the UK said it was “abhorrent and deeply distressing” that “such an act of violence should be perpetrated on the holiest day of the Jewish calendar”.
“The safety and security of Jewish communities in the United Kingdom must be guaranteed,” it added on X.
Police said officers first responded to calls from the public about a car driving into people outside the synagogue, as well as reports that a security guard had been attacked with a knife.
A witness told BBC Radio he saw police shooting a man after a car crash.
“They gave him a couple of warnings, he didn’t listen until they opened fire,” he said. “He went down on the floor, and then he started getting back up, and then they shot him again.”
Police said “a large number of people worshipping at the synagogue … were held inside while the immediate area was made safe” but then evacuated.

‘Holiest Jewish day’
Manchester mayor Andy Burnham told the BBC police had “dealt with it very quickly with some amazing support from members of the public”.
He urged people “not to speculate on social media”, while noting the Jewish community “will be very worried by the news”.
The city, famous around the world for its two Premier League football clubs and industrial history, is home to one of the largest Jewish communities in the UK. It totalled more than 28,000 in 2021, according to the Institute for Jewish Policy Research.

MP Graham Stringer said the area was home to both large Jewish and Muslim communities.
“By and large community relations are excellent between all the different ethnic groups and religious groups,” he told BBC Radio Manchester.
The Community Security Trust (CST), a Jewish charity that records antisemitic incidents, said it was “working with police and the local Jewish community”.
“This appears to be an appalling attack on the holiest day of the Jewish year,” CST added.
The city has witnessed several deadly terror attacks, notably in 2017 when Salman Abedi detonated a homemade suicide bomb outside an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester Arena.

In his petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Justice Jahangiri contended that the SHC “dismissed my application to become a party to the case”, adding that passing a “one-sided order without hearing the affected party is contrary to law”.
On September 16, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri then challenged the decision in the SC, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside.
The judge further argued that the SHC “ignored the question of maintainability of the petition”.
According to the petition, the IHC judge urged the apex court that his appeal “may graciously be granted and after granting leave to appeal, this Honourable Court, may graciously set aside the Impugned Order”.
The petition, filed under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, names the province of Sindh and others as respondents. Dr Mohammad Usman Mirza has been appointed as defence counsel by the petitioner.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations, regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, Daud filed a writ petition, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that Daud was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself.
To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person.
On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the SC.
Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.

“A high-level delegation from Pakistan has started formal dialogue with representatives of the Joint Action Committee of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in Muzaffarabad today,” Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry posted on X as the talks commenced.
 






A strike has paralysed AJK under a communications blackout after talks over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats collapsed between the JAAC, the AJK government, and federal ministers, sparking protests and violence. On Wednesday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq and federal minister Chaudhry invited the JAAC for fresh dialogue.
Earlier today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK and directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to AJK capital Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues.
The committee includes Senator Rana Sanaullah as well as federal ministers Sardar Yusuf and Ahsan Iqbal, former President of Azad Jammu and Kashmir Masood Khan, and PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira.
Photos shared by Chaudhry on X showed him, Kaira, Sanaullah, Iqbal, Kashmir Affairs Federal Minister Amir Muqam, PPP leader Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Yousuf among those participating in today’s negotiations.
Before the delegation left for AJK capital Muzaffarbad, members of a government negotiating committee spoke to the media in Islamabad and and stressed the need for dialogue to end the unrest that has gripped AJK for the past three days.
Among them, Ahsan Iqbal said the government should play its role in address the issues in AJK. But, he added, given the present situation in the region and the world, some “elements would want to disturb peace and stability in Pakistan to push forward their agendas”.
He said the government remained committed to resolving the issues of the people of AJK but they should also be mindful that no such situation was creating of which “Pakistan’s enemies” could take advantage.
AJK PM Haq thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz for issuing directives for sending a “high-level delegation” for restarting talks to AJK and expressed the hope that members of the JAAC would also work toward ending the impasse in negotiations between the two sides.
Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said, “We all are saddened and concerned over the situation. We will try our best to fulfil the just demands of the people of Kashmir and steer them out of the current situation at the earliest as the enemies of Pakistan and Kashmir would have their own objectives. As far as the  Joint Awami Action Committee is concerned, they are very honourable and disrespected people.”
He stressed the solution to the ongoing unrest was through talks. “They are a part of our body and their pain is our pain, their difficulties are our difficulties.”
Ashraf said that the loss of lives was unfortunate, whether it be because of the “administration or the civilian population”.
Rana Sanaullah also emphasised that “violence is not the solution” to any problem. He said they aimed to resolve the matters in accordance with the law and Constitution, ensuring the restoration and maintenance of peace. “We are confident that when we sit with our friend of the Joint Awami Action Committee, all misunderstandings will be resolved.”
Amir Muqam also thanked PM Shehbaz for addressing the issue. “We want the protest and the difficulties of the people of Kashmir to end. We hope that [JAAC] members would consider this … and engage with us for talks.”
Sardar Muhammad Yousuf, Qamar Zaman Kaira and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also shared similar views.
The Ministry of Interior also convened an important meeting in Islamabad today to consider steps to defuse the situation.
PM urges citizens to remain peaceful
According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on X earlier today,  PM Shehbaz had directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad.
 






According to the PMO statement, the prime minister voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in AJK as yesterday’s violent protests left three policemen dead. He urged citizens to remain peaceful and instructed law enforcement agencies to show restraint.
“The prime minister has made a strong appeal to citizens to remain peaceful. He has urged that peaceful protest is the constitutional and democratic right of every citizen, but protesters should refrain from causing harm to public order.”
PM Shehbaz, according to the statement, also directed that law enforcement agencies exercise restraint and patience with the protesters.
“The prime minister has said that respect for public sentiments must be ensured, and any unnecessary harshness should be avoided,” the statement said, adding that the government was always ready to address the issues of its Kashmiri brothers.
Expressing “deep concern over the unfortunate incidents during the protests”, the premier ordered a transparent investigation into the matter.
“The prime minister has directed immediate assistance to the families affected by the demonstrations,” read the statement. “At the government level, to find a peaceful resolution to the issue, the prime minister has decided to expand the negotiation committee.”
“The prime minister has appealed to the members and leadership of the JAAC to cooperate with the government’s negotiation committee.
“The committee will send its recommendations and proposed solutions to the Prime Minister’s Office without delay so that steps can be taken for the immediate resolution of the issues.”</p><small>2025-10-02 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/021515297a1220d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946122/from-clanker-to-delulu-what-were-the-most-searched-slang-words-on-google-in-2025' target='_blank'><strong>From Clanker to Delulu: What were the most searched slang words on Google in 2025</strong></a><br><p>Google search data from January to September 2025 revealed the slang terms dominating online curiosity, with TikTok, Instagram, gaming, streaming, and Gen Z and Alpha communities driving the trends.

This term has become a synonym for something that is ugly, undesirable or unattractive.
6. Big back (57,000 searches)

He made the remarks during an interview with Chinese state-owned broadcaster CGTN that was aired on Thursday. During the interview, the president, who visited China earlier this month, said that all his visits to the neighbouring country were “goodwill visits”.
“My visits are always goodwill visits because China is the future and all of the East will work with China,” he said. Talking about China’s Global Governance Initiative, he said: “Global governance means that I cannot walk into any other country nor any other country [can] walk into me. They have to be respectful about my territory, I shall be respectful of their territory.”
He said that he was bringing international goodwill and the Pakistani people’s goodwill, as well as the assurance that “we stand with China in good times and bad times”.
“Not that I see China going through a bad time, but even then, we are there, in case [we are] needed,” he asserted.
 






Asked whether China and Pakistan could work together to promote the Global Governance Initiative, the president said: “We don’t need a marshal mindset, we need an economical mindset. We need to let the people live and let live.”
Talking about the relationship between the two countries, the president termed Pakistan and China: “All-weather, iron-clad brothers, but […] that we are joined on the hip also.
“That’s how close we are. And that is an opportunity,” he said.
President Zardari further stated that Pakistan has always tried to “help Chinese positions”.
“Wherever I go in the world, my first position is respect China […] for its people, for its technology, for everything,” he said.
Commenting on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) 2.0, President Zardari said: “We are the closest port to China […]. One day, the generations to come will thank Chinese people and Pakistani people [for thinking] about that port.
“That port will be the closest link you have to China,” he said, calling it a “great futuristic project”. He said that once the port would become operational, it would enhance employment opportunities and trade in the area.
“So there is great importance for me to make sure Balochistan is safer,” he said, adding that “economic growth kept nations together”.</p><small>2025-10-02 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626619-ex-senator-mushtaq-ahmed-arrested-after-israeli-forces-intercept-gaza-bound-flotilla' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmed arrested after Israeli forces intercept Gaza-bound flotilla</strong></a><br><p>

US media outlets described the moves announced by the energy and transportation departments as part of the administration’s efforts to pressure Democrats in Congress to agree on a deal to end the shutdown.
US President Donald Trump had raced to enact hard-right policies even before the shutdown began after midnight on Tuesday, threatening mass firings and to slash government departments, and blaming Democrats for Congress’ failure to resolve a funding stand-off.
The Department of Energy announced on Thursday “the termination of 321 financial awards supporting 223 projects, resulting in a savings of approximately $7.56 billion for American taxpayers”. It said in a statement that those projects — overseen by the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and other bodies — “did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs … and would not provide a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars”.
However, recipients of federal funding have 30 days to appeal against a termination decision, and some have already begun the process, the statement said.
It did not list the projects in question.
In a post on social media platform X, Russell Vought, who heads the powerful Office of Management and Budget, called the slashed projects “Green New Scam funding” that was used to advance “the Left’s climate agenda”.
He listed the states affected by the decision. They include California, New York and 14 others — all blue states where Trump failed to win in the 2024 presidential elections.
 






California Governor Gavin Newsom said the Trump administration had decided to cancel “up to $1.2bn” slated for a major hydrogen energy project, threatening tens of thousands of jobs.
“In Trump’s America, energy policy is set by the highest bidder, economics and common sense be damned,” Newsom said in a statement, vowing to keep pursuing a “clean energy strategy… no matter what DC tries to dictate.”
In New York — the home state of top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries — the Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced on Wednesday it was freezing nearly $18bn in federal funding for two major infrastructure projects, the Second Avenue subway and Hudson Tunnel.
The move takes aim at diversity, equity and inclusion policies, according to the department’s statement, saying that subsidising projects with “race- and sex-based contracting requirements … is unconstitutional, counter to civil rights laws, and a waste of taxpayer resources”.
The funds would be frozen until a “quick administrative review is complete”, it said.
“Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries shutdown, however, USDOT’s review of New York’s unconstitutional practices will take more time,” it added, saying that the department “has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review”.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said in a statement that halting funding for “critical infrastructure projects” was “political payback and an attack on New York”.
“Donald Trump has been clear: he is intent on using his reckless government shutdown to hurt the American people,” she said.</p><small>2025-10-02 09:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0209491317ccb6e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945920/new-force-blood-testing-planned-to-tackle-drug-menace-among-karachi-students' target='_blank'><strong>New force, blood testing planned to tackle drug menace among Karachi students</strong></a><br><p>• ‘Coalition Against Drugs’ to monitor children’s behaviour, attendance, academic performance and social interactions
• Those doing drugs should be treated as victims, not criminals, says Shehzad Roy
KARACHI: The Campus Security and Substance Abuse Watch Force comprising 50 police personnel was established on Wednesday to curb the menace of drugs in educational institutions within the jurisdiction of the South Zone of Karachi police.
A decision to this effect was taken in a consultative meeting of the ‘Coalition Against Drugs’ here. The coalition comprises heads of over 50 academic institutes in Clifton, DHA, Saddar, and other areas, as well as police officials.
It was also decided in the meeting that random blood tests to check for drug abuse among students would be carried out with the consent of their parents.
Speaking to journalists after the meeting, South DIG Syed Asad Raza said that the Campus Security and Substance Abuse Watch Force had been established with 50 personnel including women officers, who would be deployed at different institutes.
He said their uniforms were designed in consultation with the institutes so that their presence would not be domineering, but rather cooperative.
He said the police had consulted with around 150 schools, colleges and universities located in South-Zone to grasp the issue of drug abuse, share responsibilities and devise strategies to tackle the problem.
He said as part of a larger strategy against narcotics, the police were focusing on shisha bars, social media platforms, and courier services, which were allegedly involved in the supply of drugs.
Earlier, during the consultative meeting, singer-turned-activist Shehzad Roy suggested that students involved in drug abuse should be treated as victims, not as criminals.
Sadia Faisal of Karachi Grammar School proposed that an age-appropriate curriculum should be devised at the institutes.
Meanwhile, a statement issued after the meeting said that presence of the new campus force could deter substance abuse. “Collaborative working between police and institution administrators will help in developing strategies for addressing substance misuse.”
The participants of the meeting also decided to develop a curriculum that educates students about the risks and consequences of substance abuse, including its physical and mental health effects.
The special curriculum would also incorporate life skills training to help students resist peer pressure, make informed decisions, and manage stress, it was stated. Awareness campaigns, workshops, and seminars would be organised to educate students, teachers, and parents about substance misuse.
Regarding parents’ awareness and consent for testing, it was decided that parents would be educated about the risks of substance misuse and the importance of regular testing.
The parents’ consent would be obtained for random drug testing, ensuring that the parents were involved in the process. “Support and resources would be provided to parents to address substance misuse issues with their children.”
About random blood testing for drug abuse on the campus, the participants agreed that random drug testing could deter students from substance misuse. “The students would be identified who may be struggling with substance misuse and will be provided with support and resources.”
Besides, it was also decided that teachers would be trained to identify signs of substance misuse among students.
The signs include changes in behaviour and physical symptoms.
They would be equipped with skills to support students who may be struggling with drug abuse and refer them to appropriate resources. The teachers would also be provided with strategies to manage classrooms effectively and promote a positive learning environment.
Moreover, the heads of academic institutes and the police officers agreed that “behavioural changes in students would be monitored”.
“Students should be considered victims, rather than perpetrators,” the participants said.
Students’ behaviour, attendance, academic performance, and social interactions would be monitored. “Frequent collaboration between law enforcement, educators, and administrators would be ensured to develop effective strategies and action plan for addressing substance misuse,” declared the participants.

The development comes days after tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad spilled over onto the cricketing field during the Sept 9-28 Men’s Asia Cup staged in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), when Indian cricketers refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during all three clashes in the tournament. The tensions had culminated in India not accepting the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief.
The tournament had seen the first cricket matches between the two sides since the military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May after India had launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. Pakistan had denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention.
 
 

Against this backdrop, Pakistan is kicking off its Women’s World Cup campaign today by playing Bangladesh in Colombo. Pakistan will face India in the tournament on Sunday.
According to a report published by BBC Sport on Wednesday, BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia told BBC Stumped — a weekly cricket show — the following: “I cannot forecast anything, but our relationship with that particular hostile country is the same, there is no change in the last week.”
He added, “India will play that match against Pakistan in Colombo, and all cricket protocols will be followed. I can only assure that whatever is in the Marylebone Cricket Club regulations of cricket, that will be done.
“Whether there will be handshakes, whether there will be hugging, I cannot assure you of anything at this moment,” he said.
 
 

Meanwhile, The Indian Express reported while citing BCCI sources that the Indian team had been advised by the board to avoid handshakes with Pakistan’s players before they departed for Sri Lanka.
The sources noted, “The team won’t be shaking hands with the Pakistan team during the World Cup. The team has been informed by the BCCI bosses about this. The Indian board will stand by its players.”
A day earlier, PCB chief Naqvi had refuted claims by Indian media that he had apologised to the BCCI over the trophy handover issue at Sunday’s Asia Cup final.
The closing ceremony of the Asia Cup had descended into farce as the Indian cricket team refused to collect the winners’ trophy from the ACC chief, marking a historic low in cricketing relations between the two countries. Indian skipper Surya­ku­mar Yadav complained his side were denied the trophy after winning the Asia Cup. Later, Indian media alleged that Naqvi had himself refused to hand the trophy over to the Indian team.
Subsequently, several Indian outlets, including IndiaToday, Financial Express and Hindustan Times, reported that Naqvi had apologised to the BCCI, but that he still refused to hand them the trophy.
Responding to the media reports, Naqvi had stated, “Indian media thrives on lies, not facts. Let me make it absolutely clear: I have done nothing wrong and I have never apologised to the BCCI nor will I ever do so.”
The PCB chairman called the claims “fabricated nonsense” and “cheap propaganda”, saying it was aimed at misleading Indian people. He slammed India for continuing to “drag politics into cricket, damaging the very spirit of the game”.
“As ACC chairman, I was ready to hand over the trophy that very day and I am still ready now,” he said. “If they truly want it, they are welcome to come to the ACC office and collect it from me.”</p><small>2025-10-02 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626582-pml-n-ppp-bury-the-hatchet-after-na-speakers-mediation' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N, PPP 'bury the hatchet' after NA speaker's mediation</strong></a><br><p>

Goodall died of natural causes, the Jane Goodall Institute said in a social media post.
“Dr Goodall’s discoveries as an ethologist revolutionised science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,” it said.

The primatologist-turned-conservationist spun her love of wildlife into a life-long campaign that took her from a seaside English village to Africa and then across the globe in a quest to better understand chimpanzees, as well as the role that humans play in safeguarding their habitat and the planet’s health overall.
Goodall was a pioneer in her field, both as a female scientist in the 1960s and for her work studying the behavior of primates. She created a path for a string of other women to follow suit, including the late Dian Fossey.
She also drew the public into the wild, partnering with the National Geog­r­aphic Society to bring her beloved chimps into their lives through film, TV and magazines.
She upended scientific norms of the time, giving chimpanzees names ins­tead of numbers, observing their distinct personalities, and incorporating their family relationships and emotions into her work. She also found that, like humans, they use tools.
“We have found that after all there isn’t a sharp line dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom,” she said in a 2002 TED Talk.
As her career evolved, she shifted her focus from primatology to climate advocacy after witnessing widespread habitat devastation, urging the world to take quick and urgent action on climate change.
“We’re forgetting that were part of the natural world,” she told CNN in 2020.  “There’s still a window of time.”  In 2003, she was appointed a Dame of the British Empire and, in 2025, she received the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Kenya-bound
Born in London in 1934 and then growing up on Eng­l­a­nd’s south coast, Goodall had long dreamed of living among wild animals. She said her passion for anim­als, stoked by the gift of a stuffed toy gorilla from her father, grew as she imme­rsed herself in books such as  “Tarzan” and  “Dr Doli­ttle.”  She set her dreams aside after leaving school, unable to afford university.
She worked as a secret­ary and then for a film company until a friend’s invitation to visit Kenya put the jungle within reach.
After saving up money for the journey, by boat, Goodall arrived in the East African nation in 1957. There, an encounter with famed anthropologist and paleontologist Dr Louis Leakey and his wife, arc­haeologist Mary Lea­key, set her on course to work with primates.

In its Annual Debt Review 2025, the MoF said the debt-to-GDP ratio increased to 70pc, up from 68pc a year earlier. This was attributed to a lower nominal GDP growth rate, resulting from reduced inflation, which limited economic expansion and pushed the ratio higher despite efforts at fiscal consolidation.
The MoF noted that while interest expenses rose by 9pc year-on-year, this increase was significantly lower than the 43pc recorded in the previous fiscal year. Total domestic debt stood at Rs54.5tr, and external debt at Rs26tr — both reflecting a 13pc annual increase.
 
 

The average time to maturity (ATM) for domestic debt improved from 2.8 years in FY24 to 3.8 years in FY25. External debt ATM remained above six years, consistent with the government’s Medium-Term Debt Strategy 2026–28. The external debt share in total public debt fell to 32pc from 34pc, reducing exposure to currency risk.

Fiscal deficit of Rs7.1tr and slower GDP growth drive up debt ratio to 70pc

The fiscal deficit was primarily financed through do­­mestic borrowing — 91pc — mainly via net issuances of Pakistan Investment Bonds and Government Ijarah Sukuk (GIS). The remaining 9pc (around Rs600bn) came from external sources, mostly multilateral and commercial, with a net retirement in bilateral loans.
 
 

The MoF highlighted a deceleration in debt growth, noting that it had been reduced from 23pc in FY22 and 28pc in FY23 to 13pc in both FY24 and FY25. This was attributed to fiscal discipline and the generation of a significant primary surplus.
The report claimed credit for the government’s first-ever early repayments of over Rs1.5tr in FY25 and the launch of the inaugural Green Sukuk auction. These developments, alongside fiscal consolidation, helped narrow Eurobond yields to 6-9pc and contributed to a reported Rs850bn reduction in interest expenses.
 
 

Currency movements continued to impact debt valuation. In FY25, the rupee depreciated against the US dollar, while the dollar weakened against other major currencies, including the euro, SDR, and Chinese renminbi. Although the exchange rate had stabilised in FY24, these developments still added pressure on external debt servicing.
Domestic debt rose by 15pc YoY to Rs54.5tr, the lowest increase in the last three fiscal years. The share of short-term Treasury bills declined, reflecting the government’s strategy to retire short-term debt through buybacks.
At the same time, the share of floating-rate instruments, especially PIBs, increased, reflecting investor preference amid interest rate volatility. Sharia-compliant instruments like GIS grew to 12.6pc of total domestic securities in FY25.
External debt rose 6pc YoY to $91.8bn by June 2025, driven by inflows from the IMF, an ADB-guaranteed commercial loan of $1bn, and other multilateral lenders. Multilateral loans accounted for 57pc of total external debt, bilateral loans 26pc, and commercial sources — including Eurobond/Sukuk, commercial banks, and Naya Pakistan Certificates — made up 17pc. Bilateral deposits from friendly countries, mostly rolled over, accounted for 9.8pc of external debt.

If this trend continues, the current year may turn out to be one of the deadliest in decades.
This is the crux of two reports, issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), about militant violence in the country over the past month.
According to PICSS, militant violence dropped significantly in Sept 2025, with both the number of attacks and militant capacity showing sharp declines compared to the record levels seen in Aug. The PICSS Militancy Database recorded 69 militant attacks in Sept — a 52 per cent reduction from August’s 143. These attacks resulted in 135 deaths and 173 injuries, whilst militants abducted at least 27 people.
The fatalities included 61 security personnel, 20 militants, and 54 civilians. Amongst the injured were 74 security personnel and 99 civilians. Compared with August, the number of martyred security personnel declined by 16pc, militant fatalities by 66pc, and civilian deaths by 17pc, reflecting a notable decrease in lethality.

If current trends continue, think tanks warn 2025 may be the ‘deadliest year’ in decade in terms of militant violence

KP remained the most affected province, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49. In mainland KP, 25 attacks caused 33 deaths — 20 security personnel, nine militants, and four civilians — whilst 42 people were injured. Militants kidnapped nine individuals, while security forces carried out 22 operations, killing 88 militants, though five personnel lost their lives and five militants were arrested.
In the tribal districts (erstwhile Fata), 20 militant attacks claimed 21 lives — six security personnel, three militants, and 12 civilians — and injured seven. Militants also abducted four people, while security forces conducted 18 operations in these districts, killing 83 militants. However, 24 civilians also lost their lives during these actions.
In Balochistan, 21 attacks claimed 79 lives — 33 security personnel, eight militants, and 38 civilians — and injured 122 others, including 37 security personnel and 85 civilians. Militants abducted 14 people. Security forces responded with seven major operations, killing 26 militants and arresting 10. Sindh experienced three attacks that killed two security personnel and injured two civilians.
According to CRSS’s report, Pakistan witnessed an over 46pc surge in overall violence in its security landscape for the third quarter of 2025, with at least 901 fatalities and 599 injuries — amongst civilians, security personnel, and outlaws — resulting from 329 incidents of violence.
“In just three quarters, 2025 has proven nearly as deadly as all of 2024, with 2,414 fatalities recorded compared to the entire tally of 2024 (2,546). With an entire quarter still remaining, this indicates that 2025 is on course to surpass last year’s toll. If the current trend continues, 2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade,” the report stated.

• Distrust remains over proposed International Stabilisation Force
• Hamas seeks changes to ‘disarmament’ clause
DESPITE their misgivings with the ‘pro-Israel’ draft of US President Donald Trump’s plan to bring peace to war-ravaged Gaza, countries from the eight-member Muslim bloc may yet push for it to be accepted.
Officials from Qatar and Pakis­tan have already implied — albeit diplomatically — that the plan announced by the White House was quite different from the one they signed up to in New York.
But some countries — especially those in Gaza’s immediate neighbourhood — also believe they have secured key concessions, such as Trump’s refusal to recognise Israeli annexation of the West Bank and a US commitment that Palestinians will be allowed to remain in Gaza.
Israel has also agreed, under the plan, not to permanently occupy the Gaza Strip.
“Gaza’s reconstruction represents a major economic opportunity for Egypt, ranging from debris removal to infrastructure development and urban projects. Such operations would channel billions of dollars into Egypt, directly and indirectly, boosting its economy in the long run,” Middle East Eye quoted a senior Egyptian political source as saying.
 
 

This would also end the looming threat of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza being expelled into the Sinai Peninsula.
“Accepting Trump’s plan to halt the war in Gaza would completely end the displacement scheme, which had become a source of deep tension between Cairo and Tel Aviv,” Middle East Eye reported.
The most surprising changes concerned the number of Palestinians set to be released as part of the deal, and the phased approach to the Israeli withdrawal from the Palestinian enclave.
 
 

Where previously hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would have been released alongside 1,700 men, women and children detained from Gaza, now just 250 inmates would be freed with the detainees.
Original drafts mandated 600 aid trucks entering Gaza per day, while the new version’s vague language afforded no such commitment.
There were also changes to what had been agreed on governance: Gaza would be run by a ‘Board of Peace’, to be led by Trump and former British PM Tony Blair, cutting out international ­con­sult­ation.
Troop deployment
Meanwhile, the so-called Inter­national Stabilisation Force (ISF), which was slated to train Palestinian police to take over security duties, suddenly had expanded powers, which suggested increased Israeli control.
Not only was the Israeli troop withdrawal staggered without clear deadlines, the addition of a “security zone” around the perimeter appeared to signal the prospect of a permanent presence within Gaza.
The ISF was one of the main issues discussed in the 45-minute meeting between Trump and leaders of Muslim nations in New York last week.
According to Middle East Eye, Trump had asked all countries present — Pakistan, Jordan, UAE, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt — to contribute troops to the force.
In the wake of Trump’s announcement, all eight countries issued a joint statement welcoming the Gaza plan and expressing their readiness to help finalise it.
But despite those positive words, behind closed doors serious concerns still exist in these countries about the prospect of deploying their soldiers on the ground in Gaza.
“Who will lead this force? Who will decide when to intervene? What will be the rules of engagement?” another senior regional official asked. “These questions all need to be discussed.”
The official suggested that further negotiations involving Arab and Muslim countries, the US, Israel and Palestinian representatives would be necessary before such a force could be viable.
The source added that Turkey, Jordan and Egypt sought to have UN Security Council approval for the force to legalise the move in the eyes of the international community, but the US and Israel dropped it from the draft plan.
“The Israelis don’t want UN involvement in any matter related to Palestine,” Middle East Eye quoted a source as ­saying.
A Turkish source familiar with Ankara’s position said Turkey is considering deploying troops in Gaza, depending on variables such as the structure and leadership of the force.
However, those familiar with Israeli thinking say Netanyahu would oppose any Turkish participation in such a mission, which is exactly why Hamas may insist on Turkish involvement.
Pressure on Hamas
Despite dissatisfaction with several elements, officials from Turkey, Qatar and Egypt convened quickly in Doha on Tuesday to encourage Hamas to give a positive response to Trump’s proposal.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told the media over the weekend that while the US was tasked with persuading Israel to accept the plan, Turkey and other regional players would focus on convincing the Palestinians.
“Hamas leaders were briefed on its terms immediately after the official announcement, with an emphasis that this was the last opportunity to end the war and ease the suffering of the Palestinian people,” Middle East Eye quoted a source as saying.
However, Hamas officials still want amendments to clauses in President Trump’s peace plan including on disarmament, a Palestinian source close to the group’s leadership told AFP on Wednesday.
In their discussions in Doha, the group said it needed “two or three days at most” to respond.
Hamas wants to amend some of the clauses such as the one on disarmament and the expulsion of Hamas and faction cadres, the source said.
Its leaders also want “international guarantees for a full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip” and guarantees that no assassinations attempts will be made inside or outside the territory.

• Kaira calls BISP ‘transparent aid method’, asks CM not to peddle ‘narrow nationalism’
• Azma hits back, says PPP cannot ‘steady itself’ by targeting PML-N
LAHORE: As PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row sparked by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s recent outburst against the coalition partner, the former has asked the Punjab CM to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights and Sindh’s ruling party.
During the meeting between Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Law Minister Azam Nazir, Senator Rana Sanaullah and PPP’s Navid Qamar and Ijaz Jakhrani at the NA speaker’s office, it was agreed that the matter would be taken up with PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam Nawaz.
The war of words, which began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River, as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself. In response, the PPP lawmakers stayed away from the National Assembly and Senate sittings to protest the diatribe.
Addressing a press conference, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira urged the CM not to fan ‘narrow nationalism’.
“Differences should be kept within limits. You (Maryam Nawaz) are a woman and our sister, and our leader (Benazir Bhutto) too was a woman. Reconsider your tone.  What do you want to achieve by playing narrow nationalism… Do you want the rest to leave Punjab, and their rights to be ended?”
Flanked by Usman Malik, Chaudhry Aslam Gill, and Faisal Mir, Mr Kaira said the country could not be run by a “single leader or institution”. “This country does not belong to any one person; it belongs to all of us. You (Maryam Nawaz) are not just a CM, you are also the daughter of Nawaz Sharif and the niece of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. If you say that you will not allow anyone to speak, this approach is not appropriate in any way. Reconsider this attitude,” he said.
He further said the floods had caused immense damage, and the entire nation spoke with one voice on this. “Where something is wrong, we will point it out and we will protest. But when we give opinions or criticism, you start threatening. The question concerns flood management, but the response is to target the Sindh government,” he said.
The PPP leader said BISP was even endorsed by the IMF. “It…provides immediate relief, and this was done before as well. If you don’t want to use BISP, fine; but in terms of transparency, BISP stands first, which is why the IMF itself directed that Rs200bn be added to it in this year’s budget. Our objections concern the relief mechanism,” he added.
 
 

In response to the CM’s remarks about the canal project, he said there already existed a formula for water distribution, and the matter must be decided in the Council of Common Interests by the federal and provincial governments together. “The PPP has been unfairly blamed regarding canals.”
PPP South Punjab President Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood said if the Punjab government was criticised, it was because of its failed policies that left the Seraiki belt submerged after floods. “Even in the past, there have been worse floods, yet never before were the people abandoned in such a helpless state,” he said, calling out the government for its ‘choreographed’ response.
Azma’s presser
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said the PPP leaders were competing to hold press conferences against the Punjab government while claiming they were not politicising the plight of flood victims.
Azma Bokhari further said that the PML-N took pride in “its popularity and public service”, and the PPP should focus on building its own support instead of such rhetoric. “Such statements make no difference, and PPP cannot stand on its own feet this way,” she added.
She said this was not merely political differences but a deliberate attempt to target Punjab collectively. “Personal attacks will naturally invite a response. “You may use BISP in Sindh; we have no objection,” she said.
