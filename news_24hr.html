The investment builds on top of Amazon’s prior investments for the creation of an operations network to deliver to all serviceable PIN-codes in the country, it added.
In June 2023, the e-commerce major — which competes with Walmart’s Flipkart and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Retail in India — had said it will take its investments in the country to $26 billion by 2030, without providing a breakdown.
The new investment will be used to launch new sites and upgrade existing facilities across its fulfilment and delivery network, improving speed and processing capacity, it said.
Additionally, Amazon plans to use technology to alert delivery associates about unsafe speeds and ensure equitable distribution of delivery routes.
Some of the funds will also be used to expand initiatives to improve the health and financial well-being of its employees, the company said.
In March, India’s information technology ministry said Amazon’s cloud services provider, Amazon Web Services, will invest about $8.2bn in the country.</p><small>2025-06-19 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/191603274139012.jpg?r=160333' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918159/sc-constitutional-bench-dismisses-pleas-against-transfer-of-ihc-judges' target='_blank'><strong>SC Constitutional Bench dismisses pleas against transfer of IHC judges</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on Thursday announced its verdict in a case pertaining to the seniority and transfer of Islamabad High Court (IHC) jud­ges, declaring that their transfers were not unconstitutional.
The bench — headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and comprising Justices Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Salahuddin Panhwar and Shakeel Ahmed — took up petitions filed by five IHC judges, the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) and the IHC Bar Association, among others.
In February, Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar from the Lahore High Court (LHC), Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court (SHC) and Justice Muham­mad Asif from the Balochistan High Court (BHC) were transferred to the IHC.
The controversy centres around the alteration of the judges’ seniority list after these transfers as Justice Dogar was made the senior puisne judge, which paved the way for his appointment as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq’s elevation to the SC.
Today’s judgement was announced in a 3-2 majority ruling, with Justices Afghan and Ahmed dissenting.
In the short order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the SC noted that “the transfer of a judge by the president of Pakistan by means of Article 200 of the Constitution (permanently or temporarily) cannot be construed as a fresh appointment.”
 
 

The order explained that exercise of powers of transfer by the president under Article 200 of the Constitution was not unregulated or unfettered.
Rather, it was structured on a “four tier formula which expounds that no judge shall be transferred except with his consent and after consultation by the president with the chief justice of Pakistan and the chief justices of both high courts”.
The short order emphasised that before exercising the power of transfer, certain inbuilt procedures and mechanisms had to be followed and the decision was “within the sphere and realm of judiciary and not within the domain of executives”.
The short order added: “Thus, for all intents and purposes, the transfer of judges by the president of Pakistan (…) is within the framework of the Constitution and cannot be
declared ultra vires.”
The judges further noted that the terms and conditions of transfer, including seniority, should have been taken up and mentioned by the president at the time of issuing the notification of transfer in terms of Article 200 of the Constitution.
The judges also said that they partially remanded the matter to the president, “without upsetting the notification of transfer to determine the seniority after examining/vetting the service record of the transferee judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether the transfer is on a permanent or temporary basis”.
The order concluded that the seniority and transfer of judges was determined by the president by means of a notification/order and that Justice Dogar would continue in his role as acting chief justice of the IHC till the seniority and nature of posting —
permanent or temporary — of the transferred judges were determined by the president by means of notification/order.
Dissenting order
In the dissenting order, authored by Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, he said that the judges accepted the constitutional petitions.
The order declared the impugned notification regarding the transfer of concerned judges as “null, void and of no legal effect”.
Justice Afghan said, “The permanent transfer of three Judges to IHC has been made
by the president in wrong exercise of discretion under Clause (1) of Article 200 of the Constitution.”
He added: “It has offended Article 175A of the Constitution and has made the same redundant.”
The order also stated that the permanent transfer process of three Judges to the IHC was under the “concealment of relevant and material facts from the transferee Judges”, adding that it was also “lacking meaningful, purposive and consensus-oriented consultation” with the chief Justices of the apex and high courts.
It further said that “the process for permanent transfer of three Judges to IHC has
been completed in an unnecessary haste.”
According to the judges, the proportionate representation of provinces in IHC could have been achieved by “making fresh appointments of judges from the provinces by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan under Article 175A of the Constitution”.
The dissenting note added: “It [notification] is violative of Article 2A, Article 4 and Article 25 of the Constitution and it has undermined the independence of judiciary, due process and principle of equality.”</p><small>2025-06-19 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609968-pmd-forecasts-pre-monsoon-rains-across-country-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>PMD forecasts pre-monsoon rains across country from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>

“The recorder sustained heavy external damage from post-crash fire making it impossible to extract data in India,” the ET report said, citing people aware of the development.
India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
Indian authorities are investigating the crash of an Air India Boeing Dreamliner, which last week killed 241 people on board and at least 30 on ground, marking the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
The black box consists of two components — the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR). It provides crucial insights for crash investigators, including altitude and airspeed data and pilot conversation records that help determine probable causes of crashes.
Data from the flight data recorder will be extracted at the Washington-based laboratory of the National Transportation Safety Board and shared with AAIB, the ET report added, citing sources.
Meanwhile, the airline said its plane was “well-maintained” before it crashed a week ago.
As investigators attempt to retrieve data from the plane’s black boxes, the airline said that no problems were detected with the jet before the disaster.
“The plane was well-maintained, with its last major check in June 2023,” Air India said in a statement.
“Its right engine was overhauled in March 2025, and the left engine was inspected in April 2025. Both the aircraft and engines were regularly monitored, showing no issues before the flight,” the airline said.
Initial checks since the crash on Air India’s Dreamliners “did not reveal any major safety concerns”, the country’s civil aviation regulator said on Tuesday.
Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese and a Canadian on board the flight, as well as 12 crew members. The airline said the pilots were accomplished flyers.
“The flight was led by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, a highly experienced pilot and trainer with over 10,000 hours flying widebody aircraft,” it said. “First Officer Clive Kunder, had over 3,400 hours of flying experience.”
While investigators try to piece together what went wrong, families of dozens of victims are still waiting for their loved ones to be identified.
As of Thursday, 210 victims have been identified through DNA testing, state health minister Rushikesh Patel said.</p><small>2025-06-19 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19160859fef7057.jpg?r=162807' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918162/returning-relieved-pakistanis-recall-horrifying-nights-as-israel-iran-trade-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Returning relieved Pakistanis recall ‘horrifying nights’ as Israel, Iran trade strikes</strong></a><br><p>Mohammad Hassan anxiously returned to Pakistan from Iran this week after witnessing drones, missiles and explosions tear through Tehran’s sky during what he called long, “horrifying nights”.
The 35-year-old University of Tehran student is one of about 3,000 Pakistanis who, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have returned home since Israel launched its aerial war against its long-time enemy last week.
Governments around the world are scrambling to evacuate their nationals caught up in the rapidly spiralling conflict as Israel and Iran trade missile and drone strikes.
“I was in the city centre where most of the strikes took place and even one of the student dormitories was attacked and luckily no one was dead, but students were injured,” Hassan said.

There are more than 500 Pakistani students at his university alone, he said, all of them on their way “back home”.
“Those days and nights were very horrifying … hearing sirens, the wailing, the danger of being hit by missiles. As one peeped out the window in the night, you could see drones, missiles with fire tails,” he told AFP.
Ghost town
Pakistan and Iran have a shaky diplomatic relationship. Last year, Pakistan launched strikes in retaliation against targets within Iranian territory, after Tehran said it struck the bases of another group within Pakistani territory. However, officials from both countries soon engaged in conciliatory overtures, signalling a mutual interest in de-escalating.
Despite the back and forth, there has been no suspension of trade, tourism and academic ties from either side.
Iranian consulates across Pakistan have stepped up efforts to promote their universities.
Between 25 million and 35m Shia Muslims also hope to make at least one pilgrimage in their lifetime to holy sites in Iran, foremost among them the sacred city of Qom.

Mohammad Khalil, a 41 year old petroleum engineer, left Tehran three days ago, the capital of the Islamic Republic, looking like a ghost town as residents sheltered indoors and families fled.
“In the last two days, I saw people moving out of the city in different vehicles with necessary commodities,” Khalil said.
Abdul Ghani Khan sells medical equipment in his hometown of Peshawar in northwest Pakistan and travels to Iran regularly for supplies.
He had been in Tehran for a week when the first Israeli missiles fell on Friday. Iran and Israel have traded heavy missile fire in the days since, raising fears of a wider regional conflict.
Pakistan is in a difficult position as the only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons. It, like Iran, does not recognise Israel but is also a major ally of the United States.
Khan had to make the journey home by road because the airspace is now closed. Pakistan has also shut its border crossings with Iran to all except Pakistanis wanting to return home.
“We saw drones, red lights of anti-aircraft guns and I spotted one building catch fire,” Khan said.
‘Offering prayer’
Mohammad Asif, a lawyer from Lahore, heard about the air strikes while on a pilgrimage in Qom.
He wasn’t initially afraid and continued his pilgrimage to Mashhad in Iran’s northeast, home to the golden-domed Imam Reza shrine.
That was until Israeli strikes hit the airport in Mashhad, nearly 1,000 kilometres from the Pakistan border.
Samreen Ali was also in Mashhad but, like Asif, cut her trip short and returned with her husband and 15-year-old son.

She was praying in a mosque in Mashhad when Israel struck the city.
Ali said she had visited Iran nine times before on pilgrimages and never imagined witnessing war there.
“I was offering prayer when I heard two explosions,” she told AFP.
She then noticed she wasn’t receiving messages on her phone and assumed that “communication was being restricted … because of the war”.

Syed Saqib, 46, was in Qom and had to travel 500km by bus southeast to Yazd.
“We had to take alternative routes, spend an entire night waiting at a bus terminal,” Saqib said.
They then boarded buses to Zahedan, a city near the border with Balochistan. A relieved Saqib recalled crossing the border at Taftan, surrounded by families carrying heavy luggage.</p><small>2025-06-19 11:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19162900741018b.jpg?r=163021' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918168/greenpeace-warns-of-potential-disaster-after-oil-spill-off-uae' target='_blank'><strong>Greenpeace warns of ‘potential disaster’ after oil spill off UAE</strong></a><br><p>Greenpeace on Thursday warned that an oil spill resulting from a tanker collision off the coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) could have grave environmental consequences, after authorities reported a “small” slick.
On Tuesday, the Emirati coastguard said it rescued 24 crew members of the Adalynn oil tanker after it collided with the Front Eagle vessel in the Gulf of Oman, off the coast of the Khor Fakan area of the UAE.
“Greenpeace Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has warned of a potential environmental disaster after two crude oil tankers collided,” the group said in a statement.
The environmental campaign group said satellite imagery indicated a “large plume of oil stretching up to around 1,500 hectares from the site of the crash”.
 






The group said the Adalynn was part of a Russian “shadow fleet”, which it described as “a collection of partially obsolete tankers that operate below basic security standards and carry Russian oil”.
Security analysts say Russia uses the fleet of ageing vessels to circumvent international sanctions that ban it from selling oil.
Greenpeace stated that the Adalynn could be carrying approximately 70,000 tonnes of crude oil, despite being officially listed in ballast condition, and therefore should not have been carrying cargo.
The Front Eagle is owned by the shipping company Frontline.
Farah Al Hattab of Greenpeace urged authorities to “act swiftly to contain the spill and assess its ecological impact”.
“Oil spills endanger marine life, disrupt delicate ecological balances and possibly the entire food web, and carry the potential to spark widespread environmental damage,” she said.
On Wednesday, the Emirati Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure said the accident was “caused by a navigational misjudgment by one of the vessels”.
The accident caused “minor surface damage to the outer hulls of both ships, a small oil spill, and a fire that broke out in the fuel tank of one of the ships”, according to the statement.
The incident took place close to the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a waterway between the Arabian Peninsula and Iran that carries one-fifth of global oil output.</p><small>2025-06-19 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19160418afe8b85.jpg?r=160435' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918149/karachi-reports-second-congo-fever-related-death-this-year' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi reports second Congo fever-related death this year</strong></a><br><p>Another patient died of Congo fever on Thursday in Karachi, as the number of fatalities from the disease reached two this year in Sindh, a statement from the district health officer in Malir said.
Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), commonly known as Congo Virus, causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent, according to the World Health Organisation. There is no vaccine available for the disease.
Per experts, the CCHF virus is primarily transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. In April, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued an advisory urging the prevention of Congo fever ahead of Eidul Azha.
A 25-year-old man, Zubair, a fisherman from Ibrahim Hyderi, passed away on Thursday morning, a day after the disease was confirmed, said a report by DHO Malir Dr Imdad Ali Chandio.
The victim butchered animals continuously for two days on June 7-8 during Eid. On June 13, he developed high fever with headache and myalgia and went to a hospital in Ibrahim Hyderi but was discharged the same day. After his condition worsened, he went to the Creek General Hospital but was not admitted due to the unavailability of beds.
On June 16, he went to the emergency ward of the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), where he was diagnosed as a ‘suspected’ case of CCHF and was admitted. The patient’s health deteriorated the next day and he was referred to medical ICU.
Due to the unavailability of bed, he was referred to the Sindh Infectious Disease Hospital & Research Centre (SIDH) where he was placed on ventilator support. The patient passed away on Thursday morning.
The report said the victim visited the cattle market on Eid and butchered animals for two days as an occasional butcher without safety precautions. The lab result confirmed the prevalence of CCHF on June 18.
DHO Malir said a team was sent to the area and a detailed medical history was taken from his brother and other family members. He said the family members were safe with no symptoms of Congo fever, while other people he was in contact with are being identified.
Amid the rising cases of Congo fever, the provincial health authorities have set up a daily alert system against 35 diseases in the district.
The Provincial Disease Surveillance and Response Unit (PD SRU) at Directorate General Health Services Sindh said the system is collecting daily case based data from districts across the province to identify unusual increase in cases and timely interventions. It advised the health officers in Malir district to investigate an alert and submit a report within a day.
Sindh reported its first death of the year from Congo fever a day earlier, saying a 42-year-old man passed away in Karachi, as per a statement from the provincial health ministry’s media coordinator.
The deceased, a resident of District Malir, was admitted to the Indus Hospital in Korangi, where he tested positive for CCHF on June 16, said media coordinator for the Sindh health ministry, Meeran Yousuf. The patient passed away the next day. A team of health experts visited his residence but found the door locked.
3 die from Congo virus in KP
Meanwhile, the disease killed three people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the province’s Health Adviser Ehtesham Ali confirmed in a statement, raising concerns over public health safety during the Eid holidays.
Ali said two of the fatalities occurred last night (Wednesday) at the Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), where the patient succumbed to the virus.
KP health department spokesperson Attaullah Khan said three cases of suspected CCHF were brought to the HMC. Naik Shad of South Waziristan was brought dead to the hospital on Tuesday, while Aizaz, 28, and Shafiullah, 70, both residents of Karak, passed away last night.
Expressing sorrow over the loss of lives, the health adviser attributed the deaths to negligence and lack of precaution during Eid celebrations. “These lives could have been saved with timely care and awareness,” he said, urging the public to remain vigilant and strictly follow preventive measures.
He added that the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response System (IDSRS), operating under the Public Health department, is actively responding to the outbreak and monitoring the situation closely.
The district health officers of affected areas have been notified, and contact tracing and sanitisation activities have commenced at the homes of the deceased victims to prevent further transmission, he added. The health department appealed to cooperate with authorities and prioritise hygiene and safety during the ongoing high-risk period.</p><small>2025-06-19 10:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19104948a85a031.jpg?r=105046' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917670/hoping-against-the-odds-israel-iran-war-puts-pakistani-zaireen-in-a-tough-spot' target='_blank'><strong>Hoping against the odds: Israel-Iran war puts Pakistani zaireen in a tough spot</strong></a><br><p>Syed Baqir Ali Jafferi, 61, waited a decade. He had decided that 2025 would be the year he would do it; his younger brother’s sudden demise had further compelled him. His visa had arrived, and the bookings were complete. But then Israel attacked Iran.
Jafferi, a resident of Karachi, like many others, was to embark on a pilgrimage to Iraq in Muharram, beginning June 27. The journey holds a deep spiritual place in the hearts of Shias across the world. In fact, Karbala hosts the largest gathering in the world on Ashura (Muharram 10) and Arbaeen (Safar 20).
From Pakistan, a majority of pilgrims take the land route to Karbala via Iran, which is also home to key Shia religious sites in Mashhad and Qom. Others take the plane. Jafferi was among the latter.
“All of his preparations were complete and only the tickets were to be booked, which he had planned to do on the first day of Muharram,” his niece told Dawn.com. “He was seeing this as his final trip because he can’t travel a lot due to old age.”
Unfortunately, Jafferi couldn’t get his tickets. Last week, major airlines suspended flight operations to Iran, Iraq and Syria either indefinitely or until the end of June.

Airlines that have suspended flights to the Middle East:

Fly Dubai suspended flights to Iraq and Iran until June 20
Emirates has also suspended flights to Iraq (Basra and Baghdad) and Iran (Tehran) until June 30
Qatar Airways suspended operations to Iran, Iraq, and Syria until further notice. Flights to Iran’s Tehran, Mashhad, and Shiraz have been halted, as well as to Iraq’s Baghdad, Basra, Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Najaf, and Syria’s Damascus


The development came after Israel launched a wide-scale attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and civilian infrastructure, killing top commanders, scientists, and civilians. It claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which the latter has consistently denied. A day later, Iran responded with hundreds of ballistic missiles in what it said was the “beginning of a crushing response to the Zionist regime”.
The two countries have since continued to target each other, with the war now entering its seventh day. While Iran and Israel remain at odds, pilgrims in Pakistan find themselves in an uncertain position, their hopes of visiting the holy land hanging by a thread.
Fear, confusion, uncertainty
Raza Zaidi had planned to celebrate Eid al-Ghadeer, a Shia religious event, in Najaf along with his mother and aunt. If all had been well, he would have been in Iraq by Saturday on his maiden trip. All arrangement — payments, visas and hotel bookings — had been finalised.
“But on Friday afternoon, I found out that FlyDubai, our carrier, had cancelled all flights operating within the airspace of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Jordan and Israel,” he said. “My mother and aunt are very disheartened because Eid al-Ghadeer was the only event they hadn’t celebrated in Karbala and were really looking forward to it.”

Currently, Raza continued, everything is hanging in the air. But despite the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty, he hasn’t yet sought a refund from the tour company he was travelling with. “We want to go as soon as possible if the flights are operational.
“We draw a lot of spiritual motivation from Karbala and Najaf. If the airspace had not closed, we would have been there despite the war,” he added.
While Raza’s travel plans directly clashed with the war, the current situation has also put the travel itineraries of those wanting to spend Muharram in Iraq in limbo, particularly those travelling via road, as Pakistan had earlier announced the closure of its border with Iran.
In a post on X on Wednesday night, however, the Foreign Office said: “This [is] to clarify that contrary to some media reports, all border crossings along the Pakistan-Iran border remain fully operational.”
 






For those travelling via road, the threat is higher because they have to make at least a two-night stop in Iran to get to Iraq, explained Moosa Raza, director of Al Haramain Travel Agency. He added that his company had received a record number of Ziarat bookings this year from across the country, for both the land and air routes. “All of them are now hanging in the middle … confused and scared.”

Fatima Sohail, a teacher based in Karachi, had been planning her trip to Iraq for over a year now. With Muharram falling during summer holidays, it was easier for her to take 10-12 days off from work.
“I visited Karbala some years ago, and it was such a fulfilling experience … I had decided then to come back. This time, I wanted to spend the first 10 days of Muharram there,” she said. Belonging to the Bohra community, Fatima’s trip was organised by Fayz-e-Husayni, a service established to cater travel needs of the community members performing Hajj, Umrah or Ziarat.
But she recently received a message from them regarding the current situation, stating that the Iraqi government had advised against travel to the country until further notice. “So we are waiting now because the airspace is shut, but chances are that the trip will get cancelled,” she sighed.
While Fatima acknowledged that there was uncertainty and the circumstances were not under anyone’s control, a flicker of hope is still alive in her. “If it is written, it will happen no matter what,” she said.
Dara Baig, also based in Karachi, who was set to fly to Iraq between the third and fourth of Muharram, concurred. Under the current scenario, he is sceptical if the trip would materialise.
“We don’t care about the war … if the airspace opens, we will be the first ones to reach the airport,” he told Dawn.com. “This is the essence of Ziarat — even when there is a fear of life, don’t quit.”
The evacuations
Both Baig and Raza also said that their relatives, who were in Iraq for the commemoration of Youm-i-Arafah, were stuck since the war broke out.
Mustafa*, who travelled to Iraq for the event, was among those who are stuck in Karbala and Najaf. He was to fly out on June 13, the same day the Israel-Iran war broke out. “But our flights were cancelled and the airspace was subsequently closed,” he said.
Unlike most who make the trip through tour operators, he managed the trip all by himself, and so he had cash to sustain himself for some days. “But people who have come along with tour groups are rapidly running low on cash … even the companies’ budgets are running out,” Mustafa told Dawn.com over the phone.
He further said that recently, Baghdad’s national flag carrier, Iraq Airways, had begun running emergency flights to Pakistan, but from Basra Airport, which is a seven-hour drive from Najaf and Karbala, where most pilgrims were staying. “On top of that, as per Iraqi policy, Pakistanis have to submit their passports at the airport upon arrival, which are later returned at the time of departure.
“We are in touch with the embassy for the issuance of passports, but it hasn’t been of much help so far,” he lamented.
Mustafa warned that further delay in evacuating the pilgrims could worsen the situation. “People are running out of medicines, food and don’t have money for accommodation. The government needs to immediately act.”
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, approximately 5,000 zaireen [pilgrims] from Pakistan are currently stranded in Iran and Iraq. In a statement on June 16, it said Iraqi Airways was operating daily flights on the Basra–Dubai route. “Those interested in travelling via this route are encouraged to contact the nearest Iraqi Airways office for booking and assistance.”
It said that the Pakistani embassy was assisting with the evacuations and was in touch with Iraqi authorities. Separately, it advised others to reconsider their travel plans to Tehran and Baghdad. In the past few days, over 1,000 pilgrims and students have returned from Iraq and Iran via the Taftan border.

Separately, on Tuesday, the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) operated its first relief flight to bring back pilgrims stuck in Iraq. PIA spokesperson Abdullah Khan told Dawn.com that the plane flew from Peshawar and boarded zaireen in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. They were brought there from Iran and Iraq via road.
“We cannot run any flights to Iran, Iraq, Israel, Syria or Jordan as the entire region has been declared a war zone,” he said.
Khan said that Tuesday’s flight brought back more than 150 passengers, whose list was provided to the carrier by the Pakistani embassy — also known as the ‘manifest’ document. He added that the PIA was in close contact with the MOFA regarding the evacuations.
Journey back home
Muhammad Ali Raza was among the 1,000 pilgrims and students who returned to Pakistan via the Taftan border earlier this week. He had been in Tehran since 2019, where he was completing a PhD in economics. When Israel attacked Iran on Friday, he was at his hostel, where he heard bombs that seemed to have fallen right outside his window.
“The bombardment continued from 9pm to 5am.”

Ali described the next few days, after Iran launched its response, as the most traumatic of his life, recalling how his professors and colleagues were injured in the Israeli strikes. “Initially, we thought the matter would diffuse but by Monday, it was clear that a full-fledged war had broken out,” he told Dawn.com.
That is when he and his friends decided to reach out to the Pakistani embassy in Tehran. “We got a positive response, and on Sunday (June 15), I left for Taftan in a bus arranged by them … ironically, that was also the day I was the most scared for my life because Israel targeted public places, hostels and parks.
“We just had a 1.5-hour window to leave because after that, there was not a single road that hadn’t caved in due to strikes.”
For the next 24 hours, Ali was on the road, en route Zahedan, from where he would cross the Pakistani border. “We reached Taftan on Tuesday, where the border authorities provided us with chicken biryani for lunch along with tea,” he said.
“We will now move to our homes in Punjab from here,” the PhD student added.
Ali further stated that most of his Pakistani classmates had been evacuated from Tehran, adding that while they were happy to be back to the safety of home, they were waiting for the war to come to an end so that they could go back to what they call their second home.

Gen Munir met with Trump at the White House yesterday, becoming the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.
The high-level engagement was scheduled at the Cabinet Room over luncheon, followed by a visit to the Oval Office.
Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio and Special Representative for Middle Eastern Affairs Steve Witkoff were present during the meeting from the US side, while National Security Advisor Lt Gen Muhammad Asim Malik — also the intelligence chief — accompanied the COAS.
“Although initially scheduled for one hour, the meeting extended for over two hours, underscoring the depth and cordiality of the dialogue,” the ISPR said in a press release.
During the meeting, Trump “lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counterterrorism cooperation between the two states”, the statement said.
It noted that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continued collaboration in the field of counterterrorism.
 
 

“Discussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains, including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies,” the ISPR stated.
“President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,” it highlighted.
The US president also commended Field Marshal Munir’s “leadership and decisiveness during a period of complex regional dynamics”.
The army chief extended an invitation to Trump, on behalf of the government, to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date, the ISPR said, calling it a “gesture reflecting the warmth of bilateral ties”.
On his part, COAS Munir conveyed the deep appreciation of the government and people of Pakistan for Trump’s “constructive and result-oriented role in facilitating a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in the recent regional crisis”.
He “acknowledged President Trump’s statesmanship and his ability to comprehend and address the multifaceted challenges faced by the global community”, the ISPR press release said.
“A detailed exchange of views also took place on the prevailing tensions between Iran and Israel, with both leaders emphasising the importance of resolution of the conflict,” it added, referring to the ongoing missile exchange between the two regional arch foes that marks a week today.
The military noted that the engagement “marks a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to reinforce the longstanding partnership between Pakistan and the United States, built upon shared objectives of peace, stability, and prosperity”.
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the meeting a “milestone in Pak-US ties” and a “success of the current hybrid model of governance”.
“This is the most important turning point in the 78-year history of relations. The way international and regional issues were discussed in this meeting highlighted the importance of the beloved homeland,” Asif said on X.
He added that Pakistan’s abilities to help resolve issues were acknowledged, along with the Pak-India conflict being shed light on again.
“The revival of the economy, the defeat of India, the glorious and highly successful improvement in relations with the US — all these revolutionary changes were possible with the cooperation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir and the excellent relations between Islamabad and Rawalpindi.”
 






Trump ‘honoured’ to meet army chief
When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media, Trump said, “I was honoured to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.
“He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM [Narendra] Modi as well, who just left a few days ago,” he added.
“We’re working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.”

Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel conflict, Trump said: “They (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they’re not happy about anything. It’s not that they’re bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.”
Questioned by reporters about the meeting prior to it, Trump remarked, “This man (Gen Munir) was extremely influential in stopping it (India-Pakistan fighting) from the Pakistan side.”
White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for preventing a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, Reuters reported.
But insiders suggested that the meeting was not arranged through routine diplomatic channels, but rather was the outcome of “unorthodox efforts” by a group of advisers, businessmen, and other influential figures.
Diplomatic sources in Washington said this initiative had been cooking for months and kept under wraps until the White House released Trump’s official schedule on Tuesday.
Sources said that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation, engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, and targeted lobbying via Republican-aligned firms in Washington helped Pakistan secure the meeting.
Previous military rulers — such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf — met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.
Former president Barack Obama did briefly “walk in” on a White House meeting with then-COAS Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, but that too was not a formal engagement.</p><small>2025-06-19 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/19130800f8d5033.jpg?r=131145' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918124/homeland-insecurity-expelled-afghans-seek-swift-return-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Homeland insecurity: expelled Afghans seek swift return to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan says it has expelled more than a million Afghans in the past two years, yet many have quickly attempted to return — preferring to take their chances dodging the law than struggle for existence in a homeland some had never even seen before.
“Going back there would be sentencing my family to death,” said Hayatullah, a 46-year-old Afghan deported via the Torkham border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in early 2024.
Since April and a renewed deportation drive, some 200,000 Afghans have spilled over the two main border crossings from Pakistan, entering on trucks loaded with hastily packed belongings.
But they carry little hope of starting over in the impoverished country, where girls are banned from school after the primary level.
Hayatullah, a pseudonym, returned to Pakistan a month after being deported, travelling around 800 kilometres (500 miles) south to the Chaman border crossing in Balochistan, because for him, life in Afghanistan “had come to a standstill”.
 
 

He paid a bribe to cross the Chaman frontier, “like all the day labourers who regularly travel across the border to work on the other side”.
His wife and three children — including daughters, aged 16 and 18, who would be denied education in Afghanistan — had managed to avoid arrest and deportation.
Relative security
Hayatullah moved the family to Peshawar. “Compared to Islamabad, the police here don’t harass us as much,” he said.
Samad Khan, a 38-year-old Afghan who also spoke using a pseudonym, also chose to relocate his family to Peshawar.
Born in Lahore, he set foot in Afghanistan for the first time on April 22 — the day he was deported.
“We have no relatives in Afghanistan, and there’s no sign of life. There’s no work, no income, and the Taliban are extremely strict,” he said.
At first, he tried to find work in a country where 85 per cent of the population lives on less than one dollar a day, but after a few weeks, he instead found a way back to Pakistan.
“I paid Rs50,000 to an Afghan truck driver,” he said, using one of his Pakistani employees’ ID cards to cross the border.
He rushed back to Lahore to bundle his belongings and wife and two children — who had been left behind — into a vehicle, and moved to Peshawar.
“I started a second-hand shoe business with the support of a friend. The police here don’t harass us like they do in Lahore, and the overall environment is much better,” he told AFP.
‘Challenging’ reintegration
It’s hard to say how many Afghans have returned, as data is scarce.
Government sources claim that hundreds of thousands of Afghans are already back and settled in KP — figures that cannot be independently verified.
Migrant rights defenders in Pakistan say they’ve heard of such returns, but insist the numbers are limited.
The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) told AFP that “some Afghans who were returned have subsequently chosen to remigrate to Pakistan”.
“When individuals return to areas with limited access to basic services and livelihood opportunities, reintegration can be challenging,” said Avand Azeez Agha, communications officer for the UN agency in Kabul.
They might move on again, he said, “as people seek sustainable opportunities”.</p><small>2025-06-19 08:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609931-2500-civil-servants-hold-dual-nationalities-senate-informed' target='_blank'><strong>2,500 civil servants hold dual nationalities, Senate informed</strong></a><br><p>

The Starship 36 suffered “catastrophic failure and exploded” at the Starbase launch facility shortly after 11pm (9am PKT Thursday), a Facebook post by the Cameron County authorities said.
Musk’s SpaceX said the rocket was preparing for the tenth flight test when it “experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase”.
“A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for,” SpaceX added on social media.
“There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area while safing operations continue.”
 
 

Starbase, on the south Texas coast near the border with Mexico, is the headquarters for Musk’s space project.
Standing 123 metres tall, Starship is the world’s largest and most powerful rocket and central to Musk’s long-term vision of colonising Mars.
The latest setback follows an explosion of a prototype Starship over the Indian Ocean in late May.
The biggest and most powerful launch vehicle ever built had lifted off on May 27 from the Starbase facility, but the first-stage Super Heavy booster blew up instead of executing its planned splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.
The previous two outings also ended poorly, with the upper stage disintegrating over the Caribbean.</p><small>2025-06-19 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/191211389816b5d.jpg?r=121148' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1918040/budget-2025-26-senate-panel-seeks-to-ease-tax-rules-for-buying-property' target='_blank'><strong>Budget 2025-26: Senate panel seeks to ease tax rules for buying property</strong></a><br><p>• Proposes raising purchase limit for filers from 130pc to 400pc of declared wealth
• Tax approved on previously exempt luxury private clubs
• Proposed e-commerce tax rejected; tax on online academies approved
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee has recommended raising the threshold limit for purchases made by “eligible individuals” — a new term for people who file their tax returns — and approved a measure to tax luxury clubs nationwide.
The development came as the Senate and National Assembly Standing Com­mittees on Finance and Revenue held simultaneous sessions at Parliament House to conduct a clause-by-clause review of the Finance Bill 2025-26.
Chaired by Senator Saleem Man­dviwalla and MNA Naveed Qamar respectively, both panels proposed several amendments and rejected some measures outright.
The Senate standing committee expressed concern over the newly inserted clause in the Finance Bill, which restricts the “eligible person” from making any purchase exceeding 130 per cent of the wealth reflected in their last year’s wealth statement.
 






Senator Mohsin Aziz argued for increasing this limit, suggesting that filers with Rs10 million should be able to purchase property worth Rs50m. After discussion, the committee recommended raising the li­­m­­it to 400pc of the previous year’s wealth declaration, significantly ex­­panding purchase capacity for filers.
The Senate committee also approved a proposal to impose taxes on major private clubs across the country. In the Finance Bill 2025-26, income tax has been introduced on recreational clubs, which were previously exempted from tax.
State Minister for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani stated that the recreational clubs are liable to pay tax, where their income exceeds the expenditure and such steps have been taken to broaden the tax net of the country.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said that many elite clubs serve as luxury spaces for affluent individuals. He highlighted that these clubs have accumulated billions of rupees in their accounts while providing extravagant services.
“Some clubs hold land valued at millions of dollars, yet only a handful of individuals benefit from these lavish facilities,” he said.
The proposed taxation will target the profits generated by these high-end clubs, ensuring that they contribute to the national revenue system, he added.
 
 

The FBR chairman informed the committee that a monthly income of Rs100,000 would only incur a tax of Rs1,000, stressing that the burden was manageable.
Senator Mohsin Aziz, however, pressed for raising the exemption threshold to Rs1.2m per year, citing inflation, while Senator Shibli Faraz highlighted how currency depreciation has eroded the real value of money.
Discussing the proposed tax on e-commerce, the committee argued that any levy should apply to goods rather than services. Senator Anusha Rahman opposed the government’s move altogether, criticising her own party’s approach for targeting online businesses instead of traditional retailers. Consequen­tly, the committee rejected the tax on e-commerce.
However, the committee approved a tax on online educational institutions and academies, citing their substantial earnings. The FBR chairman said some academies generate up to Rs20m a month and stressed that teachers earning through online platforms must pay taxes.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb also highlighted the newly introduced mortgage facility, stating that mortgages will be available for houses up to 2,000 square feet, and the individuals will also be eligible for tax credit not exceeding 30pc of their total income.
 
 

Commenting on the FBR’s new condition of disallowing 10pc expen­diture for purchases from unregistered suppliers, the Senate committee warned that this could stifle competition, as the number of registered suppliers remains low across the country.
Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul briefed the National Assembly’s standing committee on the new Five-Year Tariff Policy (2025-30), which proposes reducing customs duties and additional duties over five years, with an estimated revenue impact of Rs500 billion.
Mr Aurangzeb noted that the government had previously increased duties to manage its balance of payments crisis and curb imports, which also boosted revenue collection. However, even after the crisis stabilised, duties were not reduced, prompting a need for structural reforms.

The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and UK authorities had suspended permission for PIA to operate in the region in June 2020 after Pakistan began investigating the validity of pilots’ licences following a deadly plane crash in Karachi that killed 97 people.
Following the ban lift on PIA by the EASA in November last year, the national flag carrier had resumed Islamabad-Paris flights early this year. “We can operate for any destination in Europe now (except the UK) after the lifting of ban by the EASA. However, it depends upon traffic on specific routes in Europe,” a senior official of PIA told Dawn on Wednesday.
He said the PIA was also hopeful that its operation for the UK would resume in a couple of months as well. “Talks with the UK authorities concerned are underway and hopefully the PIA will be operating flights there in a couple of months,” he said.

Airline hopeful of resumption of UK operation in a couple of months

On Wednesday, the first weekly flight PK-733 departed from Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport for Paris, France, with 276 passengers on board.
The PIA has been operating two weekly flights from Islamabad to Paris since January this year.
“A Boeing 777 aircraft was deployed for this route, featuring a newly refurbished cabin interior designed to enhance passenger comfort,” a PIA spokesperson said and added that to mark the occasion, a ceremony was held at Allama Iqbal International Airport.
Passengers were seen off by PIA’s Chief Executive Officer Air Vice Marshal Aamir Hayat, Chief Operating Officer Khurram Mushtaq, Head of Mission of the French Embassy Franck Aubry, and other senior officials of the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA).
“This flight will further boost aviation, tourism, trade and people-to-people exchanges between the two countries,” he said.
Mr Aubry expressed hope for deeper ties between Pakistan and France through this new air link.
On resumption of the Islamabad-Paris flight in January last, the national flag carrier faced criticism for an advertisement featuring one of their planes flying towards the Eiffel Tower, with many finding the image “insensitive and reminiscent of the 9/11 attacks”.
The ad showing [posted on social media by PIA] a Boeing 777 flying towards the Eiffel Tower with the caption “Paris, we’re coming today” even drew ire of the government functionaries. It was deemed a “stupidity” by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar. The PIA subsequently issued an apology, stating the intention was not to offend or cause alarm.

The first ship went down on June 12 near a Libyan port in Tripoli, with 21 people, including women and children, reported missing and only five survivors found, the IOM said in a statement on Tuesday.
Those lost at sea included Eritrean, Pakistani, Egyptian and Sudanese nationals. The second wreck took place about 35 kilometres off the port city of Tobruk, with the sole survivor reporting 39 people lost at sea, according to the UN body.
 
 

“With dozens feared dead and entire families left in anguish, IOM is once again urging the international community to scale up search and rescue operations and guarantee safe, predictable disembarkation for survivors,” said Othman Belbeisi, the IOM’s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa.
According to the statement, at least 743 people have died so far this year trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. The deadly route, it said, is  “marked by increasingly dangerous smuggling practices, limited rescue capacity and growing restrictions on humanitarian operations”.
As of June 15, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, migrant landings on the Italian coast were up 15 per cent year on year, with most originating in Libya.
Mediterranean rescue
Maritime rescue organisations said on Wednesday they had pulled more than 175,000  people from the Mediterranean over the past 10 years, as waves of  migrants sought to use the dangerous sea route to reach Europe. The group of 21 NGOS active in the region estimated that at least 28,932  people had died while trying to cross the sea since 2015.
The majority had died in the central Mediterranean — waters between Libya, Tunisia, Italy and Malta — Mirka Schaefer of German NGO SOS  Humanity told a Berlin press conference. In that area, the equivalent of five adults and one child lost their lives every day over the past decade, she said. The number of unrecorded cases was likely to be “significantly higher”, she added.
Of the 21 organisations currently engaged in maritime rescue in the region, 10 of them are based in Germany. Between them, the groups operate 15 boats, four sail ships and four planes. The organisations have frequently clashed with authorities over their rescue operations, which were launched as Europe’s migration crisis broke out in 2015, when hundreds of thousands headed to the continent, mostly from the Middle  East.
In Italy, the current government has vowed to end crossings and attacked NGOs for creating a  “pull factor” that encourages departures, something migration observers say is unproven. Giorgia  Meloni’s hard-right government has passed laws requiring rescue ships to return to a designated port, a measure NGOs say is contrary to maritime law.
“The pressure on us is growing,” Schaefer said, criticising a lack of support from the German government.

Luckily, no one was hurt in the incident. The responsibility of the terror act was claimed reportedly by the banned Baloch Repu­blican Guards (BRG)  through a statement, which started circulating on social media soon after the blast.
Witnesses said that the bomb ripped through the train, when it was en route to Quetta, leading to shouts and cries of passengers. The blast caused floor of a bogie to crumble to pieces, left a three to four foot crater at the site and damaged 20-30 feet of the rail track, said officials. 
Jacobabad SSP Saddam Hussain Khaskheli, accompanied by officials of police and Pakistan Railway, reached the site and gathered details of the incident. The Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) officials had begun probe to determine the type of the bomb and the amount of explosive material used in the blast, he said.
He said that arrangements had been made to provide food to the train passengers and transport them to their respective destinations, ensuring that no passenger faced any inconvenience.
The BDS officials confirmed that five to six kilogram of explosive material was used in the bomb, which was detonated via a remotely controlled device.
Meanwhile, the PR officials arranged several coaches and vans to take all the train passengers to their respective destinations.
BRG claim responsibility 
The banned Baloch Republican Guards claimed responsibility for the terrorist act to blow up the Jaffer Express with a remotely-controlled bomb. The claim was made through a statement purportedly linked to the outfit that stated circulating on social media immediately after the blast. 
Local sources said that no case had been registered at any police station so far regarding the bomb attack on the train nor any arrest had been made.
Condemnation, call for action
Sindh Minister for Home Ziaul Hassan Lanjar sought reports from Larkana DIG and Jacobabad SSP on the terror incident and asked them to take immediate action against the culprits involved in the blast.
Local PPP MNA Mir Aijaz Hussain Jakhrani, MPA Sher Muhammad Mugheri and chairman of Jacobabad District Council Mir Tahir Hussain Khoso condemned the attack on the train and said the terrorists of banned outfits were trying to disturb peace of Jacobabad.
They demanded immediate arrest of the terrorists behind the explosion so that no one else could dare commit such act again.
A team of Pakistan Railways technicians arrived from Rohri and begun work to get the derailed bogies back on the track and repair the part damaged in the explosion. The track would be restored fully soon, said the officials.

The CCP had imposed a penalty of Rs25 million for PSM’s anti-competitive and discriminatory conduct. While acknowledging the violation, the tribunal partially allowed PSM’s appeal and reduced the penalty to Rs5m, citing the limited duration of non-compliance.
The CCP took suo motu notice in 2009 following media reports and a complaint by Frontier Foundry (Pvt) Ltd, which alleged preferential treatment by PSM towards a particular buyer, Abbas Group, at the expense of other market participants.
CCP’s investigation revealed that PSM withheld the supply of key steel products between November 2008 and January 2009 without any objective justification, thereby violating Section 3 of the Competition Ordinance 2007. The tribunal observed that PSM failed to inform all buyers of product availability, enabling exclusive access for a single group and causing harm to other market players. Such conduct constituted abuse of dominance under Section 3(2)(g) and (h) of the ordinance, it declared.

• Cabinet okays plan to eliminate Rs1.275tr power sector debt over six years
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif announced on Wednesday that the income tax rate for salaried individuals earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million annually had been reduced to 1 per cent from the previous 5pc.
There has been some confusion over the income tax rate for the first slab.
While the Finance Bill indicated that the rate was reduced from 5pc to 1pc, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced during his budget speech that the new rate would be 2.5pc.
It later emerged that the federal cabinet had approved an increase to 2.5pc before the budget presentation to offset the additional fiscal burden caused by the recent hike in government employees’ salaries.
This was backed up by the FBR chairman, who told a parliamentary committee that only Rs1,000 tax would be applicable on a monthly income of Rs100,000.
Addressing the federal cabinet in a meeting broadcast live on state-run and private TV channels, the prime minister also defended the government’s decision to raise the defence budget in the newly presented federal budget, citing the need for better equipment for the country’s armed forces amid escalating regional conflicts.
Calling the regional situation “very alarming” due to the intensified conflict between Iran and Israel, the prime minister warned that the crisis posed a threat to both regional and global peace.
He reiterated Pakistan’s complete solidarity with the brotherly country Iran and its people against Israeli aggression and called upon the international community to make efforts to ensure an immediate ceasefire in the ongoing armed conflict.
During the cabinet meeting, the premier also highlighted that the Public Sec­tor Development Programme had been expanded to Rs1 trillion in the new budget, pledging to meet development goals.
The government has recently announced the federal budget 2025-26 and now it is being reviewed at different committees of the Senate and the National Assembly before its passage by the two houses of the parliament.
The government has proposed a defence allocation of Rs1.29tr for the next fiscal year — an 11.8pc increase over the original allocation for the outgoing year.
“Considering the fight against terrorism, we have increased the fiscal space to meet the requirements of the armed forces with regard to necessary equipment,” PM Shehbaz said.
He stressed that the recent great victory against India in the armed conflict was possible due to the professionalism of the armed forces and the support of 240m people of the country.
The premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity with Iran, condemning Israeli aggression and urging the international community to secure an immediate ceasefire. He revealed that he had spoken to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the situation.
He described the scenes in Gaza as heartbreaking, noting that over 50,000 innocent Palestinians had been killed. “Brutality is being unleashed. When will the world’s conscience awaken?” he asked.
The prime minister informed the cabinet that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would attend the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting in Turkiye on June 21-22.
As for economic measures, the premier said the government had convinced the International Monetary Fund not to impose taxes on the agricultural sector, including fertiliser and pesticides, stressing that farmers were already under strain. He expressed gratitude to the IMF for agreeing to the request.
Without naming the PTI government, PM Shehbaz said the incumbent government did not act like those who had broken the promises (with the IMF) and took the country to the verge of default. He said his administration had averted a financial crisis and was steering Pakistan towards economic stability.
He also praised a delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for effectively representing Pakistan’s position on Indian unilateral actions during visits to the US and Europe.
Power sector debt plan
Meanwhile, in a key decision, the federal cabinet approved Pakistan’s largest financial scheme to stabilise the power sector by eliminating Rs1.275tr in circular debt over the next six years, without adding burden to the national budget.
Under the plan, Rs683 billion of Power Holding Company’s debt will be refinanced, and outstanding payments to independent power producers (IPPs) will be settled. The scheme aims to implement sustainable reforms, ease financial stress and restore investor confidence in the energy sector.
The prime minister commended Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for his recent address to the Pakistani diaspora in the US, calling his commitment to safeguarding Pakistan’s interests a source of national pride.
The cabinet also expressed appreciation for Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and his economic team for presenting a “people-friendly budget” for the upcoming fiscal year. Commendation was also extended to Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Yousaf for the arrangements made for Haj pilgrims this year.
The cabinet also approved the appointment of Kamaluddin Tipu as the chairman of the Commission for the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Human Rights.
Additionally, the cabinet granted an exemption under Section 21 of the Pakistan Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2002 to the National Power Parks Management Company Limited for procurement services related to the acquisition of the Rousch Power Plant.
It also ratified the decisions made during the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases meeting held on May 21.

• Collection of tax on digital services handed over to provinces
• PIDCL to oversee federal projects in all provinces
• Funds for Sindh varsities to be maintained
ISLAMABAD: In a significant development, the ruling PML-N has finally agreed to four major demands of its key ally PPP, thus paving the way for the federal budget’s smooth passage in the National Assembly.
Taking the floor during the budget debate in the lower house of parliament on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar revealed that after extensive consultations with PPP leaders, including Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, as well as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the government had accepted the PPP’s key demands, including reduction in the proposed General Sales Tax (GST) on solar panels.
The assurance came in the wake of constant criticism from the members, mostly from the PPP, on a number of budgetary proposals during the ongoing budget debate.
Amid desk-thumping by the treasury members, Mr Dar announced that the digital sales tax on services would remain within the jurisdiction of the provinces, while the proposed 18pc GST on solar panels had been reviewed and revised down to 10pc.
Mr Dar stated that after detailed discussions with coalition partners and relevant stakeholders, including the people in the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), a consensus was reached on Tuesday night to resolve several contentious budgetary issues.
He termed the concerns raised by the PPP regarding digital taxation as “valid,” and said the issue would be clearly addressed by finance minister in his winding up speech in the assembly.
Mr Dar said despite the fact that 54pc of components used in solarisation were already taxed, there was a widespread concern among stakeholders over the government’s proposal to impose 18pc GST on remaining 46pc of the components.
“However, we have now proposed reducing the solar GST from 18pc to 10pc,” he declared.
Mr Dar said when a relief was announced in any sector, they had to look for other ways to generate the revenue to fill the gap. He said initially the government had decided to announce six per cent increase in the salaries of the government employees, but after a discussion in the federal cabinet, they finally announced 10pc raise. He said now they were under discussion with the IMF as to how to compensate this additional expenditure.
Referring to another PPP’s demand, the deputy PM said that it had been decided to maintain funding for Sindh universities in the PSDP through the HEC at Rs4.7bn. In the budget, the government had reduced the amount to Rs2.6bn.
He said the prime minister had also acknowledged valid concerns raised by the PPP regarding handing over of now-defunct PWD projects to three provinces and the projects in Sindh to the newly established Pakistan Infrastructure Develo­pment Company Limited (PIDCL). He said the prime minister had agreed that there must be a uniform policy for all the provinces. He said the PIDCL would now oversee federal development projects in all the provinces.
However, Mr Dar did not mention the issue of less allocation for the ongoing projects in Sindh, including the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway.
Many PPP members in their budget speeches had categorically announced that it would be challenging for them to vote for the budget in its present form.
Besides opposing imposition of 18pc GST on solar panels, the PPP members had been agitating over the “step-motherly treatment” with Sindh province by making meager allocations for the ongoing projects in the province. The PPP members had been mainly protesting over “failure” of the federal government in handing over the projects which were being carried out by now-defunct PWD to the Sindh government as well as the Centre’s decision to directly collect tax on digital services.
Taking the floor, PPP’s veteran parliamentarian Syed Naveed Qamar said the government had by and large addressed their issues.
“We are thankful to the prime minister and the deputy prime minister. Our issues have been mitigated to some extent,” said Mr Qamar.
He welcomed the reduction of GST on solar equipment from 18pc to 10pc, but said the party would like to see further reduction in it up to five per cent.
“Matters are settled now,” declared Mr Qamar.
Earlier, taking part in the budget debate, PPP’s Ijaz Jakhrani had already disclosed in the assembly that the issues between his party and the PML-N had been resolved and his party would now have no hesitation in supporting the budget.
“Why should we not vote when the government has listened to us,” he said.

The conflict has ravaged the Gaza Strip and resulted in severe shortages of food, fuel and clean water.
Civil defence spokesman Mah­mud Bassal told AFP that 11 people were killed and more than 100 wounded “after the occupation forces opened fire and launched several shells… at thousands of citizens” who had gathered to queue for food in central Gaza.
The civil defence agency said an­­other 19 people were killed in three Israeli strikes, which it said targe­ted houses and a tent for displaced people. Three more people were killed in an Israeli air strike on a neighbourhood northeast of Gaza City on Wednesday, Bassal said.

Israel military raids refugee camps in occupied West Bank

In early March, Israel imposed a total blockade on Gaza, amid a deadlock in truce negotiations, only partially easing restrictions in late May. Since then, chaotic scenes and a string of deadly sho­otings have occurred near areas where Pales­tinians have gathered in hopes of receiving aid.
 


Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency.
The civil defence agency reported that at least 53 people were killed on Tuesday, as they gathered near an aid centre in the southern city of Khan Yunis hoping to receive flour.
After Israel eased its blockade, the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) began distributing aid in late May, but its operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and dozens of deaths.
‘Outrageous’
UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
The head of a UN inquiry said on Wednesday that the use of GHF to distribute food in the Pal­estinian territory is “outrageous”.
“In every war, the siege and starvation surely leads to death,” said Navi Pillay, who chairs the UN’s Inde­pe­ndent Interna­tional Commis­sion of Inquiry on Israel and the Palestinian territories.
“But this initiative of what’s called a foundation, a private fou­ndation, to supply food, is what I see as outrageous, because it involves the US itself, the government, and it turns out, as we watch daily, that people who go to those centres are being killed as they seek food.”
 


Raid on refugee camps
Israeli troops raided two Palestinian refugee camps in the occupied West Bank’s north overnight.
The military said that at  “around 4am Israeli forces entered Balata camp”, near the northern city of Nablus, for  “a routine counter-terrorism operation”.  It added that the troops had been deployed to the nearby Askar camp prior to the operation in Balata camp.
Imad Zaki, head of the popular services committee of Balata camp, also told AFP that the military began its raid at 0100 GMT on Wednesday.
“They closed all entrances to the camp, seized several homes after ev­­icting their residents, and orde­red the homeowners not to return for 72 hours. These homes were tur­ned into military outposts and int­er­ro­gation centres,” Zaki said.

The index released by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) with headquarters in Sydney, says the situation in Kashmir exemplifies the fragility of ceasefire agreements in volatile geographic settings and underscores the dangers posed by non-state actors capable of triggering international crises.
The index, a snapshot of the global state of peace, ranked Pakistan at 144, showing ‘low state of peace’ while India ranked 115 position with ‘medium state of peace’.
Ukraine and Russia have been placed at the bottom of the rankings of 163 countries.

Global Peace Index ranks Pakistan at 144, India at 115; says South Asia tensions remain perilously high

About conflict history and escalation hotspots in India, the index report says the conflict is highly likely in the Kashmir region over the next year.  Applying the escalation-risk indicators to the Kashmir dispute finds it has the potential for rapid deterioration. A four-day conflict ensued from 7-10 May 2025 and was the deadliest escalation betwe­­en the countries in several years.
 
 

A renewed confrontation over Kashmir would involve the two nuclear-armed rivals. Although a deliberate nuclear strike remains highly unlikely, any conventional campaign confined to the disputed territory could still inflict heavy battlefield losses and easily spill beyond the Kashmir region.
The conflict over Kashmir has the potential to substantially escalate or even become a full-blown war. Past triggers like terror attacks and corresponding Indian strikes on Pakistan have been controlled and external actors have placed significant pressure to de-escalate.
There is also a substantial risk of conflicts or increased violence inside India and Pakistan, with the potential for anti-Muslim violence in India or rebel groups like Balochistan separatists or the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan taking advantage of any conflict between the countries.
The Global Peace Index 2025 has pinpointed a set of critical escalation hotspots and regions where conflict risks are accelerating and could evolve into major wars.
According to the index, South Asia, the second least peaceful region globally, experienced the largest regional decline in peacefulness. This deterioration was driven primarily by repressive measures in Bangladesh under the Hasina government, and the heightened civil unrest and escalating internal and cross-border tensions in Pakistan.
This year’s results found that the average level of global peacefulness deteriorated by 0.36 per cent. This is the thirteenth deterioration in peacefulness in the last 17 years, with 74 countries improving and 87 deteriorating in peacefulness. Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008.

“In the last five years, increased living costs are the leading reason for borrowing in 2024, reported by 12pc of Pakistani adults”, said Karandaaz Pakistan — a government partner in digitisation and tax reforms — in its once-a-decade Financial Inclusion Survey (K-FIS).
Besides the living costs coming as financial shock and increasing borrowing needs, the survey completed with the financial support of the Gates Foundation and UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) noted that 7pc adult Pakistanis were found to have been forced to borrow due to healthcare expenses and 6pc others for the loss of employment.
Other notable reasons include marriage expenses 3pc, and climate change-related needs like crop failure or agricultural loss 3pc, and property damage 2pc, while education expenses 1.5pc and earthquake-related losses 0.1pc were the least common reasons for borrowing.
“The need for loans due to rising living costs is widespread, affecting 12pc of Pakistani adults overall. The highest demand is among self-employed individuals (15pc), followed by blue-collar workers (14pc), housewives (14pc), and individuals who are not working due to a disability (12pc), indicating financial strain across diverse groups”, the survey findings said adding the urban residents (8pc) and white-collar workers (7pc) reported lower demand, while students (2pc) had the least need.
The need for loans due to unexpected medical expenses is reported by 7pc of Pakistani adults, with the highest demand among the unemployed with disabilities (16pc), followed by blue-collar workers (10pc) and unemployed individuals (10pc), indicating financial vulnerability in these groups. Rural residents (8pc) report a higher need than urban residents (6pc), while white-collar workers (3pc) and students (1pc) have the lowest loan demand for medical expenses.
The overall need for loans due to loss of employment or income remains low at 6pc across most demographics. Blue-collar workers (10pc) report the highest need in this financial shock as well, followed by the self-employed (7pc), unemployed (6pc) and housewives (6pc), indicating higher financial vulnerability in these groups. White-collar workers (4pc), retired individuals (2pc), and students (1pc) have the lowest loan demand due to income loss. Rural and urban residents report equal needs (6pc).

• US president ‘dismisses’ Modi’s claim that Washington had no role in India-Pakistan
de-escalation
• Insiders say meeting secured via ‘unconventional means’, not diplomatic channels
WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he was “honoured” to meet Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir for talks at the White House.
Field Marshal Munir has now become the first serving chief of army staff to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president. The occasion also marked the first time a serving Pakistani army chief had been formally received at this level, without holding political office or governing under martial law.
The meeting, which began aro­und 1pm local time and lasted two hours, came hours after the US pre­sident shot back at Indian PM Narendra Modi’s claim that the United States had not pla­yed any role in defusing tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours in May of this year.
Previous military rulers — such as Field Marshal Ayub Khan, Gen Ziaul Haq, and Gen Pervez Musharraf — met US presidents only after they had assumed the role of head of state.
Barack Obama did briefly “walk in” on a White House meeting with then-COAS Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, but that too was not a formal engagement.
When questioned about the meeting in an interaction with the media later, Trump said, “I was honoured to meet him (Field Marshal Munir) today.”
Asked whether the talks included the current Iran-Israel conflict, Trump said: “They (Pakistan) know Iran very well, better than most, and they’re not happy about anything. It’s not that they’re bad with Israel. They know them both, actually, but they know Iran better.
“He (Field Marshal Munir) agreed with me. The reason I had him here was that I wanted to thank him for not going into the war [with India]. And I want to thank PM Modi as well, who just left a few days ago. We’re working on a trade deal with India and Pakistan. These two very smart people decided not to keep going with a war that could have been a nuclear war. Pakistan and India are two big nuclear powers.”
White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump was hosting Field Marshal Munir after he called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for preventing a nuclear war between India and Pakistan, Reuters reported.
But insiders suggested that the meeting was not arranged through routine diplomatic channels, but rather was the outcome of “unorthodox efforts” by a group of advisers, businessmen, and other influential figures.
Diplomatic sources in Washington said this initiative had been cooking for months and kept under wraps until the White House released President Trump’s official schedule on Tuesday.
Sources said that deepened counter-terrorism cooperation, engagement with crypto-linked influence networks, and targeted lobbying via Republican-aligned firms in Washington helped Pakistan secure the meeting.
The working lunch saw senior aides from both sides in attendance. Insiders viewed the meeting as a milestone — perhaps a signal of a new phase in US-Pakistan relations.
South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said the Trump-Munir meeting shouldn’t be seen only through the lens of the Israel-Iran war. “There’s been US-Pak engagement on critical minerals, crypto, [and] CT,” he said. “Trump takes a deep personal interest in all of these. And Munir is empowered to talk about it all. Also, Kashmir.”
Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also hailed the meeting as a positive development for strengthening Pakistan-US relations.
The PPP leader, who recently led a high-powered delegation to Western capitals to convey Pakistan’s perspective on the military stand-off with India earlier this year, also pointed to the timing of the meeting as being quite significant.
Trump ‘snubs’ Modi on mediation
Tuesday’s phone call between Modi and Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, which the former attended as a guest, was the two leaders’ first direct exchange since the May 7-10 conflict.
Giving a readout of the call, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri claimed the Indian PM had told the US president the May ceasefire was achieved through talks between the two militaries, and not US mediation.
“Talks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never do,” he said.
Misri also said that Trump expressed his support for India’s fight against terrorism and that Modi told him ‘Operation Sindoor’, under which it launched the cross-border strikes, was still on.
A White House official said on Wednesday that Trump had spoken with Modi a day earlier, without providing details of the call.
But later in the day, while speaking to reporters on the White House lawns, Trump insisted that he was the one who stopped the war.
When asked about his meeting with Pakistan’s army chief, he said: “Well, I stopped a war … I love Pakistan. I think Modi is a fantastic man. I spoke to him last night. We’re going to make a trade deal with Modi of India. But I stopped the war between Pakistan and India.”
Referring to Field Marshal Munir, Trump continued: “This man was extremely influential in stopping it from the Pakistan side. Modi from the India side and others. They were going at it — and they’re both nuclear countries. I got it stopped.”
Last month, Trump had said that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on trade instead of war.
Reacting to Vikram Misri’s remarks, Mr Bhutto-Zardari tweeted: “Indians are just really very sore losers at this point”.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held what both sides called productive talks on Tuesday at the G7 summit in Alberta and agreed to reinstate top diplomats they had withdrawn last year.
Carney drew outrage from some members of Canada’s Sikh community when he invited Modi to the G7.
 
 

Canada-India relations have been tense since former prime minister Justin Trudeau in 2023 accused India’s government of involvement in the June 18, 2023, murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Sikh separatist leader in Canada.
Modi’s government has denied involvement in Nijjar’s killing and has accused Canada of providing a safe haven for Sikh separatists.
The intelligence report noted transnational repression “plays a central role in India’s activity in Canada”, though it said China poses the greatest counter-intelligence threat to Canada and also named Russia, Iran and Pakistan.
 






The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in October that they had communicated more than a dozen threats to Sikhs advocating for the creation of a homeland carved out of India.
“Indian officials, including their Canada-based proxy agents, engage in a range of activities that seek to influence Canadian communities and politicians,” the Canadian Security Intelligence Service report reads.
“These activities attempt to steer Canada’s positions into alignment with India’s interests on key issues, particularly with respect to how the Indian government perceives Canada-based supporters of an independent homeland that they call Khalistan.”
The Indian High Commission and the Chinese embassy in Canada did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><small>2025-06-18 16:07</small></div><hr>
