His confirmation follows a statement by the Turkish foreign minister about the potential deal earlier today.
Harraj told Reuters the potential deal between the three countries was separate from a bilateral Saudi-Pakistani accord announced last year.
A final consensus between the three states is needed to complete the deal, he said.
“The Pakistan-Saudi Arabia-Turkey trilateral agreement is something that is already in pipeline,” Harraj said in an interview.
“The draft agreement is already available with us. The draft agreement is already with Saudi Arabia. The draft agreement is already available with Turkey. And all three countries are deliberating. And this agreement has been there for the last 10 months.”
Asked at a press conference in Istanbul earlier today about media reports on negotiations between the three sides, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said talks had been held but that no agreement had been signed.
Fidan pointed to a need for broader regional cooperation and trust to overcome distrust, which he said created “cracks and problems” that led to the emergence of external hegemonies or wars and instability stemming from terrorism, in the region.
“At the end of all of these, we have a proposal like this: all regional nations must come together to create a cooperation platform on the issue of security,” Fidan said.
Regional issues could be resolved if relevant countries would “be sure of each other,” he added.
“At the moment, there are meetings, talks, but we have not signed any agreement. Our President (Tayyip Erdogan)’s vision is for an inclusive platform that creates wider, bigger cooperation and stability,” Fidan said, without naming Pakistan or Saudi Arabia directly.
Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported last week that Turkiye was seeking to join the Pak-Saudi defence pact signed in September 2025.
The report said Turkiye viewed the pact “as a way of strengthening security and deterrents when there are questions over the reliability of the US, which has strong military ties with all three countries, and President Donald Trump’s commitment” to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato).

 

Saudi Arabia brings financial clout, Pakistan has nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkiye has the military experience and has developed a defence industry, Bloomberg quoted Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV, as saying.
Asked about reports of Istanbul eyeing such a pact, Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj told BBC Urdu: “From a strategic point of view, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan are close friendly countries of Pakistan, and there is a close relationship with them in terms of strategic policy.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.</p><small>2026-01-15 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/15192149423e800.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967052/trump-sees-iranian-crackdown-easing-tehran-denies-man-to-be-executed' target='_blank'><strong>Trump sees Iranian crackdown easing; Tehran denies man to be executed</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said he had been told that killings in Iran’s crackdown on protests were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions, adopting a wait-and-see posture after earlier threatening intervention.
After Iran’s foreign minister said Iran had “no plan” to hang people, Iranian state media on Thursday reported that a 26-year-old man arrested during protests in the city of Karaj would not be given the death sentence.
Rights organisation Hengaw, which reported earlier this week that Erfan Soltani was due to be executed on Wednesday, said a previously communicated order for his execution had been postponed, citing his relatives.







In a social media post on Thursday, Trump responded to a news report that an Iranian protester was no longer being sentenced to death, writing: “This is good news. Hopefully, it will continue!”
Iranian state media said that while Soltani was being charged with colluding against “internal security and propaganda activities against the regime”, the death penalty does not apply to such charges.
Trump’s comments on Wednesday led oil prices to retreat from multi-month highs and gold eased from a record peak on Thursday.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene on behalf of protesters in Iran, where the Iranian leadership has cracked down hard on nationwide unrest since December 28.
Protests appear to abate
People inside the country, reached by Reuters on Wednesday and Thursday, said the protests appear to have abated since Monday.
Information flows have been hampered by an internet blackout for a week.
Tensions had escalated on Wednesday, with Iran saying it had warned neighbours it would hit American bases in the region in the event of US strikes, and a US official saying the United States was withdrawing some personnel from bases in the region.
Trump, speaking at the White House, said he has been told that killings in the crackdown were subsiding.
Asked who told him that the killings had stopped, Trump described them as “very important sources on the other side”.







The president did not rule out potential US military action, saying “we are going to watch what the process is” before noting that his administration had received a “very good statement” from Iran.
In separate comments to Reuters, Trump expressed uncertainty over whether Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah of Iran and a prominent figure in Iran’s fractured opposition, would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.
Trump told Reuters it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth “any regime can fail”.

 

Turkiye, one of several states in the region where the US has forces, expressed opposition to the use of violence against Iran, with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan saying at a press conference in Istanbul that the priority is to avoid destabilisation.
Saudi FM Prince Faisal bin Farhan held a phone call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Thursday and discussed ways to support security and stability in the region, the Saudi foreign ministry said.







Qatar said on Wednesday that drawdowns from its Al Udeid air base, the biggest US base in the Middle East, were “being undertaken in response to the current regional tensions”.
Iran launched missiles at Al Udeid last year in response to US airstrikes on its nuclear installations during the 12-day war between Tehran and Israel.
Ali Shamkhani, a senior advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Trump that the strike showed “Iran’s will and capability to respond to any attack”.
‘Full control’
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said there would be “no hanging today or tomorrow”, in an interview with US network Fox News.
“I can tell you, I’m confident that there is no plan for hanging,” Araghchi said, also accusing Israel of orchestrating violence.
But Araghchi said the Iranian government was “in full control” and reported an atmosphere of “calm” after what he called three days of “terrorist operation”.
The British government said its embassy in Tehran had been “temporarily closed”, while the US embassy in Saudi Arabia urged staff to exercise caution and avoid military installations.
Iran’s judiciary chief vowed to fast-track trials for those arrested, stoking fears authorities will use capital punishment as a tool of repression.
Iran reopens airspace
Iran reopened its airspace after a nearly five-hour closure amid concerns about possible military action between the US and Iran that forced airlines to cancel, reroute or delay some flights.
Iran closed its airspace to all flights except international ones to and from Iran with official permission at 10:15pmGMT (3:15amPKT) on Wednesday, according to a notice on the US Federal Aviation Administration website.







The notice was removed shortly before 3amGMT (8am PKT), according to tracking service Flightradar24, which showed five flights from Iranian carriers Mahan Air, Yazd Airways and AVA Airlines were among the first to resume over the country.
Missile and drone barrages in a growing number of conflict zones represent a high risk to airline traffic.
Indian airlines among those affected
India’s largest airline IndiGo said some of its international flights would be impacted by Iran’s sudden airspace closure.
Air India said its flights were using alternative routes that could result in delays or cancellations.







A flight by Russia’s Aeroflot bound for Tehran returned to Moscow after the closure, according to Flightradar24 data.
Earlier on Wednesday, Germany issued a new directive cautioning the country’s airlines from entering Iranian airspace, shortly after Lufthansa rejigged its flight operations across the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region.
The United States already prohibits all US commercial flights from overflying Iran and there are no direct flights between the countries.

Airline operators like flydubai and Turkish Airlines have canceled multiple flights to Iran in the past week.
“Several airlines have already reduced or suspended services, and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” said Safe Airspace, a website run by OPSGROUP, a membership-based organisation that shares flight risk information.
“The situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defence, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.”
Lufthansa said on Wednesday that it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice, while it would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman from Wednesday until Monday next week so that crew would not have to stay overnight.
Some flights could also be cancelled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement.
Italian carrier ITA Airways, in which Lufthansa Group is now a major shareholder, said that it would similarly suspend night flights to Tel Aviv until Tuesday next week.
‘Unprecedented level of brutality’
Separately, G7 nations said on Wednesday they were “deeply alarmed at the high level of reported deaths and injuries” and warned of further sanctions if the crackdown continued.
Monitor NetBlocks said Iran’s internet blackout had lasted 156 hours.







Amnesty International accused authorities of committing mass unlawful killings “on an unprecedented scale,” citing verified videos and eyewitness accounts.
The US-based Institute for the Study of War said authorities were using “an unprecedented level of brutality to suppress protests,” noting reports of protest activity had sharply declined.
A senior Iranian official told journalists there had been no new “riots” since Monday, distinguishing them from earlier cost-of-living protests. “Every society can expect protests, but we will not tolerate violence,” he said.
Prosecutors have said some detainees will face capital charges of “waging war against God”. State media reported hundreds of arrests and the detention of a foreign national for espionage, without giving details.
India tells citizens to leave Iran
India’s foreign ministry has urged its citizens to leave Iran, where rights groups say a crackdown on mass protests has killed and arrested thousands of people.
India’s foreign ministry estimates there are usually around 10,000 citizens in Iran.







“Indian nationals who are currently in Iran (students, pilgrims, business persons and tourists) are advised to leave Iran by available means of transport,” the Indian Embassy in Tehran said, in a post on social media late Wednesday.
AI-created Iran protest videos gain traction
AI-generated videos purportedly depicting protests in Iran have flooded the web, researchers said Wednesday, as social media users push hyper-realistic deepfakes to fill an information void amid the country’s internet restrictions.
US disinformation watchdog NewsGuard said it identified seven AI-generated videos depicting the Iranian protests — created by both pro- and anti-government actors — that have collectively amassed some 3.5 million views across online platforms.
Among them was a video shared on the Elon Musk-owned platform X showing women protesters smashing a vehicle belonging to the Basij, the Iranian paramilitary force deployed to suppress the protests.
One X post featuring the AI clip, shared by what NewsGuard described as anti-regime users, garnered nearly 720,000 views.
Anti-regime X and TikTok users in the United States also posted AI videos depicting Iranian protesters symbolically renaming local streets after President Donald Trump.
One such clip shows a protester changing a street sign to “Trump St” while other demonstrators cheer, with an overlaid caption reading: “Iranian protestors are renaming the streets after Trump.”
Pro-regime social media users also shared AI videos purportedly showing large-scale pro-government counterprotests throughout the Islamic republic.
The AI creations highlight the growing prevalence of what experts call “hallucinated” visual content on social media during major news events, often overshadowing authentic images and videos.
In this case, AI creators were filling an information void caused by the internet blackout imposed by the Iranian regime as it sought to suppress demonstrations, experts said.
“There’s a lot of news — but no way to get it because of the internet blackout,” said NewsGuard analyst Ines Chomnalez.
“Foreign social media users are turning to AI video generators to advance their own narratives about the unfolding chaos.”
The fabricated videos were the latest example of AI tools being deployed to distort fast-developing breaking news.
AI fabrications, often amplified by partisan actors, have fueled alternate realities around recent news events, including the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and a deadly shooting by immigration agents in Minneapolis.
AFP fact-checkers also uncovered misrepresented images that created misleading narratives about the Iranian protests, the largest since the Islamic Republic was proclaimed in 1979.
One months-old video purportedly showing demonstrations in Iran was actually filmed in Greece in November 2025, while another claiming to depict a protester tearing down an Iranian flag was filmed in Nepal during last year’s protests that toppled the Himalayan nation’s government.</p><small>2026-01-15 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/151840188d284c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967116/pakistans-strategic-geographic-connectivity-complements-bahrains-financial-expertise-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s strategic geographic connectivity complements Bahrain’s financial expertise: President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari, who is on a four-day visit to Bahrain, highlighted on Thursday that Pakistan’s strategic geographic connectivity, linking South Asia, Central Asia, China and the Middle East, complemented the Gulf country’s financial expertise and regulatory framework.
He expressed these views while addressing a reception at the headquarters of Bahrain’s Economic Development Board (EDB), which is an investment promotion agency, a statement by the President’s Office said.
In his address, the president underscored Pakistan’s commitment to expanding economic cooperation, investment partnerships and institutional linkages with Bahrain, the statement said.
He “noted that the Economic Development Board plays a central role in shaping Bahrain’s economic strategy, attracting foreign investment and supporting diversification across key sectors”.
The president further observed that the board’s close coordination with government institutions and the private sector had helped Bahrain strengthen competitiveness, promote innovation and create a predictable and enabling environment for investors.
“President Zardari said the EDB’s model of policy coherence and investor facilitation offers a useful reference point for countries pursuing sustainable and inclusive growth,” the statement said.
It added that he also noted that Pakistan followed Bahrain’s development journey with “admiration and sees strong complementarities between the two economies”.
Highlighting Pakistan’s ongoing economic reforms, the president said the country was pursuing stability, digital modernisation and investment-led growth. He pointed to the Special Investment Facilitation Council as a “streamlined platform to facilitate investors”, with priority sectors including agriculture, information technology, energy, minerals, logistics and tourism.
Moreover, the president identified agriculture and food security, information technology and digital services, renewable energy and logistics as promising areas for Pakistan-Bahrain collaboration, the statement detailed.
It said the president also “emphasised Pakistan’s strategic geographic connectivity linking South Asia, Central Asia, China and the Middle East, which complements Bahrain’s financial expertise and regulatory framework”.
While outlining economic opportunities, the president also referred to regional security challenges and their impact on development, reaffirming Pakistan’s resolve to counter extremism, strengthen internal security and pursue peaceful relations with its neighbours, while safeguarding national interests, according to the statement.
“The president reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to protecting investment and fostering mutually beneficial partnerships, and thanked the leadership of Bahrain and the Economic Development Board for their role in advancing bilateral economic cooperation.”
He further commended the EDB for its “clear strategic vision and institutional strength”, observing that Bahrain’s success in positioning itself as an open and investor-friendly economy offers valuable lessons in a rapidly evolving global environment.
The statement also said the president appreciated Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa — who is also the Gulf country’s prime minister — “for the warm hospitality” extended during the visit.
It said the president conveyed his gratitude to King Hamad for the conferment of the Sheikh Issa Award, describing it as a gesture that reflected the depth of bilateral ties and mutual respect between the two countries.
“The president noted that the reception reflected the close and enduring friendship between Pakistan and Bahrain.”
The statement also mentioned that when Bahrain’s finance minister began briefing on economic development, the president interjected with a light remark, gesturing towards the Manama skyline and saying that the progress was visible before him and needed no explanation.
Separately, a post on the Presidency’s X account said President also met Bahrain’s Interior Minister Lt Gen Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa in capital Manama today.
“Both leaders pledged closer cooperation on security, counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism and reaffirmed strong bilateral ties,” the post said.







The president had arrived in Bahrain’s capital on Tuesday and met with Bahrain’s King at the royal residence, Al-Qudaibiya Palace.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), President Zardari will also hold a meeting with Crown Prince Salman during the trip.
“The visit seeks to reinforce Pakistan’s longstanding cooperation with the brotherly Gulf nation while expanding opportunities for collaboration in trade and economic partnership, defence and security, and people-to-people ties,” the FO said earlier this week.
Last year in November, Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif, during a two-day visit to Bahrain, had reiterated Pakis­tan’s commitment to deepening ties with the kingdom.
Discussing economic relations, the prime minister had unde­r­lined Pakistan’s desire to expand trade and investment and said bilateral trade was set to grow with the Pak­istan-GCC Free Trade Agree­ment.
Bahrain’s interior minister also visited Pakistan in September, with the two countries agreeing to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics and immigration.</p><small>2026-01-15 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1515441883bdec6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967110/northern-areas-expected-to-get-snow-rain-from-tomorrow-showers-likely-in-parts-of-sindh-and-balochistan-from-jan-21' target='_blank'><strong>Northern areas expected to get snow, rain from tomorrow; showers likely in parts of Sindh and Balochistan from Jan 21</strong></a><br><p>The Met Office has forecast snowfall and rain in the country’s northern areas from Friday (tomorrow) and has also predicted showers in parts of Sindh, including Karachi, and Balochistan from January 21 to 23.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department’s (PMD) forecast issued on Thursday said: “A shallow westerly wave is likely to approach upper parts of the country from January 16 and may persist till January 19.”
It added that the weather system was expected to strengthen from January 20 and grip most parts of the country from January 21.
The PMD said that rain and thunderstorm was expected in various parts of Sindh, including Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Jacobabad, Naushahro Feroze, Kashmore, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad, Mirpurkhas and Ghotki on January 22 and 23 with “occasional gaps”.







It also predicted the same for multiple areas of Balochistan, including Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Noushki, Harnai, Zhob, Kalat, Barkhan, Sibi, Loralai, Musakhel, Turbat, Gwadar, Jiwani, Lasbella, Kech, Awaran, Chaghi, Panjgur, Khuzdar, Washuk and Kharan on January 21 and 22.
Furthermore, the Met Office forecast “moderate to heavy snowfall” in Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Noshki, Harnai and Zhob during that period.
In the northern areas of the country, the PMD said “widespread rain-wind/thunderstorm” was predicted from January 20 to 23 in Gilgit Baltistan’s Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche and Shigar districts; Azad Kashmir’s (AJK) Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, and Haveli districts; as well as in Murree, Galliyat, Islamabad, and the Potohar region.
“Light rain/snowfall” was also expected in Murree, Galliyat and surroundings from January 18 to 20.
Punjab’s Sargodha, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sahiwal, Multan, Faisalabad, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Bahawalpur divisions and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Peshawar, Hazara, Malakand, Mardan, Kohat, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Khan divisions would also likely experience “widespread rain-wind/thunderstorm” from January 20 to 23.
The Met Office also predicted “heavy snowfall” in KP’s Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Shangla, Kohistan, Battagram, Mansehra and Abbottabad; AJK’s Neelum Valley, Bagh, Haveli and Rawalakot; along with Murree and Galliyat from January 20 (night) to 23 with occasional gaps.
The Met Office warned that “heavy snowfall may cause road closure and slippery conditions“ in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galliyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli, Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Noshki, Harnai and Zhob from January 21 to 23.
It further said there was a possibility of “landslides and avalanches” in hilly areas of upper KP, GB and AJK during the period.
“Tourists are advised to remain extra cautious and avoid unnecessary travelling during the forecast period,” the press release said.
It added that fog condition was likely to diminish in Punjab, KP and upper Sindh during the wet spell.
“Daytime temperatures are likely to drop significantly during the period,” the PMD advisory said.
According to the Met Office, the country received 34 per cent less rainfall in December 2025 than it normally does.
Cold wave alert for northern regions
Separately, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) also issued a cold wave alert for the upper and northern regions of the country.
The NDMA, in a statement issued by the National Emergencies Operations Centre (NEOC), forecast a strong cold wave expected to affect GB, upper KP and AJK over the coming days, resulting in heavy snowfall over high-altitude and hilly areas.
“Very cold to extremely cold conditions are likely to prevail, particularly during nighttime and early morning hours, while daytime temperatures are expected to remain below normal,” the statement read.
Earlier this month, the PMD had dismissed reports claiming that an “extreme cold wave” was expected from January 16 to 25.
The forecast indicated “moderate to heavy snowfall over high-altitude and hilly areas”, which may lead to disruptions in road connectivity, transportation, and power supply in mountainous regions.
“Adjoining plains are expected to experience cold and dry weather, with frost formation in isolated pockets,” the forecast added.
The prevailing conditions may “increase the risk of snow slides and avalanches at vulnerable locations” in hilly areas, posing threats to human safety, infrastructure, and livestock.
“Prolonged exposure to extreme cold and snowfall may also heighten health risks, especially for children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions, while frost may cause damage to standing crops and orchards in nearby plain areas,” the statement said further.
In view of the expected weather conditions, the NDMA advised the public to “avoid non-essential travel to high-altitude and snowfall-prone areas and to ensure the use of snow chains where travel is unavoidable”.
It also urged citizens to “make adequate arrangements for heating, warm clothing, and shelter”, with particular attention to protecting vulnerable populations, with advice for local communities to “remain vigilant and strictly follow advisories” issued by relevant local authorities.
The NDMA directed all provincial and district authorities concerned to remain on high alert and ensure preparedness for snow clearance operations, emergency response, and timely restoration of essential services, including electricity and communications.
The statement further said the NDMA, through its NEOC, would continue to monitor the situation closely and issue further updates as required.
It also advised the public to “obtain authentic and official information through television and radio broadcasts, verified social media platforms, and the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert mobile application, to stay informed and take necessary precautionary measures.</p><small>2026-01-15 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1513112278b3752.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967097/pakistan-hopes-routine-processing-of-us-immigrant-visas-will-resume-soon-after-internal-review-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan hopes routine processing of US immigrant visas will resume ‘soon’ after internal review: FO</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Thursday expressed hope that the United States would “soon” resume immigrant visa processing, adding that it viewed the recent suspension as part of an internal review.
The US on Wednesday announced the suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan and 74 other countries, effective January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations often rely on public welfare programmes.
In its statement, the State Department had said the “freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people”.
Responding to a query about the move despite Pakistan’s improved relations with Washington in recent months, Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi acknowledged coming across the “reports”.
“Basically, it was a brief statement by the US State Department on their social media account about the internal review of processing immigrant visas that they are in the process of,” he said.

 

“We are in touch with the US authorities to ascertain further details. This is an evolving news that we are following.
“We understand that this is an internal ongoing process of review of US immigration policies and system, and hope that the routine processing of immigrant visas will resume soon,” the FO spokesperson added.
The visa processing suspension could delay travel, study, and work plans for thousands of Pakistanis who annually seek US visas. Pakistani consulates in the US are expected to provide guidance to affected applicants in the coming days.
The freeze is linked to the US public-charge rule, which evaluates whether immigrants are likely to rely on government assistance. While suspensions of visa services have occurred in the past, officials have termed the scope of this action unprecedented.
No timeline has been given for resuming visa services, but the State Department assured that countries would be notified once the review is complete.
‘Full confidence in Iranian people and their leadership’
On the ongoing unrest in Iran and Tehran’s heightened tensions with the US, the FO spokesperson said Pakistan was “closely following the developments”.
Andrabi stressed: “We attach great importance to Iran, both as a neighbouring country and as an important player of the international community and an important member of the global fraternity.”
“Pakistan hopes that peace and stability will prevail, and we reaffirm our support for all efforts aimed at a peaceful resolution of the situation.”



He highlighted that the protests in Iran were “triggered by economic difficulties faced by the ordinary citizens, which have been further exacerbated and compounded by international sanctions”.
“So, we sincerely hope that the livelihood and financial support measures announced by the Iranian government for traders and the general public will help alleviate the hardship faced by the people, and we offer our best wishes towards that endeavour,” Andrabi said.
The FO spokesperson asserted that Pakistan remained “confident that the Iranian nation will overcome these challenges and emerge stronger”.
“A stable and peaceful Iran, free from domestic unrest, is in Pakistan’s interest.”
“We have full confidence in the wisdom of the Iranian people and their leadership — a wisdom rooted in their rich culture, ancient civilisation, history and resilience to address all the challenges confronting them.”

 

Andrabi urged Pakistanis to reconsider their travel plans for Iran, keeping in mind the FO’s recent travel advisory and exercising “extreme caution to ensure their safety and security”.
He stated that Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Mudassir Tipu and his team were “working diligently to ensure that Pakistanis in Iran are well-looked-after”.
Pakistan strongly rejects Indian army chief’s ‘baseless allegations’
On Tuesday, Indian Army Chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi alleged that there were “at least six terror camps still active across the LoC (Line of Control) and two across the international border” after India’s May 2025 strikes under what it called ‘Operation Sindoor’.
“Will act, if any [nefarious] attempts are carried out,” Times of India quoted Gen Dwivedi as saying.
Asked to comment on those remarks today, the FO spokesperson said, “Pakistan, of course, strongly rejects the baseless allegations by the Indian army chief regarding the presence of so-called terrorist camps.”
The FO spokesperson termed the allegations “cliched, habitual and somewhat delusional”.
“Our unparalleled sacrifices and blood and […] for combatting terrorism are internationally acknowledged and recognised,” he highlighted.
“We continue to contribute to peace not only in the region, but beyond,” he stressed.</p><small>2026-01-15 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1515204532ab296.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967108/bangladesh-cricket-board-removes-director-najmul-islam-amid-player-boycott' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh Cricket Board removes director Najmul Islam amid player boycott</strong></a><br><p>The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Thursday removed director Najmul Islam following protests from players ahead of Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) matches over his comments against the country’s cricketers, The Daily Star reported.
The first BPL match scheduled for 1pm local time today was delayed as players from Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express did not show up at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium for the game, according to The Daily Star.
Islam was handed a show-cause notice by the BCB a few hours before the match was set to begin. However, the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) had called for a nationwide boycott on all forms of cricket unless Islam tenders his resignation.
In a media release today, the BCB said the decision to remove Islam was taken by president Aminul Islam Bulbul “following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation”, and that it would come into effect immediately, The Daily Star reported.
“The decision has been taken in accordance with the authority vested in the BCB President under Article 31 of the BCB Constitution and is aimed at ensuring the continued smooth and effective functioning of the Board’s affairs,” the statement read.
“The Board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.
“In this regard, the BCB hopes that all cricketers will continue to display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket, and will do their utmost to ensure continued participation in the Bangladesh Premier League,” it added.
Until further notice, Bulbul will serve as the acting chairman of the finance committee that Islam was the chair of.
Islam had said on Wednesday night that he believes national cricketers should be asked to return the “crores and crores of taka” that the BCB spends on them, ESPN Cricinfo reported.
The BCB officially distanced itself from Islam’s comments and expressed its “sincere regret for remarks that may be deemed inappropriate, offensive, or hurtful.
“The Bangladesh Cricket Board also makes it clear that it will take appropriate disciplinary action against any individual whose conduct or comments show disrespect towards cricketers or cause harm to the reputation and integrity of Bangladesh cricket,” the board said in a statement, per Cricinfo.
The boycott was proposed by Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB), hours after Islam’s press conference at the BCB’s headquarters in Dhaka.
“The remark made by the BCB director [Najmul Islam] has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly, and it’s not acceptable,” Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.
“We demand his resignation. If he doesn’t resign before tomorrow’s match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow (Thursday).”
According to The Daily Star, Najmul said the board owes no compensation to players if Bangladesh miss the upcoming world cup, arguing that the BCB has never sought refunds from cricketers after poor performances at global events.
“The question [of compensation] does not even arise. We have invested so much [in] them, they haven’t been able to achieve anything, anywhere,” The Daily Star quoted Islam as saying.
“Have we won a single global trophy till now? Then we could’ve said every time, you have failed to perform, whatever we have spent on you, now we will take it back. Return it to us,” Islam said.
Islam’s comments came amid Bangladesh’s standoff with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over its refusal to travel to India for next month’s T20 World Cup.
Bangladesh announced on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh “formally requested” the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament beginning February 7.
Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are placed ninth in the ICC T20 rankings. They have played all nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.</p><small>2026-01-15 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/151656311422b08.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967094/kp-cm-sohail-afridi-lands-in-karachi-for-brief-1-day-visit' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Sohail Afridi lands in Karachi for brief 1-day visit</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi landed in Karachi on Thursday for a brief visit, just days after concluding his mobilisation drive in the city.
CM Afridi boarded a flight from Islamabad to Karachi earlier in the day, according to his focal person for digital media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi.
Late in the afternoon, the PTI said on X that the KP CM had arrived in Karachi to offer condolences to the family of Bilal Mehsud, a party worker who the PTI said died in a “tragic accident that took place during the rally in Karachi”.
It said CM Afridi would directly head to Mehsud’s family residence in Sohrab Goth from the Karachi airport, where he would meet the worker’s relatives and convey his sympathies.







The PTI said party leaders and workers accorded a warm welcome to the KP chief minister, and raised slogans in favour of ex-premier Imran Khan.
Shortly after 11am, the chief minister’s X account said he had departed for Karachi on a one-day visit.
An accompanying video showed Afridi arriving at the airport in KP, flanked by party members, including his aide Shafiullah Jan.







Afridi had already visited Karachi over the weekend, where he rallied PTI’s support base to support the party’s upcoming nationwide street movement.
During the visit, the Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah. However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue, saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid.
The confusion led to unrest and police shelling of supporters who gathered at Bagh-i-Jinnah.
Afridi, addressing Karachi crowds, had lauded the Sindh public’s warm welcome of him, but lashed out against the provincial government’s treatment of its “guests”, alleging that they had impeded his travelling party on the road from Hyderabad to Karachi.</p><small>2026-01-15 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/151705376fa3a5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967114/jcp-recommends-making-11-ad-hoc-lhc-judges-permanent' target='_blank'><strong>JCP recommends making 11 ad hoc LHC judges permanent</strong></a><br><p>The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on Thursday recommended the confirmation of 11 additional judges for the Lahore High Court (LHC) out of a total list of 13.
Presided over by Chief Justice of Pakis­tan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the JCP met at the Supreme Court (SC), a press release issued by the SC said.
After due consideration of the relevant data forms, ant­ecedents and evaluation material placed before it, the JCP, by a majority, recommended the confirmation of 11 additional judges of the LHC as permanent judges.
These were Justices Hassan Nawaz Makhdoom, Malik Waqar Haider Awan, Sardar Akbar Ali, Syed Ahsan Raza Kazmi, Malik Javid Iqbal Wains, Muhammad Jawad Zafar, Khalid Ishaq, Malik Muhammad Awais Khalid, Chaudhry Sultan Mahmood, Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh, and a female judge, Abher Gul Khan.
The JCP, by a majority, recommended the extension of Additional Judge Tariq Mahmood Bajwa for another six months.
Additional Judge Raja Ghazanfar Ali Khan was “not confirmed”, the press release added.

 

This week, the JCP, in separate meetings, has recommended making additional judges of multiple high courts permanent, approving three of the Islamabad High Court, 10 of the Sindh High Court, six of the Peshawar High Court and one of the Balochistan High Court.
The confirmation of three IHC ad-hoc judges — Additional Judges Muhammad Azam Khan, Muhammad Asif and Inaam Ameen Minhas —was made despite a letter by JCP member and IHC senior puisne judge Mohsin Akhtar Kayani questioning the competence of his colleagues.</p><small>2026-01-15 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/151511557ca0fbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967109/trump-informed-iran-he-does-not-intend-to-attack-asked-tehran-to-exercise-restraint-envoy' target='_blank'><strong>Trump informed Iran he does not intend to attack, asked Tehran to exercise restraint: envoy</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Iran’s envoy to Pakistan, Reza Amiri Moghadam, revealed on Thursday that US President Donald Trump informed Tehran that he will not attack the country and asked that Iran also exercise restraint.
Moghadam made the remarks during a visit to the National Rahmatul-lil-Alameen Authority, where he met the authority’s chairman, Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem.
Protests have taken place across Iran in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had been informed the killings of protesters in Iran had been halted, and added that he would “watch and see” about threatened military action.
The Iranian envoy also disclosed that he received information at around 1am, which indicated that Trump did not want war and had asked Iran not to attack the US interests in the region.
Speaking of the protests, the envoy maintained that the people had a legitimate right to protest and that the government had engaged in talks with the demonstrators.
However, he said that the coverage of the US and Western media incited violence, further escalating the situation.
Referring to the statements issued by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on January 7, he said that they amounted to interference in Iran’s internal affairs, further stoking the tensions.
The envoy described the events as the worst in Iran’s history.
He alleged that armed groups carried out killings, attacked mosques, imambargahs, and committed acts of arson.
The envoy went on to claim that the situation was now “fully under control”, adding that there were no protests in Iran at the moment, despite threats from Israel and the US.
He further held that in case of aggression from Israel or the US, Tehran had already conveyed that it remained prepared.
He added that the country remained on high alert and its airspace had been closed temporarily. The diplomat maintained that in the event of an attack, Iran would target US and Israeli installations in the wider region.
During the visit, the envoy added that Tehran was committed to the pursuit of peace. He further noted that Iran’s ties with Muslim countries were witnessing a “positive phase”.
Moghadam expressed gratitude to Pakistan for its support, which he said had been given “wholeheartedly”, stressing that the country needed moral and political support, rather than material assistance.
He added that Iran had faced economic sanctions for the past 44 years, causing damage but also leading to certain internal strengths.
The envoy also outlined plans to launch Persian language classes with the authority. An earlier press conference by the diplomat, scheduled for 3pm today, was cancelled due to his engagements.</p><small>2026-01-15 10:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645265-rain-expected-in-karachi-as-westerly-wave-likely-to-enter-country' target='_blank'><strong>Rain expected in Karachi as westerly wave approaches country</strong></a><br><p>

These pressures have had a direct impact on living standards and have also fueled recent protests.
The protests began on Dec. 28 in commercial hubs in the capital Tehran, when shopkeepers, merchants, and small business owners staged strikes and demonstrations to protest soaring inflation, the collapsing rial, and deteriorating economic conditions, and have since grown into nationwide anti-government expressions of discontent involving workers, students, and others across multiple cities.
The Iranian president said Sunday that his government is determined to address Iran’s economic problems amid the protests. Masoud Pezeshkian said the government admits to “shortcomings and problems” and is working hard to alleviate the people’s concerns, especially on the economy.
Currency collapse at the centre of crisis
The Iranian rial has suffered a sharp and sustained decline, hitting record lows against the US dollar on the open market. It started last year at around 817,000 rials per $1, then sank to 1.42-1.47 million rials on the parallel market by late 2025.
Due to the rial’s sharp decline, most Iranians have struggled to keep up with steadily rising prices.
The currency has been suffering for years in the face of sanctions and inflationary pressures, going from about 34,000 rials to the US dollar in 2016 to around 270,000 in 2021 and some 430,000 in 2022.
By 2023-2024, the rial had crossed the 750,000 mark on the open market, and its depreciation accelerated in 2025. Since 2020, the rial has lost nearly 800 per cent of its value, and as of this week, it trades at around 1.5 million rials to the dollar, severely eroding household purchasing power.
As the rial weakened, import costs shot up, feeding inflation and forcing businesses to raise prices. For ordinary Iranians, the falling currency has wiped out savings, reduced purchasing power, and created fear that prices will continue rising.
Traders and shopkeepers have been among the first to protest, as they struggle to afford goods amid daily currency swings.
Inflation eroding living standards
Inflation has remained above 40pc annually, with food and housing costs rising even faster in some areas. Wages have failed to keep pace, leaving households with less real income each month. Middle- and lower-income families are increasingly forced to cut back on basic goods.
Consumer price inflation remains exceptionally high, with inflation estimated at 30.6pc in 2020 before rising sharply to 43.4pc in 2021 and staying elevated at around 44pc–46pc in both 2022 and 2023.
Although inflation eased to about 32.5pc in 2024, it is projected to accelerate again, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecasting inflation of 42.4pc in 2025 and remaining above 40pc in 2026, underscoring the persistence of price pressures driven by currency weakness and structural constraints.
Food costs and staples have grown much faster, with sectoral inflation (such as bread and fruit) substantially outpacing the national rate.
The Statistical Centre of Iran reported that food inflation last September reached 58pc, more than double the rate in the same month the previous year. According to the survey, fruit costs have soared 75pc while bread and grains, which are staples in Iranian households, have almost doubled in price.
Although the government provides cash handouts and subsidies, including monthly payments, and food staple, electricity, and foreign exchange subsidies, these measures have not offset the impact of rising prices, especially as the value of payments declines alongside the rial.
Sanctions and restricted oil revenues
Iran’s economy is still severely hampered by international sanctions. US sanctions limit access to the international financial system, banking transactions, and oil exports. Even when Iran is successful in exporting oil, access to hard currency is often restricted, delayed, or held overseas.
According to a Reuters survey, Iran’s oil output fell by 100,000 barrels per day in late 2025 due to the sanctions, which directly cut into government revenue.
Total exports, oil and non-oil, are forecast to fall by around 16pc to $100 billion in 2025, while imports are expected to fall by roughly 10pc to $98bn, according to the IMF, reflecting tighter foreign exchange and sanctions pressure.
In 2025, the IMF projected a 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) decline in both output and exports as of last May. A greater decline of up to half a million bpd has been projected by independent energy analytics companies, including Kpler, Vortexa, and TankerTrackers.
As a result, foreign exchange inflows have fallen, and the Central Bank’s capacity to maintain currency stability has been eroded. Additionally, sanctions have hindered trade and discouraged foreign investment, pushing Iran to rely on unofficial routes that raise prices and decrease transparency.
Iran’s economy is still largely reliant on oil earnings, which cover a sizable portion of government revenues. In the fiscal year that ended last March, Iran’s Central Bank estimated oil revenues of $67bn. The bank reported oil revenues of $56bn for fiscal 2024, $55bn for 2023, $38bn for 2022, and $23bn for 2021.
However, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), the export figures vary. In the calendar year 2018, when the first Trump administration tightened sanctions on Iran, oil revenues reached $51bn, according to the EIA. In 2020, they sank to $5bn, before rebounding to $43bn in 2024.
Iran’s fiscal position remains under strain, with the government running persistent budget deficits amid constrained revenues and rising spending pressures.
According to IMF-based estimates, the budget deficit stood at around 4.1pc of GDP in 2024 and is expected to widen to about 6pc of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2025, before remaining elevated at roughly 6.2pc of GDP in 2026. The deterioration reflects limited oil revenue recovery under sanctions, weak non-oil tax collection, and higher outlays on subsidies, wages, and social support, adding to inflationary and currency pressures.
In its most recent budget, the government estimated daily oil shipments of 1.85 million barrels per day at $67 per barrel. However, the IMF projected that actual exports would only average 1.1 million barrels per day, showing a significant deficit.
GDP, unemployment figures
Over the last five years, Iran’s economy has navigated a volatile landscape defined by a modest recovery followed by a recent significant slowdown.
After a period of lost growth in the late 2010s, GDP rebounded with growth rates of about 4.1pc in 2021 and 4.4pc in 2022, largely driven by a recovery in oil exports and domestic services following the pandemic. This momentum peaked in 2023 with a 5.3pc expansion, but the trajectory has since cooled considerably.
By 2024, growth slowed to roughly 3.7pc, and estimates for 2025 from the IMF and the World Bank suggest a near-stagnant rate of just 0.3pc to 0.6pc. This recent deceleration is attributed to intensified sanctions, chronic inflation (averaging near 40pc), and severe energy shortages that have hampered industrial productivity.
While the oil sector remains a primary driver of the nominal economy — which fluctuated between $350bn and $475bn — non-oil sectors continue to struggle under structural constraints and a weakening currency.
In addition, the labour market over the last five years has been characterised by a jobless recovery followed by a tightening market amid recent economic stagnation. Official figures showed the total unemployment rate declining from 9.3pc in 2021 to a record low of approximately 7.2pc to 8.2pc by late 2024.
Youth unemployment remains a critical challenge, consistently hovering between 20pc and 23pc, nearly triple the national average.

IHC’s Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro issued the directives while hearing a petition filed by Muhammad Naveed Ahmad of the Centre for Justice and Rights, which invoked Article 199 (jurisdiction of high court) of the Constitution.
Advocate Muddasir Latif Abbasi appeared as the petitioner’s counsel, while Assistant Attorney General Sarfraz Rauf was present on the state’s behalf.
At the outset of the hearing, Advocate Abbasi contended that massive tree felling was being carried out across Islamabad in violation of rules and regulations.

 

He argued that the indiscriminate cutting had led to serious environmental changes, posing dangers to public health and ecology, and amounted to a violation of the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act 1997 (PEPA).
At one point, Justice Soomro summoned the AAG to the rostrum and questioned the government side, asking why trees were being cut despite existing environmental safeguards.
Taking serious notice of the matter, the court ordered the CDA to immediately stop all tree-felling activities until the next hearing.
Notices were issued to the CDA, the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and the climate change ministry, directing them to submit a detailed “para-wise” response and comprehensive report at the next hearing.
Subsequently, the court adjourned the hearing until February 2.
Recently, a large-scale tree removal drive took place in at least three locations in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), including around Shakarparian, sparking widespread public criticism.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, speaking in the National Assembly on Tuesday, stated the figure as 29,115 trees, attributing it to three “possible causes”, and affirmed that a greater number of trees would be planted in the coming months.
While the CDA had earlier maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed as they had been causing pollen allergies, WWF-Pakistan found that the action was also linked to infrastructure development in multiple locations.
According to the petition, the actions of the authorities contravened PEPA, the Islamabad Wildlife Ordinance 1979, and the Master Plan of Islamabad, which designates Shakarparian as a protected green area.

 

It was further asserted that no public hearing was conducted as required under environmental law and that the Pak-EPA failed to take timely action.
The petition also criticised the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, stating that instead of intervening, the minister publicly justified the tree cutting, claiming it was carried out in line with court orders.
The petitioner alleged that thousands of mature trees were cut during late 2025 and early 2026, causing what he termed “grave and irreversible environmental harm”.
IHC urged to fix responsibility at ‘highest levels’ within CDA
The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, made several requests before the IHC.
The petitioner urged the IHC to direct the CDA to produce the “official record of the tree-cutting operations in Shakarparian, H-8 and other areas, including who recommended it; who approved it; on what legal or policy basis; and any environmental impact assessments or notifications issued”.
He requested the court to fix responsibility for the tree-cutting at the “highest levels” within the CDA, and direct “appropriate and exemplary penal action” under relevant laws, including Pepa and the Pakistan Penal Code 1860.
Ahmad also called for Pak-EPA and the climate change ministry to be held accountable for “not having acting in the matter in time or at all”, and for them to face penal action.
The complainant urged the IHC to impose an “immediate ban on the cutting of all trees in Islamabad”.
He sought a high-powered judicial commission — headed by a retired IHC or Supreme Court judge — to investigate the “recent and ongoing violations of the Master Plan of Islamabad, including unauthorised tree cutting and encroachments”, and submit a report with recommendations within 90 days.

 

The petitioner urged the IHC to order the CDA to “compensate for the cut trees by immediately transplanting mature, grown-up native trees in the affected areas and planting additional new trees of appropriate age and size at a ratio of at least ten for every one tree removed”.
Ahmad also called for a detailed implementation report on the recommendations of the 2015 Dr Parvez Hassan Report in similar environmental cases, asking the court to “identify violations, fix responsibility and direct exemplary penal action”.
The petitioner also sought the establishment of an “impartial, autonomous, and fully empowered body” — which would comprise experts, civil society representatives and judicial nominees — for approving any future tree-cutting campaigns in cases of “genuine necessity”.
Objections raised over infrastructure projects
Serious concerns were also raised over the construction of a monument in Sector H-8 along the Islamabad Expressway.
The petitioner alleged that hundreds of decades-old native trees were cut for the project without any justification related to pollen mitigation.

 

He pointed to an apparent lack of transparency in site selection and sought directives to the CDA to justify to the court’s satisfaction as to why the monument could not be built in an existing park or public place.
Ahmad further requested the court to order the CDA to withhold further construction of a new cricket stadium and convention centre until the satisfaction of the IHC or “any commission or entity empowered by the honourable court in this behalf”.
He sought a moratorium on “all current and upcoming infrastructure projects in Islamabad until the establishment of an independent oversight mechanism to review and approve such projects in the context of environmental protection and the Master Plan”.

 

He urged the IHC to issue an injuction “stopping all further construction and civil works at the H-8, and direct that the project be shifted to another appropriate location that does not involve environmental degradation, thereby setting a precedent that no tolerance […] will be shown even after a project is launched, and will not be accepted by superior courts as fait accompli”.
The petition noted that indiscriminate tree cutting had been carried out in sectors H-8, H-9, F-9 Park, Chak Shahzad and near Zero Point, with some of the activity linked to infrastructure projects such as park upgradation, road construction and the establishment of a bus depot.

Brent futures LCOc1 were down $2.19, or 3.3pc, at $64.33 a barrel by 8:45am GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1had slipped $2.07, or 3.34pc, to $59.95 a barrel.
Brent futures rose above $66.50 a barrel on Wednesday before giving back most gains after Trump’s remarks reduced expectations of a potential US attack on Iran.
Trump turned the oil market mood by saying he had received assurances that killings of demonstrators in Iran had stopped, said PVM analyst John Evans, adding that prices on Thursday reflect the narrative of a near-term future of oversupply.
Further weighing on prices, US crude and gasoline inventories rose last week more than analysts had estimated, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.
Also on the supply side, Venezuela has begun reversing oil production cuts made under a US embargo as crude exports were also resuming, three sources said.
On the demand side, OPEC said on Wednesday that oil demand was likely to rise at a similar pace in 2027 as this year and published data indicating a near balance between supply and demand in 2026, contrasting with other forecasts of a major glut.
Meanwhile, China’s crude oil imports rose 17pc from a year earlier in December, while total imports in 2025 rose 4.4pc, government data showed, with daily crude import volume hitting all-time highs in December and for all of 2025.

“The members of Senate, National Assembly and provincial assemblies who have not submitted details of their assets and liabilities are directed to submit it on the prescribed Form B under Section 137 of the Election Act by January 15, 2026,” said a statement issued by the ECP.
“In case of failure to submit the statement, the membership of the concerned lawmakers will be suspended from January 16, 2026,” it stated.
The ECP further informed that the offices of the political finance wing (Kohsar Block) at the commission would remain open for the receipt of statements until 12 midnight on January 15.
Last week, the ECP said 446 lawmakers failed to submit their statement of assets and liabilities with the commission by the due date of December 31, 2025. It notified them to submit it by January 15.
Out of these, 125 lawmakers are members of the National Assembly, 26 Senators, 159 members of the Punjab Assembly, 62 members of the Sindh Assembly, 48 members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Assembly and 26 members of the Balochistan Assembly.
The ECP had stated that the submission was a mandatory requirement under Section 137 of the Elections Act, 2017.
Section 137 (1) of the Elections Act, 2017 stipulates that “every member of an assembly and senate shall submit to the Commission, on or before Dec 31 each year, a copy of his statement of assets and liabilities, including assets and liabilities of his spouse and dependent children as on the preceding thirtieth day of June on Form B.”
Last year, ECP suspended the membership of 139 lawmakers after they failed to submit their annual statements of assets.
Those suspended included two Senators from Balochistan, Muhammad Qasim of the Balochistan National Party (BNP) and Abdul Quddus of the PPP.
Other lawmakers included 16 members of the National Assembly, 68 of the Punjab Assembly, 33 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, 15 of the Sindh Assembly and five of the Balochistan Assembly.
The suspended lawmakers were barred from attending the respective legislature’s proceedings.</p><small>2026-01-15 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645242-at-unsc-pakistan-urges-inclusive-talks-to-end-yemen-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>At UNSC, Pakistan urges inclusive talks to end Yemen conflict</strong></a><br><p>

In the case, registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The hearing on Thursday was conducted by Additional District and Sessions Judge Mohammed Afzal Majoka, with Prosecutor Rana Usman representing the state.
At the outset, neither Mazari nor Chattha appeared before the court. An assistant counsel sought an exemption from appearance for Mazari, submitting that Chattha was engaged in proceedings relating to a contempt case before the high court.
The court expressed displeasure over the absence of the accused and observed that the request for exemption would be considered later.
Judge Majoka warned that if the accused failed to appear, their right to cross-examination would be revoked. The hearing was initially adjourned until 12 noon.
When proceedings resumed, Chattha appeared in court and informed the judge that Mazari wished to cross-examine the prosecution witness Shahroz personally, reiterating that she intended to ask questions herself.
Majoka directed the defence to complete the cross-examination, warning that failure to do so would result in termination of that right.
During the hearing, Islamabad District Bar Association President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar appeared in court and requested that the matter be fixed for Monday, assuring the court that no adjournment would be sought thereafter. He informed the court that Mazari was unwell but still wished to conduct the cross-examination herself.
The prosecution opposed any adjournment, and the prosecutor urged the court to administer an oath to the witness and commence cross-examination immediately.
The courtroom atmosphere turned tense when a heated exchange erupted between Gujjar and Usman. Harsh remarks were traded, leading to chaos in the courtroom. As tempers flared, Judge Majoka rose from the bench and retired to his chamber, ordering a break in the proceedings.

 

After the break, once again, neither Mazari nor Chattha appeared before the court. The prosecutor alleged misconduct in the courtroom and questioned the conduct of the bar president.
In view of the circumstances, the court cancelled the bail granted to the lawyers, ordered their arrest and production before the court, and formally revoked their right to cross-examination.
The court further directed that statements of the accused under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code be recorded.
The hearing of the case was adjourned till tomorrow.</p><small>2026-01-15 08:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645228-social-media-users-urged-to-remove-illegal-hateful-content-immediately' target='_blank'><strong>Social media users urged to remove 'illegal, hateful' content immediately</strong></a><br><p>

According to the latest rankings, Pakistan’s travel document was placed 98th on the list, tied with Yemen.
It ranked higher than Iraq (99), Syria (100) and Afghanistan (101).
The ranking showed that Pakistan’s passport allows visa-free access to 31 countries, including visa-on-arrival (VOA).

Singapore ranked the highest, with visa-free access to 192 countries, followed closely by Japan and South Korea with 188.
Denmark, Luxembourg, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland tied for the third spot with visa-free access to 186 countries.
According to the Henley Index, Pakistani passport holders have free visa access to Barbados, Cook Islands, Dominica, Haiti, Micronesia, Montserrat, Rwanda, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago, and Vanuatu.
While a visa-on-arrival was available for Burundi, Cambodia, Cape Verde Islands, Comoro Islands, Djibouti, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Maldives, Mozambique, Nepal, Niue, Palau Islands, Qatar, Samoa, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu.
Pakistani passport holders can also avail an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) for Kenya, Seychelles, and Sri Lanka.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi took to X and hailed the development.
He termed it a “strong achievement” and vowed that the “momentum will continue”.







Last year in October, the Pakistani passport ranked the fourth worst for the fifth straight year, with a ranking of 103.
Pakistan’s passport has been declared the world’s fourth-worst since at least 2021 on the Henley index, which calculates countries’ “visa-free score” — the number of destinations travellers can access without a prior visa, or with a visa on arrival.
The travel document was ranked 100th in 2024 and 2023, 109th in 2022 — when it allowed entry into 32 countries without a prior visa — and 107th in 2021 with the same visa-free score.</p><small>2026-01-15 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645195-pakistan-urges-saudi-arabia-to-increase-hajj-quota-in-line-with-population' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges Saudi Arabia to increase Hajj quota in line with population</strong></a><br><p>

The announcement comes after California’s attorney general launched an investigation into Musk’s xAI — the developer of Grok — over the sexually explicit material and multiple countries either blocked access to the chatbot or launched their own probes.
X said it will “geoblock the ability” of all Grok and X users to create images of people in “bikinis, underwear, and similar attire” in those jurisdictions where such actions are deemed illegal.







“We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,” X’s safety team said in a statement.
“This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.”
In an “extra layer of protection”, image creation and the ability to edit photos via X’s Grok account were now only available to paid subscribers, the statement added.
The European Commission, which acts as the EU’s digital watchdog, earlier said it had taken note of “additional measures X is taking to ban Grok from generating sexualised images of women and children”.
“We will carefully assess these changes to make sure they effectively protect citizens in the EU,” European Commission spokesperson Thomas Regnier said in a statement, which followed sharp criticism over the nonconsensual undressed images.
‘Shocking’
Global pressure had been building on xAI to rein in Grok after its so-called “Spicy Mode” feature allowed users to create sexualised deepfakes of women and children using simple text prompts such as “put her in a bikini” or “remove her clothes”.
“The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said earlier Wednesday.
“We have zero tolerance for the AI-based creation and dissemination of nonconsensual intimate images or of child sexual abuse material.”
Bonta said the California investigation would determine whether xAI violated state law after the explicit imagery was “used to harass people across the internet.”
California Governor Gavin Newsom said that xAI’s “vile” decision to allow sexually explicit deepfakes to proliferate prompted him to urge the attorney general to hold the company accountable.
Further adding pressure onto Musk’s company on Wednesday, a coalition of 28 civil society groups submitted open letters to the CEOs of Apple and Google, urging them to ban Grok and X from their app stores amid the surge in sexualised images.
Indonesia on Saturday became the first country to block access to Grok entirely, with neighbouring Malaysia following on Sunday.
India said on Sunday that X had removed thousands of posts and hundreds of user accounts in response to its complaints.
Britain’s Ofcom media regulator said on Monday it was opening a probe into whether X failed to comply with UK law over the sexual images.
And France’s commissioner for children Sarah El Hairy said on Tuesday she had referred Grok’s generated images to French prosecutors, the Arcom media regulator and the European Union.
Last week, an analysis of more than 20,000 Grok-generated images by Paris non-profit AI Forensics found that more than half depicted “individuals in minimal attire” — most of them women, and two per cent appearing to be minors.</p><small>2026-01-15 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/15111846956c523.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967090/trump-reiterates-desire-for-greenland-following-high-stakes-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Trump reiterates desire for Greenland following high-stakes meeting</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump reiterated on Wednesday that the United States needs Greenland and that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect the island, even as he said that “something will work out” with respect to the future governance of the Danish overseas territory.
The remarks, which came after a high-stakes meeting between US, Danish and Greenlandic officials, indicate that there are still fundamental, if not intractable, differences between how Washington, Copenhagen and Nuuk see the political future of the island.
“Greenland is very important for the national security, including of Denmark,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. “And the problem is there’s not a thing that Denmark can do about it if Russia or China wants to occupy Greenland, but there’s everything we can do. You found that out last week with Venezuela,” he said.
After meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Wednesday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt said the US and Denmark would form a working group to discuss a broad array of concerns regarding the island that could meet in the coming weeks.
Greenland ‘not for sale’, Copenhagen and Nuuk say
But they also made clear that Washington had not budged on its position that it must acquire Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that is strategically located and rich in minerals. Rasmussen and Motzfeldt described such an outcome as an unacceptable breach of sovereignty.
“We didn’t manage to change the American position,” Rasmussen told reporters outside the Danish embassy in Washington. “It’s clear that the president has this wish of conquering over Greenland.”
Trump has not ruled out taking Greenland by force. Before the two-hour meeting, he argued on social media that Nato would become far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the US. “Anything less than that is unacceptable,” he wrote.
In recent weeks, he has frequently repeated longstanding claims that acquiring Greenland is a national security imperative and that Denmark is not capable of warding off Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic region.
Greenland and Denmark say the island is not for sale, that threats of force are reckless and security concerns should be resolved among allies. Prominent EU countries have backed Denmark, a member of the Nato alliance.
Ahead of the meeting, Greenland and Denmark said they had begun to increase their military presence in and around Greenland in close cooperation with Nato allies, as part of their promise to beef up Arctic defense.
Late on Wednesday, a Danish Air Force plane landed at Nuuk airport and personnel in military fatigues disembarked, footage showed. The Danish military will support the preparation of exercise activity, according to the nation’s Joint Arctic Command.
Germany, Sweden and Norway have also announced that they would send military personnel to the island.
The increased military presence would include a range of exercise activities throughout 2026, according to the Danish defense ministry.
Avoiding a Zelensky moment at the White House
In their remarks to reporters, Rasmussen and Motzfeldt called the meeting respectful and emphasised that Denmark shared US concerns about Arctic security. But they firmly rejected the idea of the island becoming American.
While Trump has at times portrayed the island as besieged by Russian and Chinese ships, Rasmussen rejected that characterisation, saying “it is not a true narrative that we have Chinese warships all around the place.” The meeting presented an opportunity for Copenhagen and Nuuk to de-escalate the crisis and find a diplomatic path to satisfy US demands for more control, analysts said.
Noa Redington, an analyst and former political adviser to previous Danish premier Helle Thorning-Schmidt, said concerns were high in Denmark and Greenland that Motzfeldt and Rasmussen could be treated in the same way as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, when he suffered a public humiliation in a meeting with Trump — and Vance — at the White House in February 2025.
“This is the most important meeting in modern Greenland’s history,” he told Reuters.
Denmark and Greenland had originally sought a meeting with Rubio, hoping to have a discussion among top diplomats on resolving the crisis between the two Nato allies. But Denmark’s Rasmussen said Vance had also wanted to participate.
European diplomats had said the White House had for months brushed off Denmark’s attempts to engage on Greenland at a high level. Wednesday’s meeting was the first principal-level encounter between US and Danish officials on the issue.
Anxiety has been high in Greenland.
“I have been sleeping very, very badly, really,” said Liv Aurora Jensen, a craftswoman and designer in Nuuk, right before she watched the Motzfeldt and Rasmussen press conference on television.
“I was talking to my sister yesterday and I told her: ‘I’m trying not to get a panic attack.’”
‘We stand with the kingdom’ of Denmark, Greenland says
Greenlandic leaders appear to be shifting their approach to handling the diplomatic crisis. Until recently, they were stressing Greenland’s path to independence, but now their public statements put more emphasis on Greenland’s unity with Denmark.
“It’s not the time to gamble with our right to self-determination, when another country is talking about taking us over,” Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told Greenland daily Sermitsiaq in an interview published on Wednesday.
“That doesn’t mean that we don’t want something in the future. But here and now we are part of the kingdom and we stand with the kingdom,” he said.
Motzfeldt had a similar message.
“We choose the Greenland we know today as part of the Kingdom of Denmark,” she said in a statement released by the Danish ambassador to the US late on Tuesday.
Trump’s desire for Greenland contrasts with Americans’ opposition to annexation of the Arctic island, according to a new poll.
Just 17 per cent of Americans approved of Trump’s efforts to acquire Greenland, and substantial majorities of Democrats and Republicans opposed using military force to annex the island, the Reuters/Ipsos poll found.
Some 47pc of respondents disapproved of US efforts to acquire Greenland, while 35pc said they were unsure, in the two-day poll which concluded on Tuesday.</p><small>2026-01-15 06:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/142135075f6aa7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966944/us-announces-suspension-of-immigrant-visa-processing-for-pakistan-74-other-countries-from-jan-21' target='_blank'><strong>US announces suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan, 74 other countries from Jan 21</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: The US has announced a suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan and 74 other countries, effective January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations often rely on public welfare programmes.
The State Department said the freeze will remain in place until authorities can ensure that new immigrants will not draw on American taxpayer resources.







Officials described the measure as part of the administration’s “America First” approach.
“We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,” an official said.
State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said in a statement that his department “will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people“.
“Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassesses immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits,” he added.
Among the countries affected by the freeze are Somalia, Haiti, Iran, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, covering regions in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. All categories of US immigrant visas — including family, employment, and diversity visas — are impacted.
Impact on Pakistanis
The suspension could delay travel, study, and work plans for thousands of Pakistanis who annually seek US visas. Pakistani consulates in the US are expected to provide guidance to affected applicants in the coming days.
Public-charge rule
The visa freeze is linked to the US public-charge rule, which evaluates whether immigrants are likely to rely on government assistance. While suspensions of visa services have occurred in the past, officials said the scope of this action is unprecedented.
No timeline has been given for resuming visa services, but the State Department assured that countries would be notified once the review is complete.</p><small>2026-01-15 06:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645260-ojhri-camp-land-dispute-lhc-disposes-of-plea-approves-resolution-via-mediation' target='_blank'><strong>Ojhri Camp land dispute: LHC disposes of plea, approves resolution via mediation</strong></a><br><p>

KARACHI: While Mayor Murtaza Wahab outlined his plan to eventually dismantle the decades‑old water‑tanker system, officials at the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) voiced scepticism, saying it would not be possible to entirely shut down hydrants and end tanker services given the existing water infrastructure.
Talking to the reporters on Wednesday after inaugurating the Jehangir Road rehabilitation project, the mayor, who is also the chairman of the KWSC board, said that water tankers and hydrants have been operating in Karachi for decades, largely filling gaps where the piped water supply does not reach.
However, he stressed that the system has created inequities, with benefits flowing to select groups while blame is unfairly placed on the city administration.
“There is water in the city, but the real issue is its unjust distribution,” the mayor said, adding that his administration has already “shut down” several illegal hydrants.
He said that the contracts of seven legal hydrants have expired, leaving the city with a choice: renew the contracts or permanently close the hydrants.
Mr Wahab said that he had proposed a third option — the gradual dismantling of the hydrant and tanker system — but emphasised that such a step could not be taken without a comprehensive alternative plan.
“If hydrants are closed, how will water reach areas that depend on tankers? I have asked officials of the KWSC to develop a practical and citywide water supply strategy. We want to end this system, but responsibly,” he said.
According to the mayor, once the KWSC finalises its proposal, it will be presented to the City Council for approval. Only after formal approval will tanker services be phased out, and work on this strategy is currently underway.
Rejecting political motives behind the move, he said that his party had no hidden agenda. “This hydrant system was inherited. The beneficiaries are someone else, but the accusations are directed at us,” he said.
He acknowledged that Karachi faces a genuine water shortage but reiterated that equitable distribution remains the administration’s key objective.
‘Hydrants closure may hit DHA hardest’
According to sources who spoke to Dawn, the mayor was told in a meeting with the water utility’s senior management that a decision had to be made on renewing the hydrant contracts, which had already expired about seven months earlier.
They said the mayor had instructed the KWSC to consider shutting down the city’s hydrants in order to achieve a fairer distribution of water.
The sources said that closing the hydrants would not improve the city’s water supply, as only 15-20 million gallons of water daily (MGD), or 3.5 per cent of the total 650 MGD, was delivered through tankers.
They said that the proposed closure of hydrants would hit Defence Housing Authority’s 5, 6, 7 and 8 phases the hardest, because these areas relied almost entirely on tanker deliveries to meet their daily water needs.
A DHA resident said that people in those phases already faced limited line supply and were forced to buy water from tankers, and the situation would worsen if hydrants were shut down.

Presided over by Chief Justice of Pak­istan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the commission met at the conference room of the Sup­reme Court to make recommendations regarding the confirmation of additional judges as permanent judges of the PHC.
By a majority of its total membership, the JCP recommended the confirmations after due consideration of the relevant data forms, antecedents and evaluation of material placed before it.
The judges confirmed as permanent judges are Justice Muhammad Tariq Afridi, Justice Abdul Fayaz, Justice Salahuddin, Justice Sadiq Ali, Justice Syed Mudasser Ameer and Justice Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah.

Extends tenure of four others; PTI representatives skip com­mission’s sitting

Similarly, by a majority of its total membership, the commission recommended the extension of tenure for six months of four additional judges of the PHC, namely Justice Farah Jamshed, Justice Inamullah Khan, Justice Sabitullah Khan and Justice Aurangzeb.
PTI representatives Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar as well as Law Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Aftab Alam Afridi did not attend.

 

On Thursday, the JCP will meet again to consider the confirmation of 13 additional judges of the Lahore High Court.
In a separate development, the CJP, who is also president of the advisory board of the Al-Mizan Foundation, presided over a high-level meeting to review the ongoing projects spearheaded by the foundation.
The meeting was attended by retired Justice Mushir Alam, former judge of the Supreme Court and chairman of the administration committee; retired Justice Muhammad Tariq Abbasi, vice chairman; and the secretary of the Al-Mizan Foundation.
The meeting focused on reviewing the foundation’s welfare mandate and its alignment with sound policy, governance and financial sustainability. Established in 1995 as a welfare institution, the Al-Mizan Foundation provides structured support to serving and retired judges of the district judiciary, court staff and their families, including dependants of deceased beneficiaries.
The foundation operates under a defined governance framework to ensure transparency, accountability and long-term institutional viability.
The forum deliberated on key policy and administrative issues affecting the effective delivery of welfare services, including asset management, contractual and legal arrangements, financial compliance and taxation matters.
Particular emphasis was placed on adopting sustainable policy solutions to optimise the use of institutional assets and to ensure that welfare initiatives —especially in the sectors of health, education and employee facilitation —remain resilient, efficient and responsive to emerging needs.
The CJP also expressed appreciation for the forward-looking leadership of retired Justice Mushir Alam, noting that his stewardship has significantly strengthened the governance, policy coherence and institutional integrity of the Al-Mizan Foundation.
He also commended the contribution of Zia-ur-Rehman, the incumbent secretary of the foundation, for his professional diligence, administrative competence and reform-oriented approach.
It was acknowledged that the clarity of vision and disciplined oversight during this phase of institutional consolidation have contributed meaningfully to enhancing the foundation’s credibility, responsiveness and long-term sustainability as a welfare institution.

These include a 17 per cent unconditional and 33pc conditional reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, a 30pc increase in electric vehicle adoption, and a shift to 60pc renewable energy.
Meeting these ambitious goals will depend heavily on mobilising green-aligned investments, making frameworks like the Pakistan Green Taxonomy and robust ESG disclosure practices essential for guiding capital toward sustainable projects.
This was revealed during a session on Pakistan Green Taxonomy (PGT) and ESG Disclosure Guidelines hosted by the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI), which was attended by top business executives and industry stakeholders on Wednesday.







According to OICCI’s press release, the session was held in the backdrop of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan’s issuance of the revised ESG Disclosure Guidelines for listed companies, formally aligning them with the Pakistan Green Taxonomy. The move is aimed at strengthening sustainability reporting, enhancing transparency, and supporting Pakistan’s climate transition and environmental commitments.

 

The Pakistan Green Taxonomy (PGT), launched by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in 2024, provides a clear classification system for identifying activities that actively contribute to environmental objectives, including climate change mitigation, sustainable water use, ecosystem protection, pollution prevention, circular economy, and land management. Complementing this, the ESG Disclosure Guidelines, which will transition to mandatory reporting between 2029 and 2031, establish standardised metrics for financial and non-financial sustainability reporting.
On green financing, Farrukh Rehman, an expert on climate regulatory compliance, emphasised that integrating PGT into ESG reporting is a roadmap for businesses to align their operations with national climate objectives. Transparent and structured reporting will attract sustainable investment and enable companies to contribute to Pakistan’s environmental and social goals.

“We will make an appropriate order and may seek assistance from the parties if needed,” observed Justice Aamer Farooq, adding that the major issue before the court was how to proceed further in the matter.
Justice Farooq was heading a two-judge FCC bench hearing the case, which was initially taken up suo motu by the Supreme Court.
Earlier, the case was heard by a five-member SC bench in December 2022.

Court cites ‘slow investigation’, MLA agreement with Kenya

However, following the passage of the 26th Constitutional Amend­ment, it was first transferred to a six-member constitutional bench of the SC and later to the FCC after the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Arshad Sharif was shot in the head when Kenyan police opened fire on his car on the outskirts of Nairobi on Oct 23, 2022. He had left Pakistan in August 2022 after multiple sedition cases were registered against him in different cities.
On Wednesday, the FCC expressed its intention to close the proceedings after Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman informed the court that a Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) agreement had been signed between the governments of Pakistan and Kenya in September last year. He added that a request had already been sent for the Special Joint Investigation Team (SJIT), constituted specifically for the probe, to visit the crime scene.
The AAG recalled that the SJIT’s report had already been submitted to the court, adding that the Kenyan government had initially refused to assist in the investigation.
The law officer explained that the government would dispatch the SJIT once the Kenyan government allowed it to inspect the crime scene for further investigation. He added that the team would probe the journalist’s murder based on the evidence provided by the Kenyan government.
‘Slow investigation’
Justice Farooq observed that there was a difference in the manner in which the government and the court approa­ched the matter, adding that the investigation process had been slow, though blame could not be placed on anyone.
He questioned what further action the court could take now that a legal assistance agreement between the two countries had been signed.
During the hearing, the murder of MQM leader Imran Farooq in the United Kingdom was also referenced, with Justice Farooq recalling how Pakistani and British police jointly investigated that case.
However, the AAG argued that the nature of the Imran Farooq murder case was quite different than that of Arshad Sharif, adding that two suspects had already been nominated in the journalist’s murder.
He further stated that both the nominated suspects were still in Kenya and Pakistan had issued red notices through Interpol for their arrest and repatriation for further investigation.
The law officer said investigation on part of the investigating agencies in Pakistan has been completed for now. He also recalled that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had spoken with Kenyan President William Ruto on the phone about Arshad Sharif’s murder case in 2022.

LAHORE: The Punjab government on Wednesday announced a complete ban on the purchase of petrol and diesel vehicles across its departments, allowing only electric or hybrid modes of transportation in a move aimed at cutting emissions and accelerating the transition to clean transport.
The announcement was made by Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman in a statement issued here. However, it added that vehicles deployed for field duties had been exempted from the restriction.
Mr Zaman noted that a comprehensive electric vehicle (EV) policy for the province was expected to be announced shortly. He said the policy would reflect the provincial government’s commitment to environmental protection and the promotion of green energy.
New petrol pumps
As part of the same initiative, the approval of no-objection certificates (NOCs) for new petrol pumps has been made conditional on the installation of electric vehicle charging units.
“No new petrol pump will be allowed to operate without EV charging facilities,” the chief secretary stated.

 

The statement added that NOCs had already been issued through the e-Biz Portal for 170 new petrol pumps across 31 cities in Punjab, all of which are required to install EV charging units.
These include 29 petrol pumps in Faisalabad, 14 in Lahore, 10 in Bahawalpur, nine each in Khanewal and Bahawalnagar, eight each in Rawalpindi and Jhang, and seven each in Toba Tek Singh, Mianwali, Kasur, and Chiniot.
However, the chief secretary did not respond to a question on whether the policy decision banning the purchase of petrol and diesel vehicles was taken at any formal forum or was merely a statement.
S&GAD yet to notify move
It is learnt that no notification regarding the policy change banning the procurement of petrol and diesel vehicles and promoting the procurement of electric and hybrid vehicles has been issued by the Services and General Administration Department (S&GAD).
When contacted, an S&GAD Transport Wing official told Dawn that the department had neither received any formal approval for the change in policy nor issued any notification in this regard.
Answering a question, the official said discussions on shifting to electric and hybrid vehicles had been underway in the department for quite some time, in line with environmental and climate change initiatives.
The official added that the policy would take effect once formal approval is granted by the chief minister following the required process. The S&GAD would then issue a formal notification to launch the new policy.
‘Combating smog’
During a meeting with American business leaders, Senior Punjab Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the provincial government would now purchase only hybrid and electric vehicles as part of its smog mitigation measures.
“The government has decided to replace petrol vehicles in the official fleet with hybrid and electric vehicles,” she said.
According to a statement, the US delegation was given a comprehensive briefing on Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s vision and policy initiatives. It added that the American business leaders commended CM Maryam’s governance reforms and environmental policies.
They were informed about the provincial government’s policies and enforcement measures related to the shift towards electric and hybrid transport, brick kiln mechanisation, e-transport, official use of super seeders, and other practical reforms.
“For the first time, sectoral-level anti-smog measures have been introduced in Lahore, with the Planning and Development Department designated as the central policy hub,” Ms Aurangzeb said, adding that the city’s air quality had shown marked improvement.
To combat smog, she said, 41 monitoring stations had been installed, with the number set to reach 100 by June. The minister added that surveillance was being carried out through drones and thermal cameras. “A Smog War Room is monitoring industries, brick kilns, and vehicles around the clock, while Punjab Climate Watch is fully operational.”
The minister told the delegation that to control crop burning, 5,000 super seeders had been provided to farmers at a 60 per cent subsidy.
“A Nasa [US space agency] report has confirmed a 60 per cent reduction in smog levels.,” she said.
She further said 1,000 e-buses had been added across Punjab, with a decision taken to procure an additional 10,000 this year.

The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) held a meeting in the federal capital under the chairmanship of Mahm­ood Khan Achakzai, wherein the participants expressed concerns over the deteriorating regional situation. The participants urged the government to call an urgent joint session of parliament to form a national policy through collective wisdom.

 

They claimed that the international order was changing: the Israeli aggr­ession in Palestine and the conduct of the United States in Latin America have severely undermined international law.







They observed that imperial and colonial powers were tightening their grip around Pakistan’s neighbouring country, Iran, while the western media was creating an environment that could be used as a pretext to undermine Iran’s sovereignty.
The TTAP proposed that in view of the seriousness of the potential crisis and its possible impact on the region, the government should also convene a meeting of neighbouring countries to develop a joint and coordinated strategy to address these challenges.
PTI slams action against Adiala protesters
Meanwhile, the PTI denounced the use of force by the Rawalpindi police to disperse its sit-in outside Adiala jail on Tuesday night. The police, in a midnight operation, had used force to disperse the participants.
In a statement, the PTI said these actions constituted a grave assault on the Constitution, the rule of law and fundamental human rights, and reflected a systematic campaign of political victimisation designed to silence dissent. The party vowed that such conduct was unacceptable in any democratic society and would be vigorously challenged at every constitutional, legal and democratic forum.
The party claimed that family members of Imran Khan and party workers were present outside the jail to exercise their constitutional and legal right to meet their incarcerated leader, but the police suppressed this activity using force, intimidation and harassment.
“Peaceful party leaders and workers, along with Imran Khan’s sisters, were subjected to baton charges, manhandling and abuse. As a result of this inhumane operation, 11 male party workers were detained at the Rawat police station, while three women—Zulekha, Dr Asma and Sanaiya Safeer—remained in the custody of Rawalpindi Police,” it claimed. Similarly, the PTI stated that Advocate Raja Yasir, Adil, and Tanveer were also arrested.
Furthermore, the party stated that the Raw­alpindi police established checkpoints near Bahria Town, where citizens returning from Adiala were subjected to searches, with mobile phones snatched, women’s vehicles seized, and the windows of several cars smashed. The PTI alleged that the citizens were coerced into paying money to recover their mobile phones and vehicles from the police, while those who refused to pay bribes had their vehicles confiscated.
