Combs “viciously attacked” women when they resisted taking part in the parties, known as ‘freak offs’ or otherwise upset him, prosecutor Emily Johnson said during her opening statement in Manhattan federal court.
She told jurors they would hear testimony from victims who said Combs, 55, routinely beat them and exploded with rage at the smallest slights. The case has drawn intense media coverage because of Combs’ fame.
“They will tell you about some of the most painful experiences of their lives. The days they spent in hotel rooms, high on drugs, dressed in costumes to perform the defendant’s sexual fantasies,” Johnson said.
Defence lawyer Teny Geragos countered that prosecutors were trying to twist Combs’ romantic relationships into a racketeering and sex trafficking case.
“Sean Combs is a complicated man, but this is not a complicated case. This case is about voluntary choices made by capable adults in consensual relationships,” Geragos said in her opening statement.
Combs has pleaded not guilty to five felony counts of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on all counts, he faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years and could face life in prison.

Combs’ mother, Janice Combs, sat in the front row of the courtroom along with six of her son’s children. Combs wore a beige sweater over a white collared shirt and khakis. He smiled at his family and blew them a kiss before taking his seat with his lawyers.
Prosecutors have accused Combs of using his fame and fortune to abuse women. The defence is expected to counter that the activity described by prosecutors was consensual, and say there was nothing illegal about a “swingers” lifestyle in which Combs and his girlfriends occasionally brought a third person into their relationships.
Over the course of a two-month trial, jurors are expected to hear testimony from three and possibly four of the rapper’s female accusers, as well as his former employees who prosecutors say helped arrange and cover up his actions.
Latest entertainer to face #MeToo charges
Allegations of sexual abuse in the criminal charges brought against Combs by the Manhattan US Attorney’s office last year made him the latest powerful man in the entertainment industry to be accused of sexual misconduct in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak up about abuse.
Combs is known for turning rap and rhythm and blues artists like Notorious BIG. and Mary J Blige into stars, and in the process elevating the mainstream appeal of hip-hop in American culture in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Born in Manhattan’s Harlem neighbourhood and raised by a single mother, Combs went on to live in mansions in Miami and Los Angeles and host lavish parties for the cultural elite in destinations like the Hamptons and Saint-Tropez.

Prosecutors say his success concealed a dark side. Over two decades, Combs used violence and threats to force women to take part in the ‘freak offs’, according to the indictment.
Combs would often watch the performances, masturbate and film them, sometimes using the recordings as blackmail to ensure his alleged victims did not report his abuse, prosecutors say.
In one 2016 incident that was captured on hotel surveillance footage that prosecutors plan to show the jury, Combs was seen kicking and dragging a woman as she was trying to leave a ‘freak off’, prosecutors say.
CNN last year broadcast footage that appeared to show Combs attacking his former girlfriend, the rhythm and blues singer Casandra Ventura, in 2016 in a Los Angeles hotel hallway. Combs apologised after the video aired.
Cassie among first witnesses
Ventura, known professionally as Cassie, is among the first witnesses expected to testify against Combs.
Combs’ defence strategy at trial will hinge on undermining the credibility of the women who testify against Combs, including by arguing they were motivated by money to accuse him of wrongdoing and have unreliable memories.
Marc Agnifilo, Combs’ lead lawyer, has said the 2016 hotel incident depicted the aftermath of a dispute over infidelity and was not evidence of sex trafficking. In a court hearing on Friday, Agnifilo said Ventura had a history of domestic violence, undercutting prosecutors’ argument that she was a victim.
Ventura’s lawyer declined to comment.</p><small>2025-05-12 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604216-pakistan-army-issues-details-of-anti-india-operation-names-days-long-conflict-marka-e-haq' target='_blank'><strong>Army issues details of anti-India operation, names days-long conflict 'Marka-e-Haq'</strong></a><br><p>

“The prime minister thanks the emergency services for their work. The incident is subject to a live investigation and we will therefore not be commenting further,” a spokesperson for Starmer’s Downing Street office said.
Police said in a statement, without mentioning the British leader, that they were called to reports of a fire at around 01:35 local time (0035 GMT).
“Officers attended the scene. Damage was caused to the property’s entrance, [and] nobody was hurt,” London’s Metropolitan Police said. “The fire is being investigated and cordons remain in place while enquiries continue.”
The London Fire Brigade said it attended a “small fire”.
Starmer, who has a home in north London, has lived at his Downing Street office and residence since becoming prime minister last July.</p><small>2025-05-12 16:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12151939597dabf.jpg?r=152007' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509/india-and-pakistan-just-stepped-back-from-the-brink-of-war-heres-how-it-unfolded' target='_blank'><strong>India and Pakistan just stepped back from the brink of war. Here’s how it unfolded</strong></a><br><p>Drones, Rafales, JF-17s, and scathing rebukes — India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed states, witnessed one of their biggest escalations last week. While the neighbours are not new to conflict, this time, the breakdown in their relations was different, given the frequency and intensity of the aggression.
It began with the horrific killing of 26 tourists at a hill station in the Indian-occupied Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for the attack, an accusation the latter denies. Islamabad has since called for an international independent probe into the massacre.
However, on the night of May 6-7, New Delhi took things a step forward and launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns.
On Saturday, when tensions between the two countries peaked, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.
However, as a Dawn editorial puts it, “While foreign friends can certainly help create a conducive atmosphere, it is Islamabad and New Delhi that will have to do the heavy lifting themselves to secure peace.”
Here’s a timeline of how the latest conflict unfolded:
April 22: Gunmen shot and killed at least 26 tourists at Pahalgam resort in Indian-held Kashmir. At least 17 others are wounded. A group called Kashmir Resistance, which India accuses Pakistan of backing, claims the attack.
April 23: Pakistan’s foreign office released a statement expressing concern at the loss of tourists’ lives in the attack.
 
 

In swift measures taken following the attack, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan with immediate effect. The Attari border check post was closed, and Pakistanis in India under the Saarc Visa Exemption Scheme (SVES) had 48 hours to leave the country, while others could return by May 1. Defence personnel at the Pakistani High Commission in India were declared persona non grata and given a week to leave the country. The staff at the high commissions were also to be reduced.
Meanwhile, students from occupied Kashmir reported harassment and intimidation in other cities.
April 24: In its response, Pakistan called any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water per the IWT an “act of war”. In a slew of decisions, Islamabad suspended trade and closed the airspace with India. It also announced the closure of the Wagah border. Those who had crossed the border were ordered to return by April 30. All visas under the SVES issued to Indian nationals were cancelled with immediate effect, with the exception of Sikh religious pilgrims. Indian nationals in Pakistan at the time under SVES were instructed to exit within 48 hours.
Moreover, Pakistan also declared the Indian defence, naval and air advisers in Islamabad as persona non grata. They were directed to leave the country immediately, but not later than April 30, 2025. These posts in the Indian High Commission were deemed annulled. The support staff of these advisers were also directed to return to India. The strength of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad was to be reduced to 30 diplomats and staff members, with effect from April 30, 2025.
Meanwhile, the Indian Foreign Ministry announced that all Pakistani citizens in India must leave the country by April 29. India closed down the main border transit point and summoned Saad Ahmad Warraich, the top Pakistani diplomat in New Delhi. The Modi-led regime also blocked the Pakistani government’s X account in the country.
April 25: Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged fire overnight across the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir. Syed Ashfaq Gilani, a government official in Azad Kashmir, told AFP that there was no firing on the civilian population.
April 26: “Pakistan is open to participating in any neutral, transparent, and credible investigation (into the Pahalgam attack),” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said.
He also drew a hard line on the issue of water resources, stressing continued water flow under the Indus Waters Treaty as a red line. “Water is a vital national interest of Pakistan, our lifeline,” he said. “Any attempt to stop, reduce, or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan under the Indus River Treaty would be responded to with full force and might.”
April 28: Pakistan and India continued trading fire across the Line of Control, with each blaming the other for provocation. On the other hand, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan was ready for any incursion by India.
He added that Pakistan was on high alert and that it would only use its arsenal of nuclear weapons if “there is a direct threat to our existence”.
 


Separately, the Indian government banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels on recommendations from its Ministry of Home Affairs
April 29: Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan had “credible intelligence” reports that indicated India was planning to conduct military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours.
In a Senate session the same day, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said Pakistan would not strike India but reserved the right to retaliate.
In India, Prime Minister Nar­endra Modi gave his military “operational freedom” to respond to the Pahalgam attack.
April 30: According to Associated Press of Pakistan, Pakistani security forces delivered a robust response to India’s unprovoked ceasefire violation along the LoC, destroying an Indian checkpost after late-night aggression on April 29-30.
Sources told APP that the retaliatory strikes destroyed several bunkers, including the Chakputra post in India-held Kashmir. Separately, state media also reported that a “timely and swift response” by the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) had forced four Indian Rafale jets to retreat.
Pakistan also briefly closed the airspace over Gilgit-Baltistan, while India shut its airspace for all Pakistan-registered aircraft, or those owned and operated by Pakistani airlines or operators, including military craft.
May 1: Army chief General Asim Munir warned that any “misadventure” by India would be met with a quick and decisive response.
“Let there be no ambiguity: any military misadventure by India will be met with a swift, resolute, and notch-up response. While Pakistan remains committed to regional peace, our preparedness and resolve to safeguard national interests are absolute,” he was quoted as saying by the Inter-Services Public Relations.
The same day, authorities stopped tourists from entering Neelum Valley and other sensitive areas near the LoC in view of the security situation. All religious seminaries in the region were also ordered to remain closed for 10 days, while the owners of hotels, guesthouses, restaurants, and marriage halls have pledged to place their establishments at the military’s disposal in case India launches an attack.
Pakistan also announced that certain sections of airspace over the two largest cities — Karachi and Lahore — would remain closed for eight hours a day throughout the month of May.
May 2: The Indian government blocked access to the official YouTube channel of Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for users in India. It said the move was part of a wider crackdown on Pakistani digital content.
Separately, India also asked global multilateral agencies, including the IMF, to review funds and loans provided to Pakistan, as New Delhi sought “to corner the neighbouring state diplomatically”.
May 3: Pakistan conducted a successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450 kilometres.
The missiles were not fired toward the border area with India; they were normally fired into the Arabian Sea or the deserts of the southwest Balochistan province, the Associated Press reported.
AP added that India suspended the exchange of all mail from Pakistan through air and surface routes and banned the direct and indirect import of goods from the neighbour. It also barred Pakistani-flagged ships from entering its ports and prohibited Indian-flagged vessels from visiting Pakistani ports.
May 6-7: India launched Operation Sindoor, carrying out late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh. The Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project was shelled by Indian forces as well.
 
 

Pakistan took down five Indian jets, including three Rafale planes. Eight civilian deaths, 35 injured people and one missing person were reported.
Subsequently, the National Security Committee authorised the country’s armed forces to respond to Indian aggression at “time and manner” of their choosing, while unprovoked firing and ceasefire violations by Indian forces continued at the Line of Control.
Meanwhile, 21 airports were shut in northern and north-western parts of India until May 10.
May 8: DG ISPR said Indian drones were neutralised in the following locations: Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, Bahawalpur, Miano, Chhor, and near Karachi. Four army men were injured in this “serious serious provocation” by India, according to the military spokesperson. Around 30 drones were neutralised by Pakistan.
India’s government, on the other hand, claimed that 13 civilians were killed by Pakistani fire in “ceasefire violations” along their de facto border after violence escalated into artillery shelling following Indian strikes.
 
 

The UN renewed its call for “maximum restraint”. Countries from all over the world began talks with leadership from both countries and expressed “deep concern” over the issue, while encouraging both countries to exercise restraint. Flight operations at Karachi, Islamabad, Sialkot and Lahore airports were suspended. In Delhi, 90 flights were cancelled.
May 9: DG ISPR said Pakistan neutralised 77 Israeli drones sent by India. “We are taking each one of them out. Not one of them has been able to go back to India, and not one of them will be able to go back,” he said in a press conference.
He further stated that “if you are so fond of Pakistan firing at you, we will fulfil your demand at a time, place and means of our choosing”. He added that 33 people were slain and 76 injured in Indian attacks.
On the other hand, Pakistan postponed eight remaining matches of the Pakistan Super League X, while the Indian Premier League 2025 was suspended for a week.
May 10: India targeted the PAF’s Nur Khan (Chaklala, Rawalpindi), Murid (Chakwal) and Rafiqui (Shorkot in Jhang district) air bases, but the majority of them were intercepted by Pakistan’s air defence systems. Soon after, the Pakistan Airports Authority announced the closure of the country’s airspace till noon.
In the wee hours of the day, Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos was launched by Pakistan. In its response to Indian aggression, the military destroyed a storage site of the Brahmos missiles in India’s Beas region and the Udhampur airbase in India-occupied Kashmir as part of its retaliatory operation. According to Pakistani state media and security sources, Pakistan hit the following:

India’s power grid
Indian military intelligence’s training centre in IOK’s Rajouri
KG Top Brigade Headquarters
Uri field supply depot
Adampur, Udhampur, Pathankot, Suratgarh, Sirsa, Bhatinda and Halwara airfields, as well as the Akhnoor  aviation base
S-400 system in Adampur,
Brahmos storage site in Beas
Artillery gun positions in Dehrangyari, occupied Kashmir’s Mankot
Indian posts directly opposite in the Phuklian sector
Rabtanwali Post, Jazeera Post Complex, Kafir Mehri, Shahpar 3, and Ghadar Top across the LoC

Amid the attacks from both ends, talks continued in the back-end. At around 5pm, US President Donald Trump announced that both India and Pakistan agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire. The same was also confirmed by both the neighbours.
Air traffic across Pakistan resumed later that night.
May 11: In a press conference, DG ISPR Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry paid tribute to those who were martyred in Indian aggression and their families, while praying for the speedy recovery of the wounded.
He confirmed that Pakistan hit 26 Indian targets, including their air force and aviation bases at Suratgarh, Sirsa, Adampur, Bhooj, Nalia, Bathinda, Barnala, Halwara, Avantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Mamoon, Ambala, Udampur and Pathankot — all of which sustained major damage. He further added that the Barhmos facilities, which had fired missiles in Pakistan and killed innocent civilians, were also destroyed.

He added that Pakistan “never requested a ceasefire” and emphasises that the issue of Kashmir remains central to the dispute between Pakistan and India. The military spokesperson further confirmed that there was no ceasefire violation from Pakistan’s side but vowed to respond “if there is any aggression.”

In recent months, Karachi witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Surjani Town Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammed Ali Shah told Dawn.com that three persons were traveling in a car when a “speeding” dumper struck them on the Northern Bypass near Hamdard University.
“The police rushed to the scene after receiving information of the accident. Police found the car crushed beneath the dumper while the three occupants were found dead on the spot,” he added.
He continued that the driver managed to escape from the scene before police reached there.
“However, the suspect Gul Baig was subsequently arrested.”
The deceased were identified as Suleman, 60, his son Usama, 35, and Faraz Sikander, 40. The bodies were shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
In recent months, Karachi has witnessed widespread protests by residents, political parties and civil rights campaigners over the alarming increase in fatal incidents involving heavy vehicles mainly dumper trucks.
The provincial government has made efforts to control the menace of accidents in Karachi, including a ban on daytime movement of heavy vehicles, and imposing fines on reckless driving.
On April 18, the city administration extended the complete ban imposed on heavy vehicles in the city during daytime for another two months.
The ban on the movement of heavy vehicles was initially imposed for two months on Feb 14 in the wake of traffic accidents. While allowing heavy vehicles to operate in the city from 10pm to 6am, the city administration authorised the district and traffic police to register cases against the violators of the ban.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi said that vehicles carrying essential commodities such as water, cooking oil, medicine, oxygen cylinders for medical facilities, meat and other items were exempted from the ban.
3 murdered over family dispute
Three people were shot dead while two others injured when relatives fought against each other off National Highway, according to a police officer.
“A quarrel erupted between relatives over some personal enmity at Razzaqabad during which firearms were used, resulting in the death of three persons and injuries to two others,” Shah Latif Town SHO Mohammed Ameen Khoso told Dawn.com.
The three persons gunned down in the incident were identified as Usman Munsif, 20, Touqeer Siddiq, 25, and Touseef Bashir, 30. The injured include Noman Bashir, 20, and Munsif Latif, 45.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that two persons with gunshot injuries were brought dead at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) while the third one succumbed during treatment.
The SHO said the police arrested one suspect from the scene and a pistol was recovered from his possession. “The police are further investigating the triple murder and efforts are under way to arrest the remaining suspects,” he added.</p><small>2025-05-12 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1217330355f12d5.jpg?r=174859' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910555/as-trump-heads-to-the-gulf-israel-asks-where-the-us-stands' target='_blank'><strong>As Trump heads to the Gulf, Israel asks where the US stands</strong></a><br><p>Israeli officials have put a brave face on President Donald Trump bypassing them on a Middle East trip this week, but his decision to do so is the latest to sow doubt in Israel about where the United States stands in Washington’s priorities.
On Sunday, a few days after announcing plans for an expanded military operation in Gaza, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said it had been informed by the US of an agreement to release American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, after talks between Washington and Hamas that did not include Israel.
Trump, who will be visiting Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, also caused consternation in Israel last week by abruptly announcing the US would stop bombing Houthis in Yemen, days after a Houthi missile hit near Israel’s main airport.
“The message to the region was clear: Israel is no longer a top US priority,” wrote Itamar Eichner, diplomatic correspondent for Israeli news outlets Ynet, echoing media commentators across the political spectrum.
One Israeli official said Trump’s announcement on the Houthis was “kind of an embarrassment” and that the president acts “for good and for bad”.
Israel has been talking to the US about the post-conflict future of Gaza, and officials say relations at the official level remain strong, but some officials acknowledge being blindsided by Trump’s decision-making.
One senior official in Netanyahu’s circle, who declined to be identified by name, said there was “chaos” in the Trump administration, with everything dependent on what the president decided at any given moment.
Sometimes that helped Israel, and sometimes it did not, the official said.
The decision on the Houthis, which was not discussed with Israel beforehand, compounded Israeli unease at US talks with Iran over Tehran’s nuclear programme, which could blunt any Israeli threat of military action against its arch-enemy.
Israel faced further alarm after Reuters reported that the US was no longer demanding Saudi Arabia normalise ties with Israel as a condition for progress on civil nuclear cooperation talks.
“We coordinate. It doesn’t mean you must fully agree 100 per cent on every issue,” Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said on Sunday.
“The US is a sovereign state. Israel is a sovereign state. But I believe we have a very, very big common ground of positions with this administration, more than in the past.”
In March, Trump’s hostage negotiator, Adam Boehler, held what Hamas described as “very helpful” meetings with the Palestinian fighter group that bypassed Israel and focused on releasing Alexander.
Last week, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee denied that Trump was distancing himself from Israel. He said the relationship was often described as ironclad and “that word is still operative”.
“The president has been consistent in his support and his partnership, and I have no reason to believe that that won’t continue,” he said.
‘Chaos’
Netanyahu and his government faced criticism today even as Israelis looked forward to Alexander’s release, with a growing perception in the public that the two allies had differing priorities.
“There’s just no leadership now,” said Tel Aviv pensioner Jack Gottlieb.
There was “no question” the deal happened behind Netanyahu’s back or that the US and Israeli agendas currently differed, he said.
“Right now, it’s every man for himself,” Gottlieb said.
Netanyahu had little choice but to accept the decision on the Houthis, who signalled they would not stop trying to hit Israel by firing another missile a few days later.
Israel has relied on US military and diplomatic support since its creation as an independent state in 1948. Any weakening of US interest, as Israel faces international pressure over the Gaza bombardment, would be a severe blow.
The decision to drop the demand for a normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, to get past Riyadh’s insistence that Israel agree to moves towards a settlement with the Palestinians, underlined how damaging the issue has been for Israel internationally.
Adding Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which both normalised relations with Israel under the Abraham Accords signed during Trump’s first term, has been a major goal for Netanyahu but is now seemingly delayed indefinitely.
Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, faced bitter criticism from Israeli hardliners after stopping exports of some heavy munitions used in Gaza and imposing sanctions on violent Israeli West Bank settlers.
By contrast, Trump, in his first term, defied world opinion by moving the US embassy to Jerusalem, which Israel regards as its capital, and recognised Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights, which it seized in the 1967 Middle East war.
Israeli officials have said previously that they were aware there were risks for Israel in a president as unpredictable as Trump and one who has shown no compunction in turning on historic US allies.
“But we don’t have a choice,” said one.</p><small>2025-05-12 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1217324638ab41c.jpg?r=173307' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910551/uk-govt-toughens-immigration-plans-as-hard-right-gains' target='_blank'><strong>UK govt toughens immigration plans as hard right gains</strong></a><br><p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed on Monday to “finally take back control” of Britain’s borders as his government unveiled policies designed to reduce legal immigration and fend off rising support for the hard right.
Labour leader Starmer announced he was ending an “experiment in open borders” that saw net migration rise to nearly one million people under the previous Conservative government, which lost last year’s general election.
The government’s Immigration White Paper policy document includes plans to cut overseas [care workers][2] and increase from five to 10 years the length of time people will have to live in UK before qualifying for settlement and citizenship.
English language rules will also be strengthened, with all adult dependents required to demonstrate a basic understanding, while the length of time students can stay in the UK after completing their studies will be reduced.
Starmer said the policies would “finally take back control of our borders”, recalling the pro-Brexit slogan used at the height of the campaign to leave the European Union in 2016.
 
 

Labour vowed in its general election manifesto last year to significantly reduce net migration, which stood at 728,000 in the 12 months to last June.
It had peaked at 906,000 in 2023 after averaging 200,000 for most of the 2010s.
 
 

Starmer, a former human rights lawyer who voted for the UK to remain part of the EU, is under renewed pressure to tackle immigration following the anti-immigration Reform party’s gains in recent local elections.
Arch-Eurosceptic Nigel Farage’s party won more than 670 local council seats as well as its first two mayoral posts. It is also riding high in national polls, while Labour is struggling.
However, Starmer’s tack to the right on immigration risks alienating Labour’s large base of liberal supporters, with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens picking up votes on the left.
The premier said that migrants “make a massive contribution” to Britain but alleged the country risks becoming an “island of strangers” without more controls.
He added that he wanted net migration to have fallen “significantly” by the next election, likely in 2029, but refused say by how much.
“Every area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control,” he told reporters at a Downing Street press conference.
‘Higher standards’
The white paper also includes new powers to deport foreigners who commit offences in the country.
Currently, the government is only informed of foreign nationals who receive prison sentences.
Under the new arrangements all foreign nationals convicted of offences will be flagged to the government.
“The system for returning foreign criminals has been far too weak for too long,” interior minister Yvette Cooper said on Sunday.
“We need much higher standards.” The paper also includes new visa controls requiring foreign skilled workers to have a university degree to secure a job in the UK.
And to reduce lower skilled migration Cooper has said she aims to cut 50,000 lower-skilled worker visas this year.
On the plans to double the length of time before migrants can make settlement or citizenship requests, high-skilled individuals “who play by the rules and contribute to the economy” could be fast-tracked, according to Downing Street.
Starmer said Britain has “had a system that encourages businesses to bring in lower-paid workers, rather than invest in our young people”.
Care England, a charity representing the adult care sector, said the decision to close social care visas to new applications from abroad was a “crushing blow to an already fragile sector”.
“International recruitment wasn’t a silver bullet but it was a lifeline.
Taking it away now, with no warning, no funding and no alternative is not just short-sighted — it’s cruel,“ said chief executive Martin Green.
Starmer is also under pressure to stop the flow of migrants crossing the Channel from France to England on flimsy rubber dinghies.
More than 36,800 made the journey last year, according to British government figures, with several dozen dying.

Up to 1,400 people died in July 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the opposition, according to the United Nations.
Hasina lives in self-imposed exile in India, where she fled by helicopter, and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.
“The investigation team has found Sheikh Hasina culpable in at least five charges,” Mohammad Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor at Bangladesh’s domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), told reporters.
“They have brought charges of abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy, and failure to prevent mass murder during the July uprising.”
Tajul Islam said the prosecution had submitted its first report to be presented at the court set to try Hasina and two of her aides — former home minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal and ex-police chief Abdullah Al Mamun.
“Sheikh Hasina directly ordered law enforcement agencies and auxiliary forces aligned with her party to kill and maim, and to burn corpses and even people who were still alive at certain points,” he added.
The ICT was set up in 2009 by Hasina to investigate crimes committed during the country’s independence war against Pakistan.
Investigators have collected video footage, audio clips, Hasina’s phone conversations, records of helicopter and drone movements as well as statements from victims of the crackdown as part of their probe.
Bangladesh’s interim government on Saturday banned Hasina’s party, the Awami League, pending the outcome of the trial.
The decision was taken to ensure the country’s “sovereignty and security” as well as the safety of the protesters, plaintiffs and witnesses of the tribunal, Asif Nazrul, a government advisor on law and justice, told reporters.

“The 12th PKK Congress has decided to dissolve the PKK’s organisational structure and end its method of armed struggle,” the group announced in a statement after holding its congress last week.
The PKK’s announcement to dissolve itself heeds a call by its founder Abdullah Ocalan, jailed on an island off Istanbul since 1999, who urged his fighters in February to disarm and disband.
In a letter, Ocalan urged the PKK to hold a congress to formalise the decision.
Days later, the PKK’s leadership accepted Ocalan’s call, declaring a ceasefire.
In a speech on Saturday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted that news about a dissolution could come at any moment, adding that his government was determined to “save our country from the scourge of terrorism”.
“We are advancing with firm steps on the path to the goal of a terror-free Turkiye,” he said.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the dissolution, calling it a significant step toward lasting peace and a terror-free Turkiye.
 






“This historic development reflects the unflinching resolve of the Turkish leadership, under my dear brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Turkish nation, to continue their march forward towards reconciliation, unity and stability,” the premier said in a post on X.
“Together, Pakistan and Turkiye remain committed to root out terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” he added.
 
 

The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkiye, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984.
Its original aim was to carve out a homeland for Kurds, who make up about 20 per cent of Turkiye’s 85 million people.
Since Ocalan was jailed, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives.</p><small>2025-05-12 12:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12153512d902e2f.jpg?r=153539' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910505/psx-jacks-up-record-9pc-as-ceasefire-with-india-calms-investors' target='_blank'><strong>PSX jacks up record 9pc as ceasefire with India calms investors</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) gained a record nine per cent on Monday — the restored calm in the market mirroring that in the region after the recent Pakistan-India ceasefire that boosted investor mood.
Saturday’s ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed four days of tit-for-tat strikes between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.
The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of 9,929.48 points, or 9.26pc, to stand at 117,104.11 points from the previous close of 107,174.63 at 9:30am. Due to the massive gains, the PSX was suspended for an hour after opening to control excessive volatility.
Later in the day, the benchmark index reached as many as 117,327.78 points — 10,153.15 points (9.47pc) higher than yesterday’s close, at 3:15pm. This marked the highest intraday gain (points-wise) — more than double the 4,700 points surge in November 2024.
Finally, the KSE-100 closed at 117,297.73 points, with a gain of 10,123.10 points (9.45pc) compared to the previous close.

“The market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective deterrence against India,” noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.
“The PSX has saluted the Pakistan Air Force this morning with a surge of over 9pc in the KSE-100 Index,” he remarked, in reference to the PAF’s actions in response to India’s strikes.
Additionally, Farooq noted that the recent interest rate cut and the approval of $1 billion tranche by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) “further fueled investor enthusiasm”.
Commenting on the future investor mood, Farooq said market participants were now expected to shift their focus towards the upcoming federal budget for the next fiscal year, which is expected on June 2.
 
 

Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, listed three main reasons for the robust market activity.
Other than the ceasefire and the IMF’s green light to the disbursement, Tariq mentioned US President Donald Trump’s recent statement on increasing trade with Pakistan.
After mediating the halt of hostilities between the South Asian arch-rivals, Trump not only offered his help in resolving the Kashmir dispute but also announced he would “increase trade substantially” with both Pakistan and India.
Pakistan’s international bonds also recorded strong gains today, adding as much as 5.7 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed.
On May 8, when tensions deepened as Pakistan took down 25 drones sent by India into the country, the KSE-100 suffered the largest-ever plunge of nearly 6,500 points in absolute terms. The intraday low of 8,410 points was the second-largest single-day drop (points-wise).
Prominent industrialist Arif Habib, told Geo News at the PSX in Karachi, “We have already achieved macroeconomic stability, which has made Pakistan’s economic story presentable and better.”
He also highlighted the interest rate cut and the IMF’s approval as contributors to the positive market activity.
 


On the ongoing political situation, Habib said it was a good opportunity for “these political matters” to be discussed and settled in the parliament. “There will be no more obstacles for Pakistan’s progress then,” he stressed.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, pointed out the heightened possibility of further improving ties with Gulf countries due to Pakistan’s enhanced geopolitical position.
“This brief conflict has also demonstrated our military and technological superiority over India, strengthening our geopolitical position. As a result, it is likely to enhance ties with Gulf countries amid regional tensions and support growth in our defence and technology exports,” Ashraf told Dawn.com.
 
 

While noting the investor zest in light of the Pak-India “conflict ending with dominance”, he said the attention was now expected to shift towards improving macroeconomic indicators, including historically low inflation and a record-high current account surplus.
Pakistan’s consumer inflation rate plunged to an all-time low of 0.3pc year-on-year in April, while the $1.195bn current account surplus in March was the highest-ever monthly surplus.
Indian benchmarks eye best day in nearly a year
Meanwhile, Indian shares also rallied today.
India’s benchmarks jumped over 3pc and were on track to log their best session in almost a year after the country reached and held a ceasefire with Pakistan.
The Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex gained about 3.25pc each to 24,787.8 and 81,958.04, respectively, as of 1:12pm IST (12:42pm PKT), on track to recover the 1.5pc they lost since India’s strikes on Pakistan on May 7.
 
 

If gains hold, the benchmarks will log their best single-day jump since June 5, 2024, when markets surged after the ruling National Democratic Alliance’s victory in the national elections.
“Assuming the ceasefire is adhered to by both countries, we keep all our macro forecasts unchanged,” Barclays said in a note.
“We see India grow at a solid 6.5pc year-on-year in FY25-26, benefitting from relative insulation to global trade uncertainty and strong progress in ‘trade talks’ with the US administration,” it added.
All 13 major sectors logged gains today. The broader small- and mid-caps rallied 4pc and 3.6pc, respectively.</p><small>2025-05-12 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12144433859552f.jpg?r=144535' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910531/bjp-workers-vandalise-karachi-bakery-in-indias-hyderabad' target='_blank'><strong>BJP workers vandalise Karachi Bakery in India’s Hyderabad</strong></a><br><p>The workers of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vandalised Karachi Bakery in India’s Hyderabad over its name on Saturday, prior to the ceasefire announcement between the two neighbouring countries amid heightened tensions, Indian media outlet The Wire reported.
The vandals wore saffron shawls, stepped on Pakistani flags and chanted anti-Pakistan slogans, The Wire said, adding that there was footage of them striking the bakery’s sign with sticks, to target the word ‘Karachi’.
The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe. Following the allegations, India launched a series of drone strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties.
Both sides then launched missiles at each other, which stretched over the week before US President Trump announced that a “full and immediate ceasefire” was reached between the two countries.
A police official K Balaraju was quoted by The Wire as saying: “A couple of BJP workers showed up outside the Shamshabad Karachi Bakery within the RGI Airport Police Station limits at about 3 pm. They raised slogans and took issue with the bakery’s name. They tried to damage the signboard.”
He added that the suspects were detained but were later released as the owner did not want to press charges.

The bakery has been a renowned establishment in Hyderabad since 1953 and its name refers to the founder’s hometown prior to partition, according to The Wire. The outlet said that the bakery has continued to operate across India under this name despite various similar incidents during times of Pakistan-India tensions.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Balaraju was quoted as saying: “No employees at the bakery were harmed. No serious damage was done.”
Another branch of the Karachi Bakery was also targeted earlier, where the “protesters were seen planting tricolour flags”, the outlet added.
A manager of the bakery told The Indian Express, “We are an Indian establishment. We cannot be branded Pakistani.”</p><small>2025-05-12 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12135652eed78c5.jpg?r=140102' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910528/us-china-agree-to-slash-tariffs-in-trade-war-de-escalation' target='_blank'><strong>US, China agree to slash tariffs in trade war de-escalation</strong></a><br><p>The United States and China announced on Monday an agreement to drastically reduce tit-for-tat tariffs for 90 days, de-escalating a trade war that has roiled financial markets and raised fears of a global economic downturn.
After their first talks since US President Donald Trump launched his trade war, the world’s two biggest economies agreed in a joint statement to bring their triple-digit tariffs down to two figures and continue negotiations.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the weekend talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and international trade representative Li Chenggang as “productive” and “robust”.
“Both sides showed a great respect,” Bessent told reporters.
US President Donald Trump had imposed duties of 145 per cent on imports for China last month — compared to 10pc for other countries in the global tariff blitz he launched last month.
Beijing hit back with duties of 125pc on US goods.
Bessent said the two sides agreed to reduce those tariffs by 115pc, taking US tariffs to 30pc and those by China to 10pc.
In their statement, the two sides agreed to “establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations”.
China hailed the “substantial progress” made at the talks.
“This move… is in the interest of the two countries and the common interest of the world,” the Chinese commerce ministry said, adding that it hoped Washington would keep working with China “to correct the wrong practice of unilateral tariff rises”.
 


The dollar, which tumbled after Trump launched his tariff blitz in April, rallied on the news while US stock futures soared. European and Asian markets also rallied.
The trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has rocked financial markets, raising fears the tariffs would rekindle inflation and cause a global economic downturn.
‘Bodes well for the future’
The head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, praised the talks on Sunday as a “significant step forward” that “bode well for the future”.
“Amid current global tensions, this progress is important not only for the US and China but also for the rest of the world, including the most vulnerable economies,” she added.
Ahead of the meeting at the discreet villa residence of Switzerland’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Trump had signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an “80% Tariff on China seems right!”
However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally, saying China would also need to make concessions.
The Geneva meeting came days after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with Britain, the first with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs.
The five-page, nonbinding deal confirmed to nervous investors that Washington was willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties.
But Trump maintained a 10pc levy on most British goods, and threatened to keep it in place as a baseline rate for most other countries.</p><small>2025-05-12 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604172-india-resumes-operations-at-32-airports-after-ceasefire-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan asks Junaid Akbar to 'step down' as PAC chairman</strong></a><br><p>

The development spending stood at Rs448.6bn in the first 10 months (July-April) of fiscal year 2025, accounting for less than 41pc of Rs1.1 trillion revised budget allocation for the whole year.
The lack of spending suggests a large part of the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) — revised down from Rs1.4tr to Rs1.1tr — would remain unspent at the end of the fiscal year in June.
The ministry’s monthly data released on Sunday showed funds given to parliamentarians were the only exception to the otherwise paltry spending.

Finance ministry pushes back date to surrender unspent funds by a month

The utilisation of funds at Rs35bn was even higher than the first revised allocation of Rs25bn for the current year.
 
 

A mechanism devised by the finance ministry for the current fiscal year dictated the government should release 15pc of the budgeted allocation of PSDP in the first quarter, followed by 20pc in the second quarter, 25pc in the third and the remaining 40pc in the last quarter.
Under the mechanism, the estimated release for PSDP by April end should be at least 73pc of the annual allocation or around Rs805bn — almost two times the actual spending.
All the 36 federal ministries, divisions and their agencies could spend only Rs339bn in 10 months.
The Planning Commission, however, claimed it had authorised Rs638bn for disbursement to federal ministries in the first 10 months in line with the finance ministry’s instructions. However, only Rs339bn could actually be spent on the ground.
The provinces and special areas, merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, saw the least spending with Rs100bn — 36pc of their annual allocation of Rs277bn.
Water Resources Division, which had the single largest allocation in PSDP at Rs170bn, could spend only Rs72.5bn,  despite securing 100pc authorisation from the planning commission.
The two major corporate entities, National Highway Authority (NHA) and National Transmission & Dispatch Company (NTDC), spent only Rs109.4bn in ten months against their joint allocation of Rs255bn.
The power sector, on the other hand, utilised Rs53bn in ten months or around 55pc of Rs94.5bn annual allocation.
The climate change division spent only Rs1.5bn out of Rs5.256bn allocation.
The Planning Commission, which is actually the custodian of the development programme, could itself only spend Rs3.85bn out of the allocated Rs19bn.
The data showed at least five ministries — commerce, communications, narcotics control, religious affairs divisions and Special Investment Facilitation Council — failed to spend any money.
Early funds surrender
The finance ministry had already directed all other ministries and divisions to finalise revised estimates for the outgoing fiscal year, devise budget estimates for the upcoming year and “surrender anticipated savings” by April 30.
This was the first time that finance ministry had ordered surrendering funds sought two months before the end of the fiscal year. The move may disrupt routine operations of the public sector.
In the past, the last date for funds surrender used to be May 31 when the ministries, departments and corporations had clarity on their financing requirements for the last month of fiscal year.
The ministry said the deadline has been advanced on the directives of the Public Accounts Committee.

And the war takes its toll on all involved: both the aggressors and their targets.
The ongoing military conflict between India and Pakistan will indeed leave an adverse impact on the latter’s fragile, recovering economy, but it will not spare India’s either.
The heavy costs of the conflict for India will extend far beyond the battlefields and severely undermine its longstanding ambition to position itself as a global economic powerhouse and attractive destination for companies looking to shift production from China. The military damage would be nothing compared to the losses India’s economy would have to bear.
Finance Outlook India has argued that the military funding decisions of India and Pakistan reflected their economic objectives. India will spend $80 billion in 2025 to modernise its military forces. Pakistan’s defense expenditures are projected to reach $11bn which places financial strain on its struggling economy.
“Investing heavily in defence often diverts resources from critical sectors such as health and education, creating long-term economic challenges,” the website quoted Shazia Malik, a defence analyst at Global Security Solutions, as saying.

‘The potential for a devastating conflict with Pakistan remains a latent risk to India’s rise on the global stage’

The war between the countries creates lasting economic damages that surpass basic military budget costs, it added. “The disruption of trade combined with reduced investor trust leads to monumental economic costs, which hinder regional development. Both countries and the entire area will benefit from diplomatic initiatives taking precedence over military confrontation.”
 
 

The hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared up on Saturday morning after Islamabad launched retaliatory strikes against multiple military targets in India hours after a failed Indian attempt to target Pakistani air bases in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and Jhang.
Ever since New Delhi had hit six civilian targets in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir in unprovoked attacks under its ‘Operation Sindoor’ on May 7, Islamabad had constantly warned it against escalation and made its intent to use its right to retaliate at a “place, time and manner of our own choosing” quite clear.
At least 31 civilians, including minors and women, had lost their lives in the attacks. In response, Pakistan took down five Indian jets, including three French-made Rafael, besides destroying an Indian brigade headquarters.
However, India did not stop at that despite claiming that “it would not escalate from here”. During the next couple of days, it again violated Pakistan’s territorial integrity by launching kamikaze drone attacks in multiple cities across Punjab and Sindh before targeting airbases in the wee hours of Saturday.
Initial state media reports suggested that Pakistan had targeted key Indian military installations in a “befitting response” as part of its retaliatory operation “Bunyan-un-Marsoos” in response to “India’s initial attack, which was an assault on our homeland, people and sovereignty,” a federal government statement said, referring to the earlier Indian missile strikes against airbases.
 
 

At the time of writing this, the state media has reported that Pakistan had inflicted massive damage on India, destroying their S-400 defence system, strategic airfields, and military supply and storage sites in addition to rendering 70 per cent of India’s power grids inoperative in a cyber attack.
Commenting on post-Pahalgam hostilities between India and Pakistan, S&P Global Ratings had on Thursday said that the ongoing conflict between the pair posed increased risks to both nations’ credit metrics —though immediate credit rating impacts are not expected with potential sovereign credit support deterioration if tensions escalate. The report suggested neither nation would benefit from extended tensions.
A sustained military conflict would create obstacles for India in attracting international investors looking to reorganise their production operations there during the current uncertain economic climate. It said a prolonged conflict could complicate efforts by foreign investors looking to expand in the country and diversify their supply chains.
A note by Moody’s on Monday said that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan would weigh on Pakistan’s economic growth, adding higher defence spending would also impact India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”. “Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses,” it added.
India has a lot at stake if any escalation on the border with Pakistan goes out of control and leads to a broader conflict, Abhishek Gupta, India economist with Bloomberg Economics, had said in a note. “That may dent investors’ confidence in India as a safe haven from Trump’s tariffs, and capacity constraints at the political level may shift the focus away from the economy.”
Although Pakistan’s economic woes have made it less relevant on the international stage, it still had the potential to disrupt India’s efforts to become an export-oriented nation that is a key piece of the global supply chain, especially as it looks to attract companies from China, according to Pramit Pal Chaudhari, South Asia practice head at Eurasia Group.
“This adds to your risk premium… For India, these add to the image that you don’t want,” a Bloomberg report quoted him saying. The report also quoted analysts from India that “the potential for a devastating conflict with Pakistan remains a latent risk to India’s rise on the global stage”.
At the heart of the conflict is the longstanding dispute over Kashmir. Many across the world anticipated an escalation of tensions as soon as India blamed Pakistan — without any evidence, though — for involvement in a deadly militant attack in Pahalgam, a tourist destination in occupied Kashmir, on April 22.
In spite of Islamabad’s denial and offer for its complete cooperation in a neutral probe into the event, the Narendra Modi government amped up its anti-Pakistan rhetoric led by the Indian media. New Delhi immediately downgraded bilateral diplomatic relations, completely cut off trade ties, and pledged to take “punitive” action against Islamabad.
More crucially, New Delhi unilaterally and illegally “held in abeyance” the 64-year-old Indus Waters Treaty, threatening to strangulate Pakistan’s economy and food security. The weaponisation of the water treaty against the lower riparian practically amounts to an act of war, as rightly pointed out by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
 
 

The political rhetoric by the Modi government also led to widespread anti-Muslim riots in India and Occupied Kashmir as people raised questions about security lapses and the BJP government’s Kashmir policy, including the revocation of the valley’s autonomy in 2019.
While wreaking major economic destruction across the two countries with worldwide consequences, further escalation in the armed conflict between the nuclear nations would lead to catastrophic human loss.
Even though several countries have been actively trying to convince India to de-escalate, the world does not seem to be taking it seriously. It is time for the world to effectively intervene to preempt any catastrophic outcome from the conflict.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has correctly emphasised that “the world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan.” The US has called upon both Pakistan and India to hold “direct talks” to bring down tensions and said it will support any effort, including a neutral probe, to ensure the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack are brought to justice.
But it has so far refused to intervene directly. The world must realise that when nuclear-armed nations are fighting, all it takes is a miscalculation or a mistake. The risk increases if you have a madman like Modi taking such decisions.

In a post on X, the Indian Cricket Board, BCCI, announced the farewell of the former captain, saying that “His contributions to #TeamIndia will forever be cherished!”
 






While Kohli’s final Test wrapped up a 3-1 Test series defeat by Australia in January that saw India relinquish the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in a decade, he will be remembered most for his spell as captain between 2014-2022.
Kohli won 40 of his 68 tests in charge of India to become the country’s most successful skipper in the format and sits fourth in the list of captains with the most Test victories.
Only Graeme Smith (53), Ricky Ponting (48) and Steve Waugh (41) won more tests as captains.
India suffered only 17 defeats with Kohli at the helm as he guided the side to the final of the inaugural World Test Championship in 2021, where they lost to New Zealand.
He was also part of the team that lost the second World Test Championship final to Australia in 2023.
“I’m walking away with a heart full of gratitude — for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,” he added.
“I’ll always look back at my Test career with a smile.”
India’s next Test assignment is a five-match series in England from June 20.</p><small>2025-05-12 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604156-need-for-caution-on-trumps-kashmir-offer' target='_blank'><strong>Need for caution on Trump's Kashmir offer</strong></a><br><p>

• Claims he was on duty with a pilot from Mian Mir area
LAHORE:  A driver serving in the Pakistan International Airlines’ (PIA)  Limousine service continues to face arrest and court hearings, ever  since he was picked up after being “spotted near the Lahore corps commander’s house” on May 9, 2023.
Shah Din, claims he was on official assignment, to pick up a PIA pilot from his residence in the Mian Mir locality.
He  drove from The Mall towards the cantonment area and, on the suggestion  of traffic police, proceeded towards Rahat Bakery and then turned  towards CMH Hospital to reach the airport.
There, he was  caught up in the crowd as PTI workers and supporters launched their  violent protest at the intersection outside the corps commander’s residence.
 
 

But in the meanwhile, he was spotted in the vicinity on  CCTV footage and through geo-fencing, and eventually booked and  arrested.
The PIA Lahore Airport scheduling officer had written a  letter to the SHO Sanda Police station soon after the arrest that the  driver was on an official duty to pick up cockpit crew for the Jeddah  flight on May 9, 2023 from his residence in Mian Mir. He requested the  police officer that the driver be released as he was not involved in any  illegal activities
The Airport Limousine Services (Pvt) Ltd also  issued a certificate in September, 2023 explaining that he was on  official duty on May 9. They requested that the driver be released.  However, the requests went in vain and the elderly driver is still  facing the unending ordeal.
Penning down the nightmare he is  facing, Mr Din has written a statement that he is working as a driver at  the Lahore Airport and in possession of a service record, official ID  card and official letter.
On May 9, 2023, he claimed to be on an official duty and picked up PIA Pilot Captain Salahuddin Yousaf from  his residence in Mian Mir Colony and left for the airport.
Near Rahat  Bakery, he said, he saw a massive traffic jam and he changed the route.
“I received calls from my home and told family members that he had  safely reached the airport and dropped the pilot for his Lahore-Jeddah  flight PK-759,” he stated and added that he reached home after  completing his duty. “All the information is available on the PIA  record.”
After four days, he said, police raided  his residence on May 14, desecrated the sanctity of four walls and  arrested him for riots on May 9. He was taken to Burki and investigated  for three days.
However, Mr Din stated that he was booked under  FIR 1570/23 (Mughalpura police station), produced before an  anti-terrorism court and eventually sent to the Camp Jail.
In a  two-page statement, Mr Din stated that he was granted bail on May 27 on an application filed by his children. However, he lame­nted that he  was re-arrested as soon as he came out of the jail. He said that he had  developed serious heart ailment due to mental and physical torture while  in detention.
Mr Din said he was later released but his  ordeal did not end as he was arrested for the third time on Oct 16 after  being booked in an FIR 96/23 at Sarwar Road police station and was kept  in jail for over six months before he was released on bail.
He said that he has so far attended 42 court hearings.

The new pope, elected on May 8, called for an  “authentic and lasting peace” in Ukraine, a ceasefire in Gaza, and the release of all Israeli prisoners.
Speaking in fluent Italian, Leo also welcomed the recent fragile ceasefire between India and Pakistan, negotiated overnight, and said he was praying to God to grant the world the  “miracle of peace.”   “No more war!” the pope said, repeating a frequent call of the late Pope Francis and noting the recent 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two, in which some 60 million people were killed.
Leo said today’s world was living through  “the dramatic scenario of a Third World War being fought piecemeal,” again repeating a phrase coined by Pope Francis.
Tens of thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square and on the Via della Conciliazione leading to the Vatican broke into applause at the call for peace on what was a joyous occasion despite Leo’s solemn message.

The new pontiff welcomes ‘fragile’ ceasefire between India and Pakistan

The new pope said he carries in his heart the  “suffering of the beloved people of Ukraine.”  Hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed direct talks with Ukraine aimed at ending the bloody three-year war, Leo appealed for negotiations to reach an  “authentic, just and lasting peace”.
The pope also said he was  “profoundly saddened” by the war in Gaza, calling for an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid and release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas.
Leo said he was glad to hear of the recent India-Pakistan ceasefire and hoped negotiations would lead to a lasting accord between the nuclear-armed neighbours. He added:  “But there are so many other conflicts in the world!”
Marching bands
Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, is the first US-born pontiff and was a relative unknown on the world stage before his election. He previously served for decades as a missionary in Peru before first becoming a cardinal to take up a senior Vatican role two years ago.
Leo’s first Sunday address coincided with a previously planned pilgrimage to Rome by marching bands from around the world. Minutes before the pope addressed the crowd, bands marched up the broad boulevard leading to the Vatican playing songs such as Y.M.C.A. by the Village People, the theme from the film Rocky, and music by John Philip Sousa, who composed the marching classic  “Stars and Stripes Forever”.
Peruvian Gladys Ruiz, who lives in Rome, was among the crowd in the square, estimated at more than 100,000 by Italian authorities. Calling Leo a  “Peruvian pope” Ruiz said his election is  “a great honour for us”. Leo has dual citizenship, having gained Peruvian citizenship in 2015.
Also present were Dennis Gilligan and wife Maureen from Boston, Massachusetts, visiting Rome for their anniversary. He said he had passed up an opportunity to see Pope John Paul II when he visited Boston in 1979.
“I regretted it all my life,” he said.  “This was very moving.”  The crowd was also entertained by bands from Italy, Mexico and other parts of Latin America who came to Rome for the ongoing Catholic Holy Year. In all of his appearances since his election, Leo has not made any mention of the country of his birth, angering some US conservative commentators.

PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said India carried out a “shameful and unprovoked aerial assault” on Pakistan on the night between Tuesday and Wednesday.
The PTI leader said the “imposed and cowardly government” waited four days before issuing any official response to Indian aggression.
 
 

“This criminal delay led to the loss of precious lives and the blood of our brave martyrs is on the hands of imposed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his puppet administration,” said Mr Ayub, who is also the opposition leader in National Assembly.
The opposition leader, however, lauded the armed forces for their professionalism, while crediting former prime minister Imran Khan for modernising the PAF’s defence capabilities.
Imran’s release
Mr Ayub said former premier was the “strongest and most compelling voice” against Indian PM Narendra Modi’s ideology and Indian aggression.
“Only Imran Khan can lead Pakistan out of crisis and unite the nation — his immediate release is critical for Pakistan’s stability,” he said.
A post on PTI’s official X account also reiterated the demand for his release. “He fought Pakistan’s case with courage and conviction in 2019, and the nation needs his leadership now,” said the post.

The participants also condemned the Indian aggression, calling it a blatant provocation and a violation of international norms.
The rally, which began from the party office called Insaf House on Sharea Faisal, drew a large number of PTI workers and supporters from different parts of the city.
However, when the rally reached near the Finance & Trade Centre (FTC), it found the city administration and police blocked the main road leading to the ‘Red Zone’ by parking police mobiles and water tankers on Sharea Faisal.
The closure of the road caused a massive traffic jam. Consequently, the PTI rally had to change its route, made a left turn towards Kala Pul and reached Nishan-i-Pakistan near Seaview via DHA.

Party leaders and activists condemn Indian aggression, celebrate victory

The rally gained momentum as district-level PTI workers and supporters joined the main procession.
The rally was led by PTI-Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh and attended by city president Raja Azhar, Dr Masroor Siyal, Karachi General Secretary Arsalan Khalid and Senior Vice President Faheem Khan, along with other senior leaders.
The participants carried national and party flags, chanting slogans like “Pakistan Zindabad” and “Imran Khan Paindabad”.
The speakers and participants of the rally demanded the immediate release of the party’s founding chairman Imran Khan.
They described Mr Khan not only as a political leader but as the true voice of the people. They reiterated their commitment to peaceful protest and national solidarity.
In a symbolic move, the participants also hoisted an effigy of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi using a crane, as a message against what they termed India’s cowardly acts of aggression.
The crowd also chanted slogans against Modi and expressed their firm resolve to defend the country as a united nation.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI-Sindh president Haleem Adil Sheikh demanded the immediate release of former prime minister Khan, calling him “the true leader of the Pakistani nation” and “a symbol of resistance against oppression”.
He urged the judiciary and the government to uphold justice and democracy by ending what he described as political victimisation.
Mr Sheikh strongly condemned India’s recent actions, labelling them as a blatant provocation and a violation of international standards.
“We want to send a clear message today that the people of Pakistan stand united against any threat to our sovereignty,” he said.
“This rally is not just about protest — it’s a declaration that the nation stands with its armed forces and against the cowardly aggression of Modi’s government,” he added.
Later, the participants dispersed peacefully after offering prayers for national unity, the security forces and the early release of PTI’s jailed leadership.

• Residents complain no water for 12 days
• Utility spokesperson claims supply to city restored, areas getting water on schedule
KARACHI: While Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has recently taken notice of the water crisis and instructed the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) to restore normal supply, several localities in all the seven districts of Karachi have still been facing a severe water crisis since the leakage of an 84-inch main on Karachi University campus on April 29.
Despite the completion of the repair work on the ruptured line, water woes of the people across the city have yet to come to an end as restoration of normal supply to the affected areas has been delayed due to filling of the repaired line with water under low pressure.
Although the CM had directed the KWSC to restore normal water supply from Saturday, sources in the KWSC said that it might take several more days to resume proper supply.
The city that requires over 1,200 million gallons of water daily (MGD) got only 400 MGD water, or around 40 per cent out of the regular supply of 650 MGD, due to repair work for the past 12 days.
 
 

The persistent water shortage piled miseries on people in the sweltering weather, leaving many with no option but to buy water on exorbitant rates.
The affected neighbourhoods include Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Sheme-33, PECHS, Bahadurabad, Tariq Road, Chanesar Town, Jinnah Town, Liaquatabad, Nazimabad, Pak Colony, Golimar, Shershah, old city area, Landhi, Korangi, PAF Base Masroor, etc.
The KWSC had initially said that the repair work on the ruptured pipeline would be completed in 96 hours. However, the repair took more time due to replacement of 32-foot piece of the damaged line.
A spokesman for the water utility claimed that normal water supply to the city had been restored and different areas were being supplied as per the schedule.
However, residents in different localities said that there was not a single drop of water in their taps for the past 12 days, making their life miserable.
A resident of PECHS, Zaid Rabbani, said that no water had flowed in their locality since the water main burst at the university. “We somehow arranged water tanker, but after paying additional price,” he said.
Residents of several localities said that the water supply was restored in their areas for a very short time.
Tauseef Ali Shah, a resident of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, said the supply was restored hardly for an hour. “The pressure was also too low
and we could have only two buckets of water,” he lamented.
Sources in the water utility said the water pressure was kept low initially after the completion of the repair work as a precaution in view of the repair work on the damaged line.
They said the entire distribution network of the water utility had gone completely dried during the repair work and now the water level in different main lines in the city had got normal.
The sources said that the situation would normalise within a couple of days.
Leakages in main lines have been frequent as all main lines of different diameters, ranging from 48 inches to 84 inches, were laid in 1956 and 1971 across the city.

The ceasefire announced on Saturday allayed the fears of broader escalation but the wife of an Indian Border Security Force (BSF) trooper captured by Pakistan last month is perturbed about her husband.
She has asked her government if her ‘sindoor’ would be returned.
Sindoor is a vermilion mark worn mostly by rural Hindu women in their hair parting to depict their marital status.
Indian news publication The Wire reported that the family of 34-year-old Purnam Sau in Rishra, West Bengal, was hoping diplomatic efforts would help his return.
Sau, posted with the 24th Battalion of the BSF in Firozpur, Punjab, was deployed along the India-Pakistan border on April 23, when he assisted local farmers in evacuating a vulnerable zone and reportedly crossed the international boundary inadvertently.
The event took place at a time when tensions were high between India and Pakistan after 26 tourists were killed in a terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22.
Pakistani forces reportedly deta­ined him and later released a photograph showing him blindfolded, confirming his capture, The Wire said.
At their modest home in Rishra in Hooghly district, Sau’s family is reeling from shock and uncertainty. His wife, Rajani Sau, seven months pregnant, collapsed while narrating her ordeal.
“My husband has been captured by the Pakistani army. He is in their custody. They have released a blindfolded photo of him,” she sobbed.
“BSF officers visited our home and told us they are trying to bring my husband back. But now the situation is like a war. I don’t know what news will come next!”
Purnam’s last call to Rajani was on the night of April 22, hours before his arrest, when he checked in on her health, as he often did after night shifts.
“So many days have passed, and there’s still no word from him,” she said.
At the mere mention of Operation Sindoor, Rajani broke down, pulling her veil over her face as she wept, “Give me back my sindoor, government!”
Purnam’s father, Bhola Sau, a retired security guard, voiced frustration at the silence following initial military assurances.
“We went to Firozpur with my daughter-in-law, and the army officers promised they were trying [to bring Purnam back]. Now, there’s no update.”
Sau’s mother said her son “served the nation” for 18 years. “Today, we feel abandoned.”
The incident has united Rishra’s tight-knit, largely non-Bengali migrant community, descendants of jute mill workers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
Locals have taken turns to visit the family’s home, where TV screens blare news updates around the clock.
“We’re torn. On one side, war cries; on the other, we beg for peace and Purnam’s safe return. We’ll celebrate with sindoor only when he’s home,” shared Purnam’s brother, Shyamsundar Shau.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed hope last Monday for a swift resolution from the Home Ministry. Hooghly MP Kalyan Banerjee confirmed he raised the issue with BSF commanders.

• Pakistan welcomes US offer, says settlement must be under UNSC resolutions
• FO says committed to regional peace, security, interested in boosting trade ties with US
WASHINGTON: As hostilities between Pakistan and India come to an end with the help of the US, Pakistan on Sunday welcomed a proposal by President Donald Trump expressing willingness to play an active role for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute by working with both South Asian countries with an aim to put an end to this perennial conflict.
Diplomacy and pressure from the United States helped secure the ceasefire deal on Saturday evening, but within hours of its coming into force, both sides started blaming each other for violations. The reported shelling died down by Sunday dawn.
President Trump, in a statement posted on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, praised the leadership in New Delhi and Islamabad for agreeing to a ceasefire and credited the US efforts for facilitating this “historic and heroic decision”. “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,” the US president said in his message.
 


In a swift response to the remarks made by President Trump, Pakistan’s Foreign Office acknowledged with “appreciation the constructive role played by the United States, alongside other friendly states, in supporting the recent ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India”.
The FO in a statement said that Islamabad appreciated President Trump’s expressed “willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute — a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond”.
“Pakistan reaffirms that any just and lasting settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and must ensure the realisation of the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including their inalienable right to self-determination,” said the statement, adding that Pakistan was committed to engaging with the US and the international community to promote peace, security, and prosperity in the region.
“We also look forward to deepening our multifaceted partnership with the United States, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, and economic cooperation,” it added.
Mr Trump’s Kashmir statement came a day after India and Pakistan agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire along the Line of Control and International Border, following what the US president described as a “long night” of negotiations facilitated by Washington.
 
 

The ceasefire, which came into effect on Saturday, was endorsed by Indian and Pakistani officials shortly after the initial declaration by Mr Trump. Tensions had spiked after Indian forces struck targets in nuclear-armed Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir last week. The flare-up raised fears of a wider regional conflict.
Referring to the role his administration played in defusing the crisis, Mr Trump said, “I am very proud of the strong and unwavering leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom, and fortitude to understand that it was time to stop the aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many.”
He warned that “millions of good and innocent people could have died” if both sides had failed to seize the moment. “Your legacy is greatly enhanced by your brave actions. I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,” he added.
While the Kashmir issue was not explicitly mentioned in the ceasefire announcement, Mr Trump emphasised his intention to stay engaged on the broader dispute. “I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be found regarding Kashmir,” he wrote, adding that he also intended to “increase trade substantially with both of these great nations”.
He also previously referred to Kashmir as a “thousand-year” dispute, a term initially seen as a mistake but later “interpreted” as a way of stressing the deep-rooted and complex nature of the conflict.
“I am very close to India and I’m very close to Pakistan, as you know. And they’ve had that fight for a thousand years in Kashmir. Kashmir has been going on for a thousand years, probably longer than that…” he told reporters last month.
 
 

Several senior US officials and Republican lawmakers celebrated the ceasefire and credited President Trump for what they described as a landmark moment in regional diplomacy.
“I am incredibly proud to serve alongside Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. This historic administration is working every day to achieve peace. The golden age is coming, and it starts with peace throughout the world,” said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who is expected to be nominated as US ambassador to the UN, said this was “progress toward stability in a historically volatile region. It won’t be easy, there will be violations, and much work remains to be done, but it is another step in President Trump’s commitment to peace.”
Although India has long resisted third-party involvement in Kashmir, Trump’s repeated references to the conflict — and his offer to work toward a resolution — mark a notable shift in US engagement with South Asia’s most enduring flashpoint.

• Indian military dodges question about loss of fighter jets
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s armed forces on Sunday said they struck 26 Indian targets in ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ to re-establish deterrence after India violated Pakistan’s airspace earlier this week and separately targeted air bases in early-morning strikes.
In a press conference alongside Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed and Naval Staff (Operations) Deputy Chief Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz, Pakistan Army’s chief spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the operation.
He said the dastardly attacks began on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including women, children and the elderly. He said one Pakistani aircraft was slightly damaged during the Indian missile attack.
“Twenty-six military targets, along with facilities in India used to target Pakistani citizens and entities involved in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan, were engaged in both Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and mainland India,” he said in the presser.
 


Gen Chaudhry said Pakistan’s response was a “textbook demonstration” of integrated tri-services, enabled by real-time situational awareness, network-centric warfare capabilities and seamless multidomain operations.
“The targets included air force and aviation bases at Suratgarh, Sirsa, Adampur, Bhooj, Nalia, Bathinda, Barnala, Halwara, Avantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Mamoon, Ambala, Udampur and Pathankot — all of which sustained major damages,” he added.
The DG said Brahmos facilities, which had fired missiles in Pakistan and killed innocent civilians, were also destroyed.
 
 

India launched a series of strikes under ‘Operation Sindoor’ soon after the Pahalgam tragedy in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, in which 31 people were martyred. Pakistan’s military responded swiftly, downing five Indian jets, destroying Indian brigade headquarters, and check posts in the occupied Kashmir along the Line of Control.
The ISPR chief paid tribute to those who were martyred in the Indian aggression and their families, while praying for the speedy recovery of the wounded.
“We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every officer, soldier, airman and sailor of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who made this success on the battlefield possible through their courage, professionalism and sacrifice.”
The military spokesperson particularly thanked the youth of Pakistan — “who became the frontline soldiers as information and cyber warriors of the country” — and the media that stood as a “steel wall” against the Indian media. He also appreciated politicians for their support to the army during these times and lauded the premier for taking “destiny-changing decisions” during this testing time
War not an option

Responding to a question about who first requested for the ceasefire, the DG ISPR said: “Put it on record that Pakistan never requested for a ceasefire.”
He warned that there was no space for a war between two nuclear-armed nations. “if anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation,” he added.
He said: “This is why you saw how in this conflict Pakistan acted in a very mature manner and through conventional forces, we maintained escalation control, through conventional forces we gave them a two notch up response while also ensuring that the Pakistan forces employed on the counterterrorism operations … no pull is also exerted on them.”
IAF airfields hit
Air Vice Marshal Ahmed, while describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.
 
 

“I must appreciate the leadership … they were resolute and clear in giving instructions to all of us and that is perhaps the reason why we were so sure about what we had to do,” he said.
“With unprecedented reach, precision and lethality, while avoiding collateral, the PAF hit maximum number of IAF airfields in a single operational package since 1971 because they crossed the international border,” the officer said.
“While reestablishing deterrence, Pakistan negated the setting of a new normal under the hegemonistic design of a supremacist regime through swift and effective response.”
Sea frontiers
Vice Admiral Rab Nawaz said the Pakistan Navy was able to defend the country’s sea frontiers from a “numerically superior enemy”.
He gave details of the navy’s readiness to thwart any attack from the sea. He said there was a hype that INS Vikrant (Indian fleet) was approaching Karachi. “We were keeping a very close eye on the activities at sea […] we were monitoring it from day one,” he added.
 
 

“On the night of May 6 and 7, it was close to Bombay and on May 9, it was essentially 400 nautical miles from the Pakistani coast and it retreated close to Bombay,” he said.
“If a carrier gets within 400 nautical miles, it simplifies our problem. The navy maritime air arm was proper ready to generate a response at all times. If there was any aggression from the sea we were ready to respond effectively,” he said.
Indian military dodges question
Indian military officers, meanwhile, said that the objectives of ‘Operation Sindoor’ were achieved, with ‘high-value terrorists’ being eliminated, but dodged a question whether they had lost a bunch of warplanes in the operation.
The officers, speaking at a press conference, provided key details on Operation Sindoor, its impact and results, saying that the “objective has been achieved”.
Air Marshal AK Bharti, DGMO Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, Maj Gen SS Sharma and Vice Admiral AN Pramod addressed the press. Responding to reports that Rafale fighter jets were downed, Air Marshal AK Bharti did not confirm or deny the claims, stating instead that “losses are a part of any combat scenario”.
The Indian military said, “We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is that ‘have we achieved our objective’? Answer is a thumping yes. As for details, at this time I would not like to comment on that, as we are still in combat, and give advantage to (our) adversary. All our pilots are back home.”
