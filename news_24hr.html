Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on 7 May, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul, COAS Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.”
Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.
“The onus of ensuing escalations — one that may ultimately bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond — will squarely lie with India.”
“Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators,” COAS Munir warned.

“With diminishing distinctions between conflict and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India’s geographic warspace.
“The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses inflicted will be much beyond the imagination and calculation of the perpetrators of chaos and instability,” he said.
“The battle-hardened army, which has fought for over two decades in the sub-conventional domain, has successfully displayed its capabilities in the conventional domain, as well as by delivering a swift and decisive blow to the adversary,” he said.
 
 

“Ever since the creation of Pakistan, the armed forces, with full support of the nation, have defended the external and internal frontiers of the country with unfailing resolve, conviction and pride.
“The most recent display of this spirit and resolve of the armed forces of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq [and] Operation Bunyan um Marsoos has further strengthened the trust and confidence of the people of Pakistan in the competence and far-reaching capabilities of its armed forces by neutralising all threats with remarkable professionalism,” COAS Munir said, referring to the four-day May conflict with India.

“Downing advanced […] Rafales, targeting multiple bases including S-400s, and showcasing multi-domain warfare capabilities, Pakistan has displayed its capabilities and will to defend,” COAS Munir asserted.
 
 

He further said that “people of hues and colours, age, gender, ethnicity or creed, stood firm and tall like a wall of steel, leading to a renewed spirit of patriotism and national fervour, which prevails across the length and breadth of Pakistan”.
“Our collective success has re-energised and strengthened the proud and illustrious memories of our earlier successes. Pakistan once again came out victorious against a treacherous enemy marked by strategic blindness and naivety, and filled with hubris and rhetoric about its misguided hegemonic ambitions.
“India’s eagerness to adjudge culpability, aversion to neutral investigations and staking self-created evidence was indicative of politicisation of terrorism for vested interests of the ruling regime,” he added.
 
 

COAS Munir went on to say, “Pakistan, on the other hand, gained deep admiration of the people of Pakistan and the international community because of the legitimacy and the clear victory against a numerically superior adversary.
“Internally, it has further unified our nation and strengthened our resolve to defend against any threat, whether external or internal. It has reinforced confidence, particularly amongst the youth, that the armed forces of Pakistan are an essential element of national power and trusted with the responsibility to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state,” he said, assuring the nation that “we will not lose an inch of this sacred land”.
He commended the “valour of the people of Pakistan — every soldier, sailor, airman; the brave men, women and children and the elderly who laid their lives during these testing times; and the warriors who fought with the utmost conviction to defend their motherland at all costs”.
“The national leadership, the bureaucracy, scholars, scientists, media, academia, and most importantly, the youth deserve rich tribute for standing firmly against aggression,” the army chief added.
The army chief also spoke on Pakistan’s economy, hailing the government’s “relentless efforts” for relative stability and noting that positive economic indicators were attracting investments from across the world.
“The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future. Our vibrant youth, filled with talent, is making marvels in a multitude of domains.”
 
 

He also reiterated his cautions about social media, calling on people to be cognisant of threats “proliferating via digital media, populist anarchism and social subversion”.
“Unfortunately, in the post-truth era in which we live, perceptions bear more weight than reality and half-truths spread faster than facts. Your strength will lie in thinking critically and discerning fact from fiction,” he said, urging them to not become “tools of disinformation”.
Choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS tells Kabul
The army chief also reiterated Pakistan’s stance that India “continues with state-sponsored terrorism”.
“Our adversary’s use of Fitna al-Hind and Fitna al-Khawarij as hired guns exposes its … hypocritical and heinous face to the world. Equally disconcerting is the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan,” he said.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Urging the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS Munir urged the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”.
 
 

“Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”.
Speaking on occupied Kashmir, the army chief said India’s “oppression and widespread atrocities” in the valley will also come to an end. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s diplomatic and moral support for the Kashmiris’ freedom struggle till the resolution of the dispute in accordance with United Nations’ resolutions.

‘Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser’
During his address, COAS Munir noted that the world was witnessing “increased fragility and volatility, with a discernible shift towards violence as an instrument for attaining political objectives”.
“Amidst the chaos, Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser. Our relations with key global and regional powers, particularly Muslim countries, have further strengthened.”

The army chief stated that Pakistan had persistently “proven to be a key contributor toward peace and stability in the region and beyond”, highlighting Pakistan’s armed forces’ contributions to UN peacekeeping missions.
He also mentioned the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, terming it a “reinforcement and formalisation of Pakistan-Saudi brotherhood and a step towards ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East and South Asia”.
COAS Munir said Islamabad had also made “humble contributions towards peaceful steering of the negotiations with Iran”, adding that Pakistan’s relations with all Muslim countries were “thriving at an exponential” rate.
Hailing Pakistan’s historic “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership“ with China, the army chief also noted: “Re-energisational and strong and growing relations with the United States of America are an encouraging and welcome development.”
He lauded US President Donald Trump, saying that his “personal efforts and strategic leadership to bring peace to multiple conflict-prone areas of the world are really praiseworthy”.
“We will further nurture these relations with key global and regional players for the interest of peace, security, and development.”
 
 

COAS Munir also assailed Israel for its “blatant aggression, genocide and forced displacement waged upon Palestinians”.
Highlighting Pakistan’s “significant” role in the diplomatic efforts to secure the recent peace in Gaza, the field marshal said Pakistan expects the ceasefire to continue, followed by a smooth flow of humanitarian relief and the reconstruction of Gaza.
“Pakistan stands by its principled stance of indispensability of the two-state solution and the need for an independent, sovereign and viable State of Palestine based on pre-1967 war borders, with Al Quds Sharif as its capital,” he reaffirmed.
‘Enemies hell-bent upon driving a wedge between people, armed forces’
Addressing the cadets, he highlighted that they were being commissioned into “one of the finest armies across the world, which is second to none, respected by all and sundry”.
“This demands your absolute loyalty to [Pakistan, to the armed forces and the sacred task being entrusted onto your shoulders,” he underscored.
“Remember, our enemies are hell-bent upon driving a wedge between our people and the armed forces for their ulterior motives. Let me remind them that the bond between the people and the armed forces is unshakable,” the field marshal asserted.
He told the cadets that nothing should be more sacred than the safety and security of the people of Pakistan and no duty more binding than the defence of the country.
“The defence doctrine of Pakistan is predicated on credible deterrence and perpetual readiness, encompassing the full spectrum of capabilities. As a professional standing army, our conventional prowess through constant doctrinal and technological evolution has been optimised into a dynamic, integrated and adaptive force,” the army chief said.
Underscoring the need for intellectual readiness and technological advancements, COAS Munir told the cadets to “embrace innovation, life-long learning and adaptability to meet modern threats”.
At the outset of his address, the army chief extended his warm greetings and appreciation to the “immaculately turned-out gentlemen and lady cadets for the outstanding display of professionalism and discipline”.
He also expressed his compliments to the cadets from friendly countries of Malaysia, Nepal, Palestine, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Yemen, Mali, Maldives, and Nigeria for “successful completion of the formative training at this prestigious institution”.
“This is a moment of pride for you and all of us, reflective of the strong bond of military cooperation and international camaraderie,” COAS Munir said.
He highlighted that the PMA’s role “as a cornerstone of military excellence has always remained commendable, and the standards exhibited today are no less reflective of the same”.</p><small>2025-10-18 13:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18175626c184791.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949734/flights-suspended-at-dhaka-airport-due-to-fire-media-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Flights suspended at Dhaka airport due to fire: media reports</strong></a><br><p>A fire broke out in the cargo section of Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka on Saturday, forcing the suspension of all flights, local newspaper The Daily Star reported.
Citing Talha Bin Zasim, an officer at the Fire Service and Civil Defence Media Cell, 36 firefighting units are already working to douse the flames, the report added.
“All our aircraft are confirmed safe. Further updates will be provided as the situation develops,” the newspaper reported, citing a spokesperson for the airport.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The airport did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Daily Star, citing fire service sources, reported that the fire erupted in the cargo section near Gate 8 of the airport around 2:30pm local time (1:30pm PKT).
“Meanwhile, according to the [Bangladeshi] Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Bangladesh Civil Aviation Authority, Bangladesh Fire Service, Bangladesh Navy, and two fire units of the Bangladesh Air Force are working to extinguish the fire,” the report read, adding that two platoons from the Bangladesh Border Guard were also involved in firefighting efforts.
Sources at Dhaka Airport told The Daily Star that at least five flights scheduled to land in Dhaka were diverted to Shah Amanat International Airport in Chattogram and Osmani International Airport in Sylhet.
“The airfield at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka will remain closed until 6pm today,” the report read quoting Mohammad Ibrahim Khalil, the public relations officer at Shah Amanat International Airport.
Due to the closure, two flights operated by US-Bangla Airlines and two by Biman Bangladesh Airlines were diverted to Shah Amanat airport, The Daily Star reported. With the latest diversions, a total of eight domestic and international flights landed at Shah Amanat airport.
The newspaper added that authorities said the diverted flights will return to Dhaka once the situation normalises, as outbound passengers were left waiting at Hazrat Shahjalal due to the suspension of flight operations.</p><small>2025-10-18 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/181745139ec8a91.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949732/punjab-extends-province-wide-section-144-for-another-week-citing-security-threats' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab extends province-wide Section 144 for another week citing security threats</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Home Department on Saturday extended the imposition of Section 144 across the province for another week, citing security threats amid continuing tensions with the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a legal provision that empowers district administrations to prohibit an assembly of four or more people in an area for a limited period. It was imposed on Thursday till today amid the government’s crackdown on the TLP following its violent protests.
A complete, province-wide ban was imposed on the display of all kinds of weapons, use of loudspeakers, and publication and distribution of inflammatory, hateful or sectarian material. The ban did not apply to wedding ceremonies, funerals and burials, and loudspeakers could only be used to deliver sermons in mosques and call for prayers.
The Home Department’s order issued today said it was evident that the “threat perception to public peace, tranquillity and law and order has not abated” upon review of the latest reports and threat assessments discussed by law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
A statement from the Home Department spokesperson said the order was issued in view of concerns regarding terrorism and public safety.
“Due to security threats, public processions and sit-ins could become soft targets for terrorists. Miscreants could exploit public protests to carry out anti-state activities to fulfil their nefarious objectives,” it added.
“The continuance of the restrictions is deemed essential to prevent any potential disturbance to public order, sectarian strife, or commission of any offence, and to ensure the safety and security of the lives and property of the general public,” the order reads.
 






After tensions, violence and chaos prevailing for several days, Punjab remained largely peaceful on Friday as no incident of violence or hostile gatherings was reported in any part of the province in response to the call given by the TLP to its workers to take out rallies in protest against the police action at Muridke.
The TLP even failed to bring its workers onto the roads in Lahore, where it had been holding violent protests during the last few days. Reports suggest that the Punjab police successfully established the writ of law in the provincial capital and other cities where traffic and businesses remained running, while students attended their educational institutions as per routine on Friday.
People were witnessed shopping in the city markets, while the outlets of multinational companies, especially the fast food joints, also remained open.
A large-scale pre-dawn operation by law enforcement agencies on Monday to dismantle TLP’s protest camp in Muridke had sparked violent clashes, widespread chaos, and multiple arrests. The party had set out for what it described as a “Gaza solidarity” march, pledging to reach Islamabad and protest outside the US embassy.
As per the official figures, as many as 2,716 people were arrested after the Muridke operation. Out of these, some 251 were taken into custody by Lahore police and 178 by Sheikhpura police.
Even as police intensify their crackdown on the group following the events that transpired in Muridke, the authorities have decided to take a series of measures to “neutralise” the threat the TLP has posed to the law enforcers and non-Muslim communities since its inception.
The decision to limit the activities of the party are being linked to some crucial meetings, where the TLP’s tainted record of violent agitations, fatal attacks on the law enforcers, as well as ransacking of Christian and Ahmadiyya places of worship, came under discussion.
Tallal Chaudhry, the minister of state for interior, has said action against the TLP protesters will be taken in a manner similar to that of those involved in the May 9, 2023, riots, which led to a country-wide crackdown on the PTI.
The federal government had previously imposed a ban on the TLP in April 2021 on the recommendation of the Punjab government.
The ban was later revoked in November that year upon the request of the Punjab government, days after a deal was reached with the group to end its violent protest march to Islamabad.
Restrictions were also briefly imposed on the TLP in June 2023, when the party was carrying out a long march from Lahore to Islamabad. Restrictions lifted under an agreement reached on June 17, 2023, included a ban on the party’s coverage on electronic and social media.</p><small>2025-10-18 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18184232b3a4752.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949724/rain-forces-another-stop-as-pakistan-lose-half-their-side-in-must-win-new-zealand-world-cup-encounter' target='_blank'><strong>Rain forces another stop as Pakistan lose half their side in must-win New Zealand World Cup encounter</strong></a><br><p>Rain halted play yet again in Colombo shortly after Pakistan lost their fifth wicket against New Zealand in their ICC Women’s World Cup encounter on Saturday.
In a must-win clash to keep alive their faint semi-final hopes, Pakistan were 92-5 after 25 overs when showers forced the players off the pitch at the R. Premadasa Stadium.
An earlier stoppage in play due to the rain had reduced the innings to 46 overs a side with a 9-over play as Pakistan returned to continue their batting from 52-3.
 






Earlier, Pakistan were put into bat after losing the toss and were unchanged from their last encounter against England on Wednesday.
Opener Muneeba Ali got off to a great start — hitting a boundary off the first ball of the innings by clipping a wayward delivery to get off the mark.
She also got a reprieve when wicket-keeper Isabella Gaze dropped her in the second over of the bowling of Jess Kerr.
However, she could not capitalise on that chance with a big score as she fell for just 22, shortly after Pakistan lost Omaima Sohail.
Muneeba got out courtesy of an excellent catch by Suzie Bates at short mid-wicket, while Omaima fell victim to Lea Tahuhu’s pace — getting trapped lbw on one that skidded on.
Tahuhu continued to trouble the Pakistani batters with her brisk bowling, and the in-form Sidra Amin was her next scalp.
Sidra got out while cutting one straight to point after getting a boundary in the previous over by Sophie Devine.
That was the last delivery bowled before the heavens opened up yet again in the Sri Lankan capital — which has already seen two washouts this week and is in the midst of the monsoon season.
After the first rain-induced break, Pakistan managed only 40 more runs while losing both their captain, Fatima Sana and the set batter in Natalia Pervaiz.
Natalia fell while trying to up the rate against spinner Eden Carson while the captain continued her lean patch with the bat — getting bowled by a Amelia Kerr googly.
 






Asked about their batting woes in the tournament so far, Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana had said at the toss: “Our batting will hopefully execute better today.”
For New Zealand, Lea Tahuhu replaced Bree Illing. Skipper Devine, explaining the decision to bowl first, said, “We want to have first crack at the track, especially with rain around.”
On Wednesday, Pakistan’s hopes of a first victory at the World Cup were hit by rain, with their crucial fixture against England being abandoned after a second downpour in Colombo.
Chasing a revised target of 113 to win after earlier rains had reduced the match to 31 overs per side, Pakistan were well on their way at 34-0 in 6.4 overs when rains returned to end any chance of the match being completed — saving England from their first ever loss against the Green Shirts.
Opener Omaima Sohail said on Friday that the team was still looking forward to a chance to make the semi-finals of the tournament.
The Kiwis also go into the encounter with a washout of their own against Sri Lanka on Tuesday. The match got called off after Sri Lanka scored a daunting 258-6 batting first.
Teams:
Pakistan: Omaima Sohail, Muneeba Ali, Sidra Amin, Aliya Riaz, Natalia Pervaiz, Sidra Nawaz (wicket-keeper), Fatima Sana (captain), Rameen Shamim, Diana Baig, Nashra Sandhu, and Sadia Iqbal.
New Zealand: Suzie Bates, Georgia Plimmer, Amelia Kerr, Sophie Devine (capt), Brooke Halliday, Maddy Green, Isabella Gaze,  Jess Kerr, Rosemary Mair, Eden Carson, and Lea Tahuhu.</p><small>2025-10-18 13:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629206-punjab-govt-extends-section-144-for-seven-days' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt extends Section 144 for seven days</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan had again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day ceasefire.
In a post on social media platform X late Friday night, the ACB said three players — identified as Kabeer, Sibghatullah and Haroon — and “five other countrymen” from Urgun district were killed and seven others were injured in a strike.
It said the players had earlier travelled to Sharana to participate in a friendly cricket match.
“The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan’s sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,” the cricketing board said. As a result, the ACB decided to withdraw from participating in the tri-nation series scheduled to be played in November.
Afghanistan’s ace spinner Rashid Khan, in a post on X, said he welcomed the ACB’s decision to withdraw from the upcoming fixtures against Pakistan.
Pakistan was set to host the series, which also included Sri Lanka, from November 17 to 29.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Spokesperson Amir Mir told Dawn.com that the tri-series was still on and the third team would be finalised shortly.
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Pakistan had carried out precision strikes in Afghanistan against the outlawed Gul Bahadur group last night.
“All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said on X.
 






Cricket icon Shahid Afridi took to X and said that Afghanistan, in its acts of aggression, had forgotten Pakistan’s hospitality and “favours”.
“Pakistan has always stood by its Afghan brothers, considering the troubles of Afghans as its own trouble,” the former all-rounder wrote. “It opened its borders for its brothers. It accommodated 4 million refugees on its land.
“I have to say that in recent days, Afghanistan, forgetting all these favours, committed open aggression on the borders, to which our forces gave a full response,” he added.
Afridi wrote that Afghanistan should think of Pakistan as a brotherly Islamic country and should not allow its land to be used to aid acts of terrorism.
 






Pak Afghan tensions
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Islamabad has been raising concerns over the presence TTP terrorists in Afghanistan and has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks. For its part, Kabul has batted aside accusations of support for militancy, alternating between vehement denials of Afghan soil being used to launch attacks across the border, assurances that have failed to materialise, and simply telling the Pakistani state to negotiate with the TTP.
Tensions have flared between the two countries over the last few days, with Kabul and Islamabad engaging in border skirmishes on October 11. According to the military, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed at the border following an attack from the Afghan side.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier in the week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintained that Kabul must “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
Subsequently, Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and artillery pounded Afghanistan’s posts, targeting hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika.
On Tuesday night, fighting flared up again on between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. However, a temporary ceasefire was then announced. The Foreign Office (FO) said the ceasefire was implemented at the Taliban’s request and with mutual consent, and would last for 48 hours.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, however, made it clear on Thursday that he expected Kabul to make the first move if it was serious about resolving the issue of cross-border terrorism through talks.
“We decided the temporary 48-hour ceasefire [and] the message has been sent that if they want to fulfil our justified conditions through talks, then we are ready,” he said, adding that if the Taliban were serious, they would initiate steps to hold talks.
On Friday, with representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan. It had come after an attack on a military installation in North Waziristan and after Islamabad and Kabul extended the two-day ceasefire.
There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day.
Meanwhile, in a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Friday that the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past.
 






“There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote.</p><small>2025-10-18 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629211-pakistan-conducts-precision-strikes-targeting-gul-bahadur-terror-outfit-says-tarar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan conducts 'precision strikes' targeting Gul Bahadur terror outfit, says Tarar</strong></a><br><p>

NDTV reported that the incident occurred on Wednesday night and they were hospitalised soon after.
“They have claimed to have consumed phenyl together, but this cannot be immediately confirmed,” the report quoted Maharaja Yashwantrao Hospital  Superintendent-in-Charge  Dr Basant Kumar Ningwal as saying, adding that none of them were in a critical condition.
“What triggered the mass act by the transgender persons was not immediately clear,” the report said. Meanwhile, The Hindu reported that the incident occurred “following an altercation with … a rival group leader and her associates”.
Indore Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Rajesh Dandotiya told the outlet that the rival group leader was arrested on Thursday and a case was registered against her and three associates for alleged assault and extortion.
“As per the FIR (first information report), there was a dispute between the two factions of the community and that [the rival group leader] and her associates allegedly threatened and assaulted the 24 persons when they demanded some money from a deposit collected for a community conference, prompting them to try to harm themselves,” the report added.
It further said that a previous FIR had been lodged on Tuesday against one of the associates after a trans woman accused him and another of the three men of “posing as journalists” and issuing threats, along with blackmailing and raping her.
The Print reported that Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Rajesh Dandotiya said the two used to blackmail the victim by feigning to be journalists and going to the transgender community’s gathering in Nandlalpura in June 2025.
“The victim belongs to the Kinnar society. The victim has said that the two … claimed to be journalists, used to threaten her that they would defame her and an FIR would be registered against her, as happened in the case of her gurus. On June 12, the accused went to the dera. The accused … assaulted the victim, sexually and physically,” the report quoted him as telling reporters.
It added that they were booked under Section 18 of the Transgender Protection Act 2019 and for intimidation.
The report further said that other members of the community had reached the hospital and demanded that the suspects be arrested, with one member threatening to end her life if the group’s demands were not met. “They also attempted suicide in the hospital by pouring kerosene, which was foiled by the police,” the report added.

“The talks will focus on immediate measures to end cross-border terrorism against Pakistan emanating from Afghanistan and restore peace and stability along the Pak-Afghan border,” it said.
 






“Pakistan does not seek escalation but urges the Afghan Taliban authorities to honour their commitments to the international community and address Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns by taking verifiable action against terrorist entities,” it said.
“Pakistan appreciates the mediation efforts of Qatar and hopes these discussions contribute to peace and stability in the region,” the FO said.
Earlier, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesperson for the Taliban government, had also confirmed that talks between the two countries would take place in the Qatari capital.
In a post on social media platform X, Mujahid said, “As it was promised that negotiations would be held with the Pakistani side, a high-level delegation of the Islamic Emirate, led by the Minister of Defence Maulvi Sahib Muhammad Yaqub Mujahid, left for Doha today.”
Reports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would also include intelligence chief, Mullah Wasiq, besides the defence minister.
Minister says Pakistan carried out precision strikes in Afghanistan last night
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Pakistan struck verified camps of the outlawed Gul Bahadur group in border areas of North and South Waziristan districts along the Pak-Afghan border.
In a post on X, he said that during the 48-hour ceasefire, terrorists operating from Afghanistan attempted to launch multiple terrorists attacks inside Pakistan, which were effectively countered by security forces.
“During the effective responses by security forces, more than 100 kharjis were sent to hell,” he said. He said that terrorist also carried out an improvised explosive device (IED) attack in North Waziristan in which civilians and a soldier were martyred while multiple others were injured.
“Against kharjis of Gul Bahadur Group, precision strikes were undertaken last night. In these precision strikes, [a] minimum [of] 60-70 kharjis and their leadership have been sent to hell based on confirmed intelligence reports,” the minister said.
“All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said.
“Pakistan sincerely believes that [the] path forward lies in resolving this complex issue of Indian-sponsored terrorism emanating from Afghan soil through talks and control of non-state actors by Afghan authorities. However, Pakistan has all the rights to safeguard its territorial integrity and the lives of the people of Pakistan, and we shall not allow terrorists operating from inside Afghanistan to live in peace,” he said.
 






Pakistan had again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.
The attacks came on the heels of an attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended a two-day ceasefire.
The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) also said that it was pulling out of a T20I tri-nations series scheduled to be held in Pakistan next month after alleging that three cricketers were killed in a strike.
The fresh exchanges on Fri­day night had cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks.
“The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday.
The two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period.
Earlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.”
He warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action. This fire will spread. This has to be stopped.”
No bilateral initiative for talks emerged during the first phase of the truce. How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.</p><small>2025-10-18 10:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629198-pakistan-to-hold-qatar-mediated-talks-with-afghan-taliban-in-doha-today-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to hold Qatar-mediated talks with Afghan Taliban in Doha today: FO</strong></a><br><p>

The 2015 deal — signed in Vienna by Iran, China, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and the United States — saw the lifting of international sanctions against the Islamic Republic in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear programme.
But the pact had already been in tatters after Washington unilaterally withdrew during President Donald Trump’s first term, with Iran later pulling back from its commitments.
The reimposition last month of UN sanctions at the urging of three of the deal’s European signatories rendered the accord effectively moot.
From now on, “all of the provisions (of the deal), including the restrictions on the Iranian nuclear programme and the related mechanisms are considered terminated”, Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement on the day of the pact’s expiration.
“Iran firmly expresses its commitment to diplomacy,” it added.
Western powers have long accused Iran of secretly seeking nuclear weapons — something it has repeatedly denied, insisting its nuclear programme is solely for civilian purposes such as energy production.
The deal’s “termination day” was set for October 18, 2025, exactly 10 years after it was enshrined in the UN’s Security Council resolution 2231.
The accord capped Iran’s uranium enrichment at 3.67 per cent in exchange for sanctions relief and provided for strict supervision of its nuclear activities by the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
But Washington left the deal in 2018 and reinstated sanctions, after which Tehran began stepping up its nuclear programme.
According to the IAEA, Iran is the only country without a nuclear weapons programme to enrich uranium to 60pc That is close to the threshold of 90pc required for a bomb, and well above the level needed for civilian nuclear use.
‘Irresponsible actions’
In July, Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA following the war with Israel, with Tehran pointing to the agency’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear facilities.
The unprecedented bombing campaign by Israel and the retaliation by Iran during the 12-day war derailed ongoing nuclear negotiations between Tehran and Washington.
At the initiative of France, Britain and Germany, widespread UN sanctions against Iran returned into force in late September for the first time in a decade.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a letter addressed to the United Nations on Saturday that the expiration of the 2015 deal renders the sanctions “null and void”.
Britain, France and Germany accuse Iran of not cooperating with the IAEA and would like it to return to negotiations with the United States.
“Iran’s efforts to revive the exchanges (with the IAEA) that led to the agreement in Cairo were also sabotaged by the irresponsible actions of the three European countries,” the Iranian foreign ministry said in Saturday’s statement, referring to a recent framework to resume cooperation.</p><small>2025-10-18 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629190-fitna-al-khawarij-ringleader-among-two-terrorists-killed-in-bannu-ibo-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Fitna al-Khawarij ringleader among two terrorists killed in Bannu IBO: sources</strong></a><br><p>

KP police said that three terrorists belonging to the Fitna-al-Khawarij had made an unsuccessful attempt to target the Mazanga police checkpost last night.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Police said the terrorists were attempting to attack the Mazanga police checkpost using a rickshaw loaded with explosive material. During this attempt, they were intercepted by police officials who tried to stop them due to their suspicious activity, the police said.
When they did not stop, officials opened fire which caused the rickshaw to explode, the statement said, adding that all three terrorists were killed while police personnel remained safe.
The explosion caused minor damage to nearby houses, it added.
According to the statement, Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan and Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kalachi lauded the prompt and courageous response of the policemen, saying they had “set an exemplary standard of duty, bravery, and professionalism“.
The statement said that Bannu police was “fully committed to protecting the lives and property of the people at all costs”. The statement added that the DIG and the DPO had also announced cash rewards and certificates for the officers stationed at the checkpoint.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
On Thursday, the military said security forces had killed 34 “India-backed” terrorists during multiple operations that took place across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa over the span of three days.</p><small>2025-10-18 08:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629182-pakistan-to-forgo-donor-appeals-after-poor-2022-floods-response-says-planning-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to forgo donor appeals after poor 2022 floods response, says planning minister</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting was held on the sidelines of the plenary meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank (WB) in Washington, DC, where Aurangzeb had arrived on Sunday on a six-day trip from Oct 13 to 18.
In a statement issued today, the ministry said that Aurangzeb briefed Banga on the government’s comprehensive flood response efforts and appreciated the Bank’s timely support following the completion of the post-flood damage assessment.
 






The minister also endorsed the proposal of leveraging technology platforms and cooperatives to “effectively reach small farmers and enhance agricultural resilience”, the statement read. Aurangzeb also thanked the WB for “its technical assistance” in developing Pakistan’s tariff policy, it added.
The statement said that Aurangzeb informed Banga about the memorandums of understanding signed with the provinces for the implementation of the Country Partnership Framework (CPF).
He also recalled Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s engagement with Banga during the UN General Assembly (UNGA) session and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to “deepening its partnership” with the WB.
“The minister also requested additional support under the International Development Association (IDA) windows in light of reduced allocations and discussed the importance of adopting a holistic approach towards reforming Pakistan’s gas and power sectors to ensure long-term sustainability and efficiency,” the statement said.
Fitch ratings
In a separate meeting, Aurangzeb sat with officials from Fitch Ratings, thanking the agency for upgrading Pakistan’s credit rating to B- with a stable outlook.
The minister expressed satisfaction that all three major international rating agencies were now aligned in their assessments of Pakistan’s economy, the ministry said.
 






He also briefed the Fitch team on the recently announced Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) with the Fund.
Aurangzeb outlined “Pakistan’s progress on key structural reforms in taxation, energy, privatisation, and state-owned enterprises”.
The statement added that the minister reiterated the government’s commitment to accelerating the privatisation process to enhance efficiency and ensure fiscal sustainability.
Aurangzeb also apprised the Fitch delegation of the government’s ongoing efforts to issue Panda Bonds in the Chinese market and highlighted successful trade and tariff negotiations with the US administration, which he said had led to more competitive tariff rates for Pakistan.
Aurangzeb meets UK minister
The finance minister also met with United Kingdoms Minister for International Development and Africa Baroness Jenny Chapman in Washington.
“The finance minister appreciated the UK’s longstanding development partnership and support for Pakistan’s reform and growth agenda. He particularly acknowledged the continued collaboration on the development of the Digital Dashboard initiative aimed at improving transparency and efficiency in project monitoring,” the ministry said.
 






Aurangzeb also underscored the importance of enhanced consultation with relevant stakeholders in the selection and implementation of development projects to “ensure alignment with national priorities”.
“He emphasised the need for greater visibility and coordination on off-budget projects to improve oversight and outcomes,” it said, adding that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to “further strengthening Pakistan–UK development cooperation”.
Roundtable discussion
Meanwhile, Aurangzeb also participated in a roundtable discussion titled ‘Challenges and Opportunities for the Pakistani Economy through 2025 and Beyond’ that was organised by the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE).
He briefed participants on Pakistan’s recent macroeconomic progress, including the staff-level agreement reached with the Fund and subsequent credit rating upgrades by major international rating agencies.
 






He highlighted the ongoing transformation of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
“The minister also provided an update on the pace of privatisation and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to sustaining reform momentum,” the ministry said.
Aurangzeb also noted that recent geopolitical developments were “favourable for Pakistan” and had opened new avenues for economic cooperation and investment, it added.</p><small>2025-10-18 06:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1811031374ccd2c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949713/china-and-us-agree-to-fresh-trade-talks' target='_blank'><strong>China and US agree to fresh trade talks</strong></a><br><p>China and the United States agreed on Saturday to conduct another round of trade negotiations in the coming week, as the world’s two biggest economies seek to avoid another damaging tit-for-tat tariff battle.
Beijing last week announced sweeping controls on the critical rare earths industry, prompting US President Donald Trump to threaten 100 percent tariffs on imports from China in retaliation.
Trump had also threatened to cancel his expected meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.
In the latest indication of efforts to resolve their dispute, Chinese state media reported that Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had “candid, in-depth and constructive exchanges” during a Saturday morning call, and that both sides agreed to hold a new round of trade talks “as soon as possible”.
On social media, Bessent described the call as “frank and detailed”, and said they would meet “in-person next week to continue our discussions”.
 






Bessent had previously accused China of seeking to harm the rest of the world by tightening restrictions rare earths, which are critical to everything from smartphones to guided missiles.
 
 

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also participated in the call, according to the report by Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
Hours before the call, Fox News released excerpts of an interview with Trump in which he said he would meet Xi at the APEC summit after all.
Trump told the outlet that the 100 per cent tariff on goods from China was not sustainable.
“It’s not sustainable, but that’s what the number is… They forced me to do that,” he said.
Coordinated response
The high-level video call came as Washington worked to rally Group of Seven finance ministers in response to the latest Chinese export controls.
For now, the G7 ministers have agreed to coordinate a short-term response and diversify suppliers, the EU’s economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters in Washington.
Speaking after the grouping met this week, Dombrovskis noted the vast majority of rare earth supplies come from China, meaning that diversification could take years.
“We agreed, both bilaterally with the US and at the G7 level, to coordinate our approach,” he said on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank’s fall meetings.
Countries would also exchange information on their contacts with Chinese counterparts as they work out short-term solutions, he added.
German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil told journalists he hopes that Trump and Xi’s meeting can help to resolve much of the US-China trade conflict.
“We have made it clear within the G7 that we do not agree with China’s approach,” he added, referring to the group of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.
IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva also expressed hope Friday for an agreement between the countries to cool tensions.
The US-China trade war reignited this year as Trump promised sweeping tariffs on imports soon after returning to office.
At one point, US-China tariffs escalated to triple-digit levels, effectively halting some trade as businesses waited for a resolution.
The two countries have since lowered their respective levies but their truce has remained shaky.</p><small>2025-10-18 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/18094536fd3011d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949604/kp-cm-afridi-refuses-to-attend-pms-huddle-on-afghan-refugees' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi refuses to attend PM’s huddle on Afghan refugees</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi on Friday declined to attend a top-level huddle chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to chalk out a course of action regarding the future of Afghan refugees.
However, Mr Afridi was represented by Muzzamil Aslam, former adviser to the chief minister on finance, in the meeting.
In a statement on X, the chief minister said that he had declined to attend a federal government’s meeting about agriculture and Afghan refugees on the ground that attending such meetings without policy guidelines from detained PTI founder Imran Khan would be an insult to people’s mandate.
He hoped that the federal government would resolve the issue of his meeting with Mr Khan and direct relevant authorities to arrange his regular meetings with the party’s founder.
Mr Afridi said that his legal team was approaching the Islamabad High Court and other forums on the matter.
 







Hopes Centre will ensure his meeting with Imran in jail

Earlier in the day, he was denied a meeting with Mr Imran in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail. He returned after waiting for permission for over two hours.
Mr Afridi has approached Supreme Court Chief Justice Yahya Afridi through the registrar of the apex court, requesting him to direct the federal government and other relevant authorities to arrange his meeting with Mr Imran.
 
 

The letter, sent by KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, said that following his election as the chief minister, Mr Afridi was under constitutional and moral obligation to consult Imran Khan for guidance and instruction on urgent and sensitive matters concerning governance and cabinet formation in the province.
“I have already approached the secretary of the ministry of interior and secretary home department Punjab for arranging a meeting Mr Khan; however, despite repeated communications follow-ups, the said meeting has not yet been confirmed,” the letter noted.
It added that Mr Afridi was responsible for the governance and securing the fundamental rights and matters relating to the security situation, formation of provincial cabinet, and critical economic challenges faced by the people of the province.
“There is a pressing need to seek direction from Mr [Imran] Khan regarding these matters and others related to the federation and other provinces,” the letter said. It said that seeking the PTI founder’s directions was extremely essential as the Punjab government had stopped inter-provincial trade of flour and wheat.
Mr Afridi, who took oath of office on Wednesday after several days of deadlock, has yet not to form his cabinet.
Talking to reporters on the Peshawar High Court’s premises here on Thursday, he said that he would announce his cabinet after getting its approval from Mr Imran.
Meanwhile, former adviser to the chief minister Muzzammil Aslam told Dawn that in the meeting with PM, he raised the province’s concerns over the hasty closure of 28 refugee camps in the province, as ordered by the federal government on Monday.
 
 

He said that KP had 38 refugee camps compared to 10 in Punjab and one in Balochistan, so the Centre shouldn’t take any hasty decision on the matter.
Mr Aslam said he also raised the issue of dignified return of refugees as well as business visa policy for Afghan businessmen.
He said that the meeting agreed that KP and the interior ministry would hold a meeting over the repatriation of refugees.

The decision was announced during a Zoom meeting between the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and the private sector, chaired by Member Customs Policy Ashhad Jawad and participated by Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry (QCCI) President Muhammad Ayub Mariani, Chief Collector Customs Irfan Javed, Collector Customs Jameel Baloch, State Bank representative Muhammad Yasir, commerce ministry official Zubair Khan, and other stakeholders.
The meeting focused on addressing long-standing hurdles in Pakistan-Iran trade, particularly issues related to the Electronic Import Form (EIF) and COO.
Speaking on the occasion, Ashhad Jawad said the government was taking all possible steps to promote legal and formal trade with Iran, and that the exemption of 57 items from the COO requirement was an important part of this effort. He emphasised that promoting legal trade was vital for the country’s economic prosperity.
He appreciated the active role of the QCCI and expressed confidence that the new policy would significantly enhance trade relations between Pakistan and Iran.
The QCCI president welcomed the federal government’s decision, saying that the chamber had consistently raised concerns about the mandatory EIF and COO requirements on behalf of the province’s traders.
Mr Mariani urged local traders to take advantage of the new facility and expand trade with Iran. He also disclosed that the QCCI had submitted a second list of 37 additional items to the authorities concerned, recommending their exemption from the COO requirement. “We hope that the second list will also be approved soon.”
Published in Dawn, October 18th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-18 04:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68f2eedb7ec05.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949689/departing-mncs' target='_blank'><strong>Departing MNCs</strong></a><br><p>THE recent exit of the American multinational company Procter & Gamble (P&G) from Pakistan has created a stir in the market — unlike the relatively quiet departure of other MNCs over the past three years.
Since 2022, at least 13 companies have exited the country. Among them are four from the pharmaceutical sector, two each from energy and ride-hailing, and one each from technology and telecom. P&G’s departure is particularly significant as it produced a wide range of consumer goods; Gillette was a subsidiary of P&G, and Gul Ahmed Textile had an export garments division associated with it.
People may attribute different reasons to such exits — Pakistan’s challenging economic climate, security concerns, political uncertainty, delays in price approvals, unethical promotional practices by some local pharmaceutical firms, rampant corruption, and inconsistent utilities.
 
 

However, analysts cite different causes. In many cases, these exits are less about Pakistan and more about global restructuring. Several MNCs are relocating as part of a strategic shift towards operating from regional hubs rather than maintaining facilities in every country, allowing them to benefit from economies of scale. Shell’s departure, for example, was part of its global reorganisation.
Growing competition from local firms, the dominance of the informal sector, and shrinking profit margins have also eroded group performance. Combined with high taxation and a weakening rupee, these factors have contributed to the exodus.

MNCs strove to comply fully with applicable laws.

That said, an exit does not always mean the withdrawal of products or brands. Many companies retain their presence thr­ough a distributor model and continue relying on third-party market research and adv­ertising agencies to promote their brands.
MNCs have played a significant role in shaping and developing the ‘corporate culture’ in Pakistan, particularly in Karachi. Corporate culture can be defined as “the personality of a company” which entails its “shared values, beliefs, and behaviours that shape how employees interact with each other and the outside world”.
The golden period for MNCs in Pakistan was spread over the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s. Unlike local employers, MNCs placed top priority on maintaining emp­l­o­yee relations. Higher employee satisfaction translated into greater productivity and better business outcomes. Customer care was another area of emphasis: companies ensured that clients anywhere in Pakistan had easy access to their representatives for queries and assistance with transactions.
 
 

MNCs introduced professional management systems that were largely absent in local enterprises. These included structured training and development, job des­criptions, performance evaluations, career progression, and policy frameworks for human resources and other departments. Expenditure on employee development was considered an investment — based on the belief that improved knowledge and skills would enhance productivity.
MNCs also strove to comply fully with applicable laws, including labour regulations. They generally supported workers’ right to form and operate trade unions, fostering mutual respect. Because of fair dealings by management, unions would often reciprocate, ensuring a peaceful work environment. Even during the early 1970s — a period of industrial unrest — MNCs largely remained unaffected due to their ethical and transparent practices. The relative stability of the 1960s further encouraged entrepreneurs to invest not only in trade but also in manufacturing.
A notable example is Esso, which established its fertiliser plant in Daharki, Sindh, in 1968. Inc­o­r­porated as Esso Fer­ti­liser Pakistan Ltd in 1965, the plant — then the largest forei­gn in­­vestment in Pakistan — began producing urea in 1968. Later renamed Exxon Che­m­ical Pakistan Ltd (ECPL), it was sold to employees in 1991 through an employee-led buyout. It was regarded as a model company with exemplary management practices and performance.
 
 

Another corporate giant, Imperial Chemical Industries, a British firm, had established a soda ash plant in Khewra in 1944, which became Khewra Soda Ash Company Ltd in 1952. The company was renamed ICI Pakistan Ltd in 1966. It maintained a head office and a specialty chemicals unit in Karachi, produced pharmaceuticals and agrochemical products, and operated a paints plant in Lahore and a polyester fibre plant in Sheikhupura. Later, it set up a Pure Terephthalic Acid plant at Port Qasim, Karachi.
As ICI wound up operations globally, its Pakistan operations were sold in July 2012 to an established industrial group through a consortium led by a dominant cement company. It is heartening that the successors of both ECPL and ICI continue to follow the management systems they inherited from these global corporate giants.

The PTI, the opposition and the governor of KP interpreted the Constitution in their own self-serving ways.
At issue was the legal point raised by the opposition and the governor that the election of the new CM was not possible till the resignation of the then outgoing provincial chief executive became effective after the governor’s ‘verification’ and formal ‘acceptance’.
It is not clear what the opposition thought it would gain by delaying the election when none of the three major opposition parties could agree on a joint candidate to contest the vote against PTI nominees. Nor was any effort, unlike in the past, made to pressure or entice pro-PTI MPAs to defect.
 
 

Defection, in fact, had been made easier by the Election Commission when it declared the pro-PTI MPAs of the Sunni Ittehad Council independent, thus free from any obligation to follow any party’s direction. The opposition, it seems, was misled into playing a game without a plan, probably encouraged by some powerful voices that had publicly ‘rejected’ PTI leader Imran Khan’s choice of Sohail Afridi as the new CM.
There are no constitutional provisions to support the position taken by the opposition and the governor on the issue of the CM’s resignation, and the resignation becomes automatically effective upon being tendered to the governor.
Had there been any doubt about the ‘genuineness’ of the resignation, it was wiped out when the then outgoing CM, Ali Amin Gandapur, publicly announced in the provincial assembly that he had resigned and the ‘joke’ about delaying the election of his successor should come to a stop.

It is unclear how far the new CM’s conduct will be different from that of his predecessor.

The CM’s election in the legislature further sealed the opposition’s fate when the new provincial chief executive was elected by a thumping majority, securing 90 votes in a House of 145. This was an overwhelming mandate as a candidate for CM needed only 73 votes to prove his or her numerical majority.
 
 

In this case, the new CM actually secured 17 extra votes, reflecting that not even a single pro-PTI ‘independent’ MPA wavered by defecting as the practice has sadly been in the past. As another new normal in Pakistani politics, the matter landed in the Peshawar High Court where the chief justice promptly accepted the PTI’s point of view and directed the governor to administer the oath to the chief minister-elect by a fixed time, and nominated, under Article 255(2), the KP Assembly Speaker to conduct the oath in case the governor was unwilling or unable to comply with the court’s direction.
It is ironical that Article 255(2) was amended under the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which gave the power to the provincial high court to nominate someone else to administer the oath if the governor was not available to do so. Earlier, this power to nominate someone else was available with the governor. Had this article not been amended, the opposition and the governor might have delayed the oath-taking by a few more days.
A division bench of the Peshawar High Court also rejected the plea filed by one of the opposition candidates seeking to declare the CM’s election unconstitutional. Understandably, the PTI leadership was profuse in its praise for the judiciary for delivering justice to their party and candidate.
 
 

Fortunately, the governor eventually administered the oath to the CM-elect in the stately Governor’s House though surrounded by a messy crowd which constantly pushed and jostled to get close to the CM. This is how the first phase of the new saga came to an end.
It remains to be seen how far the policy and conduct of the new CM will be different from that of Mr Gandapur, who constantly tried to navigate a balancing act. On the one hand, there were clear instructions from Imran Khan to leave no stone unturned to secure his and his wife’s release, along with that of scores of other incarcerated party leaders, even if it meant violent confrontation with the federal government and its law enforcers.
The former CM had led quite a few rallies to Islamabad — some of them violent; he sounded aggressive most of the time and even threatened to respond, bullet for bullet, if his rally was stopped again. Despite this confrontational posture, he did not cross certain red lines and that might have been his undoing.
For example, he was asked not to let the annual provincial budget 2025-26 pass in the assembly but he justifiably didn’t comply. He also held meetings with the federal interior minister and shook his hand, too, which was criticised in the strongest, even obscene, terms in pro-PTI social media.
 
 

He had practically abandoned the idea of leading assault rallies from KP to the national capital after the violent end of the Oct 24, 2024, rally in Islamabad. He also failed to comply with the wishes of Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan and wife Bushra Bibi. His public criticism of Aleema Khan might have proven to be the proverbial last straw. In short, he was not aggressive enough for the likes of Imran Khan and his family.
The new CM has declared in his post-election maiden speech in the assembly that he is the ‘champion of agitational politics’. Instead of focusing on education, health, development and governance, he said that his top priority was to secure the release of Imran Khan and his wife. This must have gone down well with the PTI leader and his family. He also said in his first speech that he was Pakistani first and Pakhtun later.
One is not sure how much this will calm the nerves of his detractors; we must wait and see if his ‘balancing act’ works better than that of his predecessor.

The National Assembly Standing Committee’s decision came following a briefing given by Pakistan Rail­ways’ officials to the committee about the October 7 attack on the Jaffer Express.
The officials said that Jaffer Exp­ress was targeted with an improvised explosives device on October 7 near Sultan Kot Railways Station in Sindh.
The blast derailed five bogies and damaged the track. Seven passengers, including Pakistan Railw­ays employees, suffered injuries.
The standing committee, chaired by Ramesh Lal in the absence of the chairman, heard updates on the Jaffer Express train blast, encroachments of railways lands and Kara­chi-Pipri freight corridor project.
 
 

Briefing the committee on the freight corridor project, the secretary of Pakistan Railways said the project would start from Keamari, linking Karachi Port to Pipri. On this route, he said, two new railway lines will be laid to connect it with Motorway M-9.
The committee also discussed various aspects of the project. The panel was informed that the terminal will initially operate on a small scale, and the first pha­­se is expected to be co­­m­­pleted within six months.
The committee was further informed that 17 freight trains will operate on a daily basis and the project will cost $400 million.
Divisional Superinten­d­ent of Pakistan Railways in Sukkur brie­fed the commit­tee about encroachments on PR land in Sukkur.
He said that 16,458 acres of land were under operational use, 3,253.233 acres under encroachment, and 457 acres occupied by land grabbers.

According to police, the case was lodged on the written complaint of Khuda Bakhsh, a resident of Sarbandan in the Dasht area, who alleged that Mr Baloch accused the FC of being responsible for killings in various areas.
The complainant further stated that Mufti Shah Mir and Maulana Ghulam Sarwar were killed by unidentified assailants, but Mr Baloch blamed the FC for their deaths without any evidence.
Police have registered the FIR against the JI leader under sections 124, 506, 505, and 504 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), as well as sections 26, 20, and 11 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016.

The interior minister’s remarks came during a meeting with Jamiat Ule­ma-i-Pakistan Secre­tary General Allama Shah Owais Noorani, in which detailed discussions were held on religious harmony, tolerance, and national unit, according to a press release by the Interior Ministry.
Both leaders agreed that “no action would be taken against any innocent person, and all of the innocent will be released,” the ministry said. They also agreed that no madressah [seminary] will be closed down.
 






Mr Naqvi reiterated that those bearing arms against the government will face the law.
“Holding arms against the state can never be allowed,” Mr Naqvi was quoted as saying, adding that the leaders also agre­­ed that “the miscreants will be dealt with strictly.”
Mr Naqvi emphasised that no one will be permitted to take the law into their own hands.
“There is no place for miscreants and extremists in the Pakistan of Quaid-i-Azam,” Naqvi said, adding that elements spreading “unrest, chaos, and extremism will be dealt with with an iron hand.”
 
 

The minister acknowledged the valuable role religious scholars play in promoting interfaith harmony and patience.
He stressed that the promotion of religious education is a collective responsibility and called on all segments of society to ensure lasting peace, tolerance, and harmony.
Allama Noorani, in turn, assured the government of his party’s “full cooperation” in promoting sustainable peace, tolerance, and brotherhood across the country.

However, his father, Assistant Commissioner Ziarat Muhammad Afzal Baqi, is still missing, and authorities are making all-out efforts for his safe recovery.
Police officials said that after his recovery, Mustansar Bilal, the son of assistant commissioner, reached the Zardalo area of Harnai, from where he was taken into protective custody and handed over to the Deputy Commissioner Harnai.
It may be recalled that the assistant commissioner and his son were abducted about two months ago by unidentified armed men while returning to Ziarat after a picnic along with their family. The kidnappers allowed the family members, security guard and driver to go home after setting the official vehicle on fire.
 
 

On Sept 21, reports circulated that the kidnappers had killed AC Ziarat and dumped his body in a mountainous area of Harnai district. An official of Ziarat administration also confirmed that Afzal Baqi had been killed by the kidnappers and even released a photograph purported to be his body.
However, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti later informed the provincial assembly that the killing of the assistant commissioner was not confirmed, assuring that the government was making all-out efforts for his safe recovery.
Officials said that Mustansar Bilal reached the Zardalo area of Harnai district and informed local authorities about his presence in the area. “Mustansar is safe and sound in the custody of Deputy Commissioner Harnai,” police officials said.
Authorities, however, said that AC Ziarat remains missing and efforts were underway for his safe recovery. They did not disclose how Mustansar Bilal managed to reach Harnai.

• Preliminary damage of this year’s floods put at $2.9bn across sectors
• 1,039 dead, 1,067 injured; surveys to conclude in two weeks
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan suffered more than $30 billion in damages and losses in the 2022 floods but received only $600 million in foreign assistance, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Friday.
Apart from that, all international commitments were loans, most of them repurposed from previous facilities, he said while releasing preliminary estimates for flood-related damages at Rs822bn (about $2.9bn).
“This is an irony,” he said, adding that the global community had pledged a $100bn climate-finance fund but “did not provide even $1bn”.
Therefore, after consultations, the government decided to meet the latest losses through domestic resources rather than “external crutches” despite the around $3bn damages to agriculture and infrastructure on top of human lives following the recent “apocalyptic floods”.
The minister said the surveys for flood losses, including those in the economic field, were currently in progress and would be finalised in about two weeks. He said the preliminary report entailed human losses of more than 1,039 lives and 1067 injuries, besides about Rs822bn damage to infrastructure and agriculture.
 
 

This included Rs430bn damages in the agriculture sector, Rs307bn in infrastructure, besides damage to more than 229,763 houses, including 213,000 in Punjab alone.
Besides, 6,370 houses were damaged or destroyed in Balochistan, 3,677 in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, 3,332 in Sindh and 3,222 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“At least 6.5m people across 70 districts have felt the brunt, including around 4m temporarily displaced as waters receded and families assessed the wreckage”, he said.
More than 2,811 kilometres of roads were damaged, over 2,200 head of livestock lost, around 2,200 educational institutions affected, more than 250 health facilities impacted and roughly 866 water-infrastructure assets hit, he added.
Crop losses included up to 3.4m bales of cotton, more than 1m tonnes of rice and an estimated 1.3m to 3.3m tonnes of sugarcane, subject to ground verification.
Punjab suffered the most, with Rs632bn of the nationwide Rs822bn tally, the minister said, adding that the provincial chief minister had briefed a meeting chaired by the prime minister on a support package for farmers and families.
On development expenditure, Mr Iqbal said that about Rs40bn had been disbursed under the Public Sector Development Programme in the first quarter, almost 16 per cent higher than last year’s Rs34.8bn.
Addressing progress under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, he said minutes of the recent Joint Cooperation Committee would be finalised by the end of the month and dispelled the impression that tangible progress on the second phase of bilateral economic cooperation was missing in the JCC.
At Pakistan’s request, China had agreed to finance 85 per cent of the Karakoram Highway works linked to the Diamer-Bhasha Dam, with bidding expected to start in about two months, he said.
 
 

The government has designated 2026 as the “year of reform” to modernise the economy, society and politics, the minister announced, aiming to convert recent diplomatic and macroeconomic gains into faster growth through “bold and quick” structural changes.
A three-year reform window would prioritise social, economic and political measures to encourage wealth creation and investment, remove “anti-business bias” and cut red tape and bureaucratic inertia. The prime minister has constituted a high-level forum to present an action plan this year for implementation in 2026.
The minister said that while the National  Institute of Public Administration was being converted into a university to train bureaucracy in line with global standards for economic development and business promotion, many of the social sector reforms were not possible without the full involvement of provinces.

Speaking at the Rome Water Dialogue convened by the Food and Agric­ulture Organisation, he warned that any nation attempting to control transboundary water flows violates international law.
“Any attempt to unilaterally alter transboundary water flows or weaponise water access is not only dangerous but contrary to international norms and sustainable development goals,” Mr Shah said.
Representing Pakistan at the global forum, Mr Shah raised serious concerns about India’s conduct regarding the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), long seen as a successful example of bilateral cooperation.
 
 

“The Indus Waters Treaty has long been considered a model of cooperation, even during times of conflict between Pakistan and India,” he said. “However, India’s recent unilateral actions to suspend treaty-level engagements risk undermining this crucial framework.”
Mr Shah described the IWT as one of the world’s most resilient water-sharing agreements and urged the international community to take note of what he called a threat to transboundary water governance. He called on global stakeholders to ensure that such treaties remain “sacrosanct”.
“The international community (must) act as stewards of peace and justice,” Shah forcefully urged, stressing the importance of the treaty for the well-being of Pakistan’s population.

In addition, security forces claimed to have foiled a terror bid in Bajaur after a large cache of explosives, loaded into a non-Customs paid vehicle, was destroyed in Lowi Mamund tehsil.
In Lakki Marwat, officials said an operation was launched on reports about the presence of militants in the rural area located on the border with Punjab, near Mianwali.
Security forces spotted the terrorist hideout in the forest between Kaichi Kamar and Sultankhel, which was reportedly targeted through a unmanned drone.

Forces foil major terror bid in Bajaur by disabling explosive-laden vehicle

During the operation, eight militants were eliminated and their hideouts were destroyed, while security forces seized a large quantity of arms, ammunition and explosives and launched a sanitisation operation to neutralise any other threats in the area.
 
 

Separately, TTP ‘commander’ Tariq Kochi, who hails from Toi Khula tehsil of Lower South Waziristan, was reportedly killed near the border with Balochistan by unidentified gunmen.
Sources said the incident occurred near the Tesh mountain range, where Kochi and other militants were ambushed by unidentified individuals.
Police said that Kochi had been involved for the past year in multiple incidents of attacks, shootings, and target killings targeting security forces, police personnel, and civilians in the area.
Security forces also claimed to have foiled a terrorism bid by destroying a huge cache of explosives loaded in a car in Bajaur.
A senior police official said that the sabotage bid was foiled in Thangai area at around 11:15 am, when the security personnel targeted a suspected vehicle laden with explosives.
DPO Waqas Rafique said the explosives-laden vehicle was disabled by firing at it, adding that no loss of life was reported.
The official, however, said that an investigation was underway to ascertain who was behind the failed sabotage bid.

Speaking at a signing ceremony, the prime minister described the transaction as “the first drop of rain” in a broader effort to deepen economic collaboration with the United Arab Emirates.
 






The event marked the official transfer of a majority stake in FWBL to IHC under a government-to-government (G2G) framework. The UAE delegation was led by Sheikh Zayed bin Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chairman of 2PointZero.
The federal cabinet had earlier approved the divestment of the government’s entire stake in FWBL, reportedly valued at $14.6 million (approximately Rs4.1 billion), a figure yet to be formally disclosed.

Buyer to inject Rs6.8bn more to meet capital requirements

In addition to acquiring the bank, IHC will meet the total minimum capital requirement of Rs10bn over five years. As of December 2024, FWBL’s equity stood at Rs3.2bn, with the new investor set to inject Rs6.8bn to bridge the gap.
Privatisation momentum
PM Shehbaz attributed the successful closure of the deal to the “determined and focused” leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Adviser on Privatisation Muhammad Ali. He reaffirmed his government’s commitment to restructuring state-owned enterprises and enabling private sector-led economic growth.
He added that FWBL’s founding mission — to support women entrepreneurs — would not only be preserved but also strengthened through professional management and targeted investments in sectors such as agriculture and industry.
IHC sees long-term growth
IHC Chief Executive Syed Basar Shueb said the investment signals confidence in Pakistan’s financial sector and reflects a shared vision for long-term development.
“We see strong potential in the country’s financial sector and look forward to supporting the bank’s modernisation journey by leveraging technology, automating banking processes, and advancing the use of AI in financial decision-making,” he said.
According to an official statement, this marks the first bank privatisation conducted under the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act 2022. FWBL, established in 1989, currently operates 42 branches across Pakistan, serving retail, SME, and corporate clients.

• Strikes come despite extension of ceasefire; security officials say ‘truce with Afghan govt, not terror outfits’
• Khawaja Asif accuses Afghan Taliban of ‘sitting in India’s lap’; says terrorists will be made to pay heavy price, wherever they are
• Questions remain over Qatar-mediated talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan in absence of clarity over who will attend
ISLAMABAD: With representatives from both sides expected to meet in Doha soon for talks mediated by the Qatari government, a telling statement from the country’s defence minister indicated that the gloves were off, as Pakistan again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday.
The attacks came on the heels of an audacious gun-and-bomb attack, targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended their two-day ceasefire.
Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province, as security sources claimed that precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, reportedly killing dozens of fighters.
“If someone attacks Afgha­nistan, our forces are ready to respond,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Ariana News. However, Pakistani security sources pointed out that the ceasefire agreement bet­ween the Afghan government and Pakistan did not preclude stri­kes on terror outfits and their hideouts.
 
 

There was no statement from Pakistan’s military, but terrorists linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group had claimed responsibility for the attack on Khaddi Fort in Mir Ali, where a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the main gate of a military camp before attempting to stage an incursion earlier in the day.
Although there was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on losses suffered, security sources claimed to have foiled the attack by eliminating all attackers.
The attack began on Friday morning, with local sources describing a massive explosion, followed by heavy gunfire as terrorists attempted to enter the military camp. Sources said that “all four” attackers were killed.
Heavy price to pay
In a telling statement posted to X (formerly Twitter), Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said the relationship with Kabul would no longer be like it was in the past. “There will no longer be protest notes or appeals for peace; no delegations will go to Kabul. Wherever the source of terrorism lies, it will have to pay a heavy price,” he wrote.
Mr Asif accused Afghanistan of “sitting in India’s lap and plotting conspiracies against Pakis­tan”, saying that Islamabad “can no longer afford to have relations with Kabul like in the past”.
“All Afghans on Pakistani soil will have to go back to their homeland,” he wrote. “Now they have their own government [or] caliphate in Kabul. It has been five years since the Islamic revolution… they must live with Pakistan as neighbours.”
 






In the post, the defence minister elaborated on the visits by Pakistani delegations to Kabul and provided figures for acts of terrorism by groups operating out of Afghanistan and the total number of casualties.
Since the Taliban took power in 2021, Pakistani foreign ministers visited Kabul four times; defence ministers and the ISI chiefs visited twice; the special representative and foreign secretaries carried out five visits each; the national security adviser visited once, and the Joint Coordination Committee had eight meetings in the Afghan capital.
He added that there were 225 border flag meetings, 836 protest notes and 13 demarches.
“From 2021 to date: 3,844 mar­tyred (civilians, military, and law enforcement agencies combined). Terrorist incidents: 10,347,” the defence minister listed.
Truce talks?
The fresh exchanges on Fri­day night cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks.
“The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday.
The two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period.
 
 

Earlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.”
He warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action. This fire will spread. This has to be stopped.”
 


No bilateral initiative for talks emerged during the first phase of the truce. How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.
Reports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would include Defence Minister Mullah Yaqub Mujahid and intelligence chief Mullah Wasiq.  Pakistan’s Foreign Office stayed silent on the matter, but a late-evening meeting between National Security Adviser and ISI chief Lt. Gen. Asim Malik and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar suggested that Gen Malik may travel to Doha.
Return of victims’ remains
Earlier on Friday, Afghan authorities handed over the bodies of seven Pakistani citizens — including two security personnel — to Pakistani officials at the border following the deadly Taliban attack in the Chaman sector on Tuesday.
“The Taliban authorities handed over all the seven bodies to Pakistan through Hilal-e-Ahmar Pakistan (Red Cres­cent),” Abdul Wali Khan Ghabizai of the Balochistan chapter of the organization confirmed. He said Taliban officials announced at the Vesh Mandi border post that they were returning the remains of Pakistanis who had died “in the armed clash between two countries.”
The bodies were taken to the District Hospital in Chaman for identification and medicolegal formalities.
“Five bodies were brought to the district hospital Chaman,” said Dr Muhammad Awais, the hospital’s medical superintendent. “Four out of five martyrs have been identified as residents of the border town, while the fifth could not be identified so far.”
Two of the deceased were identified as security personnel — Naik Suleman and Sepoy Sabir — whose remains were later transferred to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta. Officials said that four of the five civilians were killed by mortar shell splinters, while one was hit in the forehead. The victims — identified as Syed Ali Adozai, Muhammad Asghar Ashaizai, Rozi Khan Salehzai, and Nasibullah Salehzai — were local daily-wage workers. They were buried in their native villages Friday evening.
Local residents in Chaman claimed that at least 12 Pakistani civ­ilians were killed earlier in Taliban attacks in Spin Boldak, the first Afghan district across the border.
Responding to reports that bodies of some Pakistani soldiers had been mutilated, the Foreign Office spokesman at the weekly media briefing said, “This kind of savagery, bestiality, is condemnable, and it needs to be condemned in the strongest words possible. This is beyond the pale. It is beyond humanity, and this has deeply offended us and deeply hurt the Pakistani people.” “It is not something to be forgi­ven and forgotten easily,” Mr Khan added.

The court has summoned the defendant to appear on Oct 31 to respond to the allegations.
Syed Muhammad Ali Jafri, a consumer, filed an application through his counsel, Abdul Ahad Khan, under the relevant sections of the Sindh Consumer Protection Act, 2015, before the judicial magistrate of the consumer court (South) against the defendant Mondo Coffee Bar, operating in DHA, Phase-VIII.
The counsel alleged that the café was using the “trademark, design, and logo” of Thailand-based café Mondo Espresso & Tea Bar for financial gain through wrongful means.
After a preliminary hearing, the court summoned the defendant “to appear before this court in person, or by a pleader instructed and be able to answer all material question relating to the complaint, or who shall be accompanied by some person able to answer all such questions on October 31, 2025.”

Consumer court will take up matter against Mondo Coffee Bar on 31st

“You are hereby directed to produce on that day all the documents upon which you intend to rely in support of justification and file your written statement on the date of hearing,” the summons added.
In the application, the counsel claimed that after hearing about the much-hyped coffee shop in the DHA — initially operating under the name Mondo Espresso & Tea Bar and promoted as part of an international coffee chain — which later changed its name to Mondo Coffee Bar, the plaintiff visited the café in May along with a colleague and purchased coffee, believing it to be a branch of the Thailand-based coffee brand.
However, the applicant maintained that he was “astonished and stunned” to learn through social media that the DHA-based café was allegedly “wrongfully, illegally, fraudulently, and without lawful authority” using the brand name and trademark logo of the Thailand-owned Mondo Espresso & Tea Bar.
Referring to the official Instagram page of the Phuket-based café, counsel Mr Ahad submitted that the original café had clarified that the coffee shop operating in Pakistan under a similar name had no association with the defendant, who had allegedly “cleverly stolen” the name, logo, and design closely resembling the original brand.
He added that the defendant was allegedly using coffee cups, takeaway bags, and tissue papers bearing a trademark logo and design strikingly similar to that of the Thailand-based coffee brand.
The counsel argued that the plaintiff fell within the definition of a consumer, while the defendant qualified as a manufacturer, and that coffee constituted a product under the relevant sections of the Sindh Consumer Protection Act (SCPA), 2015.
He added that the defendant’s dishonest acts clearly fell within the definition of faulty and defective services under Section 13 of the Act, amounting to a blatant violation of its provisions.
The counsel further contended that the defendant had allegedly violated Section 21 of the Act, which pertains to false, deceptive, and misleading representation, thereby constituting an unfair practice through false misrepresentation.
He maintained that the plaintiff was therefore entitled to damages, compensation for economic loss, special damages, consequential and non-consequential relief, and a refund of payment.
The counsel pleaded for an award of Rs5 million to the plaintiff as damages for providing faulty and defective services and deceptive marketing.

Earlier this week, AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed announced that he had resigned from his position, citing “some unavoidable reasons”. However, a senior official at the AJK prime minister’s office told Dawn.com that the resignation had been “received but not yet accepted”.
AJK Finance Minister Abdul Majid Khan and Food Minister Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim announced today they would step down at a joint press conference at the Muzaffarabad Press Club, while Sports, Youth and Culture Minister Asim Sharif Butt sent his resignation directly to the prime minister, opting to stay away from media interaction.
All three were elected on PTI tickets in the 2021 general elections from LA-45 (Valley-VI), LA-38 (Jammu-V) and LA-42 (Valley-III) — constituencies reserved for Kashmiri refugees who migrated to Pakistan after 1947. However, the trio had later joined the faction of PTI defectors led by PM Haq in 2023.
Their resignations came in protest against the agreement recently signed by a seven-member federal government committee and the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC), which, among other matters, addressed the contentious issue of the 12 legislative assembly seats reserved for Kashmiri refugees settled across Pakistan.
Calling the JAAC an “unelected, baton-wielding group”, Khan and Ibrahim said the accord had effectively legitimised an “unconstitutional and morally indefensible demand, reached under pressure and without wider consultation”.
They alleged that the deal violated the fundamental rights of thousands of Kashmiri refugees and struck at the heart of AJK’s constitutional and political framework.
They maintained that the campaign against the refugee seats was a malicious move by a small group of traders and self-styled representatives pursuing narrow interests “under the guise of reforms”.
The real target, they asserted, was not the government but the identity, representation and political recognition of the refugee community that had made immense sacrifices for Pakistan and the cause of Kashmir’s accession.
Both ministers argued that these seats were not a privilege but a historic and conscious constitutional decision, which was part of AJK’s political setup since 1947. The reserved seats, they said, symbolised the constitutional acknowledgment of the sacrifices and long displacement endured by those who lost everything for the cause of Pakistan.
They termed the JAAC’s questioning of these seats’ existence a denial of the pain, identity and political significance of an entire generation exiled for its struggle for accession to Pakistan.
They said they had brought this issue to the notice of the president and prime minister of Pakistan in black and white, and added that they would “knock on all doors to frustrate the designs of the elements hellbent upon creating a wedge between local and migrant Kashmiris and thus damaging the Kashmir cause”.
Khan also shared his two-page resignation letter, in which he reaffirmed his belief in the ideology of the State of Jammu and Kashmir’s lawful accession and integration with Pakistan, in accordance with the wishes of its entire population, including the 2.5 million Pakistan-based refugees.
He said it had become “utterly impossible to continue to serve under the present government, which has failed to effectively defend and protect the constitutional rights of Kashmiri refugees, nor shown the will to assume responsibility or challenge this serious constitutional violation”.
Declaring that he had no moral choice but to resign from the AJK cabinet, effective today, Khan vowed to continue defending the rights of Jammu and Kashmir refugees and to raise his voice for their rightful place in the political and constitutional structures of both AJK and Pakistan.
In his resignation letter, Ibrahim echoed similar views, stating that Prime Minister Haq had failed to stop the “unlawful demand” raised by the JAAC and to protect the rights of around three million Pakistan-based refugees from occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
Both Khan and Ibrahim charged PM Haq of conspiring against the refugee members of the legislative assembly and called upon him to resign from office.
Butt, in his letter, expressed his and his constituents’ loss of confidence in the AJK government in the wake of the agreement, saying he could no longer remain part of it.
Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down at the end of September.
Since then, rival groups staged protests and strikes, trading blame for the violence which marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory.
On October 2, a delegation from the federal government travelled to Muzaffarabad for talks with the JAAC in a bid to put an end to the ongoing unrest in the territory. The agreement was signed after two rounds of talks.</p><small>2025-10-17 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1718303634da4b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949553/trump-says-he-expects-expansion-of-abraham-accords-soon' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says he expects expansion of Abraham accords soon</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said he expected an expansion of the Abraham Accords soon and hopes Saudi Arabia will join the pact that normalised diplomatic relations between Israel and some Arab states.
“I hope to see Saudi Arabia go in, and I hope to see others go in. I think when Saudi Arabia goes in, everybody goes in,” Trump said in an interview broadcast on Friday on Fox Business Network.
Trump said he had “some very good conversations” as recently as Wednesday with states that have indicated their willingness to join the accords.
“I think that they’re going to all go in very soon,” Trump said in the interview, which was recorded on Thursday.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed the accords in 2020 during Trump’s first term in the White House, breaking a longstanding taboo to become the first Arab states to recognise Israel in a quarter century. Morocco and Sudan followed suit.
Trump, who convened Muslim and European leaders in Egypt to discuss the future of the Gaza Strip on Monday, has presented his plan to end the onslaught in Gaza as the catalyst for a wider regional peace settlement.
He said then that more countries would join the Abraham Accords initiative and even floated the idea of a peace deal between arch Middle East enemies Iran and Israel, telling the Israeli parliament he thought Iran wanted one: “Wouldn’t it be nice?”
Earlier in June, Foreign Mini­ster Ishaq Dar ruled out the possibility of Pakistan joining the Abraham Accords, stating that such a move would effectively mean abandoning the country’s longstanding support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict and recognising Israel.
“We are not ready to recognise Israel until the two-state solution to the Palestine conflict is accepted,” Dar said. “There is no change in our stated policy on the Palestine issue.”</p><small>2025-10-17 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/629095-pakistan-afghanistan-48-hour-ceasefire-extended' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-Afghanistan halt in fighting extended amid reports of Qatar-mediated talks</strong></a><br><p>
