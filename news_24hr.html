Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was remanded in custody on Friday night, was severely dehydrated and required close monitoring, the deputy director-general of Colombo National Hospital told AFP.
“He has to be closely observed and treated for acute dehydration to prevent serious complications,” Rukshan Bellana said. “He was a severe diabetic with high blood pressure when he was brought in.”
Bellana said, however, that Wickremesinghe’s condition was “stable”.
The former president was taken to Sri Lanka’s main state-run hospital as his condition deteriorated and the prison medical facility was not equipped to treat him, a prison spokesperson said.
Opposition legislators who visited 76-year-old Wickremesinghe in prison earlier in the day reported that he had been in good spirits.
Opposition parties have accused the government of jailing him over fears he could return to power.
Anti-corruption drive
Wickremesinghe lost the last presidential election in September 2024 to Anura Kumara Dissanayake, but has remained politically active despite holding no elected position.
He was arrested on Friday as part of Dissanayake’s campaign against endemic corruption in the island nation, which is emerging from its worst economic meltdown in 2022.
Nalin Bandara, a member of parliament for the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya (SJB) party, who visited Wickremesinghe at Colombo’s New Magazine Prison, said the former leader had called for unity to challenge Dissanayake’s leftist government.
“What the former president says is that we should get onto a common stage to fight the oppression of the new government,” Bandara told reporters outside the prison.
Wickremesinghe’s own United National Party (UNP), which has two seats in the 225-member parliament, said the government felt threatened by the former president.
“They fear he might return to power, and that is why this action,” UNP General Secretary Thalatha Athukorala told reporters in Colombo.
Wickremesinghe stands accused of using state funds to finance a private visit to Britain in September 2023, while returning from attending the G77 summit in Havana and the UN General Assembly in New York.
The offences carry a maximum punishment of 20 years in jail and a fine not exceeding three times the value of the misappropriated funds, estimated at 16.6 million Sri Lankan rupees ($55,000).
His two-day UK visit was to participate in the conferring of an honorary professorship on his wife, Maithree, by the University of Wolverhampton. Wickremesinghe has maintained that his wife’s travel expenses were met by her and that no state funds were used.
Wickremesinghe became president in July 2022 after then-leader Gotabaya Rajapaksa stepped down following months of street protests fuelled by the economic crisis.</p><small>2025-08-23 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620099-cm-murad-orders-restoration-of-150-year-old-historic-banyan-tree-at-qasr-e-naz' target='_blank'><strong>CM Murad orders restoration of 150-year-old historic Banyan tree at Qasr-e-Naz</strong></a><br><p>

The Lahore Police arrested Shershah, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from outside his home on Friday. His brother Shahrez Khan, who was picked up on Thursday, was also handed over to police custody yesterday for eight days over the same allegations.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill presided over today’s hearing, where PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja appeared as Shershah’s counsel and Imtiaz Sipra as the prosecutor.
The prosecution sought a 30-day physical remand, while the defence counsel requested that the suspect be discharged from the case. Judge Gill then granted the police Shershah’s five-day custody.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.
Addressing a press conference outside the Lahore ATC, Aleema said her sons had not committed any crime to warrant arrest.
“What is their crime? Their crime is that they are Imran Khan’s nephews … that they are Imran Khan’s family,” she said.
She said that the arrests aimed to put “pressure” on Imran and his family, but added that they were not succumbing to this pressure.
“This is a fight of every Pakistani — it is a duty of every Pakistani — that for this country, its freedom … they play their part,” Aleema said.
She added, “We can play our part by standing with Imran Khan, because he is standing for Pakistan.”
With both Shahrez and Shershah now in police custody, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it was “alarmed” by the arrest of Imran’s two nephews.
“The fact that the arrests were made 27 months after the incident is difficult to understand for any independent observer, having occurred at a time when the trials of other accused persons have been long underway or already concluded,” the HRCP said in a statement.
The commission said it was “deeply concerned about the further backsliding of citizens’ rights and expresses its disappointment in the policing and legal system, particularly when it comes to dealing with political opponents”.
“We demand that the authorities ensure transparency and the rule of law in all such matters,” the HRCP added.
 






Shahrez’s wife, Maria, wrote on her newly made X account that the triathlete was in Chitral on May 9, 2023 at her family home.
She shared a purported image of the metadata of a group photo taken in Chitral that day of Shahrez with her family and friends.
 






Imran’s son Kasim Khan, who along with his brother Sulaiman has been more vocal in recent months about his imprisoned father, had termed his cousins’ arrests as “blatant state repression”.
 






Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that individuals nominated and wanted in May 9 cases must be jailed and there was “no escape” from legal accountability.
“It is not a matter of personal desire — it is the state’s responsibility to arrest absconders and proclaimed offenders,” she said in a statement without naming either of the two sons.
Condemning the attack on Jinnah House, she remarked, “Those who disrespected a military officer’s uniform are now trying to play the victim card and hiding behind the excuse of ‘privacy’ and ‘sanctity of home’.“
She reiterated that the Punjab government was acting strictly within the law and no one would be considered above it.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests yesterday, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
He asserted that both siblings were present at the scene of the Jinnah House vandalism.
ATC hearing
Similar to the request made in Shahrez’s case, the prosecution today sought Shershah’s 30-day physical remand in the Jinnah House attack case registered at the Sarwar Road police station.
“The suspect was present at the crime scene. A weapon was used at the site,” Sipra told the court, adding that Shershah was allegedly seen in a video from the incident.
“The suspect’s social media accounts have to be recovered,” he contended.
On the other hand, Raja argued that the arrest was “illegal”, noting it was made 27 months after the incident.
“The suspect had appeared in this same court yesterday with Shahrez and was arrested the same day,” the PTI counsel said. “Where was the police for 27 months?” he asked.
 
 

Raja, citing the Supreme Court’s previous directives related to videos, contended that a video had “no value [as evidence] till the person who recorded it appeared in court and spoke of its authenticity”.
Aleema’s lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassir, detailed that Shershah was arrested while on his way home after appearing for his brother’s case hearing.
 


“This case is like Shahrez’s case. We request that the court discharge Shershah from the case,” Mudassir pleaded.

Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government being toppled in August of last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
According to a press release by the FO, Dar arrived in Dhaka today “on a landmark official visit from August 23-24” on the invitation of Bangladesh’s government.
He was received by Bangladesh Foreign Secretary Ambassador Asad Alam Siam, High Commissioner of Pakistan to Bangladesh Imran Haider, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan Muhammad Iqbal Khan and officials of the Pakistan High Commission, it said.
The press release added, “During the visit, the deputy prime minister will hold important meetings with the Bangladeshi leadership, including Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, Adviser for Foreign Affairs Mr Md Touhid Hossain, and Adviser for Commerce Mr SK Bashir Uddin.
“Discussions will encompass the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation including regional and international issues of mutual interest.”
 






FM Dar received a delegation of the National Citizen Party (NCP), led by General Secretary Akhtar Hossain. He appreciated the NCP leadership’s vision for reform and social justice and emphasised the need for greater interaction between the youth of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
The delegation members apprised FM Dar on different facets of countrywide political mobilisation in 2024. The FO said the two sides also discussed possibilities to promote cultural exchanges between Pakistan and Bangladesh in the days ahead.
 






The deputy PM also held a meeting with a delegation of Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Naib Amir Dr Syed Abdullah Mohammed Taher.
“The ways to strengthen Pakistan-Bangladesh relations and the recent developments in the region were two key areas of discussion. The DPM/FM lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Jamaat leaders and activists in the face of hardships and difficulties,” the FO said.
 






Earlier today, the FO wrote on X that Dar embarked on a “historic visit to Bangladesh” as the deputy premier departed from the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi. “In Dhaka, he will hold important meetings with Bangladeshi leaders,” it added.
“The visit is a significant milestone in Pakistan-Bangladesh relations as a Pakistani foreign minister is visiting Bangladesh after a gap of around 13 years,” the FO highlighted.
 






The last time a foreign minister paid an official visit to Dhaka was in November 2012, when Hina Rabbani Khar made a six-hour visit to Bangladesh to formally invite then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina to a summit in Islamabad later that month.
 
 

FM Dar’s meetings are likely to take place tomorrow, according to Bangladeshi news outlet BSS.
The visit is expected to see the signing of four to five memorandums of understanding to strengthen bilateral ties in the fields of trade, culture, media, training, and travel, a senior official of Bangladesh’s foreign ministry told BSS.
Dar’s visit comes on the heels of Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan’s official tour to Dhaka, where he met Bangladesh’s advisers for commerce and industries.
 
 

Islamabad and Dhaka are in the process of establishing a joint working group on trade to enhance the economic ties and foster greater cooperation in trade, according to the commerce ministry.
The two countries started direct government-to-government trade in February with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice, while Fly Jinnah has also secured approval to operate flights from Karachi to Dhaka.
Diplomatic ties were rekindled after 15 years in April with the visit of Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch for Foreign Office Consultations (FOC).
Last month, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka, Paki­stan and Bangladesh agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side.</p><small>2025-08-23 13:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/23151214e092778.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935589/india-says-us-trade-negotiations-are-still-going-on-as-fresh-tariffs-loom' target='_blank'><strong>India says US trade negotiations are still going on as fresh tariffs loom</strong></a><br><p>India’s foreign minister said on Saturday that trade negotiations with Washington are continuing but there are lines that New Delhi needs to defend, just days before hefty additional tariffs by the United States are due to hit.
Indian goods face additional US tariffs of up to 50 per cent, among the highest imposed by Washington, due to its increased purchases of Russian oil. A 25pc tariff has already come into effect, while the remaining 25pc is set to be enforced from August 27.
A planned visit by US trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25-29 has been called off, dashing hopes that the levies may be lowered or postponed.
“We have some redlines in the negotiations, to be maintained and defended,” Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said at an Economic Times forum event in New Delhi, singling out the interests of the country’s farmers and small producers.
 
 

India-US trade talks collapsed earlier this year due to India not agreeing to open its vast agricultural and dairy sectors. Bilateral trade between the world’s largest and fifth-largest economies is worth over $190 billion.
“It is our right to make decisions in our ‘national interest’,” Jaishankar said.
Analysts at Capital Economics said on Friday that if the full US tariffs come into force and stick, the hit to India’s economic growth would be 0.8 percentage points both this year and next.
“The longer-term harm could be even greater as a high tariff could puncture India’s appeal as a global manufacturing hub.”
The Indian minister described US President Donald Trump’s policy announcements as “unusual”.
“We have not had a US president who conducts his foreign policy so publicly as the current one and [it] is a departure from the traditional way of conducting business with the world,” Jaishankar said.
 


He also said Washington’s concern over India’s Russian oil purchases was not being applied to other major buyers such as China and the European Union.
“If the argument is oil, then there are [other] big buyers. If the argument is who is trading more [with Russia], then there are bigger traders,” he said.
Russia-European trade is bigger than India-Russia trade, he added.
The minister also said India’s purchases of Russian oil had not been raised in earlier trade talks with the US before the public announcement of tariffs.
India to suspend postal deliveries to US over tariff confusion
India will temporarily suspend postal deliveries to the United States, the government said today, citing confusion stemming from tariffs imposed by Trump.
India’s communications ministry said the executive order issued last month requires transport carriers or other “qualified parties” approved by US authorities to collect and remit the tariff duties.
But “several critical processes relating to the designation of ‘qualified parties’ and mechanisms for duty collection and remittance remain undefined,” the ministry said in a statement.
“Consequently, US-bound air carriers have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after August 25, citing lack of operational and technical readiness.”
 






As a result, India’s department of posts will temporarily suspend bookings of “all types of postal articles” destined for the United States from Monday except letters, documents and gift items of up to $100 in value.
“These exempt categories will continue to be accepted and conveyed to the USA, subject to further clarifications from CBP (Customs and Border Protection) and USPS (United States Postal Service),” the ministry said, adding that “every effort is being made to normalise services”.
The move follows similar steps taken by postal services and mail carriers across Europe. France’s La Poste told AFP it would suspend most package deliveries to the United States from Monday.
It said the new implementation rules were issued by the CBP on August 15, “leaving European postal services with an extremely limited timeframe to get prepared”.
The Trump administration has said that it would abolish a tax exemption on small packages entering the United States from August 29.</p><small>2025-08-23 13:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2312592326b0c81.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935449/ctd-finds-raw-ties-to-targeted-killing-in-sindh-as-6-suspects-arrested' target='_blank'><strong>CTD finds RAW ties to targeted killing in Sindh as 6 suspects arrested</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on Saturday said that it found involvement of the Indian intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) in the target killing of a man in Badin district and arrested six suspects in this connection.
On July 30, the CTD had said it arrested four suspected members of a banned separatist militant group in Karachi over charges of killing a man in Badin’s Matli on May 18. During interrogation, the suspects had confessed that they had gunned down the victim, identified as Abdul Rehman. A case was registered under terrorism charges.
According to a statement by the law enforcement agency today, “In a joint operation, Sindh CTD and the state intelligence agencies traced the network working for the Indian intelligence agency RAW (Research & Analysis Wing) and arrested six suspects.”
It added that the 45-year-old victim was “an innocent citizen who actively participated in welfare work”.
“The suspects escaped after unjustly killing him,” the statement said, adding that the Indian media had expressed “immense joy” over the murder and claimed that “an Indian enemy was killed in Pakistan”.
The statement further said that the provincial government had appointed a joint investigation team under the leadership of the CTD deputy inspector general of police for investigation.
“During the investigation, thoroughly reviewing all aspects, including suspects’ statements, records and bank transactions, there was clear evidence suggesting the involvement of the banned organisation Sindh Revolutionary Army in the facilitation of RAW,” it said, adding that teams have been formed for further arrests.
Speaking during a press conference today, CTD Additional Inspector General (AIG) Azad Khan said, “Based on technical information, four suspects, Umair Asghar, Sajjad, Ubaid and Shakeel were arrested on July 8. Upon investigation, there was proof of their links to RAW.”
He continued, “The investigation also proved that the mastermind of this (killing), residing in a Gulf state, was an Indian agent and handler Sanjay Kumar alias Fauji.”
He explained that Sanjay had hired a resident of Sheikhpura named Salman. “On May 12, Salman travelled to Hyderabad and stayed at a hotel. His four accomplices came from Muridke and Sheikhpura,” he said, adding that they monitored the target’s movements for five days.
AIG Azad said that three of the suspects — Shakeel, Ubaid and Sajjad — went to Matli to carry out the killing, adding, “Umair and Salman stayed at the hotel in Hyderabad and handled the operation from there.”
“Sanjay stayed in contact [with them] from a foreign country throughout the incident,” he explained, adding, “Salman returned to the Gulf country through Karachi airport and escaped to Nepal.”
He further noted, “CTD also found that RAW spent a ton of money, sending money through banks and various sources.” Within terror financing, the CTD arrested Arsalan on Aug 17 and Talha Umair on Aug 22, he said.
The CTD recovered one 9mm pistol, one 30 bore pistol, one 125cc motorcycle and mobile phones from the suspects, he said. He added that RAW also utilised a separatist organisation and further investigation is underway.
The official also stated that “such extra-territorial killings” are considered state-sponsored terrorism under international law.
Noting the Indian spy agency’s previous involvement in “similar actions in other countries”, he said, “They use criminal elements, terrorist groups and proxies. That was also the modus operandi in this case, as evident in the facts on RAW’s involvement during our investigation.”
On Monday, an anti-terrorism court in Karachi remanded a suspected RAW agent in the CTD’s custody, Muhammad Arsalan, over his alleged terror financing and facilitation in this targeted killing case.
The CTD claimed that initial interrogation revealed Arsalan and Umair’s involvement in terror financing, while the remaining suspects were directly linked to the targeted killing of the citizen. It added that an “Indian national” had given them the target and paid Rs3 million.
In June, four suspected Indian agents were arrested in a raid carried out in Karachi’s Quaidabad area. “The suspects had made videos and captured pictures of the country’s sensitive installations, which they used to send to RAW using specialised software,” police claimed.</p><small>2025-08-23 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620093-imran-khan-nephews-face-charges-of-may-9-violence-anti-state-campaigns' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan nephews face charges of 'May 9 violence, anti-state campaigns'</strong></a><br><p>

The suspension of bilateral ties between Pakistan and India has now been officially extended beyond cricket to all sports. On Thursday, India’s sports ministry issued a new policy that ends bilateral sporting ties with Pakistan, even on neutral venues. However, no stoppage has been announced for engagement at multilateral tournaments, paving the way for the much-anticipated Asia Cup cricket clash between the two rivals next month.
Last month, the Pakistan Sports Board had asked sports federations in the country to seek approval before participating in sporting events held in India.
Questioned about sporting ties with India during a press conference in Lahore, Naqvi said: “I think we are very clear that whenever talks are held will be on an equal footing with India and there will be no more begging for negotiations. That time has passed and whatever will happen will be on the basis of equality.”
Questioned about the team’s dismal performance and the need for any revamping in it, the PCB chief reassured that the squad would exhibit improvement very soon.
The PCB chief was also asked about visa issues for sports journalists for the upcoming Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates, to which he said that a cell had been set up to coordinate visa issuance and whoever needed one would be provided.
Naqvi was also quizzed about the team composition that saw notable players Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan left out to make way for new players, to which he responded: “I do not even have a one per cent role in the team selection.”
He said there was a selection team and an advisory body, adding that all of them sat down and reviewed the squad selection multiple times over long hours and days.
“I have told them that whatever decision is made should be on the basis of merit and I will support it. Whatever lot was available to us, we polished it and took it forward. Our effort is to bring as many new people as possible so we have more competition in cricket and the best people come up.”
The PCB chief called on people to support the team in the Asia Cup match against India and to desist from criticising them, saying that “needless criticism” demotivated players during tournaments.
He also expressed hope of improvement soon in the national women’s squad.</p><small>2025-08-23 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/231650155a25dce.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935642/islamabad-court-orders-release-of-journalist-khalid-jamil' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court orders release of journalist Khalid Jamil</strong></a><br><p>A judicial magistrate in Islamabad on Saturday ordered the release of journalist Khalid Jamil, who was arrested by the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) a day earlier, noting that “there is no incriminating material” against him.
According to a first information report (FIR), seen by Dawn.com, Jamil was accused of “sharing highly intimidating content on social media X on May 7”.
It stated that he “knowingly disseminated/propagated, fake, false, misleading and misinterpreted information leading to hatred against the government functionaries, including members of national security”.
The FIR said that a review of Jamil’s “broader social media activities reveals a deliberate pattern of conduct involving mocking, ridiculing, and maligning state institutions with the clear intent to instigate public discontent”.
A case was registered at the NCCIA Cyber Crime Reporting Centre on Aug 8 under Section 20 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca) (offenses against dignity of natural person) and Section 26A (dissemination of false and fake information).
The investigation officer (IO) today presented Jamil before the Islamabad Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Mureed Khan Abbas Khan. The IO sought the journalist’s remand for six days for “for the purpose of investigation as well as collection of evidence”.
However, the magistrate in his order noted that “as per (the) contents of FIR remarks quoted in FIR does not fall within any ambit of propagation or derogation”.
He added that “it is prime liberty of every citizen regarding the freedom of speech which is also guaranteed by Constitution of Pakistan”.
“Therefore, request for physical remand of accused person is hereby turned down and accused namely Khalid Jamil is hereby discharged from the instant case.”
Human rights lawyer and the petitioner’s counsel Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir confirmed to Dawn.com that Jamil was discharged today.
“The constituent elements for either of the offences could not be seen from the FIR itself or the record. These sections simply were not made out — in fact, that specific tweet was mainly about historical facts,” she said.
“So there is no question of Section 20 or 26A being invoked.”
 






In 2023, Jamil was arrested on charges of spreading “provocative narrative” against state institutions through social media posts. He was detained under Section 20 of the Peca Act and subsequently released after getting bail.
Peca, since its introduction in 2016, has been widely criticised as a “black law” created mainly to punish dissent. In the eight years since its enactment, it has been used extensively against politicians, journalists, rights activists, and even ordinary political workers.
The National Assembly in January passed a controversial amendment bill to the country’s cybercrime laws amid a walkout by PTI lawmakers and journalists from the proceedings.
On March 20, journalist Farhan Mallick, the founder of media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested in a case pertaining to running allegedly “anti-state” content on his outlet’s YouTube channel. He was booked under Peca and the Pakistan Penal Code. He was later granted bail by separate Karachi courts, but the proceedings are still underway.
A few days later, journalist Waheed Murad, who works with Urdu News, was produced before an Islamabad court by the Federal Investigation Agency, which had booked him under Sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyber-terrorism), 20 (malicious code) and 26A (punishment for false and fake information) of the Peca. He too was granted post-arrest bail by an Islamabad court against Rs20,000 surety bail bonds following his two-day physical remand. However, he still facing legal proceedings.</p><small>2025-08-23 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620085-ppp-pml-n-to-jointly-contest-upcoming-by-elections-in-punjab-kp' target='_blank'><strong>PPP, PML-N to jointly contest upcoming by-elections</strong></a><br><p>

We’d walked through this foul water before. Felt our way through barely recognisable streets from memory. When you live in a city like Karachi, it almost begins to feel normal. And yet, nothing can get you used to the fact that you — the privileged you, who has made a living out of writing on the city’s myriad governance issues — will be among the thousands stranded in water-clogged streets as you experience it in real time. Time and again.
In 2020, when Karachi witnessed one of its worst floods in decades — it can’t definitively be the worst because we like beating our own records — my dad and I walked back home, to Garden West, from I.I. Chundrigar Road in waist-high floodwaters.
At 55, my father was surprisingly surefooted with the stride of a mountain goat. He dragged me through the deluge, all the while making sure to keep an eye open for potholes, ragged stones and bare electric wires. He even cracked a joke here and there to ensure that the neurotransmitters in my brain remained balanced.
Five years on, as we relived the ordeal, wading through a mix of sewerage and rain water on the night of August 19, it suddenly dawned on me how drastically things had changed. The roles had reversed, and I hadn’t even realised it until we were in the thick of the storm.
Over 150mm of rain and Karachi had once again sunk. Why that happens every time and what the authorities are doing about it are questions all of us Karachiites ask every monsoon season. By now, we have come up with newer and better questions: Why does the mayor keep pretending all is well even as thousands of Karachi’s citizens remain stranded? Why can’t we plan better? Is it getting worse with each passing year? Is this the new normal?
Unfortunately, nothing has changed about the responses. It is a tale told and heard a gazillion times: “Jab zyada barish ati hay to zyada pani ata hay.”
 

A cloudy sky captured from the roof of my house.

I have been told I don’t learn from my mistakes (I get that from my dad), and so, living up to the reputation, I was at my workplace at 10am sharp on Tuesday. It had already begun raining before I logged onto my computer. The weather apps flashed red with warnings of rain that was going to last the entire day. But I was unfazed.
When are these predictions ever accurate? So I got to work, resolute and focused to file the story that was sitting in my drafts for days. At around 1pm, my boss came in and cautioned of an impending rainstorm. “Leave now,” he warned.
I brushed him off initially, but then it did start raining quite heavily. By 3pm, the sky was hidden behind thick and dark clouds, intimidating us. I immediately called my dad. “What’s the plan?” I asked him. He told me to stay put, his soothing voice devoid of any worry or anxiety.
And that’s exactly what I did. Even when nerves got the best of my colleagues, I remained calm. “Abba hain naa,” I thought to myself. You see, my father and I are partners in crime and despair. And in my head, it was supposed to stay the same forever; he would handle everything, he was invincible, and age, well, that was just a number.
 

Heavy, very heavy, downpour.

Little did I know that this city was going to prove me painfully wrong. It gets to the strongest of us.
By 6pm, panic had started to settle into our building. There was a mess outside — a massive traffic jam, inundated roads and a downpour that just wouldn’t stop. And then, to make matters worse, the power went out. As the clock struck 8pm, the water levels on the main arteries had risen significantly, and it was pitch black.
I got a call. Father was downstairs. I was told to leave my bag upstairs and come with essentials — mobile phone and spectacles — tightly packed in a plastic bag. I did as told, and when I got to the main gate of our building, my lanky dad stood in drenched clothes and jeans folded up to his knees. He had already done some walking.
He was smiling his usual toothy smile, but the stress lines were evident on his face. There was no way to get home but to walk. He gripped my hand and we began the long journey ahead of us.
As we waded through the waters in front of Shaheen Complex, mixed with a bit of everything from rainwater to raw effluent, a feeling of disgust crept through me. Immediately, my father’s hand tightened around mine, this time not to give support but to take it as his foot got entangled in a floating plastic bag.
 

The main I.I. Chundrigar Road is inundated.

At 60, he was recently diagnosed with Carpal tunnel syndrome — a condition caused when the median nerve, in the carpal tunnel of the wrist, becomes compressed.
He kept losing his footing, almost falling twice if I hadn’t caught him in time. When he almost stepped on a bare electric wire, I didn’t hold back in scolding him, and henceforth made sure to make a small announcement every time I saw one.
These announcements continued even when a slope or steps came along the way. “Acha acha, baap ko mat sikhao,” he would say, laughing it off while also listening intently. At some instances, especially when we moved from a footpath to the main road, I took the first step to make sure that the ground beneath was solid, feeling with my feet where the eyes couldn’t see through the murky water.
In a few spots, I fumbled and almost fell headfirst into the water, but, miraculously, I ended up restoring my balance and that of my father. Later at night, I saw how these instances had left red scars on my feet.
In other places, when I faltered, strangers, who were probably as vulnerable as we were in that moment, signalled an open manhole, a leaking drain or a rocky crater. Even when nothing was said, their presence alone was comforting.
 

Two men push a rickshaw through flooded streets.

We were all one, abandoned in our struggle against a force we had no control over. A man dragging his wife on a motorcycle through the inundated streets. A group of chador-clad women walking back home, cursing at every passing car that splashed water on them. A father and daughter, walking almost two hours to get home, otherwise a 20-minute drive.
When we finally got to the road opposite the Pearl Continental Hotel, the water on the roads receded from our waists down to our toes. At first, we tried to stop a rickshaw, but every one of them was occupied. Some stopped in a frenzy, not to give us a ride, but to ask for directions.
So we continued our trek. There were moments when I would walk fast, too fast for dad to keep pace. I could see him heaving, out of breath, but not saying anything, and so I would slow down, the same way he did five years ago.
 

Wading through knee-deep waters on the Ziauddin Ahmed Road.

After walking for 10 more minutes, we stopped outside a shut-down bank along the route to take shelter under a leaky makeshift shed. By then, the rain was accompanied by gusts of strong wind, and so a break was necessary. We stood there, both looking intently at the road and the cars passing by, trying to gauge the velocity of the rain droplets.
Suddenly, a man, attired in the uniform of a security guard, walked up to us. “Sir, ma’am, please take our seats,” he offered in the sweetest tone. We refused politely, but he was so insistent that my father had to give in. A few minutes later, he brought two glasses of water. It was later that I realised how this small act of kindness helped dad cover a long distance on foot.
To think of it, he understood it before I did — I was the one in charge now; looking out for potholes, stones, and bare electric wires, cracking a joke now and then, and criticising the administration that was nowhere to be seen.
When we finally reached the Abdullah Shah Ghazi shrine — which is just a few kilometres from my current residence — we stopped. I was tired and worn out. So was he, but he tried his best not to show it. We decided to get a ride home. Fortunately, we were lucky to find one.
Had my father been in the lead, he would have made sure that both of us walked all the way, that he didn’t show his fatigue to me, and that he reclaimed his title of being the saviour for the umpteenth time. I may be his daughter, but I am not him, no matter how much we resemble, both physically and in personality.
“Baap to baap hi hota hai,” he joked later that night at the dinner table when I shared details of the journey with my family. And while everyone giggled, I couldn’t help but feel the invisible weight of living in a city where everything changes but nothing changes.
And this isn’t just about me or my dad. It is about the sister who called me a dozen times, worried sick, because she couldn’t reach my 25-year-old colleague. It is about the stranded Foodpanda rider I saw near Teen Talwar. It is about my friend whose newly bought car, a white Alto, was submerged in water on Sharea Faisal. It is also about our maid who didn’t have electricity for nearly two days.
It is about us, the citizens of Karachi, called ‘resilient’ every year, but fast running out of resilience … and hope.

Recent cases indicate that traffic violations and campus protests may be reported to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), raising alarms among the Pakistani community.
Two Pakistani students in northern Virginia were shocked when a traffic court judge informed them that courts are now required to share records of traffic violations with DHS.
“We were planning to drive to Chicago, but we’ve been advised not to,” said Y*, a student from Baltimore, Maryland. “We are on visas and even a minor mistake could lead to revocation.”

US reviewing social media for anti-American or extremist content; Pakistani embassy says it’s monitoring the situation, advises caution in political activities

Students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests, are even more anxious. “Some of us joined those demonstrations and now we don’t know if we can stay or might face deportation,” said S* from Baltimore.
 
 

M*, a student at George Mason University, said, “Most of us work part-time to pay tuition. Now we don’t know whether we can continue working.”
K*, who attends a community college in northern Virginia, added, “Almost all foreign students are scared. We don’t know whether we can work, drive, or even go out. This is not the America that we dreamed of.”
Those living in the US under political asylum face even greater concerns.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington estimates that between 700,000 to a million Pakistanis live in the United States, most as citizens or long-term residents. Many do not register officially, so exact numbers are unclear.
According to the latest Open Doors report by the Institute of International Education, the United States hosted 1,126,690 international students in 2024, up 7 per cent from the previous year.
Pakistan sent 10,988 students in 2024, compared to 17,099 from Bangladesh and 16,742 from Nepal. India topped the list with 331,602 students.
The Pakistani embassy estimates that the number of Pakistani students has risen to about 12,500 in 2025, still far below other South Asian countries.
 
 

As part of the broader vetting process, US authorities are reviewing social media activity for any signs of hostility toward US citizens, culture, government, or institutions.
Officials have also been instructed to monitor for support of designated foreign terrorists or engagement in antisemitic harassment or violence.
Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for US Citizenship and Immigration Services, stated, “America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies.”
In addition, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in the issuance of worker visas for truck drivers, citing safety concerns and the impact on American livelihoods.
Visa holders from Malawi and Zambia are now required to pay a $15,000 deposit for tourist or business visas, while travel bans remain in effect for 12 countries, with partial restrictions on seven more.
The crackdown has left Pakistani students and visa holders anxious about their future.
Pakistani authorities in Washington continue to receive queries from students and other visa holders and forward them to the US State Department. Embassy officials are closely monitoring the situation, emphasising the importance of legal documentation, awareness of rights, and caution in political activity.

Names of students have been withdrawn to protect their privacy.

The draw for the 48-team football championship will be held at the Kennedy Center in the US capital, where Trump recently installed himself as chairman in what he called a war on “woke” culture.
“It’s the biggest, probably the biggest event in sports,” Trump, flanked by FIFA chief Gianni Infantino, said as he made the announcement in the Oval Office of the White House.
The 2026 World Cup is being hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico next year, and Trump has made a big deal about it happening during his presidency.
 






Infantino, who has fostered close ties with the billionaire US president, brought the World Cup with him for the announcement and even let Trump get his hands on it.
“Only the FIFA president, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it, because it’s for winners only. And since you are a winner, of course you can as well touch it,” Infantino said.
“Can I keep it?” replied Trump, who won a second term in the White House last year, as he lifted the trophy with both hands.
“That’s a beautiful piece of gold.”
Trump appeared to be joking — although the separate FIFA Club World Cup trophy remains in the Oval Office more than a month after English side Chelsea won it in New Jersey last month.
Putin ‘may be coming and he may not’
There was a brief moment of nerves as Trump appeared to fumble the World Cup before placing it on his desk — as Infantino reached out a hand to steady it.
Infantino later presented the US leader with a giant ticket — Row 1 Seat 1 — for the World Cup final on July 19 at the MetLife stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just outside New York.
Trump also suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin may attend the World Cup.
Holding up a photo that he said Putin had sent him after their summit in Alaska last week, Trump said the Kremlin chief “wants to be there very badly,” but that he “may be coming and he may not” depending on the outcome of Ukraine peace efforts.
The United States was named as a joint host of the 2026 World Cup during Trump’s first term as president in 2018. He lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden but won a second term last year.
Since his return to power, Trump has launched a major crackdown on immigration, but he said it would be “very easy” for most World Cup fans to get a visa.
For visitors from some countries, it would be “obviously a little bit more difficult,” said Trump, who has banned all travelers from 12 nations including Afghanistan, Haiti and Iran.
‘Trump-Kennedy Center’
The World Cup draw was reportedly due to be held in Las Vegas but the new venue has more political overtones.
Trump led a takeover of the Kennedy Center earlier this year, saying that the venerable performing arts venue named after late Democratic president John F. Kennedy had become too “woke.”

He added on Friday as he made the announcement that “some people refer to it as the Trump-Kennedy Center, but we’re not prepared to do that quite yet, maybe in a week or so.”
Trump visited the Kennedy Center just before the Oval Office announcement on Friday. He has said he is going to make major improvements to “beautify” it, including adding marble cladding.
The US president also hailed a major federal crime crackdown in Washington that has seen US National Guard troops deployed on the streets of the capital.
Trump said the move would make Washington safe for football fans visiting the city during next year’s tournament.</p><small>2025-08-23 10:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2314393683604b8.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1935358/coas-munir-visits-turbat-reaffirms-support-for-improving-balochistans-socio-economic-development' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir visits Turbat, reaffirms support for improving Balochistan’s socio-economic development</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir visited Turbat and reaffirmed the military’s unwavering support for initiatives aimed at improving Balochistan’s socio-economic conditions, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.
The government has repeatedly voiced its commitment to the development of Balochistan — a province with severe infrastructure deficits, recurring protests and a bleak law and order situation. In June, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed it one of the top priorities.
Field Marshal Munir interacted with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and representatives of the Turbat civil administration during his visit, according to a press release from Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“The visit aimed to review the prevailing security situation, assess development initiatives, and reinforce coordination between military and civil institutions for the stability and prosperity of Balochistan,” the statement read.
 


During his interaction with the Turbat administration’s representatives, the army chief “reaffirmed unwavering support for all initiatives aimed at improving the southern Balochistan’s socio-economic development”.
COAS Munir emphasised the significance of joint civil-military efforts in addressing the challenges faced by the people of Balochistan. He also highlighted the need for good governance, infrastructure development, and the importance of inclusive, people-centric progress, the ISPR said.
The field marshal reiterated the army’s resolve to “stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Balochistan in their pursuit of peace, prosperity and sustainable development”.
He was also given a comprehensive briefing on the province’s security dynamics, including threat perspective and successful operations against Fitna al Hindustan, ongoing development projects, and efforts to enhance socio-economic conditions in southern Balochistan.
The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
During his interaction with troops, COAS Munir “appreciated their high morale, operational readiness, and unflinching commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty”. He hailed their role in ensuring peace and stability in the region under challenging circumstances.
Upon his arrival, the army chief was received by the Balochistan corps commander.
Addressing the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025 in April, COAS Munir said Pakistan’s goal was to create manpower, experts and human resources for the mineral sector, adding that economic security has emerged as an important component of national security.
 
 

He said the military would ensure a robust security framework and proactive measures to protect the interests and confidence of Pakistan’s partners and investors in Balochistan.
Under its provincial budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026, the Balochistan government has allocated Rs249.50 billion for the Annual Development Plan (ADP) and has decided to launch several development projects under the public-private partnership model.
Last month, the Balochistan cabinet approved a series of security enhancements, economic initiatives and public welfare projects, including the establishment of new police stations and a major subsidy for farmers.</p><small>2025-08-23 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620057-lahore-atc-remands-imran-khans-nephew-in-police-custody-for-five-days' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC remands Imran Khan's nephew in police custody for five days</strong></a><br><p>

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in May approved the prototype of a fifth generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), calling it a “significant push towards enhancing India’s indigenous defence capabilities”.
Singh, in a speech at a conference in New Delhi on Friday, gave more details about developing fighter jet aircraft engines in the country.
“We are moving forward to manufacture aircraft engines in India itself,” Singh said, in comments broadcast by Indian media.
“We are collaborating with a French company to start engine production in India.”
Singh did not name the company, but Indian media widely reported the company to be Safran, which has been working in India for decades in the aviation and defence sectors.
There was no immediate confirmation.
India, one of the world’s largest arms importers, has made the modernisation of its forces a top priority, and made repeated pushes to boost local arms production.
The world’s most populous nation has deepened defence cooperation with Western countries in recent years, including the Quad alliance with the United States, Japan and Australia.
India signed in April a multi-billion-dollar deal to purchase 26 Rafale fighter jets from France’s Dassault Aviation.
It would join 36 Rafale fighters already acquired, and replace the Russian MiG-29K jets.
Singh has also promised at least $100 billion in fresh domestic military hardware contracts by 2033 to spur local arms production.
This decade India has opened an expansive new helicopter factory, launched its first domestically made aircraft carrier, warships and submarines, and conducted a successful long-range hypersonic missile test.
India was engaged with Pakistan in a four-day conflict this year, their worst standoff since 1999.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.</p><small>2025-08-23 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620043-raw-network-busted-in-karachi-as-ctd-arrests-six-terrorists' target='_blank'><strong>RAW network 'busted' in Karachi as CTD arrests six suspects</strong></a><br><p>

The ballot is scheduled for Sept 18.
The seat fell vacant after the Election Commission of Pakistan de-seated Punjab PTI President MNA Ahmed Chattha in the wake of his conviction in May 9 riots.
In the upcoming by-poll, the PML-N did not award ticket to its last two-time aspirant Dr Nisar Cheema, who won the seat in 2018 and lost in February 2024 as a runner-up.
The party announced ex-MPA Bilal Farooq Tarar, the brother of federal minister for information Attaullah Tarar, as its candidate in the Wazirabad by-poll.
Following the nomination of the PML-N candidate, the Cheema group got  annoyed as earlier Nisar Cheema’s elder brother Justice retired Iftikhar Cheema had won the seat thrice as PML-N candidate.
However, on Friday the PML-N president and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif held a meeting with Dr Nisar Cheema and Zulfiqar Cheema at his residence in Murree where Punjab PML-N President Rana Sanaullah, former federal minister Khurram Dastgir Khan, ex-MNA Mudassar Qayyum and party’s Gujranwala division president former MNA Abid Raza Kotla and others were also present.
Participants in the meeting apprised Nawaz of the political situation in Gujranwala region, particularly the party’s campaign for the by-poll.
The party chief reportedly promised to address their concerns.
 






 
 

Gujranwala division PML-N President Abid Raza told Dawn that the meeting was ‘very successful’ as the Cheema brothers had later called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad where they announced a complete support to the PML-N candidate.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Rana Sanaullah were also present in the meeting in the PM office, Mr Raza said.
 






Sources said the Cheemas had been feeling ignored by the PML-N leadership since the February 2024 election and lack of coordination between them and the leadership had created a distance due to which the party opted to change its candidate.
The Cheema clan is said to have an edge in terms of population over the Chattha clan in Wazirabad that’s why most of the times the seat was won by representatives of this clan.
The PTI is yet to announce its candidate since it is not clear to contest the vote.
Sources said a member of senior politician Hamid Nasir Chattha’s family might contest the by-poll if the party opted to contest the election.

Babar and Rizwan, once Pakistan’s revered T20I opening pair, have been sidelined from the format as the team pursues a more aggressive approach under new leadership.
The transition follows the appointments of Mike Hesson as Pakistan’s white-ball head coach and Salman Ali Agha as T20I captain earlier this year. Hesson has publicly stated that Babar and Rizwan need to refine their T20I skills to reclaim their spots in the national XI.
 
 

With the senior duo out of favour, Pakistan are relying on less-experienced players such as Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, and Mohammad Haris to bolster the top order, while Hasan Nawaz has emerged as a promising middle-order batter. All featured prominently in Hesson’s first three assignments and are set to play when Pakistan begin their tri-nation series in the United Arab Emirates on August 29.
The tournament, featuring hosts UAE and Afghanistan, will be staged entirely in Sharjah and is seen as a preparatory competition ahead of the Asia Cup, which begins on September 9 in the UAE.
“Everyone should get an opportunity. Babar and Rizwan are world-class players and have done great for Pakistan, and they will continue to do so,” Shaheen told reporters on the sidelines of the team’s training camp at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday.
 






“But everyone gets opportunities, and they should seize them. The youngsters we have are also our players, and we should back them. The more we support them, the better. Instead of criticising them for being new, we should remember they are our players and help them progress.”
The Asia Cup will provide Hesson and Salman with their first significant test, giving them a chance to assess the team months ahead of the T20 World Cup, scheduled in India and Sri Lanka in February-March next year.
Under Hesson, Pakistan have enjoyed mixed results so far, having thrashed Bangladesh 3-0 at home, lost 2-1 away, and defeated West Indies 2-1 in the United States.
The Asia Cup will feature at least one and at most three high-stakes encounters with India. With the cross-border tensions of May still fresh, the matches are expected to be intense, presenting a stern challenge for Pakistan’s revamped side.
Shaheen, however, expressed confidence in his team’s preparation.
“Obviously, it’s a high-pressure match, and plans will be made,” he said. “But with the kind of preparation we have, I don’t think Pakistan has ever prepared this early before. This time, we have a great opportunity. We can also use the stadium to our advantage. Our preparation can get even better for the big matches. But our first target is the tri-nation series, and then the Asia Cup.”
The left-arm pacer also acknowledged the threat posed by Afghanistan and UAE in the tri-series.
“In T20 cricket, no team is easy,” he noted. “But our preparation is solid; we have a young team ready to play fearless cricket. I think we have an edge, and there’s nothing to worry about. Our preparation is for the big events.”

“I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript of her two-day interview last month with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. “The president was never inappropriate with anybody.”
During the interview, the imprisoned 63-year-old former British socialite also said she did not witness any sexual abuse by Epstein, her longtime boyfriend, and did not implicate any other prominent individuals in wrongdoing.
“He kept a lot to himself and he didn’t like to share,” Maxwell said of Epstein. “He was not a sharer. Well, at least not with me.”
The Justice Department’s release of the transcripts and audio recordings of Maxwell’s interview comes amid intense public curiosity about Epstein, a multimillionaire who socialised with the cultural and political elite, and as Trump, a Republican, tries to tamp down a political crisis stemming from the Justice Department’s decision not to release files from its investigation of Epstein despite its earlier pledges to do so.
 
 

Maxwell spoke with Blanche on the condition that she not be prosecuted for any self-incriminating statements she were to make, but she could be prosecuted if she lied in the interview.
Maxwell was previously charged with perjury for lying in a 2016 deposition about her knowledge of Epstein’s alleged behaviour, though prosecutors dropped those charges after a jury found her guilty of sex trafficking in 2021.
During Maxwell’s month-long trial in Manhattan, jurors heard emotional and explicit testimony from four women who said Maxwell recruited and groomed them for abuse by Epstein. Three of the four said Maxwell herself touched their bare breasts or took part in the encounters, which often began as massages.
Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty.
Epstein’s death, coupled with his friendships with powerful people like Trump and former Democratic President Bill Clinton, has fueled conspiracy theories that other people were involved in his crimes, and that he was murdered to cover that up. No one other than he and Maxwell have been charged with crimes.
Blanche asked Maxwell if Epstein maintained any “client list”.
“There is no list that I am aware of,” Maxwell said.
 
 

Maxwell, who pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges brought against her in 2020, has asked the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. David Markus, Maxwell’s attorney, said in a statement on Friday that the interview supports Maxwell’s argument that she is innocent.
“She supported her answers with documents and other objective evidence. Her demeanour and credibility are clear for anyone to hear,” Markus said.
Markus has previously said Maxwell has not held discussions with Trump about a possible pardon, but that she would welcome “relief”.
‘Very cordial’
Blanche’s interview of Maxwell on July 24 and July 25 came as Trump sought to quell criticism from his conservative base of supporters and congressional Democrats over the Justice Department’s decision not to release the files.
A week after the interview, Maxwell was moved from a low-security prison facility in Florida to a less-restrictive prison camp in Texas.
Trump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. During Maxwell’s trial, the financier’s longtime pilot, Lawrence Visoski, testified that Trump flew on Epstein’s private plane multiple times. Trump has denied flying on the plane.
Maxwell told Blanche she never saw Trump receive a massage or engage in other inappropriate activity. Many of Epstein’s alleged victims say their unwanted sexual encounters with him began as massages.
“As far as I’m concerned, President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. “And I just want to say that I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now.”
 
 

It is rare for a Justice Department official as senior as Blanche — who has also served as Trump’s personal lawyer — to directly interview a criminal defendant.
Blanche asked Maxwell about her and Epstein’s interactions with a spate of prominent Democrats, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and billionaire Democratic donor George Soros.
Maxwell did not implicate any of those individuals in wrongdoing.
Maxwell said she worked with Bill Clinton on his philanthropic endeavours, and that he used Epstein’s plane for a trip to Africa. But she said Clinton never visited Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein was accused of abusing some girls.</p><small>2025-08-23 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/231042438d2efee.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934710/encounter-another-child-molester-shot-in-private-parts-in-kasur' target='_blank'><strong>‘Encounter’: Another child molester shot in private parts in Kasur</strong></a><br><p>KASUR: In another incident in Kasur, a suspect, who had molested a minor girl, was shot in his private parts during an alleged encounter in the limits of Chunian Police Station on Friday.
The suspect was seen with a 10-year-old girl at Zaheerabad Colony of Chunain through a viral video. The child was in the street when he molested her and CCTV footage captured him committing the crime. The girl child’s father had reported the matter to the police and registered an FIR.
The police claimed when they conducted a raid to arrest the suspect, he tried to attack them with his pistol that went off. As a result, his private parts were critically injured. The suspect was hospitalised in an injured condition.
According to sources in the police, he belonged to the same area as that of the child he molested. He is stated to be 27/28 years old, a daily-wager with no regular job. He is married and has a daughter.
About three weeks back, a video of a man molesting a girl child who was playing in the street of Shah Inayat Colony had gone viral, causing an outrage on social media.
DPO Essa Khan Sukhera had taken notice of the footage and directed Station House Officer Asif Javed to arrest the suspect. Three days later, the suspect, a labourer from Okara, was arrested by City police in an injured condition. He too had suffered a bullet injury to his private parts.
The police said the suspect was caught at Dhanpat Road where he pulled out a pistol to escape arrest. However, the pistol went off during a firing exchange, causing an injury to him.
Kasur has been notorious in recent years due to child molestation, rape and sexual abuse cases. In 2015, a child pornography ring was busted for involvement in a case in which over 200 children of Hussain Khanwala village were filmed while raping young boys and girls.
As many as 285 cases of child sexual abuse were recorded in this single scandal. The busted gang had men in their 20s and 30s. According to some reports, the entire village knew about the shocking activities of the gang.
In 2018, six-year-old Zainab Amin was kidnapped, raped and killed by a suspect.
In 2020, a 12-year-old boy was arrested for raping a three-year-old boy child on the rooftop of his house. In 2021, am 11-year-old boy, a seminary student, was raped by four men, aged 30 to 40, near Rohi Nullah on his way to his seminary.

The Pakistan Tele­comm­unication Authority (PTA) said the tariff adjustments highlighted in the audit observations had been duly approved by the authority in line with the prescribed regulatory framework.
“All relevant records substantiating these approvals were shared with the audit authorities for verification,” the PTA stated.
In a statement, PTA said, “Certain misleading information is being circulated on social media, suggesting that Jazz charged its subscribers tariffs beyond those approved by PTA during the financial year 2023–24, as referenced in the Auditor General of Pakistan’s report.”
 
 

It reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding consumer interests and ensuring a fair, transparent telecom ecosystem.
The authority maintains continuous oversight of all operators’ tariff structures to ensure strict compliance with regulatory requirements and to prevent any unfair commercial practices.
 






Meanwhile, Jazz has also issued a statement claiming that it was reviewing the observations shared in the audit report on the PTA for Audit Year 2024–25.
“We remain confident that Jazz has acted lawfully and transparently at every step, in full alignment with PTA’s rules and regulatory procedures, including those related to tariff approvals and mandated contributions.”

• Naveed Qamar argues lawmakers deserve same relief as civil servants
ISLAMABAD: A National Assembly panel on Friday failed to reach consensus on a bill seeking secrecy of lawmakers’ assets after members from PML-N and PTI joined hands to oppose the move tabled by PPP legislators.
Under the existing law, all members of the National Assembly, Senate, and provincial assemblies are required to submit to the Election Commission, on or before Dec 31 each year, a statement of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouses and dependent children. Section 138 of the Elections Act also requires the ECP to publish these declarations in the official gazette.
The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs, which met under the chairmanship of Rana Iradat Sharif Khan, considered the bill introduced by Shazia Marri and Syed Naveed Qamar.
The proposed amendment to Section 138 seeks to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the extent of disclosure, under this section, shall give due regard to the balance between public interest for good governance and an individual’s privacy and security. Provided further that the extent to which the first proviso shall apply will be determined by the Speaker of the concerned Assembly and, in the case of the Senate, by the Chairman.”
 






According to the statement of objects and reasons, the amendment aims to strike a balance between transparency and the protection of individual rights.
It states: “While the publication of statements of assets and liabilities serves a vital role in promoting public accountability, enhancing trust in public office, and ensuring good governance, it is recognised that unrestricted or excessive disclosure could potentially compromise the personal security and privacy of parliamentarians and their families.”
During the proceedings, Mr Qamar referred to the recently passed amendment to the Civil Servants Act, which requires civil servants in grades 17 to 22 to disclose all domestic and foreign assets, including those of their spouses and dependent children.
He pointed out that civil servants can approach their heads of departments if they believe disclosure of their assets could pose a security threat. He argued that similar relief should also be available to lawmakers.
The committee was also apprised that National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) was expanding its operational capacity. The agency has also enhanced coordination with the PTA to curb the misuse of illegal SIMs. It also raised concerns over financial crimes, fraudulent activities targeting the BISP.

The fifth accused, Mama Abdul Ghafoor, a leader of the National Party, was released by police, who said he is no longer required for investigation.
Mahrang Baloch, along with Beebu Baloch, Gulzadi Baloch and Bebarg Baloch, was produced before the ATC in Quetta amid tight security.
Police informed the court that further investigation was needed and requested a 15-day extension in remand, which the court approved.
This is the fourth time the BYC leaders have been presented before the court since their arrest. Initially, they were detained under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (3MPO). Following the expiry of their MPO detention, terrorism-related charges were filed against them.
 
 

A large number of BYC supporters gathered outside the court during the hearing, raising slogans in solidarity with their leaders.
Speaking to the media outside the court, Mahrang Baloch said the state was attempting to intimidate the public by imprisoning BYC leaders. “We want to make it clear that no national or public movement retreats because of imprisonment.”
She said that the arrests were an effort to suppress the voice of the people of Balochistan, but instead, “we will amplify this voice so that the world hears the demands of the Baloch people”.

In a special report, the IIF noted that while Pakistan has successfully rebuilt its economic buffers and secured financing, the gains will likely prove short-lived without comprehensive structural reforms, particularly in tax broadening, privatisation, and the resolution of circular debt.
The report emphasised that Pakistan has made little headway in these critical areas, particularly privatisation and energy-sector restructuring, with circular debt still unresolved. The IIF warned that these unresolved issues pose a significant risk to Pakistan’s economic outlook for FY26.
 
 

Notably, inflation has decreased significantly, allowing the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to cut its policy rate to 11pc since the easing cycle began in June 2024.
In addition, Pakistan posted its first current account surplus (0.5pc of GDP) since FY11, along with the highest primary balance surplus (2.4pc of GDP) in over two decades in FY25. These developments have resulted in sustained multilateral and bilateral support and improved credit ratings.
However, the IIF highlighted that despite these positive headlines, the economic situation is not as promising as it may seem. Geopolitical tensions, both regional and global, pose significant challenges for FY26, while domestic political instability, though subsiding, remains fragile. The relationship between the military establishment and the opposition PTI party remains tenuous, adding to the uncertainty.

Highlights structural weaknesses in tax broadening, privatisation and energy sector, undermining long-term stability

While fiscal and external buffers accumulated in FY24/25 have provided some relief, they remain limited. The $5bn increase in reserve assets has boosted the country’s import coverage to just 2.4 months, while the primary balance surplus has led to a slight reduction in total public sector debt, which remains high at around 67pc of GDP. These figures suggest that while short-term stability has been achieved, long-term sustainability remains uncertain.
The IIF also pointed out that the recent trade agreement with the United States, Pakistan’s largest export partner, could provide some support to the textile industry, though the benefits are expected to be modest. Agriculture, which accounts for nearly a quarter of GDP and employs 40pc of the workforce, will likely remain sluggish. The kharif season, covering key crops such as rice, sugarcane, cotton, and maise, has faced early water shortages followed by heavy monsoon rains, which could weigh heavily on harvests in the first half of FY26.
Furthermore, deadly flash floods have exacerbated the challenges, plunging Pakistan into its second major flooding crisis in three years. This could have serious implications for growth, as well as for the country’s external and fiscal balances.
Inflation, while improving, remains a concern. A sharp rise in food prices, caused by the floods, led to a 2.9pc month-on-month increase in headline inflation in July, the largest increase in two years. Core inflation remains sticky, hovering around 7pc in urban areas and 8pc in rural areas. Additionally, energy price adjustments (including higher gas tariffs, subsidy removals, and increased fuel costs) and new tax measures are expected to feed into inflation in the near term. As a result, the SBP paused interest rate cuts in June and July, and the IIF expects interest rates to remain on hold for an extended period, with inflation averaging 6.5pc in FY26.
On the external front, the IIF forecasted that Pakistan’s current account will be influenced by the normalisation of imports (particularly machinery, raw materials, and consumer goods). Exports will depend largely on the progress of the US-Pakistan trade deal, though the IIF remains sceptical of its impact on exports. In the absence of a sharp increase in commodity prices, the current account deficit is expected to stay modest (about 0.5pc of GDP in FY26), allowing some reserve accumulation, though import coverage will remain critically low at about 2.5 months.
 
 

The IIF also expressed concerns over Pakistan’s fiscal situation. Although the country’s fiscal deficit narrowed to 5.4pc of GDP in FY25 and total revenues grew by 35.6pc, much of this growth came from one-off factors, such as record profits from the State Bank of Pakistan.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) fell short of its target by about 1pc of GDP, and the federal tax-to-GDP ratio remains stuck at around 10pc. For FY26, authorities are forecasting another large increase in tax revenues, but this may be difficult to sustain given the already high tax burden on the formal sector and the exclusion of the retail/wholesale sectors, which account for about 20pc of GDP, from the tax net.
On the expenditure side, reductions in subsidies (particularly on electricity) and net lending to public enterprises have helped, but total spending still rose by 18pc in FY25. The IIF also noted that recent tensions with India could lead to an increase in defence spending in FY26.
As a result, the authorities’ targets of a 3.9pc of GDP deficit and a 2.4pc primary surplus for FY26 appear overly ambitious. The heavy reliance on domestic financing is also a cause for concern, and the IIF warned that fiscal performance will remain a key test for the IMF programme, with vested interests complicating the progress of reforms.

• Over 330 households affected across six villages; no casualties reported
• Dozens of homes, acres of farmland, bridges and trees submerged
• GB CM orders immediate rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure
GILGIT: A glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) caused widespread devastation in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Ghizer Valley early on Friday mor­n­ing, but the quick thinking of a local shepherd helped avert a human tragedy.
According to Rescue 1122, the flood, triggered by a burst from a glacier in the Tildas village of Gupis Valley, occurred at around 3am, wreaking havoc downstream.
The flood debris blocked the Ghizer River for several hours, significantly raising the risk of further flooding in adjacent areas. Gilgit-Bal­t­istan Secretary Fida Hussain explained that a gla­cial lake had formed above Tildas and Rawshan villages. The high temperatures led to the burst of the lake, causing a flash flood in Sado Nallah on Wednesday night.
A shepherd, Wasiyat Khan from Rawshan village, who was near the glacier, used his mobile phone to alert the community about the impending flood. His warning gave villagers enough time to evacuate and local volunteers swiftly moved residents to safer locations.
 






Mr Hussain confirmed that although the flood swept through the downstream areas of Tildas and Rawshan, no casualties were reported. However, around 40 people were initially stranded in the floodwaters on Friday morning. The Pakistan Army was called for a helicopter rescue, but by the time the helicopters arrived, local volunteers had already managed to rescue the stranded individuals. All affected residents are reported to be safe.
Local sources said that the flood devastated approximately 80 per cent of Tildas village, displacing 65 households and washing away homes, land, infrastructure and personal belongings. The floodwaters also blocked the Ghizer River for six hours, creating an artificial lake and submerging homes, farmland, bridges and trees in nearby villages.
According to a local administration report, the flood affected over 330 households across six villages — Tildas, Raushan, Hakis, Gawat and Molaabad — after the river was blocked. The report highlights that of the 906 houses in these villages, 330 were severely damaged, leaving these families in dire need of emergency assistance.
Public infrastructure was also submerged, including a mosque, a school, a Jamat Khana and an RCC bridge on the Gilgit-Ghizer Road. The artificial lake on the Ghizer River submerged parts of the Gilgit-Shandur Road, cutting off access to the upper Gupis, Phander and Yasin regions.
According to Rescue 1122, some 200 people were rescued from the flood-affected areas and relocated to the Yangal and Samal areas of Ghizer. The rescue teams also provided medical assistance to those traumatised by the destruction of their homes.

Displaced families, who fled with little more than the clothes on their backs, are now in urgent need of shelter, food and medical supplies. The local administration has said that while water has begun to recede from the artificial lake, the risk to downstream settlements persists.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and cabinet members visited the affected areas in Ghizer and announced the immediate rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure, including bridges, power supply lines, drinking water and irrigation channels.
The chief minister also directed the home secretary and the director general of the GB Disaster Management Authority to assist in the rescue efforts and ensure the safety of the affected populations.
In recognition of the heroic actions of the shepherd, Wasiyat Khan, the GB police department issued an official commendation certificate.
His timely alert saved several lives, and local communities and officials alike have hailed him as a hero.
 
 

Ghizer Valley has been severely affected by flooding this year. On Aug 14, the region was struck by multiple floods, resulting in 13 deaths, several injuries and widespread displacement across the Ghalti, Ishkoman, Gupis, Yasin, Daen and Chaturkhand areas.
These disasters occurred without early warning systems in place, which could have saved lives and property.

The ADB is in advanced talks to lead the financing of a $2 billion upgrade of a 500-km stretch of the railway line, which had previously been part of the Chinese project, two sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.
The proposed rail upgrade would modernise the track and bridges from the com­mercial capital Karachi to Rohri, near Suk­kur, so that trains can run faster.
In Rohri, the line will meet a branch coming from the area of the Reko Diq mine and will carry the copper concentrate to port.
The upgrade has become urgent, sour­ces said, as it is needed to transport copper ore from the Reko Diq mine currently being developed by Canada’s Barrick Mining Corp.
Earlier this week, ADB announced $410 million in financing for the Reko  Diq mine itself, and its president is due to visit Islamabad next  week, they said.
 
 

Tim Cribb, Reko Diq’s project director, told Reuters that the government  and Barrick would work together on securing financing for the upgrading of the branch coming from the west to Rohri.
The Reko Diq copper and gold mine is due to enter production in 2028 with anti­cipated annual output of some 200,000  metric tons of copper concentrate.
One of the world’s largest untapped copper deposits, it is Pakistan’s largest foreign investment in recent years.
“We will have a crisis. How will you evacuate output from Reko Diq? The exhausted line will come under even more pressure,” a senior government official said.
There was no immediate comment from Pakistan’s railways ministry or China’s foreign ministry.
The ADB would not confirm the finance package, which is being reported for the first time by Reuters. But it said Pakistan’s government and the regional lender  “have regular discussions on railway sector development”.
“Any potential ADB assistance would be subject to comprehensive due diligence and consideration under ADB’s policies and procedures before any commitment is made,” it said.

“We are very confident that these relations are stable and sustainable on their own and will continue to grow and achieve new heights,” Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said during the weekly media briefing.
His remarks came a day after Chi­n­ese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Pakistan as part of his three-nation South Asian tour to attend the sixth Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue.
While the Pak-China dialogue broadly reviewed various aspects of the bilateral relationship, both sides carefully navigated the region’s shifting geopolitical landscape marked by warming China-India ties, Pakistan’s growing engagement with the United States, and tensions in US-India relations driven by President Trump’s tariffs and policies.
 



FO terms New Delhi’s missile capabilities a global security threat

India’s leg of Yi’s visit strengthened China’s rapprochement with New Delhi after years of hostility. The visit resulted in agreements to resume suspended trade talks and accelerate negotiations on border disputes.
Speaking at a media conference following the bilateral dialogue, Yi had emphasised China’s partnerships with both India and Pakistan “were not targeted at any third party, nor were they affected by any third party.”
 
 

Both Yi and FM Ishaq Dar underlined the importance that Pakistan and China attach to each other. Yi described Islamabad as “the most important stop” on his three-nation trip and highlighted the “stronger internal drive” behind bilateral ties.
Echoing these sentiments, the FO spokesperson said: “Pakistan-China relationship is a very sustainable, longstanding, and robust relationship.” He expressed confidence that Pakistan-China relations, including their growing economic and strategic cooperation, would not be affected by regional developments, including those involving China.
Dialogue offer
Mr Khan said Pakistan is ready for an all-encompassing dialogue with India and welcomed the mediatory efforts of ‘friends’. “We are ready for composite dialogue. We welcome any effort which helps us achieve our objectives,” he remarked.
 
 

Although Wang Yi did not publicly comment on India-Pakistan tensions or offer to mediate, he said, “A peaceful, stable, and prosperous South Asia serves the common interests of all sides and meets the expectations of all peoples.”
Mr Dar, soon after Yi’s visit, signalled Pakistan’s readiness to engage in dialogue with India. The FO spokesman stressed that unlike India’s insistence on focusing solely on terrorism, Pakistan believes “this would just be one item during the composite dialogue.”
Pakistan was not reluctant to address terrorism, as “we have complete and detailed evidence about India’s acts of terrorism against Pakistan”, he said.
Agni-V test
The FO warned that India’s expanding missile capabilities pose a threat to both regional and global security and criticised the selective application of export control regulations by the Western countries that enabled New Delhi to advance its missile programme.
 
 

“The acquisition and testing of int­ercontinental ballistic missile capabilities reflects a growing military threat posed by India extending far beyond the region and even the continent. This development seriously undermines peace, security and strategic stability at both regional and global levels,” the spokesperson said.
“India’s expanding missile arsenal, including systems with intercontinental range, raises serious concerns about the selective and discriminatory application of Export Control Regulations that have enabled such destabilising advancements,” Mr Khan added.
Expressing concern over India’s accelerating arms buildup, Mr Khan warned: “It is dangerous not only for Pakistan’s security but also for regional stability.”

The report, compiled by the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP), said that under the law, the SECP must obtain approval from the Ministry of Finance for salary hikes. However, the SECP management proceeded with a pay raise for its employees during a Policy Board meeting on Oct 17, 2024, with effect from July 1, 2023.
The audit found that the salary package of SECP Chairman Akif Saeed reached Rs41.53m for the fiscal year 2023-24, while each commissioner received Rs35.8m due to the backdated salary increases. Additio­nally, the report revealed that SECP illegally distributed Rs110m for entertainment allowances to its commissioners and staff.
The AGP’s findings highlight that while the SECP Policy Board approved these raises, it lacked the authority to sanction such increases. Besides, the pay and allowance increases were made without prior approval from the finance division, totalling Rs377.22m.
The audit report urged the finance ministry to either approve or reverse these illegal increases.
 
 

The audit also highlighted that SECP had failed to deposit around Rs14 billion into the Federal Consolidated Fund, including Rs7.11bn in revenues. These funds were generated through licensing and registration fees (Rs4.13bn), the insurance sector (Rs591.56m), the securities market (Rs47.77m), and specialised companies (Rs1.91bn).
Under Section 37(1) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2019, all revenues collected by an autonomous entity under federal government statutory instruments must be deposited in the treasury single account. However, SECP did not comply with this requirement.
The SECP also failed to deposit a surplus balance of Rs6.99bn into the Federal Consolidated Fund, even though any surplus of receipts over actual expenditure must be remitted to the Fund.

The Improved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Programme, Subprogramme 2, includes a policy-based loan of $300m and ADB’s first-ever policy-based guarantee of up to $500m. The guarantee is expected to help mobilise up to $1 billion from commercial banks, the Manila-based lender said in a statement.
The ADB noted that Pakistan had made significant progress in improving macroeconomic conditions, and the new programme supports the government’s commitment to further reforms. These reforms are aimed at strengthening public finances and promoting sustainable growth. The programme is designed to support wide-ranging reforms to improve tax policy, administration, and compliance, while enhancing public expenditure and cash management. It also focuses on promoting digitalisation, facilitating investment, and fostering private sector development.
The primary goal of these measures is to reduce Pakistan’s fiscal deficit and public debt, while creating fiscal space for social and development spending, the ADB explained. The programme is backed by a comprehensive support package, including technical assistance and close coordination with development partners, to help Pakistan build long-term fiscal resilience and stability.
The programme follows a policy-based lending (PBL) modality, which includes two subprogrammes. Subprogramme 1, approved and disbursed in December 2023, totalled $300m and focused on establishing the foundation for policies, laws, and institutional capacities to enhance resource mobilisation and allocation. 
Subprogramme 2 builds on these foundational reforms and aims to drive substantial improvements in tax policy and administration, taxpayer compliance, public expenditure, and cash management, as well as the mobilisation and effective utilisation of national resources, including domestic private investment and savings.
For Subprogramme 2, the ADB has proposed the inclusion of policy-based guarantees (PBGs) to support the government’s financing needs within the current fiscal year. These guarantees will take the form of partial credit guarantees (PCGs) to mitigate credit risk for commercial banks lending to Pakistan, thereby facilitating the mobilisation of private capital.
Despite the significant progress in restoring economic stability through consistent policy reforms, the ADB warned that long-standing structural challenges remain. “A narrow tax base limits fiscal fairness, sustainability, and the ability to meet Pakistan’s considerable social and development spending needs,” the bank stated.
