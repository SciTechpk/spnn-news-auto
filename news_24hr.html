However, the footage dates back to October 2024 and shows Iranian airstrikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase.
Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders and that this was start of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed and state media reported that the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Additionally, at least six nuclear scientists were also killed along with civilians, as per reports.
Today, an Israeli X user posted a video of missile attack on an unidentified location, with the following caption: “Crazy documentation from Iran, dozens of periods at the same time.”
The post was viewed nearly 30,000 times.
Israeli analyst Eli David shared the same clip with the following caption, “Tehran moments ago,” racking up 523,000 views.
It was also shared here, here, here, and here, gaining 209,000, 77,000, 11,000, and 2,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and influx of visuals coming out of the recent conflict between Iran and Israel.
A reverse image search of the keyframes of the clip yielded a posted by a user on X dated October 1, 2024, with the caption, “🇮🇱🇮🇷 15 minutes Iranian missiles hitting Israel … supercut.”
 






Refining the search for that date yielded an October 1, 2024, YouTube video by Indian state broadcaster Doordarshan titled: “Iranian missiles targeting the Nevatim airbase in the Negev Desert”.
 


A keyword search for “Iran airstrike” and “Israel” around the corresponding date yielded an October 1, 2024, news report from Al Jazeera, titled “Iran says missiles fired at Israel in response to assassinations.”
According to the report, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, in retaliation for the killing of senior Iranian and allied leaders, including top commanders from Hezbollah and Hamas.
Israeli authorities reported that around 200 ballistic missiles were fired, triggering air raid sirens and shelter warnings across several regions. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had claimed responsibility, labelling the attack a response to Israeli “crimes”. While many of the missiles were intercepted, some caused significant damage and casualties, escalating fears of further regional conflict.
The viral clip was also circulated during the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May with claims it showed India attacking Pakistan.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows an Israeli attack in Tehran is false. The video is old from October 2024 and shows Iranian airstrikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase.

Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran early on Friday, saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders and that this was the start of a “prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.”
Iran promised a harsh response and Israel said it was working to intercept about 100 drones launched towards Israeli territory in retaliation.
But around 0800 GMT (1pm PKT), Israeli media said an order to citizens to remain near protected areas had been lifted, suggesting that most or all the drones had been neutralised.

Key developments so far:

Iran says top commanders, including Hossein Salami, killed
Israel says military intercepting drones fired from Iran in response
At least 95 casualties so far, including women and children
Iran’s supreme leader appoints new military commanders
Trump urges Iran to make deal, warns of more “death and destruction”


In a letter to the United Nations, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the attack as a “declaration of war” and “called on the UN Security Council to immediately address this issue”, the ministry said.
An Israeli security source said Israeli Mossad commandos had operated deep inside the Islamic Republic before the attack and the Israeli spy agency and military had led a series of covert operations against Iran’s strategic missile array.
Israel also established an attack-drone base near Tehran, the source added.
The military said it had carried out a large-scale strike against Iran’s air defences, destroying “dozens of radars and surface-to-air missile launchers”. Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions including at the main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.
Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, had been killed and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Several children were killed in a strike on a residential area in the capital, they said.
At least 95 people were wounded in Israel’s attack and taken to medical centres in 12 different provinces that were targeted, national emergency services spokesperson Mojtaba Khaledi told state TV.
 
 

Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei swiftly appointed new Revolutionary Guards and armed forces chiefs to replace those killed in targeted Israeli strikes on Friday.
In separate decrees, Khamenei named Mohammad Pakpour to replace Salami as commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Abdolrahim Mousavi to replace Mohammad Bagheri as chief of the armed forces general staff.
A senior adviser to Khamenei was wounded during the attack, state media reported.
“Ali Shamkhani, an advisor to the supreme leader… was injured in today’s attack by the Zionist regime,” according to state TV.
Earlier in the day, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a recorded video message: “We are at a decisive moment in Israel’s history.
“Moments ago Israel launched Operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival. This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”

Khamenei said in a statement that Israel had “unleashed its wicked and bloody” hand in a crime against Iran and that it would receive “a bitter fate for itself”.
An Israeli military official said Israel was striking “dozens” of nuclear and military targets including the facility at Natanz in central Iran. The official claimed Iran had enough material to make 15 nuclear bombs within days.

The United States said it had no part in the operation, which raises the risk of a fresh escalation in tensions in the Middle East, a major oil-producing region.
Alongside extensive air strikes, Israel’s Mossad spy agency led a series of covert sabotage operations inside Iran, Axios reported, citing a senior Israeli official. These operations were aimed at damaging Iran’s strategic missile sites and its air defence capabilities.
At least six nuclear scientists were killed in Israel’s attacks, media outlets in the Islamic Republic reported.
Iran’s Tasnim news agency named the six scientists including Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran. Fereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, was also among the scientists killed, it added.
Later in the day, the organisation added that most of the damage from Israeli air strikes targeting its underground uranium enrichment facility at Natanz was at ground level.
“Most of the damage is on the surface level,” said the organisation’s spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, adding that there had been “no casualties” at the facility where the enrichment centrifuges are housed underground.
A fresh round of explosions was heard in northwestern Iran, state television reported, following Israel’s wave of early morning strikes on multiple cities.
“A few minutes ago, new explosions were heard in East Azerbaijan,” the broadcaster said, as the Tasnim news agency said an earlier wave of strikes had hit 10 sites in the province, killing at least three people.
Meanwhile, Israel’s embassy to Sweden said that Israel would close its diplomatic missions around the world in light of recent developments and that consular services would not be provided. It did not say how long the missions would be closed.
Pezeshkian administration: Iran will write the ending to this story
The administration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has released a statement, announcing that Iran will avenge the blood of every single individual killed in Israeli strikes, IRNA reported.
“With a savage regime as this,” the statement read, referring to Israel, “one shall not speak but with the language of power.”
“As of this moment, the Islamic Republic of Iran’s government has begun the necessary defensive, political, and legal measures to make the illegitimate Israel regret [its aggression] and will deny the Israelis a moment’s rest,” it said.
“The world now better understands Iran’s insistence on its right to enrichment and nuclear technology and missile power.”
Iran has in the past 200 years never started a war, the statement said, but will not hesitate the slightest to defend itself.
“The ending to this story will be written by Iran.”
Trump urges Iran to make a deal
US President Donald Trump urged Iran to “make a deal”, warning that there will be more “death and destruction” after Israel launched deadly strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities.
“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
“Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left… just do it before it’s too late,” he said.
Iran to make a deal over its nuclear programme, saying that there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.
“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
Earlier in the day, Trump said that Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table, in an interview with Fox News after the start of the Israeli air strikes on Iran.
“We will see,” Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin quoted Trump as saying in a post on X.
Trump would convene a meeting of the National Security Council on Friday morning, the White House said. He had said on Thursday an Israeli strike on Iran “could very well happen” but reiterated his hopes for a peaceful resolution.
The US military is planning for the full range of contingencies in the Middle East, including the possibility that it might have to help evacuate American civilians, a US official told Reuters.
Iran’s armed forces spokesperson said Israel and its chief ally the United States would pay a “heavy price” for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation.
While the US tried to distance itself from Israel’s military operation, an Israeli
official told public broadcaster Kan that Israel had coordinated with Washington on Iran.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.
“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said in a statement.
“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US interests or personnel,” he added.
 






The State Department issued an advisory saying that all US government employees in Israel and their family members should “shelter in place until further notice”.
Hezbollah warns Israel Iran strikes ‘threaten to ignite the region’
Lebanese group Hezbollah condemned Israel’s wave of strikes on Iran on Friday, warning that they threaten to “ignite the region”.
“This enemy adheres to no logic or laws and knows only the language of killing, fire, and destruction,” Hezbollah said in a statement that condemned the strikes as a “brutal” aggression.
UN nuclear watchdog chief ready to travel to Iran to assess situation
UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said he was ready to travel to Iran to assess the situation there after Israel’s strikes hit the sprawling nuclear complex at Natanz.
In a statement to a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors, Grossi said the other main enrichment centre in Iran, Fordow, was not hit and neither was another nuclear facility in Esfahan, citing Iranian authorities.
There are no elevated radiation levels at Natanz, he added.
“I call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint to avoid further escalation. I reiterate that any military action that jeopardizes the safety and security of nuclear facilities risks grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region, and beyond,” Grossi said in his statement.
“I have indicated to the respective authorities my readiness to travel at the earliest to assess the situation and ensure safety, security and non-proliferation in Iran.”
He did not say what the extent of the damage at Natanz was or what parts of the site were hit. The site includes a vast underground uranium enrichment plant and a smaller, above-ground pilot enrichment plant.
Iran is enriching to up to 60 per cent purity, close to the roughly 90pc of weapons-grade, at the pilot plant, but it is producing smaller quantities of that material there than at Fordow, a site dug into a mountain that military experts have said would be difficult for Israel to destroy through bombardment.
“Despite the current military actions and heightened tensions, it is clear that the only sustainable path forward — for Iran, for Israel, the entire region, and the international community — is one grounded in dialogue and diplomacy to ensure peace, stability, and cooperation,” Grossi said.
Earlier today, Grossi said that nuclear facilities “must never be attacked”.
The UN nuclear watchdog said that Iranian authorities told it that no increase in radiation levels have been observed at the Natanz uranium enrichment site following Israeli strikes.
“Iranian authorities have informed the IAEA… that no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site,” the International Atomic Energy Agency said in a post on X, after earlier confirming that the facility was “among targets” of the strikes.
It added that Iran’s only nuclear power plant in the southern port city of Bushehr had not been targeted.
However, Iran’s atomic energy organisation confirmed in a statement that its nuclear facility in Natanz had been damaged, but investigations have not shown any radioactive or chemical contamination outside the site.
“The attack has damaged several parts of the facility. Investigations are ongoing to assess the extent of damages,” the statement said.
 






Meanwhile, Israel’s neighbouring country Jordan’s military said it intercepted drones and missiles that had violated the kingdom’s airspace.
“Royal Air Force aircraft and air defence systems intercepted on Friday morning a number of missiles and drones that entered Jordanian airspace,” a military statement said.
Air raid sirens sounded in the Jordanian capital after Israel’s attack on Iran, while the public security directorate urged people to stay at home.
“Adhere to the guidelines and stay in your homes,” said an announcement on loudspeakers in Amman.
Jordan had earlier said it would not allow its airspace to be violated and vowed not to become a “battleground” in any regional conflict. “Jordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,” government spokesperson Mohammad Momani told AFP.
The government meanwhile condemned Israel’s attack, with foreign ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah warning of “the consequences of such escalatory actions”.
Jordan also called the attack “a blatant violation of the sovereignty of a United Nations member state and a clear breach of international law and the UN Charter”.
Tel Aviv’s Ben Gurion Airport was closed until further notice, and Israel’s air defence units stood at high alert for possible retaliatory strikes from Iran.
“Following the pre-emptive strike by the State of Israel against Iran, a missile and UAV (drone) attack against the State of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate time frame,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.
Israeli military Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir said tens of thousands of soldiers had been called up and “prepared across all borders”.
“We are amidst a historic campaign unlike any other. This is a critical operation to prevent an existential threat, by an enemy who is intent on destroying us,” he said.
Israeli Minister Gideon Saar was holding a “marathon of calls” with counterparts around the world regarding Israel’s attack on Iran, the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Pakistan was among several countries and international actors which condemned Israel’s strikes, with the Foreign Office calling it “unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned “in the strongest possible terms today’s unprovoked attack on Iran by Israel.”
“I convey my deepest sympathies to the Iranian people on the loss of lives in this attack. This grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further destabilising an already volatile region,” he said in a post on X.
“We urge the international community and the United Nations to take urgent steps to prevent any further escalation that could imperil regional and global peace.”
 






Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on X that a 24/7 Crisis Management Unit has been created at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani nationals in Iran.
“Pakistan Embassy in Tehran has also been directed to provide all facilitation to community members/Zaireens. The Embassy’s hotline number is (0098)-2166941388,” he said in a post on X.
 






The National Assembly also unanimously passed a resolution against Israel’s attack on Iran, which was jointly presented by the government and opposition.
The attacks triggered sharp falls in stock prices in Asian trade on Friday, led by a selloff in US futures, while oil prices jumped as investors scurried to safe havens such as gold and the Swiss franc.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned any military escalation in the Middle East, said deputy UN spokesperson Farhan Haq.
“The Secretary-General asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford,” Haq said.
Flight disruptions, airspace closure

Emirates airline said flights to and from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Iran had been cancelled after Israel’s strikes  sparking concerns of a wider escalation.
Several flights scheduled for Friday and one Tehran flight on Saturday were listed as cancelled on the airline’s website, with the Dubai international airport also reporting that “some flights at [DXB] and DWC — Al Maktoum International have been cancelled or delayed due to airspace closures over Iran, Iraq, and Syria” in a statement on X.
The United Arab Emirates capital’s international airport warned of flight disruptions.
“Flight disruptions are expected through today at Zayed International Airport. Passengers are advised to check with their airline for the latest status of their flights before travelling to the airport,” the Abu Dhabi airport said in a statement on X.
 






Qatar Airways  said it had temporarily cancelled flights to Iran and Iraq “due to (the) current situation in the region,” the airline said in a statement.
German airline Lufthansa also said it had suspended all flights to and from Tehran.
“Lufthansa Group flights to and from Tehran will be suspended until further notice due to the current situation,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding it would also avoid Iranian, Iraqi and Israeli airspace for now.
Air France said it was suspending its flights to and From Tel Aviv “until further notice” and was “closely monitoring the situation in the Middle East in real-time,” a spokesman for the French airline told AFP, adding that “the safety of its customers and crews is its absolute priority.”
Earlier on Friday, Iraq also closed its airspace. “The ministry of transport closes Iraqi airspace and suspends air traffic at all Iraqi airports,” the Iraq News Agency reported.
Nuclear talks
US and Iranian officials were scheduled to hold a sixth round of talks on Tehran’s escalating uranium enrichment programme in Oman on Sunday, according to officials from both countries and their Omani mediators.
A US official said those talks were still scheduled to proceed despite the Israeli attack.
The Israeli military said on Friday that it was forced to act based on new intelligence information showing that Iran was “approaching the point of no return” in the development of a nuclear weapon.
“In recent months, this program has accelerated significantly, bringing the regime significantly closer to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” it said in a statement, without disclosing the purported evidence.
A source familiar with US intelligence reports said there had been no recent change in the US intelligence assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and that Khamenei had not authorised the restarting of the nuclear weapons programme that was shuttered in 2003.

This is not the first time Israel has taken pre-emptive action against Iranian nuclear infrastructure. For years, the two states have been engaged in a complex and often covert conflict involving cyber operations, proxy engagements, and targeted killings.
Disputes over Iran’s nuclear activities — which Tehran maintains are for peaceful purposes — have long shaped the relationship. Israel has consistently called for international pressure on Iran, while the latter has rejected allegations of seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

From deadly bombings in Buenos Aires in the early 1990s, to the cyberattack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility using the Stuxnet virus, assassinations of key Iranian nuclear scientists, and now the retaliatory missile exchanges of 2024–2025, the two countries have been locked in a high-stakes regional conflict with global repercussions.
Here is a timeline of key events tracing the covert and open hostilities that have defined the Iran–Israel confrontation over the past decade:
August 2019
Israel carried out a series of attacks in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq — all of Iran’s allies — claiming it was to prevent them from equipping themselves with sophisticated weapons.
It accused Tehran of trying to establish an arms supply line through Iraq and northern Syria into Lebanon. During the same year, Israel also attacked ships carrying Iranian oil and weapons through the sea, according to the New York Times.
January 2020
General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Quds force of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ (IRGC’s) and the architect of its security apparatus, was killed in a US airstrike near Baghdad International Airport. The US has traditionally been Israel’s staunchest ally and has echoed its calls against Iran’s nuclear programme. As a result of the airstrike, Soleimani died alongside Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and several others.

The White House and the Pentagon confirmed that the “killing” of Soleimani in Iraq was ordered by US President Donald Trump as a preemptive action to deter future attacks allegedly being planned by Iran. The Pentagon said Soleimani had been “actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region”. It said it took “decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qasem Soleimani,” but did not specify how.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed Soleimani as a “martyr”, and vowed that a “vigorous revenge is waiting for the criminals”  behind the killing.
Iran struck back in retaliation with missile attacks on Iraqi bases housing American troops. About 100 US military personnel were injured.
March 2021
By the beginning of 2021, Iran and Israel had increasingly begun attacking each other at sea.
Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, accused Iran of being behind a February explosion on an Israeli-owned ship transporting vehicles sailing off the coast of Oman. Iran accused Israel of targeting an Iranian cargo ship about 50 miles off the coast of Israel.
April 2021
Iran blamed Israel for a mysterious explosion that knocked out power at its uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, BBC reported.
Israel did not publicly accept that it was behind what Iran called “an act of sabotage” but US and Israeli media reports quoted officials as saying it was carried out by Israel’s overseas intelligence agency, Mossad.
Iran vowed to take revenge “at a time of its choosing”.
November 2021
Iran’s high-ranking nuclear physicist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was shot “by terrorists” in an ambush near Tehran. At the time of his death, he was serving as head of the Research and Innovation Organisation within Iran’s Ministry of Defence.
Fakhrizadeh had long been suspected by Western, Israeli and Iranian exile foes of masterminding what they alleged was a covert programme to develop nuclear weapons. Iran had consistently denied pursuing nuclear arms, insisting its nuclear activities were for peaceful purposes.

Netanyahu had previously claimed that after the closure of Project AMAD — Iran’s alleged nuclear weapons programme — Fakhrizadeh continued to work on “special projects” within the Defence Ministry.
Following the assassination, Iran’s then-foreign minister condemned the killing as an act of terrorism and accused Israel of carrying out the operation. A spokesperson for Netanyahu declined to comment when approached by AFP.
In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the UN Security Council, Iran’s envoy Majid Takht Ravanchi warned against “any adventuristic measures by the United States and Israel against his country, particularly during the remaining period of the current administration of the United States in office.” referring to Trump’s final weeks in office. He stated that Iran reserved the right to take “all necessary measures” in self-defence.
Fakhrizadeh’s assassination took place less than two months before Joe Biden was to take office as US president.
Biden had promised a return to diplomacy with Iran after four hawkish years under  Trump, who withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and began reimposing crippling sanctions.
July 2022
US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed a new security pact aimed at reinforcing their united stance against Iran. As part of the agreement, the United States pledged it would “never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon” and vowed to use “all” elements of American power to prevent the Islamic Republic from doing so.
Lapid stated that the only measure capable of stopping Iran was knowing that if they continued to develop their nuclear programme, “the free world would use force”.
In response, Iran’s ultra-conservative President Ebrahim Raisi warned the US and its allies that Tehran “would not accept any crisis or insecurity in the region”.
December 2023
An Israeli airstrike outside the Syrian capital Damascus killed a senior adviser in the IRGC, Sayyed Razi Mousavi. He was responsible for coordinating the military alliance between Syria and Iran, according to Reuters.
According to Iran’s ambassador in Damascus, Hossein Akbari, Mousavi was posted at the embassy as a diplomat and was killed by Israeli missiles after returning home from work.
Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi called it a “show of weakness” on Israel’s part.
The IRGC warned that Israel would suffer for killing Mousavi, who held the Guards’ rank of brigadier-general.
April 2024
A suspected Israeli airstrike on the main Iranian embassy compound in Damascus killed seven officer of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), including two senior commanders — Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a senior commander in the Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and his deputy, General Mohammad Hadi Hajriahimi. Several other IRGC military advisers were in the building.
The attack marked the first time the vast embassy compound itself had been hit, and it came amid soaring tensions over Tel Aviv’s war in Gaza.

Israel neither confirmed nor denied responsibility. However, a senior Israeli government official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said those hit had “been behind many attacks on Israeli and American assets and had plans for additional attacks”.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian called for a “serious response by the international community”, while Iran vowed to take revenge.
In retaliation, the IRGC launched what it described as “extensive” drone and missile strikes against “certain targets” inside Israel under the name Operation True Promise. On April 13, Iran carried out a direct attack on Israeli territory using a barrage of drones and missiles. Its regional proxies and allied groups also launched coordinated attacks on Israeli positions.
In response, Israel conducted a direct strike on the Iranian city of Isfahan on April 19, according to multiple sources. Tehran, however, downplayed the incident and indicated it had no immediate plans for retaliation.
July 2024
Hamas’s political leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran amid the Israel-Gaza conflict, hours after he attended a swearing-in ceremony for Iran’s new president. Haniyeh’s bodyguards were also killed in their residence in Tehran.
Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri called it “a grave escalation” aimed at breaking the will of Hamas.

Khamenei threatened “harsh punishment” for Haniyeh’s killing, saying: “We consider it our duty to seek revenge for his blood as he was martyred in the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran.”
Initially, Israel did not comment on the killing. Later, in December, Israel’s defence minister for the first time admitted to Israel’s role in killing Hamas’s political leader, according to BBC.
October 2024
Tensions between the two regional arch-rivals came to a head when Iran launched what it described as a barrage of missiles at targets within Israel. Although Israel claimed it destroyed most of the projectiles before they impacted, several missiles did hit various areas across the country, although no widespread loss of life was reported.
Tehran had claimed at the time that the attack was a response to the assassination of Hassan Nasrallah, IRGC commander Abbas Nilfor­oushan, as well as the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.
June 2025
Israel launched widescale attacks on several Iranian nuclear facilities and military sites, and carried out assassinations of top military officials and nuclear scientists, as part of their launch of Operation Rising Lion — a targeted military operation aimed at rolling  back what it called the “Iranian threat to Israeli survival.” Israeli officials described it as the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from developing an atomic weapon.
Iranian state media have reported the killing of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) top commander Hossein Salami, as well as nuclear scientists Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi in the strike.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei warned that Israel and its chief ally would pay a ‘heavy price’ for the attack, accusing Washington of providing support for the operation. He said Israel would face a “bitter and painful” fate in its aftermath.
Israeli military Chief of Staff, Eyal Zamir, said Israel had reached a “point of no return” with the operation, which began early Friday.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the United States was not involved in the strikes and that Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally for self-defence.

Calling it a “decisive moment in Israel’s history”, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was also targeting Iranian scientists working on a nuclear bomb and missile factories in an operation that would continue for days.
Iran has long maintained that its nuclear-related activity is for peaceful purposes.
Israel declared a state of emergency in anticipation of retaliatory missile and drone strikes by Tehran.
Here are some reactions from top officials and governments around the world:
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio
“Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.”
“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US nterests or personnel.”
 






Pakistan condemns ‘unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel’
Pakistan strongly condemned the “unjustified and illegitimate aggression” by Israel and stood in solidarity with the people of Iran, according to a statement by the Foreign Office.
“Pakistan stands in resolute solidarity with the people of Iran and unequivocally denounces these blatant provocations, which constitute a grave danger and a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, with serious implications,” the FO said.
“The Israeli military strikes violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran and clearly contravene the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law. Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.”
Pakistan noted that the international community and the UN bear responsibility to “uphold international law, stop this aggression immediately and hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.”
 






Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also noted that Israel’s attacks were a “brazen violation of Iran’s sovereignty.”
“This abhorrent action has shaken foundations of international law as well as conscience of humanity, and gravely undermines regional stability & international security. Pakistan stands in solidarity with the government and the people of Iran,” he said in a statement on X.
President Asif Ali Zardari also strongly condemned Israeli aggression against Iran, labelling the act as a “flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran,” the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“The Israeli military strikes are a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran, and amount to total disregard of the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law”, the president said, according to a President House press release.
Expressing sympathy at the loss of lives, he urged the international community and the UN to “hold the aggressor accountable, and take immediate action to prevent the situation from further escalation.”
Condemning the attack, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman cautioned, “the start of a new war in the region could be very dangerous,” adding that the “world can not afford any wars.”
She urged world leaders to “make every possible effort to establish peace in the world.
“The effects of war are not limited to only one country; it affects us all,” she said. “The goals of developing countries are badly affected during times of war.”
Iraq says Israeli ‘aggression’ threatens international security
Iraq condemned Israel’s “military aggression” against Iran, saying that the wave of air strikes violated international law and threatened global security.
“The Government of the Republic of Iraq strongly condemns the military aggression launched by the Zionist entity against the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” it said in a statement.
“This act represents a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.”
Saudi Arabia condemns ‘blatant Israeli aggressions’ on Iran
Riyadh, once a rival of Tehran before reconciling about two years ago, condemned the wave of strikes that Israel said it launched against nuclear and military sites in Iran.
“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expresses its strong condemnation and denunciation of the blatant Israeli aggressions against the brotherly Islamic Republic of Iran, which undermine its sovereignty and security and constitute a clear violation of international laws and norms,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
 






Oman, which is mediating Iran-US nuclear talks
“Oman considers this act a dangerous, reckless escalation, representing a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, the principles of international law. Such aggressive, persistent behaviour is unacceptable and further destabilises the regional peace and security.”
“The Sultanate of Oman holds Israel responsible for this escalation and its consequences, and calls upon the international community to adopt a firm and unequivocal stance to halt this dangerous course of action.”
Qatar says Israel attack on Iran ‘hinders’ diplomatic efforts
Gaza mediator Qatar criticised a wave of Israeli strikes on Iran saying it “hinders” attempts “at de-escalation and reaching diplomatic solutions”.
Qatar “expresses its strong condemnation and denunciation of the Israeli attack,” the Gulf state’s foreign ministry said in a statement reported by the official Qatar News Agency, adding the “dangerous escalation threatens security and stability of the region and hinders efforts to de-escalate and reach diplomatic solutions”.
** Turkiye urges Israel to halt ‘aggressive actions’ after Iran strikes
Turkiye said Israel must “put an immediate end to its aggressive actions that could lead to further conflicts,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Earlier, a top Turkish official condemned Israel’s strikes on Iran, describing them as “barbaric” and unjustifiable aggression, the Associated Press (AP) said.
Omer Celik, the spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s governing party also maintained that the action was a diversion tactic, aimed at shifting attention away from international criticism of its actions in Gaza.
“There can be no legitimacy or justification for the Israeli attack. This is barbaric aggression,” Celik said on a X post.
Celik went on to accuse Israel of “hostility” toward diplomatic efforts, noting that the attack took place amid ongoing negotiations between the US and Iran.
UAE calls for ‘self-restraint and judgment’
The United Arab Emirates condemned “in the strongest terms” Israeli strikes on Iran, urging diplomacy, AP reports.
The UAE is one of only a handful of Arab countries to recognize Israel, after it signed onto the Abraham Accords in 2020. The ministry of foreign affairs for the federation of seven sheikhdoms “stressed the importance of exercising the utmost self-restraint and judgment” and urged against the conflict’s expansion.
Spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres
“The Secretary-General condemns any military escalation in the Middle East. He is particularly concerned by Israeli attacks on nuclear installations in Iran while talks between Iran and the United States on the status of Iran’s nuclear programme are underway.
“The Secretary-General asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford.”
EU top diplomat urges ‘restraint’ from all sides
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called for all sides to “exercise restraint,” extending support for “any diplomatic efforts towards de-escalation.”

“Stability in the Middle East must be the priority and we are engaging partners to de-escalate. Now is the time for restraint, calm and a return to diplomacy.”
Kremlin condemns Israel-Iran ‘escalation’
Russia condemned and expressed concern over what it called a “sharp escalation” between Israel and Iran, Russian state media reported.
“Russia is concerned and condemns the sharp escalation of tensions,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state news agencies.
The Russian embassy in Tel Aviv also urged Russians in Israel to leave the country if they could and said it “strongly recommends” against travelling there until the “situation normalises.”
India urges Israel and Iran to not escalate tensions
Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal urged both Israel and Iran “to avoid any escalatory steps,” saying India has “close and friendly” relations with the two nations, AP reported.
India, he added, urges “dialogue and diplomacy” and is “closely monitoring the evolving situation, including reports related to attacks on nuclear sites.”
He said India “stands ready to extend all possible support.”
China ‘deeply concerned’ over strikes, condemns ‘violations’ of Iran’s sovereignty
China said it was “deeply concerned” over Israeli strikes on Iran, condemning “violations” of the country’s sovereignty and offering to help ease tensions.
“The Chinese side… is deeply worried about the severe consequences that such actions might bring,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said. “The Chinese side calls on relevant parties to take actions that promote regional peace and stability and to avoid further escalation of tensions.”
German Chancellor warns Israel, Iran against ‘further escalation’
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has urged both Israel and Iran to avoid any “further escalation” in the aftermath of the attack.
Both sides should refrain from steps that could “destabilise the entire region,” said Merz, adding that he had been briefed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the raids and had convened a meeting of Germany’s security cabinet.
Merz emphasised that Berlin backed “Israel’s right to defend its existence and the security of its citizens”.
Germany had for years been expressing concerns about Iran’s “advanced nuclear weapons programme”, he said.
“Germany stands ready to use all diplomatic means at our disposal to influence the parties to the conflict. The goal must remain that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons,” Merz said.
Merz also said that authorities would step up security at Jewish and Israeli sites in Germany following the Israeli strikes.
France urges restraint from ‘all sides’
France’s foreign minister on Friday urged restraint after Israel pounded Iran in a series of air raids.
“We call on all sides to exercise restraint and avoid any escalation that could undermine regional stability,” Jean-Noel Barrot said on X.
Afghanistan warns ‘Israeli strikes on Iran stoke regional instability’
Afghanistan, condemning the Israeli strikes, said that “the attacks violated international law and fuelled regional insecurity.”
The strikes, which left key military commanders and nuclear scientists dead, “constitute a clear violation of the fundamental principles of international law, particularly national sovereignty”, Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted in a statement on X.
“The continuation of such tension-provoking actions has made the situation in the region even more fragile and worrying,” he wrote.
He said the Taliban authorities, which do not recognise Israel, called for all stakeholders to “address this issue and prevent the spread of further insecurity and instability in the region”.
Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong
“Australia is alarmed by the escalation between Israel and Iran. This risks further destabilising a region that is already volatile. We call on all parties to refrain from actions and rhetoric that will further exacerbate tensions.
“We all understand the threat of Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile program represents a threat to international peace and security, and we urge the parties to prioritise dialogue and diplomacy.”
New Zealand prime minister Christopher Luxon
“It’s a really unwelcome development in the Middle East. The risk of miscalculation is high. That region does not need any more military action, and risk associated with that.”

All 156 passengers on flight AI 379 had been escorted from the plane, in line with emergency plans, an Airports of Thailand official said.
The aircraft took off from Phuket airport bound for the Indian capital at 9:30am (7:30am PKT) on Friday, but made a wide loop around the Andaman Sea and landed back on the southern Thai island, according to flight tracker Flightradar24.

The incident follows the crash of an Air India flight in Ahmedabad on Thursday shortly after takeoff, in which more than 265 people were killed.
AOT did not provide details on the bomb threat. Air India did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Indian airlines and airports were inundated with hoax bomb threats last year, with nearly 1,000 hoax calls and messages received in the first 10 months, nearly 10 times that of 2023.
Blackbox found of crashed Air India 787; India considering grounding fleet
Investigators recovered a black box recorder from the crash site on Friday of a London-bound passenger jet that ploughed into a residential area of India’s Ahmedabad city, killing at least 265 people on board and on the ground.
The Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner had issued a mayday call shortly before it crashed around lunchtime on Thursday after lifting barely 100 metres (330 feet) from the ground.
One man on board the plane, which was carrying 242 passengers and crew, miraculously survived Thursday’s fiery crash, which left the tailpiece of the aircraft jutting out of the second floor of a hostel for medical staff from a nearby hospital.
“Initially, I too thought that I was about to die, but then I opened my eyes and realised that I was still alive,” survivor Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, a British citizen, told national broadcaster DD News from his hospital bed.
The nose and front wheel of Air India flight 171 landed on a canteen building where students were having lunch, witnesses said.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Kanan Desai said that 265 bodies had been counted so far, which suggested that at least 24 people were killed on the ground. The toll could rise further as more body parts are recovered.
“The official number of deceased will be declared only after DNA testing is completed”, Home Minister Amit Shah said in a statement late on Thursday. DNA samples will be taken from family members of the dead who live abroad, he said.
Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian on board the flight bound for London’s Gatwick airport, as well as 12 crew members.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the devastated neighbourhood on Friday and was also pictured by survivor Ramesh’s bedside.
Ramesh, who suffered burns and other injuries, said: “Everything happened in front of me, and even I couldn’t believe how I managed to come out alive from that.”
“Within a minute after takeoff, suddenly… it felt like something got stuck… I realised something had happened, and then suddenly the plane’s green and white lights turned on.”
The Indian government is also considering grounding Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet, Indian broadcaster NDTV reported earlier on Friday, a day after one of the airline’s aircraft of the same make crashed in Ahmedabad city, killing more than 240 people.
The fleet will likely be grounded for a safety review, NDTV reported, citing sources.</p><small>2025-06-13 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/131344206804c5e.jpg?r=143118' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916909/israel-just-launched-a-widescale-attack-on-iran-heres-how-we-got-to-this-point' target='_blank'><strong>Israel just launched a ‘widescale’ attack on Iran.

In a rather anticipated move, Israel on Friday launched widescale strikes on Iran, claiming that it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. In a message, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the attacks were the beginning of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz, Reuters reported. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards corps said its top commander, Hossein Salami, was killed, and state media reported the unit’s headquarters in Tehran had been hit. Six Iranian nuclear scientists were killed, Iranian state media reported.
 
 

In response, Iran launched around 100 drones towards Israeli territory, which Israel was working to intercept, according to Tel Aviv. At around 0800 GMT, Israeli media said an order to citizens to remain near protected areas had been lifted, suggesting that most or all of the drones had been neutralised.
Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US was not involved in the strikes and Tel Aviv had acted unilaterally.
The United States and other European countries had already warned of such an attack by Israel on Iran, which has once again reignited tensions in the Middle East. In fact, on Wednesday, the US withdrew diplomats from Iraq and authorised the voluntary departure of its military family members from the region.
These developments come against the backdrop of the Iran-US nuclear talks, which, as per a New York Times report, revolve around Tehran’s near-bomb-grade uranium and Washington’s goal to ensure Iran enriches no uranium at all on its soil.
Uranium enrichment is a process used to make fuel for nuclear power plants, but it can also yield material for an atomic warhead.
Negotiations or bombs
In April, the US and Iran initiated high-level nuclear talks with Oman serving as an intermediary. It was the first engagement between the two countries in nearly seven years, when President Donald Trump had pulled the US out of the 2015 nuclear agreement.
Essentially, the 2015 deal imposed restrictions on Iran’s nuclear programme, making it impossible for the country to produce a bomb, in return for the lifting of most of the US and international sanctions against it. But Trump withdrew the US from the accord with world powers in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. Tehran reacted a year later by violating the deal’s nuclear curbs.
In March 2025, after assuming the presidency for the second time, Trump said he had written a letter to Iran, pressing it to open talks on preventing the development of nuclear weapons or face possible military action. In response, Iran had pushed back against Trump’s demands regarding direct negotiations and instead left the door open to indirect discussions.
A few days later, however, Trump told reporters at the Oval Office that Washington was commencing direct talks with Iran. The announcement was made during talks with Netanyahu, who was visiting the US at the time.
The talks
The first round of US-Iran talks took place on April 12 in Muscat and was described as “constructive”. The focus of the talks was on “de-escalating regional tensions, prisoner exchanges and limited agreements to ease sanctions in exchange for controlling Iran’s nuclear programme”, Reuters had reported.
US and Iranian officials again met for the second time on April 19, this time in Rome. Speaking on state television after the talks, the Iranian foreign minister had described them as useful and conducted in a constructive atmosphere. There was no immediate comment from the US side following the talks.
The third round of talks was held in Oman again, this time including a technical-level meeting between experts from both sides. Just a day before the talks, Trump, in an interview with Time magazine, had said that he “would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped”.
 
 

The same week, Washington had also announced new sanctions targeting Iran’s oil network, a move described as “hostile” by Tehran. Separately, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had warned Iran that it would face consequences for supporting the Houthis, a Zaydi Shia military organisation active in Yemen.
Subsequently, the fourth round of talks, scheduled for May 3 in Rome, was postponed. “US sanctions on Iran during the nuclear talks are not helping the sides to resolve the nuclear dispute through diplomacy,” Reuters had quoted an Iranian official as saying. Meanwhile, Oman had stated that the talks were being rescheduled due to “logistical reasons”.
The same day, in an interview with Fox News, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said that Iran had to ‘walk away’ from uranium enrichment and long-range missile development, and it should allow American inspectors into its facilities.
“If you have the ability to enrich at 3.67 per cent, it only takes a few weeks to get to 20pc, then 60pc, and then the 80 and 90pc that you need for a weapon,” Rubio had said.
Deal or no deal?
The fourth round of US-Iran talks did end up taking place, again in Muscat on May 12. The meeting was held the same week President Trump undertook his visit to the Middle East, the Associated Press reported.
Iran called the negotiations, which ran for three hours, “difficult but useful”. On the other hand, a US official told AP: “Agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements.”
Three days later, on May 15, Trump announced that the US was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran. “We’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,” he said on his Gulf tour, according to a shared pool report by AFP.
“We’re getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this … there [are] two steps to doing this, there is a very, very nice step and there is the violent step, but I don’t want to do it the second way,” he added.
However, an Iranian source said that while Tehran was prepared to offer what it considered concessions, the “issue is that America is not willing to lift major sanctions in exchange”.
Irrespective, the fifth round of talks took place between the two countries in Rome on May 23, where “some but not conclusive progress” took place, said mediator Oman. Meanwhile, Iran said it had received “elements” of a US proposal, and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later said the text contained “ambiguities”.
A few days after the fifth round of talks, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a speech delivered on the commemoration of the death of the Islamic Republic’s founder, pledged that Tehran would not abandon its uranium enrichment — a key demand in the US proposal.
“Independence means not waiting for the green light from America and the likes of America,” he said, adding that the US proposal was “100pc against” the ideals of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Tensions rise
Henceforth began a tug of war between Iran and the US.
On June 9, the Iranian foreign ministry said it would soon present a counterproposal for a nuclear deal to the US via mediator Oman. It stated that the US proposal had failed to include Tehran’s key demand of lifting sanctions.
But despite the disagreement, President Trump earlier this week said talks would continue between the two countries. “They’re just asking for things that you can’t do. They don’t want to give up what they have to give up,” Trump told reporters at the White House, according to Reuters. “They seek enrichment. We can’t have enrichment.”
 
 

He further said that Iran was the main topic of a phone conversation he had on Monday with the Israeli PM. Netanyahu’s office said the president had told him talks with Iran would continue at the end of the week. Soon after, Oman announced that the sixth round of US-Iran talks will take place on Sunday.
But then a lot happened in just one day — June 12. Trump warned that a “massive conflict” could break out in the Middle East. “I don’t want to say imminent, but it looks like it’s something that could very well happen,” Trump said in response to a question from a reporter about an Israeli attack on Iran, AP reported.
At the same time, the US president also said that he was urging Netanyahu to hold off from taking action for the time being and later took to social media to say that the “entire Administration has been directed to negotiate with Iran”.
The same day, the International Atomic Energy Agency issued its strongest condemnation of Iran in 20 years, saying that the country had continued to enrich uranium to near weapons-grade levels and had failed to comply with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations. Following this, Iran said it had built and would activate a third nuclear enrichment facility.
Within just a few hours after the developments, Israel attacked Iranian nuclear targets, with Netanyahu saying strikes would continue for as long as it would take “to remove this threat”.

Noorpur Thal among hottest Punjab regions with mercury touching 48.5°C

Dust storms, thunder and rain are also exp­­ected in some districts of southern Pu­­njab and upper Sindh during the period.
Heatwave
Punjab is currently ex­­p­eriencing a severe heatw­a­­ve, with temperatures re­­aching a scorching 48.5°C in Noorpur Thal, making it one of the hottest regio­­ns in the province. Baha­w­alnagar, Bhakkar, Gujran­wala, and Hafizabad rec­o­rded te­­mperatures bet­w­een 47°C and 48°C, while major cities like Lahore and Fai­salabad recorded temperatures of 46°C.
Meanwhile, the Provin­cial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) also issued an alert warning of an impending weather shift from today.
The Punjab governm­ent also directed district administrations and other departments to prepare for potential weather-related disruptions.
NDMA advisory
An impact-based wea­ther advisory issued by NDMA’s National Emer­g­e­ncies Operation Centre (NEOC) has urged the public to take precautions and stay updated via the NDMA app, as extreme heat is expected to affect the rest of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Ba­­lochistan, some areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK from Friday to Wednesday (June 13-18).
A weak western wea­ther system is forecast to affect the upper regions of the country from June 13 to 16, potentially influencing weather conditions across multiple provinces. In Punjab, hot weather is expected to persist throu­ghout the week.
In Khyber Pakhtun­kh­­wa, mostly hot conditions are predicted, but scatte­red rain and windstorms are likely in several districts, including Chitral, Dir, Haripur, Karak, Ko­­h­at, Kohistan, Khyber, Ku­­rram, Mansehra, Moh­ma­­nd, Nowshera, Malakand, Charsadda, Abbottabad, Bannu, Buner, Hazara, Pe­­shawar, Swabi, Swat, Waz­iristan, and adjoining areas.
Sindh and Balochistan are forecast to remain predominantly hot and dry throughout the advisory period.
In Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK, hot weather will prevail, although areas such as Astore, Skardu, Hunza, Shigar, Bagh and Neelum Valley may receive isolated rainfall from June 13 to 16.
Published in Dawn, June 13th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-13 04:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/13092603fa27528.jpg?r=092840' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916865/lahore-high-court-restores-ombudsperson-for-workplace-harassment' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore High Court restores ombudsperson for workplace harassment</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has declared null and void the Punjab caretaker government’s decision to remove Nabila Hakim Ali Khan from her position as Ombudsperson for Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace, restoring her to office with immediate effect.
Justice Raheel Kamran issued a detailed 21-page judgement on a writ petition filed by Ms Khan, who had challenged her de-notification on Aug 4, 2023, on the grounds of lack of legal authority, procedural impropriety, and infringement of her guaranteed tenure.
The petitioner was appointed for a fixed term of four years under the amended Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace (Amendment) Act, 2022.
The judge held that no removal is permissible during the tenure except for proven misconduct or incapacity, and even then, only after due process, which was entirely absent in this case.
The judge observed that the caretaker government lacked the authority to remove the ombudsperson, terming the act outside its limited constitutional and statutory functions.
Justice Kamran noted that caretaker setups are designed to ensure electoral neutrality and cannot take policy-level or structural decisions that impact statutory bodies. He said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had directed the caretaker government to ensure removal of all politically appointed institutional heads.
However, the judge found the ECP overstepped its authority, as it had no power to direct the termination of a statutory office-holder unless there was compelling evidence that the official could influence electoral outcomes — a criterion that was not met in the petitioner’s case.
The judge also criticised the absence of any inquiry or due process in the petitioner’s removal.
He said despite objections raised later by the provincial government about the petitioner’s qualifications and prior political affiliations, no formal hearing or notice was given to her before de-notification.
“Even if an elected government intended to take any action based on such objections, it would be required to act while following the principles of natural justice, ensuring fairness and due process for the petitioner,” the judge noted.
Recognising the constitutional role of the ECP in conducting free and fair elections, Justice Kamran found that its 2023 directive — used by the caretaker government to justify the de-notification of the petitioner — did not authorise the removal of statutory office holders unless there was a demonstrated risk of election interference.

PAKISTAN’s first and comprehensive National Security Policy has assumed marked importance in the wake of skirmishes between India and Pakistan between May 6-10. I referred to the NSP in my last column, ‘Development challenges’, published in these pages on May 30, 2025. After receiving numerous inquiries, I realised that our NSP may not be general knowledge. So I figured a column was in order.
First, let’s recognise that we do, in fact, have a valid National Security Policy 2022-2026, and a very good one at that. Most countries either don’t have a national security policy or don’t make it public. Not only does Pakistan have a national security policy but it is also a largely public document, with a confidential portion.
By contrast in India, as reported by the media there in 2023, the National Security Council Secretariat has been trying to bring out a national security strategy for many years. Deliberations between the military and strategic community have attempted to build a case and content for the strategy, but it has yet to come to fruition.
After Pakistan, Japan has also produced a national security policy with some interesting similarities between the two. Our NSP was approved after thorough discussions by the highest security forum in the country — the National Security Committee (NSC), and then by the highest national government decision-making body, the federal cabinet, on Dec 28, 2021. It was launched publicly on Jan 14, 2022, with full civil and military support.

‘Security of Pakistan rests in the security of its citizens.’

Good public policies are those which are backed up by robust research and wider, inclusive consultative processes, as is the case with the NSP. It was led by our first civilian National Security Adviser Dr Moeed Yusuf, who was well-suited to his post because of his laudable credentials. A security and strategy academic, he has credible standing in the global security research community, with his wide-ranging experience and academic contributions.
“Formulating a comprehensive National Security Policy for the approval of the National Security Committee as well as ensuring its sustainability through monitoring its implementation and undertaking periodical reviews/updates in consultation with all stakeholders as required” reads the mandate of the National Security Division, according to the Rules of Business, 1973. However, the division had not fulfilled this important part of its mandate since 1973. There was some active interest in 2014, but even then a national security policy could not be developed.
Upon assuming office in December 2019, Dr Yusuf picked up the mantle. Wider national consultations were undertaken, some of which I witnessed personally; 120 working groups in almost all sectors were set up and more than 500 experts consulted.
The policy passed through civil-military scrutiny. The process eventually involved tabling the document in an in-camera briefing before the Parliamentary Committee on National Security, with the then opposition members unfortunately boycotting the proceedings. Eventually, it was approved by the NSC and the federal cabinet.
Rolling out the NSP was meant to set a “directional tone” and send a message to the world that our vision for national security is broad and seeks to identify the means of expanding economic resources so that Pakistan can simultaneously strengthen its traditional and non-traditional security. “The security of Pakistan rests in the security of its citizens,” wrote the prime minister in his message. “Realising the symbiotic relationship between economic, human and traditional security is now imperative for Pakistan’s long-term development. Domestic stability and reg­ional peace based on mutual coexistence, regional connectivity, and shared prosperity are essential prerequisites to optimising national security.”
The NSP articulates a citizen-centric comprehensive national security framework for Pakistan whose ultimate purpose is to ensure the safety, security, dignity and prosperity of Pakistanis.
Organised in eight parts, the NSP covers almost all important aspects of a comprehensive national security framework: national cohesion; economic future; defence and territorial integrity; internal security; foreign policy in a changing world; and human security. The last section on human security covers population growth and migration; health security; climate and water stress; food security and gender security. The NSP includes education in the section on “securing our economic future” as a means of producing an employable and skilled labour force in a highly competitive and technology-driven global job market.
Personally, I am not too happy with the section on health security as it is patchy in concept. It is mainly driven by the Covid pandemic and how to prepare and respond to health emergencies rather than paying serious attention to the urgent need to strengthen essential healthcare for all without discrimination, ie, universal health coverage, which is not possible without investing in primary healthcare.
The continuity of public policies across governments is a sign of system maturity. However, implementation is another challenge altogether.
Regarding the continuity of the NSP, despite providing an inbuilt annual review within the policy, we haven’t heard anything about its implementation. Even in the case of the best laws and policies, the devil resides in the space between policy and implementation.
At the moment, it seems that our NSP has been forgotten. In the backdrop of the events of last month, and with Pakistan now sending its delegations to other capitals to present its case, I wonder if the NSP was even a part of the dossiers prepared for members of the delegation.
It is never too late, however. It is time to revisit Pakistan’s National Security Policy, update it, and implement it. This would be our best case on national security to put before the world.

During the last 65 years of its operation, the IWT has served its purpose well. It includes substantive provisions that clearly fix and regulate the rights and obligations of both India and Pakistan. Since the IWT was a bargain between the two countries, at least for Pakistan, the lower riparian, modifications or changes in the treaty can only be considered if they address its concerns.
However, India had expressed its intent to have the IWT renegotiated before holding it in abeyance. As a matter of fact, Article XII of the IWT itself provides for this eventuality: “The provisions of this treaty may from time to time be modified by a duly ratified treaty concluded for that purpose between the two governments.” And, “The provisions of this treaty or provisions of this treaty as modified … shall continue in force until terminated by a duly ratified treaty concluded for that purpose between the two governments”. India, pursuant to Article XII, sent two notices to Pakistan in January 2023 and in September 2024 inviting Pakistan to begin parleys for the IWT’s modification.
 
 

Post-Pahalgam, Pakistan has invited India to open talks on all issues including the operation of the IWT, which was held in abeyance by India in April 2025. If, ultimately, the two countries agree that the treaty is liable to modification, then Pakistan will be called upon to protect its interests in any Protocol added to the IWT following the modifications agreed upon. I believe there are at least four areas where Pakistan is advised to protect its interest via the Protocol:
i. In order to make the IWT a multilateral water-sharing arrangement, China should be invited to become a party. Both China and India being upper and lower riparians in the region have many disputes inter se. It would be a strategic decision by both to enter into a formal water-sharing arrangement. Such a partnership is not altogether fanciful; its foundations have already been laid in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and related treaties. India, Pakistan and China are members of the SCO.

There are at least four areas where Pakistan is advised to protect its interests via any Protocol to the treaty.

Article 3 of the SCO Charter identifies areas of cooperation among the member states. Article 3 includes “sound environmental management, including water resources management in the region, and implementation of particular joint environmental programmes and projects”. Article 3 additionally provides for expansion of the spheres of cooperation by mutual agreement. If a multilateral arrangement is agreed to in the shape of a Protocol to the IWT, all three countries will benefit and it will help lessen tensions.
China’s case for becoming a party to any future Protocol to the IWT is supported by precedents of various major rivers in the world. For example, the Mekong is a transboundary river and all countries sharing it are parties to the 1995 Framework Agreement for sustainable development and management of the river basin. The Mekong River Commission manages the obligations under the said agreement.
Similarly, the Nile River Basin Cooperative Framework 2010 is executed by states that share the river. It also established the Nile River Basin Commission that develops the river in a cooperative manner.
In Europe, the Danube is shared by 14 countries, which have formed an international commission through a convention in 1994. Given that the Indus originates from Tibet, China, it creates a just cause to consider China becoming a party to any new arrangement under the IWT. In any case, India itself has created a locus standi for China through its own doing vide the presidential order of Aug 5, 2019.
ii. Clause 8 of Annexure D to the IWT lays down the criteria which India has to observe while designing any dam on the western rivers. Clause 9 further requires India to inform Pakistan six months before starting any construction on a dam to allow Pakistan to assess whether or not the provisions of Clause 8 have been duly followed by India. In fact, notwithstanding the provisions of Article VII (2) of the IWT, India’s decision to construct a dam (apart from the matter of its design) is taken outside the purview of the IWT regime and is based wholly on India’s arbitrary assessment of its energy needs and strategic interests.
In the above scenario, Pakistan may only object to the technical specifications under the provisions of Annex-D but cannot challenge the necessity or soundness of the decision of the upper riparian state to construct a particular dam. In order to restrain the abusive and arbitrary use of power to construct as many dams as it likes, it is necessary to provide a judicial mechanism in the shape of the International Court of Justice or Court of Arbitration, where the decision of constructing a dam itself may be challenged as unnecessary or mala fide. In this view, three years’ notice to Pakistan to protect its interests is also called upon after a political decision to construct a dam has been taken.
iii. Presently, the IWT does not contain any provision envisaging the management of climate change. The IWT in its present form relies on historical data in order to ensure that water supplies remain consistent. However, this is no longer safe on account of climate change. It is recommended that the IWT reflect the need to establish mechanisms to quantify and collect data regarding climate change, while also strengthening existing data collection. Therefore, in order to assess changes that are required as a consequence of the impact of climate change, provisions should be introduced for establishing a permanent panel of experts with representation from all parties.
iv. A provision to the effect that India should maintain minimum water flow in the eastern rivers for the lower riparian state needs to be added to the Protocol. In the context of international water law, ‘minimum flow’ refers to the least amount of water that a river needs to continue to flow to satisfy the needs of lower riparian states, including ecological needs.

During a meeting with UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, PM Shehbaz appreciated the Gulf state’s consistent efforts in promoting peace, dialogue and stability in the region.
The high-level engagement took place as part of the prime minister’s day-long official visit to Abu Dhabi, aimed at reaffirming Pakistan’s gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad’s position during its recent standoff with New Delhi.
Tensions flared following what Islamabad termed a “false flag operation” by India in the mountainous resort town of Pahalgam. In the wake of the incident, both countries carried out missile and air strikes. According to Pakistan’s military, India lost six aircraft in the exchange, including a Rafale fighter jet.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, both sides expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties and ongoing engagements at all levels. The leaders agreed to maintain close coordination and continue working together to advance shared goals of regional peace and prosperity.
The meeting underscored the deep-rooted, brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE, built on mutual trust, shared values and a history of close cooperation.
The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral, reg­i­o­nal and global issues of mutual interest, and reaffirmed their commitment to further enhancing collaboration in key areas. Prime Minister Shehbaz reiterated his earlier invitation to the UAE president to visit Pakistan.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi were also present at the meeting.
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz was warmly received at Abu Dhabi’s Al Bateen Airport by Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the UAE’s national security adviser and brother of the president. He also accompanied the prime minister to the Presidential Palace.
Secretary General of the UAE Supreme National Security Council Ali Ahmed Al Shamsi, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, and Pakistani diplomatic staff were also present at the airport to receive the prime minister.
London Tech Week
Later in the day, PM Shehbaz addressed Pakistan’s participation at London Tech Week 2025 held in Abu Dhabi, where he highlighted the country’s commitment to transitioning into a knowledge-based economy.
Speaking at the global platform, the premier said Pakistan’s dedication to digital transformation, technological innovation and youth empowerment remained unwavering.
The prime minister congratulated all stakeholders on Pakistan’s impactful presence at London Tech Week 2025.
“This positions Pakistan as a forward-looking country that is harnessing technology, innovation and youth potential to engage with the world,” he said. “Our presence at such an important platform reflects our growing digital footprint and global ambition.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz returned to Pakistan on Thursday evening after concluding his official visit to the United Arab Emirates.
PM’s notice
In a separate development, PM Shehbaz has taken notice of a more than five-fold increase in the salaries of the National Assembly speaker and Senate chairman and sought a report from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.
Sources said the prime minister’s action came in the wake of widespread public criticism over the increase in the salaries of the custodians of the two houses from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3 million a month.
The decision has drawn criticism from within the ruling PML-N, as two party stalwarts — Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Khawaja Saad Rafique — publicly criticised the move.
However, during the post-budget press conference on Wednesday, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb defended the steep hikes — some as large as 550 per cent — in the salaries of the speaker, deputy speaker, members of parliament, and ministers.

However, this breach is not limited to the industrial sector or Sindh. The situation in the services sector, where few are paid minimum wages, is more alarming. Women work for less wages than their male colleagues though they put in an equal number of hours and do the same job.
At Wednesday’s post-budget press conference, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb himself admitted that industry in particular and the private sector in general are not willing to pay minimum wages. The lame explanation was that the government had not announced increased minimum wages in the new budget. His response underlines the helplessness of the state before employers who do not give a hoot about the law.
 
 

The large-scale informality in the economy due to the lack of any credible attempt to document unregistered businesses has deepened the challenge of enforcing the minimum wage, leaving workers vulnerable to exploitation. But the main reason for non-compliance is the systematic annihilation of trade unions by the state at the behest of employers over the last four decades.
Thus it is foolish to expect toothless and corrupt provincial employees’ social security organisations to force wealthy employers to implement the minimum wage.
Enforcement of the latter across the board is also linked to implementing other labour laws and active labour unions putting pressure on delinquent employers. Overall, the lack of enforcement of laws, including those related to minimum wages, is contributing to poverty and inequality.
If the authorities can seek punitive legislation for tax compliance, they can also draft a similar bill for implementation of the minimum wages rather than ceding to employers’ diktat.

• Minister expects policy rate to come down before next year, seems hopeful about privatisation
• Finance secretary says current year’s uplift budget reduced to Rs967bn, hints at further drop
• Lawmakers concerned over tax-to-GDP ratio, revenue shortfall, taxes on solar panels, among other things
ISLAMABAD: Amid a downward revision in federal development spending, which may fall further by the end of this month, the Ministry of Finance told a parliamentary panel on Thursday that armed forces officers had been granted a special relief allowance at 50 per cent of their basic salary, while junior commissioned officers and soldiers would get 20pc allowance in the upcoming fiscal year.
Testifying before the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Secretary Finance Imdadullah Bosal highlighted relief measures proposed in the budget, saying that “special relief allowance at the rate of 50pc to officers and 20pc to JCOs/soldiers” of their basic salary had been granted. The meeting was presided over by MNA Syed Naveed Qamar.
The ministry did not disclose the financial impact and the reason for the higher allowance for officers in response to members’ questions about the financial impact of these allowances. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb promised to get back with a detailed response, besides few other things, later saying he had noted down the points raised by Omar Ayub, the leader of the opposition.
Mr Bosal disclosed that the current year’s public sector development programme had been revised to Rs967bn from Rs1.1 trillion and conceded even this amount may not be fully utilised by June 30, given the fact that Rs662bn had so far been actually spent.
At this, the members pointed out that a reduction in development expenditure would not only change the current year’s growth estimates (2.7pc of GDP) based on Rs1.1tr investment but also many other economic indicators as well.
The minister expected the central bank’s policy rate decline to single digits before the close of the current calendar year, as inflation had been a ‘fantastic story’ and both fiscal and current accounts improved significantly. He said the monetary policy committee was set to meet next week and there was a cushion to do more. He did not comment further, saying it was the State Bank of Pakistan’s domain.
The minister said Pakistan would be receiving about $1bn foreign inflows before the close of the current fiscal year through a syndicated arrangement from banks, with about $500 million guarantee from the Asian Development Bank, to be doubled next year. Therefore, the foreign exchange reserves currently at over $11bn would touch $14bn by June-end.
The minister said Pakistan would double commercial and capital market borrowing next year as credit ratings improved further, pointing out that about $500 million foreign bond maturing in September and another $1.2bn in April next year would be repaid in time.
The finance secretary said the major source of non-tax revenue – SBP profit – that stood at Rs2.6tr during the current year and projected at Rs2.4tr next year was mainly because of windfall from the higher policy rate. Normally, it remains around Rs1tr or so, he said.
Petroleum levy
He said the petroleum levy, another major source of non-tax revenue, stood at Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs77 per litre on petrol and would be increased by Rs2.5/litre carbon levy under the next year’s budget, taking its size on average to Rs80/litre on these two products.
With an additional levy on furnace oil, the PDL was targeted to generate Rs1.468tr next year from Rs1.161tr during the current year. He confirmed that the upper cap on the petroleum development levy had been removed as the government increased its rate by Rs10/litre for the power sector subsidy and another Rs8 per litre for the Quetta-Karachi (N25) highway. The government had no plan to further increase it, he added.
Mr Bosal said the BISP allocation for next year had been increased by 21pc to Rs716bn from Rs592bn, while Azad Kashmir’s grant had been jacked up by 33pc to Rs140bn next year from Rs105bn. The allocation for Gilgit-Baltistan had also been raised by 18pc to Rs80bn from Rs68bn, which was in addition to another Rs20bn wheat subsidy to the region. Likewise, another special area of tribal merged districts had also been increased by 21pc to Rs80bn from Rs66bn.
The minister acknowledged members’ concern about Rs87bn revenue projections next year from privatisation deals. He said this was an area where the government could not complete any transaction, but many corrections had been made, including certain incentives allowed by the IMF. This would not only take the PIA to the finish line but also the Roosevelt Hotel, three power distribution companies and a couple of financial sector transactions, both through strategic sale and listings on the capital market, he added.
The finance minister thanked the four provinces for delivering over Rs1tr cash surplus this year and hoped to secure another Rs1.464tr next year. Their support helped the overall fiscal deficit reach 5.6pc of GDP against the federal deficit of 6.8pc envisaged in the budget last year. With their support, the consolidated fiscal deficit was estimated at 3.9pc of GDP for next year.
The committee members expressed concerns over the tax-to-GDP ratio, revenue shortfall, taxes on solar panels, hybrid vehicles, carbon levy, petroleum levy, private sector lending and debt, SMEs, industrial and agricultural growth and targets, withholding tax (WHT) on ATMs and bank deposits, pensions, gender-specific allocations, health-specific allocations, electric vehicles, structural reforms, sales tax on cotton, public sector expenditure, defence spending, the widening current account deficit, and the negative growth rates observed in both the manufacturing and agricultural sectors.
The discussion also highlighted the challenges of climate change and the need for social protection. The members expressed serious concerns regarding the inefficiency of Customs Intelligence and smuggling at the borders.

The Israeli army said on X that its soldiers seized several suspected members of Palestinian group Hamas in a  “targeted” operation in Beit Jinn, 12 kilometres (seven and a half miles) from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.
Since the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes in Syria aimed at denying military assets to the Islamist-led interim administration. It has also deployed tro­ops across the demilitarised zone on the Syrian side of the armistice line that used to separate the opposing forces on the Golan.
Syria’s interior ministry said “these repeated provocations constitute a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic… these practises cannot lead the region to stability and will only result in further tension and turmoil”.
The Israeli military said troops carried out a  “targeted, intelligence-based nighttime operation in Syria and apprehended several Hamas terrorists”. It alleged that those seized were plotting attacks on Israeli troops.
The Syrian interior ministry said that Israeli soldiers detained seven people and fired directly at the villagers, killing one civilian.
In a statement, Syria’s foreign ministry called on the international community to  “take decisive steps to stop these recurring attacks”.
The raid comes days after the Israeli army said it  “struck a Hamas terrorist in the area of Mazraat Beit Jinn”, which neighbours Beit Jinn. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said one person was killed in the attack.

AHMEDABAD: More than 200 people were killed when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed shortly after takeoff, authorities said on Thursday, in what is said to be the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
Only one person is known to have survived, as the plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel just outside the airport at lunchtime.
The passengers included 169 Indian nationals, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian. Two pilots and 10 cabin crew were also aboard, according to AFP.

According to air traffic control at Ahmedabad Airport, Air India’s flight 171 — bound for London Gatwick airport — departed at 1:39 pm local time (0809 GMT) from runway 23. It gave a Mayday call, signalling an emergency, but thereafter there was no response from the aircraft.
Footage of the crash showed the plane taking off over a residential area and then disappearing from view, before a huge ball of fire and smoke is seen rising into the sky from beyond the houses.
Another video circulating on social media showed an aircraft rapidly losing altitude — with its nose up — before it hit a building and exploded into an orange ball of fire.
India’s CNN News-18 said the plane crashed on top of the dining area of state-run B.J. Medical College hostel, killing many medical students as well.
‘Sole survivor’
City police chief G.S. Malik told Reuters that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. Vidhi Chaudhary, another senior police officer, said they had found one survivor, who was in seat 11A.
Indian media identified the fortunate man as UK resident Ramesh Viswashkumar.
“Thirty seconds after takeoff, there was a loud noise and then the plane crashed,” the 40-year-old told the Hindustan Times.
 






“It all happened so quickly,” he told the paper from his hospital bed.
Police chief Malik said the bodies recovered could include both passengers and people killed on the ground.
“When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me,” he said.
“Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.”
He said that his brother Ajay was seated in a different row on the plane. “He was travelling with me and I cant find him anymore. Please help me find him, he said.
According to the BBC, Vishwash has a wife and child and has lived in the UK for many years. His relatives, who had gathered at the family home in Leicester, said they were awaiting more information.
Federal minister C.R. Patil said the dead included Vijay Rupani, a former chief minister of Gujarat state.
The Indian aviation minister’s office said PM Narendra Modi, whose home state is Gujarat, had told it to ensure all support was extended to the rescue efforts.
Ahmedabad Airport, which suspended all flight operations after the crash, said it was operational again but with limited flights. The airport is operated by India’s Adani Group conglomerate.
The last fatal plane crash in India, the world’s third largest aviation market and its fastest growing, was in 2020 and involved Air India Express, the airline’s low-cost arm.
Tata will provide Rs10 million ($117,000) to the families of each of the dead, cover all medical expenses of those injured and help rebuild the hostel of the medical college, chairman N. Chandrasekaran said.
First Dreamliner crash
Aviation tracking site Flightradar24 said the plane was a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, one of the most modern passenger aircraft in service.
It was the first crash for the Dreamliner, which began flying commercially in 2011, according to the Aviation Safety Network database. The plane that crashed on Thursday flew for the first time in 2013 and was delivered to Air India in January 2014, Flightradar24 said.
Investigators with the US National Transportation Safety Board will travel to assist Indian counterparts probing the brutal Air India crash, the agency announced Thursday.
“The NTSB will be leading a team of US investigators travelling to India to assist… with (the) investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India,” the agency said on X, adding that under international protocols, “all information on the investigation will be provided by the Government of India.”
 






The UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) says it has “formally offered its assistance” to the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau in India.
It adds that the UK AAIB will have expert status in the Indian investigation because UK citizens were on board the plane.
Boeing said it was aware of initial reports and was working to gather more information. Boeing shares fell 5pc as the crash posed a major setback for the planemaker as its new CEO looks to rebuild trust following a series of safety and production challenges.
Aircraft engine-maker GE Aerospace said that it would put a team together to go to India and analyse cockpit data, CNBC TV18 reported.

• Says fiscal space shrinking, provinces must share burden and invest in human development
ISLAMABAD: The federal government on Thursday proposed shifting the “regressive” population-based formula for distributing divisible pool resources under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award to criteria based on climate adaptation and other performance indicators.
Speaking at a news briefing, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the current NFC criteria were regressive as population, being the overwhelming consideration, had been made an incentive instead of a disincentive. He said the Centre would seek climate adaptation and other social sector indicators as key determinants for distributing resources with and among the provinces when the NFC meets in August this year. He went on to question the devolution planned under the 18th Amendment and the 7th NFC Award in place since 2009.
He said the devolution was incomplete as the provinces had not devolved responsibilities and resources down to the district level for such a long time despite commitments. He said the size of provincial finances had expanded, which required a district government system to be activated. He said the Centre had devolved powers to the provinces, which would have to empower local governments.
On the occasion, Chief Statistician Naeemuz Zafar defended economic growth estimates for the current year at 2.7 per cent, saying he could elaborate and defend the outcomes of the recent National Accounts Committee (NAC).
He said the objections over NAC datasets were not justified as the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics had published all the data on its website, and statistics about the growth estimates were transparent.
He said he had also noticed some objections over agricultural output, but it should be recognised that major crops only made up 18pc of the agricultural sector. The remaining 80pc comprises livestock, fisheries and forestry.
However, responding to a question, he conceded that the GDP growth rate estimates had taken into account Rs1.1 trillion public sector development investments and data pertaining to livestock was worked out based on the 2010 survey.
This indicated that, along with the industrial sector’s upsurge reported in the fourth quarter, the 2.7pc GDP growth rate would need to be revised by the September-October NAC review, as the Ministry of Finance separately put the PSDP spending at Rs967 billion instead of Rs1.1tr and indicated its further revision.
Fiscal space shrinking
The planning minister said the Centre’s fiscal space was shrinking as the development programme had contracted to 0.8pc from over 1.2pc of GDP in a few years, which was a matter of concern. He said that after transfer of provincial shares, the Centre would be left with about Rs11tr, of which over Rs8.2tr would go for debt servicing and the remaining on defence expenditure.
Therefore, the provinces must share the expenditure and invest in human development, including child stunting, as 40pc children were currently stunted, he said.
Responding to a question, the minister said India was weaponising water, which was a serious challenge for Pakistan, but warned that India would need to avoid that route or face consequences. He stressed that Pakistan was prioritising water sector projects and dams.
Mr Iqbal said the national leadership had resolved collectively to transition from crisis to stability and sustained growth under the vision of Uraan Pakistan and the 13th Five-Year Plan. “This year’s budget is not merely a financial statement. It’s a roadmap towards recovery, resilience and opportunity for all Pakistanis,” he added.
He said the government had been struggling for two years to pay for ongoing development projects. “Today, we are paying our defence expenditures and servicing debt obligations from our own resources, but very soon, we will finance our development independently,” he said.
This would be achieved through 4.5pc growth in agriculture through Rs4.2bn investments in crop productivity and livestock, modernisation and mechanisation, backed by provincial initiatives such as the Punjab Kissan Card.

The distribution of food and basic supplies in the war-ravaged Gaza Strip has become increasingly fraught and perilous, exacerbating the territory’s deep hunger crisis.
Civil defence official Mohammed al-Mughayyir told AFP that the Al-Awda Hospital received 10 dead and around 200 wounded, including women and children, “after Israeli drones dropped multiple bombs on gatherings of civilians near an aid distribution point around the Netzarim checkpoint in central Gaza”.
He said that Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital received six dead following Israeli attacks on aid queues near Netzarim and in the Al-Sudaniya area in northwestern Gaza.

GHF accuses Hamas of attacking aid workers; Palestinian group calls the foundation a ‘filthy tool’ of Israeli forces

The Israeli army said it was looking into the reports when asked for comment by AFP. Restrictions imposed on media in the Gaza Strip and the difficulties of access on the ground mean AFP is not able to independently verify the death tolls.
Mughayyir said another six people were killed in Israeli attacks across Gaza.
Aid workers
The US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) on Thursday accused Palestinian group Hamas of attacking aid workers en route to distribution centres, saying that at least eight people had been killed.
GHF had earlier given a toll of at least five killed in the attack, which took place late Wednesday in the southern Gaza Strip.
“We are still collecting more information on the deadly and unprovoked attack on our dedicated local team members and volunteers,” GHF interim executive director John Acree said in a statement.
“As of now, we can confirm at least eight fatalities, multiple injuries, and we fear that some of our team members have been taken hostage,” he added.
In an earlier statement, GHF said a bus carrying more than two dozen members of it team, “local Palestinians working side by side with the US GHF team to deliver critical aid, were brutally attacked by Hamas”.
It said the team was en route to one of the foundation’s distribution centres west of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip.
“We carefully considered closing our sites today given the heightened security risks and safety concerns, but we decided that the best response to … murderers was to keep delivering food for the people of Gaza who are counting on us,” Acree said in the group’s update.
“We will not be deterred from our mission towards providing food security for the Palestinian people in Gaza.”
An officially private effort with opaque funding and backed by Israel, GHF began operations on May 26 after Israel completely cut off supplies into Gaza for more than two months, sparking warnings of mass famine.
The United Nations and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives. GHF claimed it had distributed nearly 2.6 million meals today and more than 18.6 million to date.
Hamas accused GHF of becoming a “filthy tool” of Israeli forces. “The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has become a filthy tool in the hands of the occupying army, used to lure civilians into deadly traps,” the Hamas government media office in Gaza told AFP on Thursday.

Trump had offered to work on the Kashmir issue after he brokered a ceasefire between the two nuclear powers following their most intense military confrontation in decades. In a message lauding the countries’ leaders for achieving peace, he remarked, “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir.”
Responding to a question on the steps the US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce noted, “[Trump] has been the only one to bring certain people to the table to have conversations that nobody thought was possible,” remaining hopeful that the Kashmir issue can also get resolved.
Fielding questions after a bill-signing ceremony on Thursday, the US president said that he “stopped a war” between Pakistan and India.
“Eventually they were gonna go nuclear … and I stopped it, I called each leader … and I spoke to them and talked about trade,” Trump said. “I said, ‘You’re not trading with us if you go to war … if you’re going to start throwing nuclear weapons around.
“They were both unbelievable. They understood it exactly, they stopped. I stopped that war with phone calls and trade,” Trump added.
He further said that India is negotiating a trade deal in Washington, and a Pakistani delegation would arrive “I think next week”.
In response to another question, Trump said, “We’re going to get them together. I told them, India and Pakistan … they have a longtime rivalry over Kashmir. I told them ‘I can solve anything.’
“I will be your arbitrator. I will be your arbitrator. I can solve anything.”
 
 

Pakistan and India have been at odds since the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly denied the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before the US brokered a ceasefire on May 10.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence there. As part of its global outreach, the team visited London and will also visit Brussels.
The delegation comprises former foreign ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Subzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; along with senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.

The move was made in a notification today from the Sindh Excise, Taxation and Νarcotics Control Department.
The Associated Press of Pakistan reported that on September 16, 2024, the Sindh Excise Department had taken a significant step by making biometric verification mandatory for vehicle registrations and transfers.
Sindh Senior Minister for Information, Transport, Excise, Taxation, and Narcotics Control Sharjeel Memon had said that all new and old vehicles would be subject to biometric verification during the registration or transfer process.
He elaborated that the change would be implemented in three phases under the new policy. In the first phase, starting from July 1, biometric verification will be mandatory for the registration of new vehicles.
In the second phase, beginning on November 1, biometric verification would be required for vehicle buyers.  In the third phase, biometric verification of both the vehicle seller and buyer would be enforced.
Memon had said that the government was working to make all processes more transparent in the Excise Department and was committed to ensuring that Sindh led the way in digitising public services.
He had emphasised that biometric authentication in vehicle registration and transfers was a significant milestone in promoting transparency that would enable the accurate identification of buyers and sellers, thereby helping to protect citizens from illegal vehicle transfers and fraud.
Memon had said that vehicle owners could visit any Nadra e-Facilitation Centre or district excise office to complete the biometric verification process.</p><small>2025-06-12 17:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12212700e2411db.jpg?r=215106' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916754/pm-shehbaz-discusses-regional-peace-bilateral-ties-with-uae-leadership' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz discusses regional peace, bilateral ties with UAE leadership</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday met with the United Arab Emirates leadership to discuss regional peace and stability and explore ways to deepen bilateral ties during his official day-long visit to the emirates.
Over the last few months, UAE has expressed commitment to strengthening its long-standing partnership with Pakistan and announced a $2 billion debt rollover soon after.  In April, the two nations signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen the bonds between the people of both nations.
The premier arrived in Abu Dhabi earlier today, where he was welcomed by the UAE’s National Security Adviser, Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, The Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
During a high-level meeting with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, PM Shehbaz discussed bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest and reaffirmed commitment to further enhance cooperation in key areas, state media PTV reported.
“Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the positive trend of bilateral relations and the ongoing progress at all levels,” it added.
They agreed to maintain close communication and continue working together to advance the shared goals of regional peace and prosperity, the report said.
It added, “PM [Shehbaz] reiterated the invitation to the President of the UAE to visit Pakistan soon.”
The premier’s delegation included Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, and Special Assistant to the PM Tariq Fatemi.
In a statement posted on X, PM Shehbaz said that he was “delighted” to meet with Al-Nahyan, thanking him for the UAE’s “vital role in easing recent tensions” with India.
“We reaffirmed our shared commitment to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” he said. “Our deep-rooted ties built on trust and brotherhood, continue to grow stronger, especially in trade and investment. “I look forward to welcoming His Highness to Pakistan soon.”
 






In February, PM Shehbaz was invited by the UAE to participate in the World Governments Summit (WGS) in Dubai, where he delivered a keynote address highlighting Pakistan’s vision for inclusive economic growth, digital transformation and governance reforms.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.</p><small>2025-06-12 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608898-pakistan-uae-reaffirm-commitment-to-strengthen-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UAE reaffirm commitment to strengthen bilateral cooperation</strong></a><br><p>

Mahrang, the chief of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), along with other activists of the group was arrested on March 22 for allegedly “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after their members faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang’s sister had challenged the detention in the BHC but the court had asked the petitioner to approach the home department for her release. The sister had subsequently filed constitutional petitions in the high court challenging the detentions but those were dismissed.
Mahrang’s petition, filed in the Supreme Court (SC) through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi and lawyer Jibran Nasir, pleaded for the right to appeal against the May 22 order and requested the apex court to set aside the BHC judgment and allow the constitutional petitions.
Mahrang argued the BHC judgment was “without jurisdiction, illegal, and liable to be set aside”.
She said that the continued detention was “unjustified and disproportionate” as her name was already placed in the Fourth Schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, subjecting her to stringent restrictions on movement, liberty, and livelihood and enabling the government to maintain oversight through measures including good behaviour bonds, movement restrictions, reporting requirements and asset inquiries.
“It is submitted that further preventive detention under the MPO, in addition to these restrictions, amounts to excessive and punitive control which fails the legal tests of legality, necessity, and proportionality,” the petition said, adding that she was entitled to be released from preventive custody so she may lawfully defend herself in pending cases and seek appropriate legal remedies.
The petitioner also argued that the impugned decision by the Balochistan government was “vitiated by a manifest misapplication of law and a complete failure to adhere to statutory procedure”.
She requested to be allowed to urge further grounds in addition to the above at the hearing of this appeal.
A day earlier, her sister urged the apex court to set aside the BHC’s April 15 order that rej­ected the plea against Mahrang’s detention under the MPO.
The petition alleged that her “repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a sympathiser of militants” was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons. It apprised the court that her father and brother were “subjected to enforced disappearance in 2011 and 2017.”
The federal governm­ent through the interior ministry, home and tribal aff­airs department of Baloch­istan, prosecutor general, inspector general of police, Federal Investiga­tion Agency director general, Quetta deputy commissioner and the state have been named as res­pon­dents in the petition.
Along with the main appeal, a separate application was also filed before the Supreme Court, seeking suspension of the BHC order during the pendency of the present case.</p><small>2025-06-12 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1219581430744a4.jpg?r=200453' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916751/motorway-cop-allegedly-killed-by-wife-in-mardan-police' target='_blank'><strong>Motorway cop allegedly killed by wife in Mardan: police</strong></a><br><p>A woman on Thursday allegedly gunned down her husband, a motorway cop, in the Mian Khan area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Mardan district, according to police.
Mardan police spokesperson Faheem Khan told Dawn.com, “The suspect has been arrested and a first information report (FIR) has been registered at the Baizai police station.”
The FIR, registered under Section 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and seen by Dawn.com, states that the complainant, the slain police official’s elder brother, alleged that he was asleep in his room when gunshots were heard in the house.
“When my wife and I went inside, we found my brother’s wife with a pistol in her hand, while he was lying in a pool of blood,” the complainant alleged, adding that the victim succumbed to his injuries while being transported to a hospital in Katlang.
“There have been domestic disputes between them since they got married and they used to fight regularly,” the complainant added in the FIR.
Incidents of homicides are frequently reported in various parts of the country. According to the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), Punjab, KP, and Sindh are among the regions with a higher number of murder FIRs.
A day ago, Punjab police said they arrested a suspect in Okara for the alleged murder of his wife last month.
The FIR of the incident was registered at Okara’s Renala Khurd Saddar Police Station at the complaint of the woman’s father under Section 302 of the PPC on May 19. According to the FIR, the complainant found his daughter murdered with her throat slit when he reached his son-in-law’s home with the latter lying unconscious on the ground in an injured state as well.
Last month, a man and his two sons were shot dead in Mardan district, police and rescue officials said, adding that the five suspects had fled the scene.</p><small>2025-06-12 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12203111fe54059.jpg?r=203115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916752/harvey-weinstein-jury-resumes-deliberations-after-partial-conviction-infighting' target='_blank'><strong>Harvey Weinstein jury resumes deliberations after partial conviction, infighting</strong></a><br><p>Jurors will reconvene on Thursday in Harvey Weinsteins sex crimes retrial, a day after they handed down a partial conviction against the former movie mogul but hit an impasse on a rape count as deliberations spiralled into angry infighting.
Weinstein, once one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood, faced a retrial that began on April 23 after a state appeals court last year overturned his 2020 conviction.
He was accused by prosecutors in the case of raping an aspiring actress and assaulting two other women.
Weinstein, 73, pleaded not guilty and has denied assaulting anyone or having non-consensual sex.
The jury found Weinstein guilty on one of the three counts he faced, which stemmed from his alleged assault of former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006. The jury found Weinstein not guilty of a charge stemming from his alleged assault of Kaja Sokola in 2002 when she was a 16-year-old aspiring actress.
The jury has not yet reached a verdict on a third count, which charges him with raping aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013.
In a startling development on Wednesday, the jury foreperson told presiding Supreme Court Justice Curtis Farber that other members of the panel were shouting at him and threatening him for refusing to change his vote on the rape count.
Farber sent jurors home for the day to give them time to cool down and instructed the foreperson to arrive in court separately on Thursday.
Weinstein’s lawyers unsuccessfully moved for a mistrial, arguing that the breakdown in the jury room would taint any verdict.
Regardless of the eventual verdict on the rape charge, Weinstein faces up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced. He has separately been sentenced to 16 years in prison following a rape conviction in California.
In closing arguments on June 3, the prosecution told the 12 jurors that the evidence showed how Weinstein used his power and influence to trap and abuse women.
The defence countered that the accusers lied on the witness stand out of spite after their consensual sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer failed to result in Hollywood stardom.
A jury found Weinstein guilty in February 2020 of raping Mann and sexually assaulting Haley. Sokola’s allegation was not part of that case.
The conviction was a milestone for the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct by powerful men.
But the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, threw out that conviction in April 2024. It said the trial judge erred by letting women testify that Weinstein had assaulted them, though their accusations were not the basis of the criminal charges.
Though the conviction was thrown out, Weinstein, who has had a litany of health problems in recent years and attended the retrial in a wheelchair, has remained behind bars because of his California conviction. He is appealing that verdict.
More than 100 women, including famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of misconduct.
He co-founded the Miramax studio, whose hit movies included such Academy Award winners as “Shakespeare in Love” and “Pulp Fiction.” Weinsteins own eponymous film studio filed for bankruptcy in March 2018, five months after sexual misconduct accusations against him became widely publicised.</p><small>2025-06-12 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608873-ndma-issues-alert-for-rain-hot-weather-from-june-13-to-18' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA issues alert for rain, hot weather from June 13 to 18</strong></a><br><p>

The annual report benchmarked the current state and evolution of gender parity across four key dimensions: economic participation and opportunity, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.
In the latest report, Pakistan has been ranked below Sudan, (57pc, 147th), Chad (57.1pc, 146th), Iran (58.3pc,145th), Guinea (59.5pc, 144th), Democratic Republic of the Congo (60.1pc, 143rd), Niger (61.3pc,142nd), Algeria (61.4pc, 141st), and Mali (61.7pc, 140th).
Occupying the bottom rank of the index, Pakistan saw its overall parity score decline from last year’s edition, from 57pc to 56.7pc, the report said. Overall Pakistan has closed +2.3 of its gender gap since 2006.
However, this year’s results were a second consecutive drop from the economy’s best score of 57.7pc, achieved in 2023. Pakistan’s parity in economic participation and opportunity has declined by 1.3 percentage points, the report said.
While economic representation indicators have remained unchanged, income disparity in Pakistan has slightly increased since the last edition (0.02 points), as has perceived wage inequality (4 percentage points).
The sole sub-index advance registered by Pakistan in this year’s edition was “Educational Attainment”, bumping educational parity upwards by 1.5 percentage points to reach 85.1pc.
The shift was partly driven by an increase in female literacy rates (from 46.5pc to 48.5pc). However, parity has also risen because male enrolment shares have dropped in tertiary education, increasing the relative balance between men and women but lowering educational reach overall.
The report said Pakistan’s economy had seen political parity drop from 12.2pc in 2024 to 11pc in 2025.
While parity in parliament increased by 1.2 percentage points, women’s ministerial representation dropped from 5.9pc in 2024 to zero in 2025 and with it the overall sub-index score, the report added.
Pakistan was listed among countries including Azerbaijan, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, and Vanuatu that have all-male ministerial cabinets.
Commenting on the 2025 edition of the report, Managing Director of the World Economic Forum, Saadia Zahidi, said the report “arrives at a decisive moment, with the world in flux as technological breakthroughs, geopolitical conflict and economic uncertainty are creating unprecedented challenges as well as bringing new opportunities.
“Amid such change, gender parity is both a principle and a strategy,’’ she said, adding that “economies that tap into the full spectrum of their talent and human capital are best positioned to navigate an era of transformation and accelerate productivity and prosperity.”
Zahidi said most economies were not fully leveraging this pathway for growth.
 






The report found that there was still a combined global average gender gap of over 30pc across four areas: economic participation and opportunity, political empowerment, educational attainment and health and survival, she added.
The global gender gap score in 2025 for all 148 economies included in this edition of the index stands at 68.8pc. The global gender gap closed by 0.3 percentage points in 2025, from 68.4pc in 2024 to 68.8pct in 2025.
Based on the collective speed of progress of those 100 economies, it will take 123 years to reach full parity globally, the report said.
The 2025 Global Gender Gap Index shows that no economy has yet achieved full gender parity. Iceland (92.6pc) continues to lead the Global Gender Gap Index, holding the top position for 16 consecutive years, and remains the only economy to have closed more than 90pc of its gender gap since 2022.
Each of the top 10 ranked economies have closed at least 80pc of their gender gaps, the only economies to do so. Globally, gender parity has increased by 4.8 percentage points since 2006.</p><small>2025-06-12 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608861-pakistan-world-leaders-react-with-grief-to-air-india-crash-in-ahmedabad' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, world leaders react to Air India crash in Ahmedabad</strong></a><br><p>

As part of the Global March to Gaza, thousands of activists planned to travel to Egypt’s Rafah border crossing with the Palestinian territory on Friday to demand the entry of humanitarian aid.
On Thursday, the march’s spokesperson Saif Abukeshek told AFP: “Over 200 participants were detained at Cairo airport or questioned at hotels across Cairo.” He added that those detained included nationals from the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Morocco, and Algeria.
Abukeshek said that plainclothes police entered hotels in Cairo on Wednesday with lists of names, questioned activists and in some cases confiscated mobile phones and searched personal belongings.
“After interrogations, some were arrested and others were released,” he added.
 
 

At Cairo airport, some detainees were held for long hours without explanation, Abukeshek said, adding that others were deported, without specifying exact numbers.
Twenty French activists who had planned to join the march were held at Cairo airport “for 18 hours”, he said. “What happened was completely unexpected,” Abukeshek said.
Footage shared with AFP showed dozens of people with their luggage crammed inside a holding room at the airport.
“We’re locked up here in this room with so many people — some 30-40 people,” a German national said in one video. “I called the embassy and they told me their people are trying to figure things out,” she said.
The Greek contingent said in a statement that dozens of Greek nationals were among those held at Cairo airport “despite having all legal travel documents, having broken no law and followed every legal procedure in entering the country”.
Cairo’s security chief did not respond to an AFP request for comment.
Pressure
After 21 months of conflict, Israel is facing mounting international pressure to allow more aid into Gaza, which the United Nations has dubbed “the hungriest place on Earth”.
 
 

Another convoy dubbed Soumoud, or steadfastness in Arabic, left the Tunisian capital on Monday, hoping to pass through divided Libya and Egypt — which organisers say has yet to provide passage permits — to reach Gaza.
The Global March to Gaza, which is coordinating with Soumoud, said around 4,000 participants from more than 40 countries would take part in the event, with many having already arrived ahead of the Friday march.
According to the plan, participants are set to travel by bus to the city of El-Arish in the heavily securitised Sinai Peninsula before walking 50 kilometres (30 miles) towards the border with Gaza.
They would then camp there before returning to Cairo on June 19.
Israel has called on Egyptian authorities “to prevent the arrival of jihadist protesters at the Egypt-Israel border”.
Such actions “would endanger the safety of (Israeli) soldiers and will not be allowed”, Defence Minister Israel Katz said.
In response, Egypt’s foreign ministry said that while it backs efforts to put “pressure on Israel”, any foreign delegations visiting the border area must receive approval through official channels.
“We will continue despite what happened because the current numbers in Egypt and those expected to arrive are enough to organise this march,” Abukeshek said.</p><small>2025-06-12 13:29</small></div><hr>
