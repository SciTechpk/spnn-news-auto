Dar said this while addressing the extraordinary session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers in Saudi Arabia.
His statement follows a joint statement by the OIC, which initiated its 22nd extraordinary session in Jeddah on Saturday. The moot has been convened against the backdrop of Israel recognising Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, with Soma­liland’s president, Abdira­hman Mohamed Abdul­lahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
Later, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”.
Dar expressed Pakistan’s “unwavering support for the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia” in his address today.
“We strongly condemn the illegal and unlawful recognition by Israel of the Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia and the subsequent unwarranted and highly provocative visit of its foreign minister to Somaliland,” he said.
He added that Pakistan also voiced its firm support for Somalia and condemned Israel’s actions during the UN Security Council’s briefing on the issue.
“We identify this development as a direct assault on Somalia’s internationally recognised borders, which constitutes a flagrant violation of international law,” Dar said.
“The principle of state sovereignty and territorial integrity constitutes a peremptory norm of international law from which no deviation or derogation is permitted.”
Dar called the internationally-recognised borders of Somalia “sacrosanct and inviolable” and said that the Somaliland region remained an “integral, inseparable and inalienable part of Somalia”.
“No external actor has either the legal standing or the moral authority to alter that fundamental reality,” he said. “Any act, statement or recognition thereof by a state or an external entity regarding any part of the Federal Republic of Somalia should therefore be considered null and void, producing no political or legal effects.”
He added, “We believe that such recognition of an integral part of a sovereign state is not a diplomatic act, but an act of political aggression that sets a perilous precedent, threatening peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea region, and beyond.”
The foreign minister added that Pakistan joined the group of OIC countries in “unequivocally rejecting the unlawful Israeli move” through the joint statement released in the immediate aftermath of the supposed Israeli recognition of ‘Somaliland’.
The joint statement termed the recognition of ‘parts of states’ a violation of the cardinal principles of international law and the UN Charter and noted the Israeli action’s potential “serious repercussions” for the Horn of Africa region, the Red Sea region and for international security as a whole, he said.
“The OIC and the wider international community’s firm rejection of this unlawful overture by Israel is, therefore, vital so that the impudent Israeli act does not set a precedent for other countries,” Dar added.
He said that the developments in the region were “particularly alarming at a time when Somalia is demonstrating encouraging and tangible progress on its political and institutional trajectory”, pointing out that the Federal Republic of Somalia had made notable strides in national reconciliation, constitutional reform and the revitalisation of state institutions.
“Positive trends in the financial sector, particularly the efforts related to economic legislation and the move towards an inclusive one-person-one-vote election, represent important steps towards consolidating Somalian democracy and stability,” he added.
“These gains reflect a Somali-owned and Somali-led path towards political reconciliation and cooperation,” he said.
“This positive momentum must be protected and reinforced, not sabotaged and undermined by actions that risk fragmenting the country and reversing hard-earned progress across the entire milieu of national indicators.”
In addition, he said that Pakistan also recognised the sacrifices and resilience of the Somali people and its security forces in thwarting the consistent threat posed by Al-Shabab and its affiliates.
“Israel’s brazen recklessness undermines regional and international efforts aimed at combating terrorism in a region beset with this challenge.
“It also opens the door to the creation of fragile environments susceptible to infiltration and exploitation by extremist groups, thereby negatively impacting regional and global security,” the foreign minister said, adding that in this context, continued support for Somalia’s security and stabilisation efforts remained “indispensable”.
“At this pivotal juncture, when Somalia is focused on defeating extremism, any action that deflects attention, weakens cohesion or fuels division is profoundly irresponsible,” Dar said.
He said that Pakistan fully aligned itself with the OIC’s call “for all states and organisations to refrain from any form of formal, semi-formal, or informal engagement with the authorities of Somaliland”, and to ensure that any engagement strictly respected the sovereignty and unity of Somalia.
“Pakistan categorically rejects any proposal or plan aimed at the forced displacement of Palestinians and linkages of Somaliland region of Federal Republic of Somalia with any such illegal action,” he added.
“Any action that advocates or implies the displacement or relocation of Palestinians not only violates international law but also undermines the prospect of a just and lasting peace in the region.”
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s steadfast support for the Palestinian people in their legitimate struggle for self-determination, saying that the only path to lasting peace and stability lay in the realisation of an “independent, contiguous and sovereign” state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders and with Al-Quds Al Sharif as its capital.
Dar added that as a “frontline supporter” of the UNSCR 2803 and the “Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict”, Pakistan reiterated the intention to contribute to its successful implementation thereof, with a view to ensuring the sustainability of the ceasefire, bringing an end to the conflict in Gaza, to secure a “dignified life” for the Palestinian people who had endured prolonged humanitarian suffering, and leading to a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.
“As a non-permanent member of the UNSC, Pakistan will continue to work with the OIC and Arab partners to mobilise global support for the Palestinian right to self-determination, justice and peace,” he said.
On the topic of India-occupied Kashmir, the foreign minister said that the unresolved dispute remained the “primary source of conflict in South Asia and a nuclear flash point”.
He stressed the urgent need for renewed and concerted efforts under the UN auspices to secure a “just, lasting, and peaceful resolution of the dispute“, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
Dar also appreciated the “strong, unwavering and consistent support that the OIC has always afforded to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters”. Nevertheless, he urged the OIC to step up its efforts to support a just resolution of the dispute.
Dar called upon the OIC and the broader international community to “speak with one voice” and firmly reject all actions that undermined Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
“This meeting today is a resounding manifestation of our collective solidarity with Somalia against a blatant transgression of its sovereignty by a decidedly un-conscientious actor,” he said.
“On our part, Pakistan remains resolutely committed to standing with the government and people of Somalia as the country continues its advances towards continued peace and progress.”

The sources said wedding guests were staying at the house, and the deceased included the bride, groom and mother of the groom.
The injured had been taken to Pak­is­tan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) Hospital, the sources further stated, adding that four nearby houses were also damaged in the blast.
A statement issued by the Senate Secretariat said that Senate Chairman Yusuf Raza Gilani had expressed grief over the incident that took place “during a wedding”.
He expressed sorrow over the loss of lives and extended condolences to the families of the deceased.
“This is a heart-wrenching incident that turned celebrations into mourning for a family,” the statement quoted him as saying, adding that he expressed concern over gas cylinder explosions.
“Such incidents demand that relevant departments fulfil their responsibilities seriously and ensure safety measures,” he said, stressing the need for an effective strategy to curb the unsafe use of gas cylinders. In this connection, he called for ensuring compliance with laws and educating the public about safety measures.

Illustration by Abro

The sentiment that ‘revolution was just around the corner’ serves as a poignant distillation of the 1960s ‘counterculture’ zeitgeist. It was a unique historical moment, where global currents of youthful middle-class dissent converged to create a sense of inevitability that the old order was about to collapse.
There is a distinct sense of melancholy attached to this sentiment today, stemming from the fact that the revolution never actually materialised. The capitalist structures and political hierarchies that drew the fire of youthful protestors proved resilient.
The survival of the status quo was largely due to the durability of the modern state. When pushed hard, governments effectively reinforced their ‘law and order’ platforms, a strategy that successfully appealed to a more cautious general public. They prioritised stability over radical change, allowing the state to reassert control.
Capitalism demonstrated a remarkable capacity to co-opt the rebellion. Instead of being dismantled by the ‘rebellion’, the market absorbed it, rapidly transforming the potent symbols of revolution into mass-produced commodities. This allowed individuals to buy the aesthetic of a revolutionary without ever actually threatening the financial institutions that issued them loans and credit.
However, despite the political failures of the era’s uprisings, they did usher in some social shifts. As noted by the American sociologist Todd Gitlin, while the movements of the 1960s failed to topple governments, a “cultural revolution” effectively took root, fundamentally altering how society perceives authority, gender roles, racial dynamics and environmental stewardship.

From the counterculture of the 1960s to today’s ‘Gen Z revolutions’, mass uprisings have repeatedly failed to dismantle power because the modern state has learned how to absorb dissent, co-opt its language and rebrand itself without changing its core

But it is also true that the state gained a sophisticated understanding of how to manage dissent energised by middle-class youth. In the decades that followed, governments learned to neutralise modern, youth-led uprisings by absorbing their energy.
According to the American political scientist Christian Davenport, the evolution of state power since the 1970s has seen a sophisticated shift toward the “professionalisation of state survival”, moving away from blunt, reactive force in favour of nuanced containment. Modern states now prioritise strategies of co-optation and absorption, expertly identifying the leaders and aesthetic language of youth movements to bring them into the fold.
One way of doing this is by inviting activists into ‘advisory’ committees. This aids the state to effectively dissipate radical energy through institutionalisation. The state then allows for symbolic concessions, such as the resignation of a single unpopular official. This satisfies the activists’ immediate hunger for change but without threatening the underlying power structure. The most recent example in this regard is Bangladesh.



This management of dissent extends into the digital realm as well. The initial advantage held by youth activists in this area has been increasingly eclipsed by state-directed information management. And anyway, the digital landscape often gets flooded with a clutter of noises, so much so that a movement’s core message becomes diluted or misunderstood by the wider public.

 

Most post-1970s movements have taken on a bourgeoisie character. Therefore, the state strategically exploits the socio-economic stakes that the activists have in the existing system. Dissent has become the specialised vocation of the bourgeoisie. This is why it fails to achieve the critical mass necessary for systemic change. This is why, in most cases now, the state often treats dissent as a pressure valve to be managed.
The 1974 ‘Carnation Revolution’ against a fascist regime in Portugal is remembered as a popular uprising. It really wasn’t. According to the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, it was a ‘top-down’ transition initiated by the military. It was a coup d’etat. By leading the change from within, the rebel officers ensured that the transition remained institutional and controlled, effectively neutralising the more revolutionary working class elements.
This pattern, what Harvard University political scientist Tarek Masoud calls “decapitation without dismantling”, defines the subsequent ‘revolutions’ of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In these instances, high-visibility, youth-led middle class protests succeeded in removing unpopular leaders, yet the underlying state machinery and power structures remained largely untouched.
These uprisings functioned as pressure valves. Examples include 2003’s ‘Rose Revolution’ in Georgia, 2004’s ‘Orange Revolution’ in Ukraine, 2011’s ‘Arab Spring’ (2011), 2022’s ‘Sri Lankan Aragalaya’ and last year’s uprisings in Bangladesh, Nepal and Madagascar. The newest trend in this regard are the so-called ‘Gen Z Revolutions.’
These cases prove that, unless an uprising targets the entire administrative and economic infrastructure, the state will simply rebrand itself while maintaining the old power dynamics. Targeting the entire infrastructure hasn’t happened since the revolutions in France (1789), Russia (1917), China (1949), Cuba (1958), Nicaragua (1979) and Iran (1979).

 

The American historian Crane Brinton established a rigorous “fever chart” for true revolutions, requiring a progression from the collapse of the old regime to a “Thermidor”, or the consolidation of an entirely new order. In contrast, most modern uprisings fail to reach this final stage. Learning from the upheavals of the 1960s, the state no longer tries to simply crush dissent. It manages it. By allowing an unpopular figurehead to be removed, the state provides a psychological victory to the protesters.
Uprisings in this regard are better described as pressure valves than revolutions. When the media labels these events as ‘revolutions’, it misses the fact that the underlying power structure is often stronger the day after the uprising than it was the day before.
Pakistan is an excellent example of this. The power structure actually grew stronger after the May 9, 2023 uprising staged by the supporters of the now jailed populist Imran Khan. Such events function as pressure valves because they provide an outlet for the energy of middle-class youth. But this energy fails to crystallise into an actual revolution.
The so-called ‘Gen Z Revolutions’ will also eventually be absorbed back into the systems they ‘fought’. The old machinery will re-assert itself, often rebranding the same power under the new, popular language of the ‘revolution’.
Nevertheless, while the term ‘pressure valve’ might suggest a failure to achieve total victory, this mechanism is arguably more vital to the long term health of a nation than a ‘Thermidorian’ revolution. The true danger of a systemic overthrow is the almost inevitable descent into a reign of terror or a vacuum of power that invites civil war, economic collapse, and permanent instability. Therefore, the preservation of certain deep-rooted instruments of the state are necessary for the survival of the nation.
By allowing pressure valves, these instruments allow for a change without destroying the hardware of the state. A society can move towards reform more effectively through incremental institutional change than through a total rupture that risks leaving the society in a state of permanent chaos.
Published in Dawn, EOS, January 11th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-11 06:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/69630b479d96a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966332/living-in-interesting-times' target='_blank'><strong>Living in interesting times</strong></a><br><p>SINCE the so-called rules-based order is crumbling in whatever flawed form it existed, those with power are asserting themselves in the most unbridled of ways, with the only restraining factor being power itself or its quantum at the disposal of one player or the other.
The phenomenon is not limited to the big powers’ actions on the global stage but is mirrored by developments in the region and even within countries, with domestic politics being shaped by the ‘might is right’ principle, if it can be called a principle. The resultant scenario is scary to say the least.
This must be the reason that some of the ‘rattled’ middle-ranking economic-military powers are now forging alliances and concluding pacts so that their collective strength or power enables them to better negotiate the challenges and come out relatively unscathed from the reshaping of the world that seem underway. Let me get into the specifics.
The US-backed Israeli attack started against the around two million Palestinians in the tiny and largely defenceless Gaza Strip ostensibly triggered by the October 2023 Hamas attack. It has continued, despite the murder of thousands of civilians including children, in the face of worldwide demonstrations and calls for an immediate ceasefire by international institutions such as the UN. (In fact, the US sanctioned International Criminal Court judges and its prosecutor examining war crimes charges against Israeli leaders.)

Against the international backdrop, Pakistani foreign policy has so far delivered well.

But the October Hamas attack was only an excuse, as before the brutal Gaza bombing campaign was over, Israel also attacked Lebanon, annexed more of the Syrian Golan Heights and not just attacked Iran itself but also sucked in the US to bomb Iranian nuclear sites (by this time Donald Trump had moved into the White House).

 

This was the beginning of the reshaping of the Middle East, the move towards the realisation of the ‘Greater Israel’ dream. Those still defiant and seen as obstacles were attacked too like the Houthis in Yemen; allies were encouraged to increase their influence and footprint in non-Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen from sites overlooking the Red Sea water routes in the southwest to the northeast of the country.
The fighting in Sudan and the Israeli recognition of Somaliland across the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa are aimed at the same strategic objective: to have oversight of shipping routes south of the Suez Canal whether for transport of oil or other essential supplies.
But in the power game, even states with smaller militaries can apply economic levers effectively to be heard. And this assumes greater significance in the ‘transactional’ Trump era. So when the Israelis attacked targets on Qatari soil, it was seen as an overreach by even those countries in the region which restricted their reaction to lodging verbal protests during the Gaza genocide.
It also brought home the truth that American bases and troops on their soil were not there for their protection but served US interests and were there to project US power. This led to a flurry of activity and saw a defence pact inked between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Now a Bloomberg report suggests, citing unnamed sources, that Turkiye may join the pact too.
Of late, Saudi Arabia has reasserted its power and re-established itself as the main backer of forces in the non-Houthi parts of Yemen, bombing and evicting the South Transitional Council from areas the latter had taken over from the Saudi-backed Yemeni government in Sanaa after rebelling from the governing coalition.
Zooming out of the region, we can see the US reviving the Monroe Doctrine (Trump has rechristened it the ‘Donroe doctrine’) and applying it to Venezuela, after kidnapping its president and his spouse on the flimsiest of charges, some of which were amended between their snatching in Caracas and their indictment a day later in New York City.
Trump says the US will “run Venezuela” now, having left the regime in place, after an apparent deal with interim president Delcy Rodríguez and will sell their oil to who he likes but the country itself cannot sell oil, for example, to China, Cuba and Russia.
Donald Trump is also making similar noises about ‘hitting’ other South American countries, such as Colombia and Mexico, whose leaders do not conform to his (far) right-wing worldview. He also keeps repeating his desire to take over Greenland one way or another. Given the collapse of the rules-based order and US military might, who knows what he does next.
No different is the use of military power by Russia to make inroads into Ukrainian territory. Ukraine is a country that gave up its nuclear arsenal after the collapse of the Soviet Union primarily on account of US security guarantees.

 

Now under Trump, the US is telling Ukraine to pretty much forget about its lost territory and do a peace deal with Russia. It has nearly halted all military aid to Ukraine and also told Nato states in Europe that they must step up their defence spending dramatically because the leader of the so-called Free World is done underwriting their defence.
Against this backdrop, one must say, Pakistani foreign policy has so far delivered well with the three major world military powers the US, China and Russia seemingly onside, along with the well-resourced Gulf states. With Pakistan responding robustly and effectively to an Indian attempt to project power in South Asia by missile attacks on Pakistani soil without legal justification in May last year, Islamabad’s stock has risen in the world.
With the rules-based order becoming more of an irrelevance, Pakistan too appears to be taking inspiration from how domestic dissent particularly over Gaza has been handled in the US and Europe. Perhaps, Pakistan feels that when established democracies can get away with it, why shouldn’t a hybrid government? The answer is some distance away. The old order may be crumbling but what will rise from its ashes is still to take concrete shape.

Once again, it involves India, which has been intent on throwing its weight around. This time, though, it is getting a taste of its own medicine.
Less than a month before the Twenty20 World Cup is set to be played in India and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh have cited security reservations over travelling to India. The Bangladesh Cricket Board is, instead, in a discussion with the International Cricket Council about playing its matches in Sri Lanka.

 

Its concerns have been triggered on account of worsening Dhaka-New Delhi ties and the recent events related to its fast bowler Mustafizur Rehman.
Mustafizur had been signed by the Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders, only for the Board of Control for Cricket in India to ask the team to release him due to “recent developments”. The move sparked a furore in Dhaka, which banned the broadcast of the IPL in the country and asked the ICC to shift its World Cup matches from India.
Its argument is that when India cannot ensure Mustafizur’s safety, the only Bangladeshi played snapped up in the IPL auction, how can it guarantee the security of the entire team.
The World Cup, beginning on Feb 7, is set for geopolitical strains again after Pakistan-India tensions eased with an arrangement which sees both teams play their matches at neutral venues during tournaments held in either country.
Pakistan will play their World Cup games in Sri Lanka, just like India played their Champions Trophy matches in the UAE last year. India has cited security concerns for not sending its team to Pakistan. Now, it has to address Bangladesh’s similar concerns.
It is imperative for the ICC, led by former Indian cricket supremo Jay Shah, to make an impartial decision instead of forcing Bangladesh to play in India.

“Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social. “The USA stands ready to help!!!”
The president later repeated the message in other posts as well while US media reported that Washington was mulling potential strikes against Iran.
Iran has witnessed waves of protests since late December, triggered largely by a sharp decline in the value of the Iranian rial and worsening economic conditions. The demonstrations began on Dec 28 near Tehran’s Grand Bazaar and later spread to several other cities.
On Friday, Trump said Iran was “in big trouble” as unrest grew, adding that the United States was “watching very closely” and warning Iranian authorities against using lethal force against protesters.
Iranian officials have accused the United States and Israel of fomenting the unrest, warning that security forces and the judiciary “will show no tolerance whatsoever toward saboteurs“.
On Saturday, Trump also reposted comments by US Senator Lindsey Graham on his Truth Social platform. In the post on X, the South Carolina lawmaker warned Tehran that its actions against protesters would not go unanswered.
Trump also reposted a Fox News report claiming that a protester had climbed the Iranian embassy in London on Saturday, torn down the current regime’s flag and hoisted a pre-revolutionary symbol.
Meanwhile, US media reports suggested the Trump administration was weighing tougher options. The Wall Street Journal reported that the Trump administration had held initial discussions on potential strikes against Iran.
The New York Post separately reported that Washington may carry out preliminary strikes on selected targets, though it did not specify when or which targets could be involved.
Separately, a retired US Navy officer urged the administration to expand support for Iranian protesters in cyberspace. Vice Admiral Robert Harward, a former deputy commander of US Central Command, called on Washington to establish new State Department initiatives to help Iranians gain access to secure virtual private networks (VPNs).
“Approximately 86 per cent of Iranians use VPNs to bypass government restrictions and online surveillance,” Harward wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News, arguing that expanded access to secure VPNs during internet disruptions would allow protesters to organise and communicate “more safely.”
Harward also urged the administration to draw up a target list of Iranian government entities involved in repressing free speech and violating human rights, including military command-and-control centres, cyber police headquarters and morality police facilities.</p><small>2026-01-11 05:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1108292351e8d19.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966345/kp-cm-afridi-to-hold-rally-at-mazar-i-quaid-in-karachi-after-pti-alleges-police-raided-bagh-i-jinnah' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi to hold rally at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi after PTI alleges police raided Bagh-i-Jinnah</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi is determined to hold a public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi on Sunday after PTI alleged Sindh police raided Bagh-i-Jinnah — the earlier planned venue for the rally — on Saturday night and subjected party workers to violence.
Meanwhile, Afridi also claimed that his and his team’s routes were blocked while they were returning from Hyderabad to Karachi.
The KP CM is on a three-day visit to Sindh, which began with his arrival in Karachi on Friday afternoon. He visited Hyderabad yesterday, and the PTI plans to conclude his visit with a public gathering in Karachi.
The visit is part of the PTI’s street mobilisation movement.
PTI alleges police raid at Bagh-i-Jinnah, changes rally venue
The PTI said in a post on its X account at around 8am on Sunday that the party’s public gathering would be held at Mazar-i-Quaid at 2pm.
The party initially planned to hold the rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah, and the PPP-led Sindh government had even issued a no-objection certificate for it despite objections from the PML-N.
But the PTI blamed the Sindh administration of “wasting their time” and announced that the public meeting would now be held in front of the Quaid’s mausoleum.
In a late night development, PTI spokesperson Fauzia Siddiqui posted on X that the Sindh government wasted their time as the deputy commissioner East had issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) on Saturday evening at 6:30pm.
“The public power witnessed in Karachi yesterday has frightened them; they don’t understand what to do now. The people of Karachi will be at the Mazar-i-Quaid public gate at 2pm with our guest, chief minister of KP, Sohail Afridi. We will hold a public meeting at the VIP gate at 2pm,” she stated.
But Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar warned of strict action if any public meeting was held on the road. “No one is allowed to challenge the writ of the government,” he said in a statement.
Later, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh posted on X that the rally would be held at Bagh-i-Jinnah, but the venue again seems to have been changed, going by the PTI’s latest post.







Siddiqui, as well as Sheikh, also alleged in posts on X that authorities had raided Bagh-i-Jinnah, violated PTI workers to violence and arrested several party workers.
Siddiqui said in one of her posts at around 4:30am that containers had been parked around Jinnah Ground and police personnel were present at the site in large numbers.







In another post, she alleged police had “attacked” Bagh-i-Jinnah, arrested several PTI workers and their belongings had been confiscated.







Similarly, Sheikh said in a post on X at around 2:30am that “this fascism against peaceful workers was unfortunate. The PPP and Sindh government, which harp about democracy, should feel ashamed“.







In other posts, he decried the “police raid at Bagh-i-Jinnah” and claimed PTI workers had been subjected to violence.







KP CM claims routes blocked
Earlier, KP CM claimed in a post on X that “upon my return from Hyderabad, all routes for me and my entire team have been blocked. For the past four hours, I’ve been switching between different routes. At 4:23am, we’ve now set off toward Karachi on a deserted road“.
“The Sindh government is not only playing with my life but also with the lives of my team,” he said, warning that the precedent of the treatment being meted out to the CM of one province in other provinces would “prove highly detrimental in the near future”.
“Pakistan belongs to all of us. Do not spread so much hatred here to such an extent that it becomes impossible to return from that point. Fake democratic forces are not leaving any stone unturned in this. This is extremely shameful,” he said.







Later, in a video message shared on PTI’s X account, the CM said: “We reached Karachi around 7:15pm […] We will definitely hold a rally today. It took us seven and a half hours to reach Karachi from Hyderabad.
“They had blocked the route at different places and we were compelled to travel on a deserted route. This was tantamount to putting my and my team’s lives at risk, as anything could have happened there.”
He urged Karachiites to come out for the rally today, adding that “they (the Sindh government) are afraid of the rally, but it will be held”.

We do know that, on Saturday, the Iranian army issued a statement saying it would safeguard strategic infrastructure and public property, while urging Iranians to “thwart the enemy’s plots”. Clearly, things have reached a point where the protests are being seen as a national security threat.
Inflammatory rhetoric from American leaders, including the US president, has not helped and, indeed, may have put Iranians in greater jeopardy by fanning paranoia.

 

There have been concerning reports of state buildings being set on fire, and both protesters and security forces being killed in clashes. Educational institutions have reportedly been closed in the worst-affected areas.
The current situation represents a dramatic escalation from about two weeks ago, when the protests had begun in response to soaring inflation. The agitation gradually turned political, with the protesters calling for the leadership to step down, expressing dissatisfaction in violent ways.
It bears remembering that Iran has been subjected to crippling sanctions for decades, most recently over its nuclear programme. Yet, despite facing extreme adversity, the Iranian leadership and, indeed, its people, have clung to their sense of national pride and refused to let others dictate terms to them.

 

It seems that the war with Israel last year left the country weakened. How this challenge is navigated will be a test for the Iranian people.
There is, of course, much for Pakistan to be concerned about, given that Iran is an adjacent neighbour and also a ‘brotherly’ nation. The uprising there cannot simply be considered an internal matter. Given the actors involved and the global forces seeking an opening, Pakistan must remain wary of how things unfold, as it will want to avoid any situation that brings another global conflict to its doorstep.
That said, this remains a matter for the Iranian people to resolve. The ruling class must identify and accept its mistakes, and move to address them decisively and transparently. It must win back the trust of those protesting or accommodate their demands to avoid a further meltdown. Meanwhile, the Iranian people must remain wary of those exploiting their divisions while posing as friends. Ultimately, a nation must decide what is best for it by itself.

TAXILA: The Taxila Museum has one of the most sacred relics of Buddhism, the relics of Lord Buddha, on display, making it the only museum in Pakistan to hold such a rare object connected to the Gandhara age.
After the authorities showcased them in 2022, hundreds of followers of Buddhism, especially monks and religious scholars, have visited the museum to witness the bone relics and offer religious rituals before them.
These were the same objects twice sent to Sri Lanka for public exhibition in the past. During the first tour, then Sri Lankan president Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, along with members of the Buddhist clergy and other dignitaries, inaugurated the exposition in Colombo.
Punjab Department of Archaeology Director Mohammad Iqbal Manj is credited with the plan to display these items. Since the inauguration of the Taxila Museum in 1928, the holy Buddhist relics had been kept in secret chambers to prevent their theft, he told Dawn.

The artefacts had been kept hidden to prevent theft, but are being showcased under strict security

For their display, the Thai government recently gifted a gold-plated, bulletproof showcase equipped with multilayer security protocols and then-Thailand envoy Chakkrid Krachaiwon formally inaugurated the showcase.
Senior Thai monk Most Venerable Arayawangso, along with his disciples, also visited Pakistan and the museum for these relics.
Speaking about their importance, Mr Manj said only a few “original” Buddha relics exist in the world. He said the department was cautious about their safety and security, especially in view of the mysterious theft of 81 rare antiquities in 1999.
Dr Abdul Ghafour Lone, a senior official of the Federal Department of Archaeology, Islamabad, who also conducted successful excavations, particularly at the Buddhist site of Jinan Wali Dehri, told Dawn that these relics were discovered by Sir John Marshall during the excavation of the Dharmarajika Stupa in Taxila between 1912 and 1916.
The relics were found in a small golden casket wrapped with inscriptions in the ancient Kharosthi script of Gandhara. It was inscribed on the silver wrapping foils around the Buddha relics that Urusaka of Noacha placed the bone relics of Lord Buddha in his chapel at Dharmarajika.
He said that the stupa is considered one of the eight largest Buddhist stupas in South Asia, built by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BC.
“The stupa, along with the large monastic complex that later developed around it, forms part of the Ruins of Taxila, which were inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1980,” Mr Lone added.
Abdul Nasir Khan, former curator of the Taxila Museum, said that these bone relics hold immense importance for followers of Buddhism. He said that Buddhists thronged the venues where these relics were exhibited in Sri Lankan cities of Gampaha, Kurunegala, Kalutara, Hambantota, Monaragala, Ampara, Badulla, Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura.
Curator of the Taxila Museum, Humera Naz, told Dawn that this valuable record was dated to the year 136 (78 AD). She said the inscription confirmed that the relics belong to the Buddha.
“This inscription records that on the 15th day of Ashadha, in the 136th year of Azes, the sacred relics of Buddha were enshrined by the venerable Sion, a Bactrian inhabitant of Noacha.”
She said that the display of these holy relics has not only boosted religious tourism but has also helped promote the country’s soft image. She added that since their display, the museum has witnessed visits by Most Venerable Arayawangso, who offered the religious rituals of Kathina — a Buddhist festival — for the first time in Pakistan’s history.
This was followed by visits from chief monks and monks from South Korea, Sri Lanka and other Buddhist countries, as well as scholars from across the globe.

KARACHI: Banks received 30 per cent fewer US dollars from exchange companies in the first half of the current fiscal year, according to official data.
Exchange companies sold about $1.4 billion to banks during July-December FY26, compared with around $2bn in the corresponding period of FY25, reflecting a decline of nearly 30pc.
Exchange companies are required to sell surplus foreign currency in the banking market. However, they are also allowed to sell dollars to individuals for specific purposes.
“The customers bought about $1.2bn in six months from exchange companies, kept $400m in bank accounts and the remaining $800m is not traceable,” said Malik Bostan, Chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
The untraceable $800m is believed to have been used for purchasing virtual currencies. Trading in virtual currencies remains unregulated in Pakistan, though the State Bank is working on a framework to regulate cryptocurrency transactions.
The government has expressed support for cryptocurrency trading and is willing to legalise it with the assistance of the State Bank. Selling dollars to the general public is not straightforward, as exchange companies typically issue cheques for encashment through banks or directly transfer dollars into buyers’ bank accounts instead of providing cash.
Data show that currency sales to banks have been on a declining trend from June to December 2025. The highest inflow was recorded in June, when banks received $408m.
At the start of FY26, sales stood at $279m in July, falling sharply to $163m in August. They recovered to $187m in September, rose to $243m in October, dipped slightly to $238m in November and increased again to $271m in December.
Despite rising remittance inflows this year, dollar sales by exchange companies to banks have declined.
“Special apps available on websites are attracting dollars from Pakistan. The current US dollar rate offered by these apps is around Rs292, which is highly attractive for dollar holders,” Mr Bostan said, adding that these platforms guide holders either to sell at these rates or invest in cryptocurrencies.
Exchange rate outlook
“The latest liquidity profile of the SBP shows aggregate short positions of less than $2bn, broadly in line with the IMF’s target, and suggests that reserve accumulation has not been driven by buy-sell swaps but by mopping up excess liquidity from the interbank market,” said Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark.
The current trajectory implies a potential breach of the Rs280 to a US dollar; however, with the real effective exchange rate at 104.8, competitiveness already appears stretched. In this context, the central bank should resist a decisive break below Rs280, preferring stability over signalling strength, particularly as import demand gradually recovers and longer-dated external pressures remain unresolved, he said.
“For now, the dollar-rupee parity is likely to remain range-bound, with two-way movement increasingly coming into play,” he added.

ISLAMABAD: At a time when the federal government is grappling with its own fiscal shortfall, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has raised concerns that revenue transfer shortfalls from the centre during the first half of 2025-26 have jeopardised the province’s ability to meet its annual budget surplus target, as agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The provincial government further warned that the delayed and reduced federal transfers are exerting significant pressure on its finances, particularly impa­cting the delivery of essential services in the merged districts of the former Federally Admini­stered Tribal Areas (Fata).
The issue was formally raised in a two-page letter from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Adviser on Finance to the Chief Minister, Muzammil Aslam, to Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb. The letter followed weeks after newly appointed Chief Minister Sohail Afridi publicly accused the federal government of withholding the province’s rightful share from the divisible pool.
The provincial government said that the budgeted surplus of Rs157 billion for the current fiscal year was based on the assumption that federal transfers would be released in full and on schedule. Any delay or shortfall in these transfers, the letter warned, directly undermines the province’s ability to uphold fiscal discipline and achieve its agreed surplus target.
The scale of the problem was most visible in the merged districts.
The KP government allocated Rs292bn for the merged districts in 2025-26, including Rs143bn for current expenditures, Rs50bn under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP), Rs40bn for the Annual Development Programme (ADP), Rs43bn as the province’s estimated 3 per cent share of the NFC award, and Rs17bn for temporarily displaced persons (TDPs).
However, actual federal releases during the first half of FY26 amounted to just Rs56bn, only 19pc of the total allocation. Provincial officials have warned that this shortfall has significantly constrained development activity and severely disrupted essential public service delivery in some of the country’s most historically neglected regions.
According to Mr Muzammil, despite limited federal support, the provincial government has continued to sustain development through its own resources. The province released Rs26.4bn under the AIP, even though it received no federal funding under this head.
Similarly, against federal releases of just Rs9.8bn, the KP government provided Rs16.4bn from its own budget to maintain development momentum, despite growing fiscal imbalances. For current expenditures in the merged districts, provincial spending has reached Rs63bn, while federal transfers stood at only Rs46bn, leaving a funding gap of Rs17bn.

 

The concerns now extend beyond the merged districts, as shortfalls in federal transfers continue to undermine KP’s fiscal stability. Releases under straight transfers have fallen sharply below target, only Rs19bn has been received so far against the annual allocation of Rs115bn, representing just 17pc of the total.
Moreover, shortfalls in divisible pool tax transfers have further strained the province’s finances. KP’s share in federal tax assignments for the first half of FY26 was projected at Rs643bn, including the 1pc share for the war-on-terror. However, actual receipts amounted to only Rs567bn — resulting in a shortfall of Rs76bn.
The shortfall is also pronounced in Net Hydel Profit (NHP) payments. Against a budgeted amount of Rs106bn for FY26, the federal government has released only Rs18bn during the first half, just 17pc of the expected disbursement.
These mounting revenue pressures have coincided with unavoidable spending obligations. The KP government incurred Rs28bn on flood response and rehabilitation efforts, along with an additional Rs7bn on support for TDPs. Officials warn that these unplanned expenditures have further squeezed the province’s already limited fiscal space.
The KP government has cautioned that if federal releases continue at the current pace, achieving the budgeted surplus of Rs157bn will become increasingly complex. It has called for urgent corrective measures, stressing the need for timely and predictable federal transfers in line with budgeted assumptions to stabilise provincial finances and protect public service delivery, the letter added.

Netanyahu has said Israel should not be reliant on foreign military aid but has stopped short of declaring a firm timeline for when Israel would be fully independent from Washington.
“I want to taper off the military within the next 10 years,” Netanyahu told said. Asked if that meant a tapering “down to zero”, he said: “Yes.”
Netanyahu said he told President Donald Trump during a recent visit that Israel “very deeply” appreciates “the military aid that America has given us over the years, but here too we’ve come of age and we’ve developed incredible capacities.”
In December, Netanyahu said Israel would spend $110bn on developing an independent arms industry to reduce dependency on other countries. The US and Israeli governments had signed a memorandum of understanding for the 10 years through September 2028 that provides $38bn in military aid, $33bn in grants to buy military equipment and $5bn for missile defence systems.

Netanyahu says Israel has developed ‘incredible capacities’ and has come of age militarily

Israeli defence exports rose 13 per cent last year, with major contracts signed for Israeli defence technology including its advanced multi-layered aerial defence systems.
US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Israel supporter and close ally of Trump, said on X, “We need not wait ten years” to begin scaling back military aid to Israel.







“The billions in taxpayer dollars that would be saved by expediting the termination of military aid to Israel will and should be plowed back into the US military,” Graham said. “I will be presenting a proposal to Israel and the Trump administration to dramatically expedite the timetable.”

The severe cold has reduced gas supply in several areas, causing serious difficulties for residents trying to keep their homes warm. The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) has been implementing loadshedding in Quetta and surrounding areas from midnight to 5am.
People in Kalat, Mastung, Ziarat, Pishin and several other areas are also facing similar gas shortages amid the ongoing cold spell.
However, residents say many localities in the provincial capital and its outskirts are not receiving gas properly even outside these hours. “We are getting gas for a very limited time without any timetable,” Mehmood Khan, a resident of the Sariab area, told Dawn, adding that the situation worsened after winter rain and snowfall on the mountains surrounding the Quetta valley.
Several localities in the main city area are also facing low or no gas supply from SSGC as temperatures plunged to between minus five and minus seven degrees Celsius. “We have no option but to purchase gas cylinders to keep our houses warm and for cooking,” Mansoor Ahmed, a resident of the posh Samungli Housing Scheme, said.
Amid the worsening situation, residents of the Sariab area, who have been facing the most severe gas shortages, staged a protest against low gas pressure and prolonged supply suspensions. Protesters burned tyres and erected barricades, blocking the road and bringing all types of traffic to a complete halt.
The protest came during an intense cold spell, with citizens facing severe hardship due to reduced gas pressure. The temperature in Quetta dropped to minus three degrees Celsius, while in Kalat it plunged to minus eight degrees Celsius.
Over the past several days of extreme cold, people in Quetta and surrounding areas — particularly the elderly, women and children — have been suffering because of gas shortages and outages.
Protesters said they had repeatedly informed SSGC officials about the low gas pressure, but no action was taken. In response, residents blocked the main Sabzal Road by burning tyres and placing obstacles, demanding the immediate restoration of adequate gas supply.
They said gas pressure in Killi Ferozabad and adjoining areas had dropped significantly, compounding their difficulties during the harsh winter.

According to a statement issued on Saturday, the apex court reiterated that institutional integrity, discipline, and strict adherence to prescribed procedures were non-negotiable, particularly in matters relating to official conduct and the administration of justice.
In disciplinary proceedings concluded under the Supreme Court Establishment Service Rules, 2015, Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi imposed ma­­jor penalties on three offi­cers of the SC’s Karachi registry.
The penalties were im­­posed for serious lapses in administrative respo­nse, including delayed reporting, failure to seek timely written directions, and delays in reconstructing judicial records from available digital copies, resulting in institutional concern.
Disciplinary proceedings were also concluded against an officer of the SC Lahore registry, following a complaint re­­po­rted through the anti-corruption hotline.
A major penalty was imposed on account of transparency-related issues.
“The Supreme Court underscores that while welfare and career progression of the members of staff is a priority, nevertheless transparency and compliance with established procedures are indispensable to the credibility of judicial institutions,” the statement read.

In a statement, the representative body of healthcare professionals said the “unannounced and aggressive entry of FBR teams into private healthcare facilities — particularly across Punjab — has reached an intolerable level of harassment”.
Such measures threaten the very fabric of healthcare delivery in the country, said PMA Secretary General Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro in a statement. “The PMA highlights that recent raids, which forced the immediate suspension of Outpatient Department (OPD) services, are not merely administrative issues; they constitute a direct interference in patient management and a violation of the sanctity of life-saving institutions,” according to the statement.
It said the presence of enforcement officials in clinics “creates an atmosphere of fear, causes psychological distress to patients, and disrupts surgical teams”.

Association claims such measures threaten fabric of healthcare delivery

“Tax collection must never come at the cost of human life. Doctors are not ‘traders,’ and hospitals are not ‘retail outlets’. The private sector serves over 70pc of Pakistan’s population. Treating healthcare providers as commercial vendors is a gross misinterpretation of a noble profession,” he stated.
“While we respect the rule of law, audits should be conducted through documented, professional channels not through ‘commando-style’ raids that victimise healers. This targeted victimisation discourages professional excellence and pushes our brightest medical minds to seek opportunities abroad,” it claimed.
The PMA said the doctors were ready to comply with taxation, provided there was accountability for how that money would be spent. “We demand that the tax collected from the sweat and toil of healers not be squandered on the luxurious lifestyles of the ruling elite,” he stated.
It called upon the PM and the finance minister to take immediate notice. “We demand an immediate cessation of these aggressive tactics,” Dr Shoro stated.
He warned that if the FBR does not immediately halt the ‘harassment’, the PMA will be forced to take the final, definitive step of a nationwide suspension of services. “The responsibility for any resulting healthcare crisis will rest solely on the shoulders of the FBR and the relevant authorities,” he added.
In December 2025, the FBR deployed Inland Revenue Service (IRS) officers to the premises of commercial hospitals and clinics, marking a shift toward on-site monitoring. The initiative gained momentum in the wake of the poor tax compliance of doctors in the tax year 2025.
Official figures compiled by the FBR show that a large share of Pakistan’s medical profession remains outside the tax net, while a minimal number of those on the tax rolls declared extremely low annual incomes in their tax returns.
Of the 319,572 registered doctors nationwide, only 130,243 are registered on the income tax rolls, representing 40.75 per cent of the total. Even within this already narrow base, just 56,267 doctors filed income tax returns.

The statement came after Trump repeated that Washington was “going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not”. European capitals have been scrambling to come up with a coordinated response after the White House said this week that Trump wanted to buy Greenland and refused to rule out military action.
“We don’t want to be Ame­ricans, we don’t want to be Danish, we want to be Gre­en­landers,” the leaders of five parties in Greenland’s parliament said in a joint statement.
“The future of Greenland must be decided by Greenlanders.”

US president asserts Russia or China may occupy Greenland if America doesn’t

They said no other country could meddle in this. “We must decide our country’s future ourselves — without pressure to make a hasty decision, without procrastination, and without interference from other countries,” they underscored.
Julius Nielsen, a 48-year-old fisherman in the capital Nuuk, said: “American? No! We were a colony for so many years. We’re not ready to be a colony again, to be colonised”.
A Danish colony until 1953, Greenland gained home rule 26 years later and is contemplating eventually loosening its ties with Denmark. Many Greenlanders remain cautious about making this a reality.
“I really like the idea of us being independent, but I think we should wait. Not for now. Not today,” Pitsi Mari, who works in telecoms, said.
“I feel like the United States’ interference disrupts all relationships and trust” between Denmark and Greenland, said Inaluk Pedersen, a 21-year-old shop assistant.
The coalition currently in power is not in favour of a hasty independence.
The only opposition party, Naleraq, which won 24.5pc of the vote in the 2025 legislative elections, wants to cut ties as quickly as possible but it is also a signatory of the joint declaration. “It’s time for us to start preparing for the independence we have fought for over so many years,” said MP Juno Berthelsen in a social media post.
According to a poll published on Saturday by Danish agency Ritzau, more than 38pc of Danes think the US will launch an invasion of Greenland under the Trump administration.
Denmark and other European allies have voiced shock at Trump’s threats on Greenland, a strategic island between North America and the Arctic where the US has had a military base since World War II.
‘Crucial for US security’
Trump says controlling the island is crucial for US national security given the rising military activity of Russia and China in the Arctic.
“We’re not going to have Russia or China occupy Greenland. That’s what they’re going to do if we don’t.
So we’re going to be doing something with Greenland, either the nice way or the more difficult way,” the US president said.
Both Russia and China have increased military activity in the region in recent years, but neither has laid any claim to the vast icy island.
Greenland has also attracted international attention in recent years for its vast natural resources including rare earth minerals and estimates that it could possess huge oil and gas reserves.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an invasion of Greenland would end “everything”, meaning the transatlantic Nato defence pact and the post-World War II security structure.

LAHORE: The Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) has appealed to the people to take to the streets on Feb 8 to oppose “fascism, restore the Constitution, and safeguard the country’s sovereignty”.
“Those playing with the Constitution of Pakistan are a security risk,” TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai said while speaking to journalists at the Lahore Press Club on Saturday.
Mr Achakzai invited people from all walks of life to join the movement for the restoration of the Constitution and to take to the streets on Feb 8, marking the second anniversary of the February 2023 elections. “If we do not come out on the roads to stop fascism, restore the Constitution and the country’s sovereignty on Feb 8, we will all be responsible for Pakistan’s downfall,” he warned.
Flanked by TTAP Vice Chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, Haqooq-i-Khalq Party chief Ammar Ali Jan and Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Mr Achakzai said powerful quarters had blocked the natural process of leadership development through suppression, leading to internal crises. Unlike other countries, he said, courts had even snatched a political party’s election symbol.
Referring to PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, the TTAP chief said the former PM had tried to follow the constitutional path but was sidelined and punished with a 10-year forced exile.
Expressing hope that history would forgive him, Mr Achakzai said he had conveyed to Mr Sharif and would also speak to incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan that the next democratic government should honour judges who did not surrender to pressure and instead resigned from their positions, by conferring upon them the title of “Heroes of Democracy”. He said such judges should eventually be restored all the privileges they had given up in their struggle to uphold the Constitution, judiciary and courts.
Responding to a question, Mr Achakzai said Pakistan could approach the United Nations to convene a round-table conference involving Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and China to discuss issues and find solutions. “No country alone can find and implement solutions,” he added.
Allama Nasir Abbas said the “powerful” were blocking all avenues for reform and denying people their right to protest. “If the powerful block all ways to bring reforms, the people will rise to dismantle the oppressive system,” he warned. He said the martial laws imposed by Gen Ziaul Haq, Gen Pervez Musharraf and the current “undeclared martial law” were responsible for abrogating the Constitution.
Calling on people to join the movement, he said the TTAP had been launched to restore the Constitution and empower citizens to claim their due rights.
Ammar Ali Jan formally announced his party’s decision to join the TTAP movement for the restoration of the Constitution and democracy. He lamented that parliament had been rendered dysfunctional, the judiciary weakened and the media shackled. He said the country’s GDP was stagnant, more than 40 per cent of the population lived below the poverty line, educated and skilled youth were leaving the country, while a few companies were earning billions of dollars in profits.
He said the people of Pakistan had the right to decide who should represent and rule them, rather than having state institutions decide the fate of the country and its citizens. “Those who work within their defined responsibilities will earn respect and honour from the people,” he said, adding that those who crossed their limits would face resistance and chaos.
Former senator Khokhar said people’s lives had been ruined by the suppression of opposition. “When you push the opposition against the wall, people themselves rise and assume the role of opposition,” he said, citing the example of Azad Kashmir, where an elected government was deposed.
Later, a TTAP delegation, led by Mr Achakzai and Allama Nasir Abbas, visited Minar-i-Pakistan and spoke to journalists. Local authorities allowed the delegation to enter the historic site but barred its workers and supporters who chanted slogans against the Punjab government.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Achakzai called on the people to take to the streets on Feb 8 to stand against oppression and fascism and restore true democracy, as envisaged in the Lahore Resolution. He said anyone who suspends or alters the Constitution is liable to punishment under Article 6.
Allama Nasir Abbas said the delegation had come to Minar-i-Pakistan to send a message that the country belongs to its people, and that everyone must come forward to save it from the clutches of oppressors. He asserted that the fascists would ultimately be defeated by the people of Pakistan.
Mustafa Nawaz Khokar said the Punjab government had effectively turned Iqbal Park into a “no-go area” for the public on weekends, noting that the Pakistan Day Resolution was passed at the park.
The TTAP leaders also chanted slogans like “Hum zulm mitanay niklay hein, aao hmaray saath chalo”.
The TTAP delegation also met people on city streets in the night and urged them to join the movement, close shops and observe a wheel-jam on Feb 8. They also distributed pamphlets prepared by the PTI Punjab across city streets, roads and at people’s residences.
The delegation also visited Mazar-i-Iqbal and Bibi Pakdaman to pay homage.

PESHAWAR: At least 12 terrorists were killed in multiple counterterrorism operations and gun battles in different parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday, while violence elsewhere in the province left two Counter-Terrorism Dep­artment (CTD) personnel martyred in targeted attacks and claimed the life of a senior JUI-F leader who succumbed to injuries from a bomb blast a day earlier in South Waziristan.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said security forces carried out two intelligence-based operations on Thursday after receiving information about the presence of terrorists.
It said the first operation was conducted in North Waziristan, where troops engaged a terrorists’ location and gunned down six of them in an exchange of fire. The second operation, conducted jointly by police and security forces in Kurram district, resulted in the killing of five terrorists, the statement said.
ISPR said weapons and ammunition were recovered from the dead terrorists, whom it described as “Indian-sponsored khwarij”. It said the terrorists had been involved in attacks on security forces and law enforcement agencies, as well as the targeted killing of civilians.
The military’s media wing said sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate any remaining terrorists in the areas, adding that counterterrorism operations under the “Azm-i-Istehkam” vision would continue.
Separately, one terrorist was killed, another injured and two were arrested during an exchange of gunfire in the Malagori area of Khyber district, sources told Dawn on Saturday. Residents alerted security forces after spotting a group moving towards the hilly locality of Murad Dhand near the Khunarri dam, the sources added.
The sources said security forces, aided by local armed volunteers, engaged the terrorists, while gunship helicopters and artillery were also called to pound the terrorists’ position.
A video circulating after the clash showed two blindfolded suspects in custody amid a crowd of residents, while an army official urged local volunteers not to shelter terrorists.
Local sources said it was the first such clash in Malagori, where Chinese engineers and workers are stationed for maintenance work at the Warsak Dam and the construction of an irrigation canal from the dam to Peshawar.
CTD officials martyred
Meanwhile, a CTD official was martyred by unidentified motorcyclists in the jurisdiction of the Regi police station in Peshawar on Saturday, police said. Police spokesperson Alam Khan said the official, identified as Sanaullah, was targeted in the Regi area and a search operation was launched.
Another CTD official was martyred in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil on Saturday evening after unknown gunmen opened fire on him.
Police and residents said the attack took place in Mena Bazaar, about 25 kilometres from Khar, the district headquarters. War Mamund SHO Aslam Khan said the official, identified as Saifur Rehman, 40, died while being shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Khar.
JUI-F leader dies of wounds
Separately, a senior Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) leader and district president of Wafaqul Madaris Al-Arabia, Maulana Sultan Muhammad Wazir, died on Saturday after sustaining injuries in a bomb blast near a madrassa in Wana bazaar a day earlier. Police said an explosive device went off near a religious seminary in the Konra Cheena area of Wana in Lower South Waziristan, leaving Mr Wazir critically wounded. He was shifted towards Dera Ismail Khan for treatment but died on the way, officials said.
Lower South Waziristan DPO Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir said investigations were underway.
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman con­demned the attack, saying it was not only an assault on an individual but on “a moderate, peaceful and democratic ideology”.
He said the repeated targeting of religious scholars in South Waziristan was alarming and required urgent attention from the state. Party leaders reiterated their commitment to peaceful political struggle, religious harmony, democratic values and constitutional supremacy.
In a separate incident in Upper South Waziristan, peace committee chief Qadeem Khan sustained minor injuries when an improvised explosive device targeted his vehicle in the Barwand area of Serwekai tehsil, police said.
DPO Arshad Khan said the vehicle was damaged in the blast and the injured was shifted to a local hospital, where he was reported to be out of danger. Police cordoned off the area, collected evidence and launched a search for the attackers.

The committee will visit Peshawar and, in coordination with public representatives, review the progress of these schemes.
According to the PM Office Media Wing, the premier met political representatives from KP and assured them about timely completion of ongoing Centre-funded development projects in the province.
He stated that the federal government was fully aware of the problems faced by the people of KP and taking tangible steps, within its jurisdiction, to ensure sustainable solutions to those issues. A detailed discussion was also held on the overall political situation in the province and the challenges faced by the public. Matters related to public welfare, development projects and governance were discussed as well.
‘Lack of governance’
The participants informed the prime minister that the provincial government had completely failed due to a lack of governance.
They said the provincial government had no clear policy regarding health, education, infrastructure or public welfare and was paying little attention to resolving public issues.
The PM urged public representatives to prioritise the resolution of public problems, adding that he had recently distributed laptops, on merit, among male and female students across KP in Haripur.

The KP CM reached Hyderabad earlier today for a day-long trip to mobilise the public for a nationwide street movement.
Speaking at a ‘meet the press’ event, Afridi complained that KP was being meted out “stepmotherly treatment” by institutions that were supposed to strengthen democracy in the country and claimed that the PTI government was “toppled as a result of a London plan”.
Afridi said a 15-point agenda was presented before Pakistan and “everyone agreed” that a military operation was not the solution to any problem. “The actual problem is that decisions are always taken in closed rooms,” he said.
Afridi further added that if a military operation were launched in KP, the provincial government would be obliged to stand with its people. “I have asked my administration to facilitate all those people, whether they leave voluntarily or are forcibly expelled,” he said.

The provincial chief executive further said KP was not being given its rights by the federal government, which had stolen PTI’s mandate. “It is a fake federal government that is ruling after a regime-change plan,” he remarked.
“I am the first CM elected from the merged districts in KP, and these tribal areas have remained deprived of their rights for the last 78 years,” he complained, adding that whenever sacrifices are discussed, tribal people’s contributions are cited as examples.
He said that when his name as provincial chief executive was announced, a spokesperson of an institution rejected it.
The KP CM lamented that other chief ministers travel in Pakistan Air Force jets frequently, both within and outside Pakistan. “We often saw that even breakfasts were brought through these jets,” he added.
Afridi recalled that the federal government had committed funds for the TDPs in the area, but these funds were not provided. He said the KP government had provided Rs7.5 billion out of its own resources.
“I have often mentioned that the merged districts are denied their share in the NFC’s divisible pool. The NFC is meant to be disbursed among four provinces, but it is technically shared among only 3.5 or 3.75 provinces, which is a constitutional violation,” he said.
Afridi further said that erstwhile FATA areas “were not included in the NFC” and noted that these districts were not financially integrated into KP. He also claimed that KP’s share in the NFC exceeds Rs1,300 billion.
“Rs100 billion had been promised but was not provided; it now stands at Rs300 billion, based on a ratio of 3 per cent of the divisible pool,” he said, adding that only Rs132 billion had been given, while the liability stood at Rs 568 billion.

Regarding claims of lawlessness in his province, he said the KP government lacks writ in areas “falling under cantonments”.
Afridi added that the people of his province were satisfied with the KP government despite “oppression and attempts to eliminate the PTI”. “People not only voted for PTI but also protected it,” he added.
He emphasised that “nationalist interests” are supreme, however, if Imran Khan seeks an independent judiciary and free media, this should not be interpreted as “stubbornness” on his part, as only real democracy can strengthen Pakistan.
After arriving in the city, Afridi addressed PTI supporters and workers at Khurshid Chowk and in other areas of the city.
CM Afridi arrived in Karachi yesterday on a four-day visit to garner momentum in the lead up to the planned February 8 protests, which would mark two years since the general elections that the opposition claims were rigged.







Sindh govt grants NOC for PTI’s Mazar-i-Quaid rally
The Sindh government issued a formal no-objection certificate (NOC) to the PTI for their rally on Sunday at Bagh-i-Jinnah, adjacent to the Mazar-i-Quaid, said Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.
“The PTI leadership was informed in advance about permission for legal and constitutional activities,” he said.
“There are some procedures for issuing a NOC which would take time to implement, but the Sindh government fulfilled its promise.”
Memon added that the PTI is free to pursue political activities in Sindh, but noted that they would need to abide by the terms and conditions outlined in the NOC.
“The Sindh government allows all political parties to carry out activities within the ambit of the law,” he stated.
Arrival in Jamshoro
Earlier today, CM Afridi was welcomed by Sindh United Party (SUP) President Syed Zain Shah upon his arrival at the G.M. Syed Edifice.







Addressing the welcome event, CM Afridi said the politics of President Asif Ali Zardari has “ended” the politics of PPP’s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his daughter Benazir Bhutto.
“Now, there is Zardari’s control over Sindh,” he said.
Afridi was responding to SUP’s Shah, who had mentioned the KP CM’s remarks from Friday, in which he praised the PPP for “keeping the democratic traditions” of Bhutto and Benazir alive. He said Shah had misconstrued his remarks about PPP’s rule in Sindh.
The chief minister slammed the PPP, which he said was once the “flag-bearer of the Constitution”, for changing the basic fabric of the Constitution through the 26th and 27th Amendments.
“Whenever Imran Khan issues a call for a street movement, we hope that you will support us,” Afridi said.
“The name is Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi. Remember it,” he said, taking a jibe at those who were “scared” of his name. He further quipped that “every chowk is D-chowk” when supporters raised slogans of Islamabad’s renowned D-Chowk.



CM Afridi stressed that PTI founder Imran Khan’s struggle was for the “supremacy of the Constitution and the law, true democracy, rule of law, free media and the restoration of an independent judiciary”.
“God willing, we will not sit calmly unless we fulfil this heartfelt desire of Imran Khan,” he vowed.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said Sindh had been deprived of its resources and added that “powerful quarters” have usurped provinces‘ resources.
He said Sindh has the first right to use its gas over any other part of the country, adding that no one could snatch the province’s water.
Raja pointed out that the PTI supported Sindh’s stance on the six canals issue. He maintained that PTI was not there for “politics of power” and therefore, it would not strike a deal.

In his speech, the SUP president came down hard on the PPP, accusing it of selling Sindh’s resources in lieu of power.
Shah said that for the last 79 years, either “military rule or puppet civilian rulers have ruled the country”. He said a “fake government” was installed not only in the 2024 elections but in 2022 as well, when Imran was ousted.
He demanded fresh and transparent elections and the release of all political prisoners, including Imran and Yasmin Rashid.
In a post on Facebook, the SUP demanded the release of “all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, Ali Wazir, Mahrang Baloch, and Moro [incident’s] prisoners“.



At around 2pm, the PTI shared a video, saying CM Afridi and his convoy had reached Jamshoro. Another video showed him raising slogans of “Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi”.
Hours earlier, the PTI’s KP chapter stated on X that the SUP was ready to welcome Afridi, with a stage set.







PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh told reporters that Jamshoro district’s Kotri city was also among the party caravan’s stops.
In a post earlier in the day, the PTI shared a video of PTI Hyderabad Youth Wing’s “enthusiastic” members chanting slogans as they stood prepared to welcome the KP CM at the Hyderabad Insaf House.







In a post on X, the PTI detailed the KP CM’s itinerary for his trip to Hyderabad, where he is set to address the local press club, attend the Insaf Students Federation’s convention and participate in “street movement activities”.
The party agenda also listed an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) in Hyderabad, though the lawyers’ body claimed it had never granted permission for Afridi to visit or address the bar.
The bar association’s general secretary had invited the KP CM in a letter dated Jan 7. However, in a press release issued on Jan 8, the HCBA clarified that its executive committee had rejected the application by a clear majority. It said the general secretary issued the letter in his personal capacity and used the bar’s letterhead without consent.
Departure from Karachi
“[We] have departed from Karachi for Hyderabad,” announced Sheikh shortly after 12pm.
“God willing, Hyderabad will also come out on the streets massively like Karachi,” Sheikh said, hailing the massive public response received by CM Afridi in the metropolis a day earlier.







Speaking to the media before departing, CM Afridi said, “We were extremely happy with the way we were welcomed in different districts of Karachi and the passion and spirit we saw in the public. We thank everyone.”
Referring to his planned public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi on Sunday, the chief minister said the people of Karachi had “another big responsibility”.
“We have to make this jalsa successful under all circumstances and send a message to the world that Karachi was Imran Khan’s, is Imran Khan’s, and, God willing, will remain Imran Khan’s,” he stressed.







“Toward Hyderabad for street movement [sic],” said KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi on X, sharing a picture with CM Afridi, Sheikh and Raja.







Sheikh also shared a video showing people showering petals on Afridi in a “splendid welcome” at Karachi’s Toll Plaza.







We are patriots of Pakistan: Salman Akram
Earlier on Saturday, Sheikh and Raja, along with others, gathered at Karachi‘s Hassan Square to record a statement as they began their journey to join CM Afridi’s convoy.
Umer Dar, the brother of Usman Dar who quit the party in the wake of the May 9 riots, was among those present.
Raja said: “Dear citizens of Sindh, we are present on your land today. I am standing opposite Karachi’s Hassan Square. As you know, a grand jalsa is being organised at 4:30pm tomorrow at Bagh-i-Jinnah under the shadow of Mazar-i-Quaid.
“We have come before you with Imran Khan’s message. This is a message of freedom […], of defending the water of Sindh’s farmers,” he said.
The PTI secretary general urged the public to attend the powershow and collectively raise their voice against the imprisonment of PTI leaders and the “violation of their privacy”.
“We have to tell the oppressor that ‘we are alive, you cannot erase us’,” he said, calling the PTI and its founder “Pakistan’s future”.
“We are the patriots of Pakistan, we are the sons of Sindh, we are the guardians of Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber Paktunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan,“ he said.







Plan ahead
A schedule shared by the PTI on X lists CM Afridi’s planned activities for Sunday, including the Mazar-i-Quaid gathering and a meeting with the All City Tajir Ittehad Association in Karachi.
The schedule stated that Afridi would meet Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah on Monday (Jan 12) morning.







Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid.
On the other hand, a notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office on January 8 cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold a gathering in Qayyumabad.
Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.

Major Iranian cities were gripped overnight by new mass rallies denouncing the Islamic Republic, as activists on expressed fear that authorities were intensifying their suppression of the demonstrations under the cover of an internet blackout.
The two weeks of protests have posed one of the biggest challenges to the Iranian authorities, although Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed defiance and blamed the United States.
Following the movement’s largest protests yet on Thursday, new demonstrations took place late Friday, according to images verified by AFP and other videos published on social media.
This was despite an internet shutdown imposed by the authorities, with monitor Netblocks saying early on Saturday that “Iran has now been offline for 48 hours”.







The blackout has sparked fears among activists that authorities are now violently cracking down on the protests, with less chance that the proof will reach the outside world.
According to a report by the Iran Human Rights Activists News Agency, the death toll in the protests rose to 65, Anadolu reported.
The report added that protests took place in 512 locations in 180 cities in all 31 provinces, resulting in the deaths of 50 protesters, 14 law enforcement and security officials, and one government-affiliated civilian.
Demonstrations also left dozens injured and 2,311 detained. The injuries were largely caused by pellet shots and plastic bullets, according to the report.
Authorities have not issued a statement about those killed or injured.
Amnesty International said it was analysing “distressing reports that security forces have intensified their unlawful use of lethal force against protesters” since Thursday in an escalation “that has led to further deaths and injuries”.
Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi warned on Friday that security forces could be preparing to commit a “massacre under the cover of a sweeping communications blackout”, and said she had already received reports of hundreds of people being treated for eye injuries at a single Tehran hospital.
Norway-based Iran Human Rights group has claimed that at least 51 people have been killed in the crackdown so far, but warned the actual toll could be higher.
Iranian authorities are using the “most blatant tools of repression”, prize-winning filmmakers Mohammad Rasoulof and Jafar Panahi said, pointing to the internet blackout.
“Experience has shown that resorting to such measures is intended to conceal the violence inflicted during the suppression of protests,” they added.
‘Seize city centres’
In Tehran’s Saadatabad district, people banged pots and chanted anti-government slogans as cars honked in support, a video verified by AFP showed.
Other images disseminated on social media and by Persian-language television channels outside Iran showed similarly large protests elsewhere in the capital, as well as in the eastern city of Mashhad, Tabriz in the north and the holy city of Qom.
In the western city of Hamedan, a man was shown waving a Shah-era Iranian flag featuring the lion and the sun amid fires and people dancing.
In the Pounak district of northern Iran, people were shown dancing round a fire in the middle of a highway. It was not possible to immediately verify the videos.
Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted Shah, hailed the “magnificent” turnout on Friday and urged Iranians to stage more targeted protests on Saturday and Sunday.







“Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres,” Pahlavi said in a video message on social media.
‘Big trouble’
Pahlavi, whose father Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was ousted by the 1979 revolution and died in 1980, added he was also “preparing to return to my homeland” at a time that he believed was “very near”.
Authorities say several members of the security forces have been killed, and Khamenei, in a defiant speech on Friday, lashed out at “vandals” and accused the United States of instigating the protests.
State TV on Saturday broadcast images of funerals for several members of the security forces killed in the protests, including a large gathering in the southern city of Shiraz.
Iran’s army said in a statement that it would “vigorously protect and safeguard national interests” against an “enemy seeking to disrupt order and peace”.
National security council chief Ali Larijani said in comments broadcast late Friday that “we are in the middle of a war”, with “these incidents being directed from outside”.
US President Donald Trump again refused on Friday to rule out new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic Republic in June.
“Iran’s in big trouble. It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,” Trump said.
Protester replaces flag at Iranian Embassy in London
A protester briefly replaced the flag of the Islamic Republic of Iran at its London embassy with a former flag, flown before 1979, during a demonstration today, witnesses told AFP.
A video posted to social media showed a man on the balcony of the embassy, near Hyde Park, replacing the country’s current flag with one used during the rule of the ousted shah to cheers from hundreds of demonstrators below.
The flag — tri-coloured, with a lion and sun, surrounded by a wreath and crown — was a ceremonial one used in Iran before the 1979 revolution. It stayed in place for several minutes before being removed, witnesses on site told AFP.

“Democracy for Iran. Shah Reza Pahlavi. Justice for Iran,” chanted the demonstrators, referring to the son of the late shah of Iran who now lives in the United States. Some also held placards reading “Free Iran”.
“I’m here to support Iranians, my loved ones inside Iran — they’ve been protesting for two weeks today,” said one demonstrator, Taraneh, 33, who declined to give her last name.
“The internet has been shut down … We get very little information from inside Iran,” she added. “But, you know, people are still in the streets. They’re being attacked.“</p><small>2026-01-10 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10233850f237d57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966208/after-fatal-ice-shooting-minneapolis-mayor-urges-activists-to-avoid-trumps-bait' target='_blank'><strong>After fatal ICE shooting, Minneapolis mayor urges activists to avoid Trump’s ‘bait’</strong></a><br><p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Saturday urged demonstrators protesting the fatal shooting of a motorist by a US immigration agent to stay peaceful, saying that any unlawful actions would play into US President Donald Trump’s hands.
Frey, a Democrat, cautioned them as civil liberties and migrant-rights groups prepared nationwide rallies to protest the killing of 37-year-old Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer on Wednesday. Minnesota and US officials have offered starkly different accounts of the shooting.
Twenty-nine people were arrested overnight in Minneapolis as police responded to protests, including a gathering of demonstrators outside a hotel believed to be lodging a visiting contingent of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, city Police Chief Brian O’Hara said.
One police officer was injured in the response, O’Hara told a news conference on Saturday.

Frey, who has been critical of immigration agents and the shooting, said the demonstrations to date have remained mostly peaceful and that anyone causing damage to property or engaging in other unlawful activity would be arrested by the police.
“We will not counter Donald Trump’s chaos with our own brand of chaos. He wants us to take the bait,” Frey said at the news conference.
The fatal shooting of Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, came soon after some 2,000 federal officers were dispatched to Minneapolis in what ICE’s parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, called the “largest DHS operation ever.”
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, condemned the deployment as a “reckless” example of “governance by reality TV.”
O’Hara said more than 200 law enforcement officers were dispatched to the Hilton Canopy Hotel on Friday night to respond to what started as a “noise protest” but then escalated, with more 1,000 demonstrators gathered on site.
“We initiated a plan and took our time to de-escalate the situation, issued multiple warnings, declaring an unlawful assembly, and ultimately then began to move in and disperse the crowd,” O’Hara said Saturday.
Federal-state tensions escalated further on Thursday when a US Border Patrol agent in Portland, Oregon, shot and wounded a man and woman in their car after an attempted vehicle stop. Using language similar to its description of the Minneapolis incident, DHS said the driver had tried to “weaponize” his vehicle and run over agents.
The two DHS-related shootings this week have drawn thousands of protesters to the streets of Minneapolis, Portland and other US cities, with many more demonstrations under the banner “ICE Out For Good” planned for Saturday and Sunday.
Protest organisers said more than 1,000 weekend events have been planned across the country demanding an end to large-scale deployments of ICE agents, mostly to cities led by Democratic politicians.
The rallies were being organised by a coalition of groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, MoveOn Civic Action, Voto Latino, and Indivisible, some of which were at the forefront of “No Kings” protests against Trump last year.</p><small>2026-01-10 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10225428e5fab22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966207/syrian-authorities-transferring-kurdish-fighters-from-aleppo-to-northeast' target='_blank'><strong>Syrian authorities transferring Kurdish fighters from Aleppo to northeast</strong></a><br><p>Syrian authorities on Saturday began transferring Kurdish fighters from the country’s second city, Aleppo, to areas they control in the country’s northeast, state television reported, after days of deadly clashes.
The violence in Aleppo erupted after efforts to integrate the Kurds’ de facto autonomous administration and military into the country’s new government stalled.
Since the fighting began on Tuesday, at least 21 civilians have been killed, according to figures from both sides, while Aleppo’s governor said 155,000 people have been displaced.
On Saturday evening, state television reported that Kurdish fighters “who announced their surrender … were transported by bus to the city of Tabaqa” in the Kurdish-controlled northeast.
An AFP correspondent saw at least five buses on Saturday carrying fighters leaving the Kurdish-majority Sheikh Maqsud district, accompanied by security forces.

Their departure came as US envoy Tom Barrack on Saturday met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, and afterwards issued a call for a “return to dialogue” with the Kurds in accordance with an integration agreement sealed last year.
In a statement to the official SANA news agency earlier today, the military announced “a halt to all military operations in the Sheikh Maqsud neighbourhood”.
A Syrian security source had told AFP that the last Kurdish fighters had entrenched themselves in the area of al-Razi hospital in Sheikh Maqsud, before being evacuated by authorities.
On the outskirts of Sheikh Maqsud, families who were unable to flee the violence were leaving, accompanied by Syrian security forces, according to an AFP correspondent.
Men were carrying their children on their backs as women and children wept, before entering buses taking them to shelters.

Dozens of young men in civilian clothing were separated from the rest, with security forcing them to sit on the ground, heads down, before being taken by bus to an unknown destination, according to the correspondent.
Government forces began striking the district overnight after a deadline elapsed for Kurdish fighters to withdraw during a ceasefire.
Residents waiting to return
At the entrance to the district, 60-year-old resident Imad al-Ahmad waited for permission from the security forces to return home.
“I left four days ago… I took refuge at my sister’s house,” he told AFP. “I don’t know if we’ll be able to return today.”
Nahed Mohammad Qassab, a 40-year-old widow also waiting to return, said she left before the fighting to attend a funeral.
“My three children are still inside, at my neighbour’s house. I want to get them out,” she said.

The clashes, some of the most intense since Syria’s new authorities took power, present yet another challenge as the country struggles to forge a new path after the ousting of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.
Both sides have blamed the other for starting the violence in Aleppo.
‘Fierce’ resistance
Kurdish forces earlier reported coming under artillery and drone attacks, and claimed on social media to be mounting a “fierce and ongoing resistance”.
The army said three soldiers had been killed by Kurdish fighters, while state television accused them of launching drones at residential areas of Aleppo. A flight suspension at Aleppo airport was extended until late Saturday.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) control swathes of the country’s oil-rich north and northeast, and were key to the 2019 territorial defeat of the Islamic State group.
But Turkey, a close ally of neighbouring Syria’s new leaders, views its main component as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which agreed last year to end its four-decade armed struggle against Ankara.

Turkey has launched successive offensives to push Kurdish forces from the frontier.
Elham Ahmad, a senior official in the Kurdish administration in Syria’s northeast, accused Syrian authorities of “choosing the path of war” by attacking Kurdish districts and of “seeking to put an end to the agreements that have been reached”.
“We are committed to them and we are seeking to implement them,” she told AFP.
The March integration agreement was meant to be implemented last year, but differences, including Kurdish demands for decentralised rule, have stymied progress.
Ahmad welcomed on X a proposal by international mediators to evacuate the Kurdish forces from Sheikh Maqsud, but on condition that the local Kurdish population is protected.
Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the renewed clashes cast doubt on the government’s ability to unite the country after years of civil war.
Syria’s authorities have committed to protecting minorities, but sectarian bloodshed rocked the Alawite and Druze communities last year.</p><small>2026-01-10 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644383-woman-found-chained-inside-karachis-dha-flat' target='_blank'><strong>Woman found chained inside Karachi's DHA flat</strong></a><br><p>

The decision comes a day after Hayat rebuffed rumors and fake news on social media regarding the extension of holidays and maintained that schools would reopen on Jan 12.
The education minister, however, created a poll on his X account, asking people if schools and colleges should reopen from Jan 12 or 19. The majority of the users voted for Jan 19.







In the latest post today on X, Hayat wrote: “In view of the prolonged severe winter spell and the forecast of extremely low temperatures in the coming days, and on the advice of PDMA, the Government of Punjab has decided to extend winter vacations until January 19.”



Meanwhile, in a separate notification, the Punjab Higher Education Department stated that winter vacations for higher educational institutions were extended from January 10 to January 16 due to the severe weather.
“All colleges (public and private) shall re-open on Monday, January 19, 2026, resuming [the] full/normal week for all classes,” the notification, available with Dawn, read.
It added that BS 4-year programmes would continue to function and all examinations would be held as per the notified schedules of boards and universities.



The Punjab government had announced winter vacations for all public and private schools and colleges from December 22 to January 10.
Earlier in the week, a fake notification claiming to have been issued by Punjab’s School Education Department went viral on social media, spreading confusion among parents and students.
The notification claimed that “due to severe weather conditions,” the vacations had been extended until January 17, and that schools would reopen on January 19.
Sindh govt changes school timings until Jan 26
The Sindh government today notified new school timings in the province due to the prevailing cold weather.
A weather advisory from the Met Office forecast cold and dry weather over most districts in Sindh, with a minimum temperature of 9º Celsius and a maximum of 25ºC.“Moderate to dense fog is likely to persist over Sukkur, Rohri, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Shaheed Benazirabad, Dadu, Larkana, Tando Jam, Mohenjodaro and surrounding areas,” the advisory read.
According to a notification from the Sindh government, available with Dawn, all private and public educational institutions would open from 9am on January 12 (Monday) until January 26.



The changes to school timings would apply to educational institutions “under the administrative control of the school education and literacy department”, the notification read.
The decision was made after Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah consulted Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah. While schools will open at 9am, school closure times will remain the same.</p><small>2026-01-10 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10210203185ab8b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966205/police-rescue-woman-forcibly-confined-in-karachis-darakhshan' target='_blank'><strong>Police rescue woman forcibly confined in Karachi’s Darakhshan</strong></a><br><p>A woman who was unlawfully confined and chained to a bed in Karachi’s Darakhshan area was rescued by police on Saturday, according to a senior police official.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that police received a call about a woman unlawfully confined and bound with chains in a third-floor flat in Darakhshan Commercial Area. The station house officer Darakhshan immediately reached the scene.
The flat was found locked from the inside, with police breaking the lock and entering in the presence of neighbours, the DIG said.
“Inside the bedroom, a woman was found with iron chains tied around her neck, hands and feet. The chains were cut with power tools and the woman was freed,” he added.
The victim, a resident of Shireen Jinnah Colony, alleged that her ex-husband called her to the flat under the pretext of giving her money for their children.
When she arrived at about 9am, her ex-husband and his friend allegedly confined her in the bedroom and chained her to the bed. She further stated that she managed to break the bed to get free, escaped to the balcony and raised a hue and cry to draw attention. Neighbours alerted police on the Madadgar-15 helpline.
DIG added that the victim was taken to Darakhshan police station for further legal action, while police registered a first information report under Sections 337A(1) (punishment of assault to the head or face), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modest) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), read with 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) PPC.
In December 2024, a young nurse in Karachi was rescued by police from the alleged wrongful confinement by her paternal family, who had shaved her head as a punishment for wanting to marry of her own free will.</p><small>2026-01-10 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10205050995a519.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966197/ttap-leadership-distributes-pamphlets-in-lahore-commences-public-outreach-campaign' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP leadership distributes pamphlets in Lahore, commences public outreach campaign</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: After addressing workers and supporters at Minar-i-Pakistan, Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leadership commenced a public outreach campaign in Lahore.
Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mahmood Khan Achakzai of the TTAP, visited different markets and commercial areas of the provincial capital to rally support for the opposition alliance’s street movement.
As part of the drive, videos posted on X by the opposition leadership showed the leadership distributing pamphlets.







“A large number of people expressed solidarity with the leadership of Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan,” said a post on X by the opposition alliance.
Obstacles at Minar-i-Pakistan
Earlier in the evening, Abbas and Achakzai reached Minar-i-Pakistan to address supporters of the PTI and the opposition alliance.
However, local authorities closed all doors and blocked party workers from entering the Minar-i-Pakistan ground but allowed the TTAP leadership to proceed.







PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik chided the Punjab government for not even allowing the TTAP delegation to present a resolution at Minar-i-Pakistan.
Speaking to Dawn, she said the party had called its workers to accompany the TTAP delegation, but the “terrified Punjab government” shut the gates of the Minar-i-Pakistan ground.
Drawing a comparison, Malik said the Punjab government allegedly smashed the vehicles of delegation members, while Sindh allowed a reception for the PTI delegation led by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.







Later, the TTAP delegation visited Mazar-i-Iqbal and the Bibi Pak Daman shrine to pay homage.
Lahore Press Club address
Abbas and Achakzai also held a press conference at the Lahore Press Club, along with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Haqooq-i-Khalq Party General Secretary Ammar Ali Jan.
Abbas, speaking at the press conference, said that the opposition movement was about “reforms, protection of the Constitution, ensuring the rights of the people, and the liberation of the downtrodden classes of society”.







He maintained that those in power were “blocking all routes to any reform”. “What avenues will people be left with otherwise?” the leader questioned.
“They will rise and revolt against the system.”
Achakzai also spoke at the press conference, reiterated his earlier stance that the “Constitution was under attack” and the country had been plunged into a crisis.
“We are the common people of Pakistan, and we love this country just as much as anyone,” he said.
“We have to collectively bring the country out of this crisis,” Achakzai said.
“We are not here to tell people that please come follow us; we are here to ask them to stand with us,” Achakzai added.
Achakzai also called on people to join the opposition’s movement, stating that, “In such a crisis, it is a sin to stay at home; you must come out on the streets”.
“It does not matter what party you belong to, which sect, if you love this country, come and sit with us,” he said.
In response to a question regarding talks with the government, the TTAP chief said that regardless of what happens, “we will not make a deal at the expense of Pakistan”.







Achakzai further reiterated that “Pakistan’s army needs to stay within its framework as other countries’ armies do.”
“Those playing with the Constitution of Pakistan are a security risk,” he said.
Achakzai said the powerful quarters “had stopped the natural process of developing leadership through suppression that led to create internal crises.”
Citing that PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif tried to take the right path of the constitution, the TTAP chief said he was sidelined and punished for a 10-year forced exile.
Hoping that history would forgive him, Achakzai said that he had asked Nawaz and would also speak to incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan that the “next democratic government should honour all those judges with the title of ‘heroes of democracy’ — those who did not surrender to the powerful and resigned from their jobs.”
“Such judges should one day be rewarded with all privileges that they had surrendered in their endeavour to uphold the Constitution, judiciary and courts,” Achakzai said.
Responding to a question, Achakzai suggested Pakistan could request the United Nations to call a round-table conference, where Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and China could sit together, thrash out issues and find solutions.
“No country alone can find and implement solutions,” he added.
Ammar Ali Jan also spoke at the press conference and announced that his party, along with trade unions and student organisations, was joining the TTAP for “restoration of democracy, upholding of the Constitution, and the security of the country”.







He lamented that the parliament had been “rendered dysfunctional, the judiciary ruined, and the media chained.”
Meanwhile, PTI has also issued a call to the masses to gather at Minar-i-Pakistan, where the TTAP leadership is expected to announce a formal resolution.
PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged party leaders, workers and others to reach Minar-i-Pakistan and prove themselves as good hosts.
As part of today’s activities, the delegation was expected to head to the Data Darbar and Bibi Pak Daman shrines to pay their tributes.
The TTAP delegation wanted to visit Data Darbar to pay homage as soon as it entered Lahore on Thursday; however, the Punjab government blocked all roads leading to the shrine.
Therefore, the opposition alliance had kept the TTAP delegation’s movements secret, hoping they would find open routes to the shrine and Minar-i-Pakistan.
PTI Punjab also distributed pamphlets in an effort to mobilise the party’s support base for the upcoming street movement.
On Thursday, Achakzai, who led the TTAP caravan from Islamabad to Lahore, urged the nation and political parties to support its wheel-jam and shutter-down strike to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8 elections, saying the protest would also pave the way for talks with the government.</p><small>2026-01-10 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644375-sindh-curtails-school-timings-as-cold-wave-grips-province' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh cuts school timings as cold wave grips province</strong></a><br><p>

The 40-year-old woman was shot and injured by her husband in their home on Friday. The initial probe revealed that the incident occurred over a “domestic dispute”.
“The suspect had fled the scene after the incident,” the police official stated.
In the statement issued today, the police confirmed that the suspect is in custody and the murder weapon was recovered from his possession.
The statement added that the suspect was arrested during a raid conducted on Friday night.
“Further interrogation of the suspect is underway, and all the proceedings will be done as per the law,” said SSP Siddiqui.
The suspect is a serving police inspector, posted with the Special Investigation Unit (SIU).
A day earlier, the SSP revealed that it was the suspect’s second marriage to the victim. “The suspect had doubts that his wife was still in ‘contact’ with her former husband,” he said.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) have continued voicing its concerns over honour killings as a serious issue.</p><small>2026-01-10 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644350-pti-gets-permission-for-karachis-bagh-e-jinnah-rally-warned-against-anti-state-speeches' target='_blank'><strong>PTI gets permission for Karachi's Bagh-e-Jinnah rally, warned against 'anti-state speeches'</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), PAF Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, who on a visit to Iraq, called on Iraqi Air Force Commander Lt Gen Staff Pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi.
The two met at the Iraqi Air Force headquarters, where ACM Sidhu received a guard of honour upon his arrival, it said.
“Discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, with emphasis on joint training, capacity building and improving operational cooperation,” ISPR said.







During the meeting, ACM Sidhu “highlighted the deep-rooted religious, cultural, and historical ties between Pakistan and Iraq”.
He also “reaffirmed PAF’s commitment to support the Iraqi Air Force in training and capacity development”.
The statement said the pair “agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability”.
Meanwhile, the Iraqi air chief commended PAF’s “professionalism and technological advancement”.
The statement added that he also expressed “interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed a keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, Super Mushshak trainer aircraft”.
The commander also appreciated Pakistan for its role in regional stability, it said.
“The visit underscored the shared resolve of both air forces to further strengthen defence ties and professional collaboration,” ISPR added.
The JF-17 Thunder aircraft are jointly developed by Pakistan and China. Earlier this week, Bangla­desh had expressed an int­e­rest in the “potential pro­cu­r­e­ment” of JF-17 Thun­der aircraft.
Meanwhile, reports have emerged stating that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.</p><small>2026-01-10 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644334-govt-moves-to-address-water-crisis-in-islamabad-via-emergency-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt moves to address water crisis in Islamabad via emergency plan</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, “Pakistan Navy demonstrated its operational readiness and combat preparedness through a comprehensive exercise in the north Arabian Sea, showcasing both conventional and unmanned capabilities, as per dictates of evolving naval warfare.
“The exercise included the successful live firing of LY-80 (N) surface-to-air missile from a vertical launching system at an extended range, validating the long-range capabilities of Pakistan Navy’s modern air defence systems,” said ISPR.



It said that the missile “successfully engaged and neutralised an aerial target, demonstrating Pakistan Navy’s robust air defence capabilities”.
It added that the exercise also featured the “successful engagement” of surface targets using loitering munition, demonstrating Pakistan Navy’s precision strike capabilities.
It added that the loitering munition successfully engaged and destroyed surface targets.
“Successful open-sea trials of an unmanned surface vessel were also conducted, marking a significant leap in autonomous naval technology. The trials validated the platform’s ability to combine high-speed performance with mission-critical durability,” it said.
“Key capabilities demonstrated include extreme manoeuvrability, precision navigation and weather resilience,” it said, adding that an unmanned surface vessel offered a low-risk, high-impact solution with the stealth of a tactical interceptor.
It added that the Pakistan Fleet commander witnessed the exercise, which showcased Pakistan Navy’s ability to “employ advanced systems”.
It stated that Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf commended officers on their “professionalism and operational competence”.
He reaffirmed Pakistan Navy’s resolve to “ensure seaward defence of Pakistan and safeguard national maritime interests under all circumstances”, it added.</p><small>2026-01-10 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10142921ee6a521.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966191/jui-f-leader-succumbs-to-injuries-following-blast-in-lower-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F leader succumbs to injuries following blast in Lower South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A senior Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) leader succumbed to his injuries on Saturday morning after being critically wounded in a bomb blast near a madressah in the Wana bazaar area.
Police said on Friday that a remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED) was planted in the Konra Cheena area near a religious seminary to target Maulana Sultan Muhammad Wazir, who was also the district president of Wafaqul Madaris al Arabia.
He was immediately taken to Dera Ismail Khan for medical treatment but breathed his last on the way.
Lower South Waziristan District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir confirmed that an investigation into the incident was underway. He said law enforcement agencies were examining all aspects of the incident, adding that the evidence collected from the site was being analysed to trace those responsible.
The attack on Maulana Sultan is the latest in a series of incidents targeting religious scholars and JUI-F leaders in South Waziristan, particularly in Wana and the Birmal tehsil, over the past two years.
In a statement posted on X, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman expressed his deep grief on Sultan’s death, describing him as a “devoted and courageous leader”.
“This incident is not merely an attack on an individual but an assault on the moderate, peaceful, and democratic ideology,“ he said, asserting that the JUI-F was the “flag-bearer” of these values.
“Following Bajaur, the targeting of freedom-loving and peace-advocating scholars in regions carrying deep religious significance like South Waziristan marks a deeply alarming pattern,” he said.
Fazl recalled that in March 2025, JUI-F’s South Waziristan Emir was “severely injured” in a bomb blast and “till date remains under treatment at Multan’s Nishtar Hospital”.
He further pointed out that former JUI-F district president Maulana Mirza Jan Wazir had been injured in a terrorist attack in June 2024 and had now passed away.

 

Fazl said that the targeting of a party such as the JUI-F, which believed in “moderation, tolerance and constitutional struggle”, was extremely upsetting and a moment for serious reflection.
The JUI-F chief said such attacks on scholars were “not only resounding proof of the failure and negligence of security institutions but also sinister attempts to suppress the peaceful narrative” that his party had been promoting for years across the country, including tribal areas.
“The sole crime of such scholars is that they advocate for reason over the gun, love over hatred, and peace over discord,” Fazl lamented.
He asserted that the JUI-F had always opposed oppression and violence, spoken for the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and adopted the struggle for reform and peace as its motto while remaining within the framework of the state.
“This is precisely why the party, while staying away from all shades of extremism and radicalism, is recognised as a balanced, responsible, and mainstream national political force.”
Fazl called on the “institutions responsible for national security” to recognise their constitutional and moral obligations; ensure the establishment of peace and the effective protection of scholars across the country, particularly in the tribal districts; and fulfil the demands for justice by meting out punishment to the elements involved in these tragic incidents.
He affirmed that the JUI-F would continue its struggle for peace, religious harmony, democratic values, and constitutional supremacy in the country with “full resolve, no matter how many sacrifices it must give along the way”.







Peace committee chief unhurt in blast
Separately, a suspected improvised explosive device (IED) blast targeted the vehicle of peace committee chief Qadeem Khan in the Barwand area of South Waziristan’s Servekai tehsil.

Upper South Waziristan DPO Arshad Khan said that the vehicle sustained significant damage in the attack, but the peace committee chief escaped with minor injuries.
Police sources said security personnel reached the site immediately, cordoned off the area, and shifted the injured leader to a local hospital.
The DPO confirmed that initial inquiries suggest the blast was carried out using an IED, deliberately targeting the peace committee chief. He said police were examining all aspects of the incident and had launched a search operation to apprehend the perpetrators.</p><small>2026-01-10 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644312-punjab-extends-winter-vacation-for-schools-colleges-amid-cold-snap' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab extends winter vacation for schools, colleges amid cold snap</strong></a><br><p>
