Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the “heinous” attack on the police station in Balcova, a district just west of the resort city, left two officers dead and a third “seriously injured”.
“The suspect in the incident, 16-year-old E.B., has been arrested and an investigation has been opened,” he wrote on X.
 






It was not immediately clear why the station was attacked, but footage posted by the Gercek Gundem news website showed mobile phone footage of a person in a balaclava, a black top and pale trousers jogging along the pavement carrying a rifle, then entering a building.
Another clip broadcast by Turkish TV stations showed a group of civilians helping to manhandle the alleged attacker, wearing white trousers, into a police van.
The DHA news agency said the assailant had used “a long-barrelled gun” while NTV television described the weapon as a “pump-action shotgun”.
Police immediately fanned out across the area, imposing tight security measures, media reports said.
Izmir Mayor Cemil Tugay denounced a “treacherous” attack and sent his condolences to the families of the dead in a post on X.

Emergency service and medical teams “pronounced the deaths of four victims, including a man about 50 years old and three men aged around 30”, a statement from Magen David Adom said — Israel’s emergency service — adding it was providing medical treatment to several other people, with five evacuated to hospitals.
The service received reports of more than a dozen people injured by gunfire Monday at a road junction in east Jerusalem, with police saying the assailants had been “neutralised”.
It later said paramedics and ambulance crews were providing medical treatment and evacuating five “seriously wounded people” who had been sent to hospitals in Jerusalem.
“Several other victims, with varying degrees of injury, are also being treated at the scene,” it added.

It was not immediately clear who carried out the shooting or what the motive was. Israeli police described the shooters as “terrorists” without saying how many had been involved in the incident. They also claimed that the perpetrators had been killed, according to Reuters.
The Israeli ambulance service said earlier that 15 people were wounded and at least five were in serious condition with gunshot wounds. Paramedics arriving at the scene found victims lying on the road and sidewalk near a bus stop, some of them unconscious.
Israely daily Haaretz reported that the two suspects had been shot dead by “a civilian member of the security forces who were present at the scene”, citing the police.
“The Israeli security establishment estimates that the two are West Bank residents, and that they fired at a bus and a bus stop at the junction,” the newspaper reported.</p><small>2025-09-08 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08134037412e972.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940482/two-gunned-down-one-injured-over-minor-dispute-in-nankana-sahib-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two gunned down, one injured over minor dispute in Nankana Sahib: police</strong></a><br><p>Two people were killed and another was injured on Monday when a “minor dispute” escalated into a gun battle between two groups in Punjab’s Nankana Sahib, according to police.
In a statement, Nankana police said that the incident took place in Sangla Hill and that two people were killed and one was injured; the latter was moved to the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad.
“As soon as the incident was reported, Nakana DPO (District Police Officer) Faraz Ahmed reached the spot,” the statement read, quoting a police spokesperson. “The scene of the incident was inspected, and orders were issued for the immediate arrest of the suspects involved.”
The statement added that the DPO visited the victims’ families and vowed that the suspects would “be arrested and brought to justice as per the law”.
Later, another statement from Nankana Police confirmed that following an operation in Sangla Hill, two of the suspects were arrested.
“A successful police operation was carried out under the leadership of DPO Faraz Ahmed,” the second statement read. “Two suspects involved in the incident were arrested, and further action is underway.”

While issuing a severe weather warning, the PMD highlighted the likelihood of torrential rains, gusty winds and possible urban flooding across Karachi and other parts of Sindh.
“Thunderstorm and rains are expected tomorrow [Monday] in Karachi with possibility of heavy falls,” said PMD’s focal person Anjum Nazeer Zaigham.
An advisory issued by the PMD stated that a depression over southwest Rajasthan and adjoining Guajrat has intensified further into a deep depression. “It is very likely to move westward and entered in southeastern Sindh during the next 24 hours causing widespread rains with strong winds.”
During the day, Karachi experienced overcast and humid conditions, with dense cloud cover persisting throughout. Light rain was also reported in the outskirts of the city.
The maximum temperature in the city was 32.6 degrees Celsius with 75 per cent humidity, increasing the discomfort for residents even before the anticipated downpour.
The Met office has warned that thundershowers with strong gusty winds and scattered “heavy to very heavy falls” are likely in Karachi Division, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Dadu, and Mirpurkhas until September 10.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari has called on all institutions to remain fully prepared in view of the heavy rains in Sindh.
He directed provincial, district and municipal authorities to stay on high alert and ensure advance arrangements. He also emphasised the need for close monitoring of water levels in Hub Dam and other reservoirs to safeguard communities.

He was addressing a judicial conference at the apex court, marking the commencement of the new judicial year.
The CJP’s address comes ahead of a full court meeting later today — in which all SC judges are expected to participate — to review and approve the Supreme Court Rules 2025, as cracks in the judiciary become starker.
Recently, senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah wrote a letter to CJP Afridi, asking him to answer six questions he raised about judicial independence, the court’s rules and policies, and the appeals against the 26th Amendment.
“We all talk about technology, we all talk about AI to be utilised for enhancing the justice delivery system,” Justice Afridi said, adding that 61,000 files will be digitally screened under a project that will be completed within six months.
 
 

“It is only when you have them digitally scanned that you can utilise the tools of AI for categorisation. It will be easy to categorise cases and to fix before one bench one issue,” he said.
The chief justice emphasised, “Yes, technology is necessary. Yes, AI has to be utilised. But no, not now. We are not ready for it. We have to prepare ourselves for that.”
Justice Shah, Munib Akhtar, Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Athar Minallah, Shahid Waheed, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Malik Shahzad Ahmad were among the fellow SC judges seen attending the event. Judges of the high courts were also present.

‘No issue on judges’ leaves during holidays’
During his speech, CJP Afridi also detailed a number of new policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs) introduced to address the structure of discussions on important issues.
Justice Afridi remarked that the chief justice could previously take up any case out of order for an early hearing, but SOPs were now in place to prevent that.
Stating that the court was taking up cases on a “first-come, first-served” basis, the top judge clarified that the court would not hear cases out of their order.
Then, apparently responding to one of the questions raised in Justice Mansoor Ali Shah’s recent letter on the CJP having powers to grant or refuse judges’ leaves, Justice Afridi said leaves outside of judicial holidays required permission.
“Let’s look at the grant of leave. I made it very clear, during holidays anyone who wants to go anywhere, no issue. But when there is court work, then I said here is the discretion, discretion is the exercise, it is the criteria, you have got everything in writing.”
 
 

Just last month, the SC issued a number of policy decisions taken between Oct 26, 2024 and Aug 12, 2025. One such decision, reflected in a General Standing Order dated July 29, 2025, amended the Supreme Court Judges (Leave, Pension and Privileges) Order 1997, empowering the CJP to grant or refuse leave, whether within or outside Pakistan, or to revoke or curtail leave already granted to judges of the court.
Enforced disappearances’ issue given ‘serious attention’
CJP Afridi further observed that the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee, which he heads and includes all the chief justices, had given “serious attention” to the issue of enforced disappearances.
“We sat down and decided on 17 items on which we are to proceed […]
First and foremost was that serious attention was given to enforced disappearances,” the top judge said.
He thanked Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan for assuring the judiciary that the government was “seriously considering a mechanism to ensure the production of detained persons”.
 
 

“I thank you for that and I expect that soon, we will have a good news regarding that,” Justice Afridi remarked.
“Number two, to safeguard the dignity of judges, SOPs have also been framed by the high courts to protect the judicial officers from external influence. This is the district judiciary. We have done it; all the district judiciary, all the high courts have framed their rules,” the CJP stated.
SC reforms based on 5 principles
Justice Afridi observed that after assuming the CJP’s office in October 2024, he felt the need for reforms, which were categorised based on “five principles”.
The CJP listed those principles: “To improve service delivery through technology, to improve access and transparency, to strengthen legal and regulatory framework, leverage international and external resources, and to revitalise the attached departments.”
 


Noting that the apex court had eight sections, CJP Afridi said each section prioritised speedy justice. He said digital case-filing and case-tracking were among the measures raised during six interactive meetings held to discuss the SC’s reforms.
“There are two groups in the lawyers’ community,” the CJP remarked, adding that members from both were included in the consultation process for judicial reforms.
He detailed that a high-powered committee led by Justice Shahid Waheed, which also included Justices Irfan Saadat Khan, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi, reviewed suggestions made by the SC “sections”, some judges and lawyers. Those were then placed before an administrative full court meeting on April 17.
Justice Afridi also spoke of the “Public Facilitation Centre” inaugurated today, which will begin its operations on October 1 and will provide “all details” related to cases.
Reiterating the need for speedy disposal of cases, he asserted: “We have always worked for the supremacy of the law.”
Emphasising that rules cannot be made within a single day, the judge urged those having objections to file their recommendations, which would then be taken up by a committee and eventually the full court. “I assure you that whatever your proposals are will be […] taken into consideration,” he affirmed.
‘Reduced security protocols for judges’
During his address, CJP Afridi highlighted that the security provided to him and other judges has been reduced, as well as the protocols when in Islamabad’s Red Zone, which houses key government buildings.
“I had nine security contingents as the chief justice. I sat down with the security people and I said ‘I am in the Red Zone, my residence is in the Red Zone, please have a heart’. So we have come down to this that there will only be two security vehicles with me, and same is the case with the worthy judges.”
 
 

He remarked that judges could need security when going outside of Islamabad, but not as much when in the Red Zone.
Continuing his speech, Justice Afridi noted that the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) had decided on 64 complaints against judges, 72 had been referred to the council’s members, and 65 were pending, which would be considered in the SJC meeting later this month.
AGP Awan, Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Tahir Nasrullah Warraich, and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) President Mian Rauf Atta also addressed the event.
Separately, CJP Afridi also inaugurated a “Media Station” at the SC, telling mediapersons on the occasion: “You people are necessary for the system because you keep everyone in check. […] Please keep us on check but it should be healthy.”</p><small>2025-09-08 09:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/08124614d2cf482.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940471/who-asks-taliban-to-lift-female-aid-worker-restrictions-following-earthquakes' target='_blank'><strong>WHO asks Taliban to lift female aid worker restrictions following earthquakes</strong></a><br><p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) has asked Taliban authorities to lift restrictions on Afghan female aid workers, allowing them to travel without male guardians and help women struggling to access care after a powerful earthquake killed 2,200 people in eastern Afghanistan.
“A very big issue now is the increasing paucity of female staff in these places,” Dr Mukta Sharma, the deputy representative of WHO’s Afghanistan office, told Reuters.
She estimated around 90 per cent of medical staff in the area were male, and the remaining 10pc were often midwives and nurses, rather than doctors, who could treat severe wounds.
This was hampering care as women were uncomfortable or afraid to interact with male staff and travel alone to receive care.
The September 1 magnitude-6 quake and its aftershocks injured more than 3,600 people and left thousands homeless in a country already dealing with severe aid cuts and a slew of humanitarian crises since the Taliban took over in 2021 as foreign forces left.
The Afghan health ministry and a spokesperson for the Taliban administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Taliban say they respect women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Islamic law and have previously said they would ensure women could receive aid. Its administration in 2022 ordered Afghan female NGO staff to stop working outside the home.
 
 

Humanitarian officials say there have been exemptions, particularly in the health and education sectors, but many said these were patchwork and not sufficient to allow a surge of female staff, particularly in an emergency situation that required travel.
That meant aid organisations and female staff faced uncertainty, Sharma said, and in some cases were not able to take the risk.
“The restrictions are huge, the mahram (male guardian requirements) issue continues and no formal exemption has been provided by the de facto authorities,” she said, adding her team had raised the issue with authorities last week.
“That’s why we felt we had to advocate with [authorities] to say, this is the time you really need to have more female health workers present, let us bring them in, and let us search from other places where they’re available.”
Sharma said she was extremely concerned about women in the future being able to access mental health care to deal with trauma as well as for those whose male family members had been killed, leaving them to navigate restrictions on women without a male guardian.
Peer Gul from Somai district in Kunar province, which was severely hit by the quakes, said many women from his village had experienced trauma and high blood pressure after the earthquake and were struggling to reach medical care.
“There is no female doctor for examinations; only one male doctor is available,” he said.
Sharma noted the growing shortage of Afghan female doctors as the Taliban have barred female students from high school and university, meaning a pipeline of women doctors was not being replenished.
The United Nations estimates around 11,600 pregnant women were also impacted by the quakes in a country with some of the highest maternal mortality rates in Asia.
Funding cuts, including by the US administration this year, had already left the health system reeling. Around 80 health facilities had already closed in the affected areas this year due to US aid cuts and another 16 health posts had to be shuttered due to damage from the earthquake, Sharma said.</p><small>2025-09-08 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622528-judicial-policymaking-panel-to-review-missing-persons-key-issues-on-oct-17-cjp' target='_blank'><strong>Judicial policymaking panel to review missing persons, other key cases on October 17: CJP</strong></a><br><p>

For people who had grown up with the river as playground, lifeline, and legend, its sudden return was less catastrophe than reunion, a reminder that Lahore’s history is inseparable from the waters that once defined it.
Rooted in myths, epics and legends
From its earliest myths, Lahore has been inseparable from the Ravi. The river doesn’t just flow past the city — it flows through its memory and identity.
Foundational folklore locates the city’s origins in Lava or Loh, son of Rama and Sita, casting the river as both guardian and witness, flowing by the fort’s walls. In fact, Ravi’s banks were the stage for one of the earliest remembered battles: the Dasarajna, or Battle of Ten Kings.
 
 

In an archival compilation on Lahore’s antiquities, the Deshwa Bhaga — a traditional account naming Lahore as Lavpor or ‘City of Lava’ — reportedly speaks of a duel between the Raja of Lahore [ruler of the ancient Hindu principality of Lahore before its conquest] and the Pandava Bhim [a central heroic figure in the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata] at a forest by the Ravi’s edge. Punjabi ballads, too, place Lahore’s jungles, then called Udinagar, as the site where folk-hero Raja Rasalu slew a man-eating rakshas, casting the Ravi as a theatre of defiance and courage.
Together, these texts and oral traditions present Lahore not as a city beside a river but as a city forged through it: a civic identity built on epic landscapes of struggle and survival.
According to an article in Dawn, the Ravi, known in the Vedas [a body of religious scriptures originating in India] as Iravati, was part of Saptasindu, the land of seven rivers that defined the earliest cultural imagination of Punjab. The same piece recalls how the Battle of the Ten Kings, one of the most celebrated episodes of the Rig Veda (an ancient Sanskrit collection of hymns), was fought “on the banks of the River Ravi surrounding Lahore.” In that clash, King Bharata’s tribe defeated a powerful confederation of rulers.
Thus, from the very outset of South Asia’s mythic consciousness, Lahore and the Ravi are intertwined: the city emerges not just as a settlement on water but as a battlefield, a site of identity forged through conflict and survival.
This cultural symbolism extended into Lahore’s religious imagination. The 16th-century mystic Shah Hussain, better known as Madho Lal Hussain, was first buried on the Ravi’s bank. When the river flooded, his grave was swept to higher ground near Shalimar, far from the current river course, an act his devotees interpreted as the Ravi’s own homage, carrying its lover to safety. Lahore’s famous Mela Chiraghan (‘Festival of Lights’) grew up around this shrine, once involving lamps floated on the Ravi’s waters in his memory. Through this story, the Ravi itself becomes a character in Lahore’s Sufi history — a vehicle of divine will and protector of saints.
In Sikh tradition, Ravi and Lahore are immortalised as a site of martyrdom and faith. It was along the fort’s Ravi-wall in 1606 that the 5th Sikh Guru, Arjan Dev, met his end.  Sikh scriptures recount that after days of torture in Lahore, Guru Arjan was permitted to bathe in the Ravi, which then flowed just outside the city walls. According to legend, Guru Arjan’s soul merged with the Ravi’s waters — a serene acceptance of God’s will.
This poignant event is commemorated at Gurdwara Dera Sahib in Lahore (on the old Ravi bank), and the river itself is revered as a witness to the Guru’s sacrifice.
These are not idle fictions, rather collective myths: narratives through which communities stabilise identity and transmit values across generations. For Lahoris, the Ravi functioned as a symbolic reservoir, embodying both beauty and defiance, and each retelling on the bridges or in the gardens reinforced their social frameworks of memory. In this way, folklore was less about individual imagination and more about a shared cultural memory that allowed the city to see itself reflected in the river, century after century.
That inheritance began to fade as the river itself receded. By the late 20th century, upstream diversions and unchecked pollution left the Ravi a blackened trickle. Experts noted a 36pc decline in annual flow and more than 40pc in summer months, transforming what was once a gold-bearing artery of Punjab into an open sewer.
For Lahoris, the sight of a dry bed beneath the bridges was more than ecological loss; it was cultural bereavement. A city once defined by its river was left with nothing but dust and memory.
 
 

The reunion of August 2025
This August, unprecedented monsoon rains and dam releases forced the Ravi back into Lahore. Alongside the Sutlej and Chenab, it produced one of the largest floods in Punjab’s history, displacing over two million people. Yet amid danger, Lahoris flocked to the bridges not in fear but in awe. Families gathered to watch the river swell, stretched their hands towards the water, and the two long-lost lovers had met again.
So what does it mean when a community celebrates the very flood that endangers it? The answer lies not in irrationality but in collective memory.
In Lahore, the Ravi has long functioned as what sociologist Maurice Halbwachs might call a “social framework of memory” — a living symbol through which people situate themselves in history and culture. The river is not merely water; it is a repository of myth, identity, and continuity. Its disappearance hollowed out not only Lahore’s landscape but also its cultural self-understanding. Its sudden return, how ever destructive, activated what French historian Pierre Nora describes as a lieu de mémoire: a site where memory condenses, reviving an ancient rhythm in the civic imagination.
Yet nostalgia must be distinguished from material conditions. The flood did not simply return romance to the city; it also exposed the structural vulnerabilities of Lahore’s urban planning, the weakness of its embankments, and the absence of a coherent ecological strategy. Schemes like the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project as well as the myriad of other real estate projects dotting the riverbanks are framed as progress, but without critical attention to ecology and equity, they risk repeating the very extractive logic that once killed the river.
The paradox
When Lahore expanded toward the Ravi, it wasn’t simply a cartographic shift; it was an urban philosophy that treated a living floodplain as a real estate frontier. For some Lahoris, this August’s flood was a moment of dread as their homes swept away, their lives upended. For others, it was a bittersweet reunion with a river they had long cherished as memory. Yet what returned was not nostalgia alone but the Ravi itself, in its own course, at its own speed, with the force of disaster. And the truth that must be faced is this: it is not only the river that has returned to its place, but human construction that has trespassed into it now stands exposed and precariously at risk.
Entire swathes of land, formerly declared “prone to floods” by the Punjab Irrigation Department are now filled with private housing schemes, many of which have seen considerable damage in the recent floods. Supported by regulators applying rules unevenly and even approving projects inside the flood-influence zone, many of these housing schemes are located in the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project. The irony here is that the “river training works” and construction of flood protection embankments, which were supposed to be carried out by the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda), lagged far behind in approvals.
Moreover, the Human Rights Watch too reported that the scheme spans over 100,000 acres, with around 85pc of the land under cultivation before its acquisition. At the time, the HRW documented how farmers were pressured off their land even as environmental groups warned of the risks posed by the channelisation and paving of the floodplain.
Together, these findings expose how Lahore’s expansion into the Ravi was less development than denial; a refusal to respect the ecological logic of the river, and a gamble that was always going to end up in catastrophe.
Today, the river’s return denotes the paradox of affective attachment in contexts of risk: people are drawn to it because it anchors identity, even as it threatens material survival. Lahoris are interpreting the river both as symbol of who they are and as hazard to what they have built.

According to the ‘Global Islamic Fintech Report 2024-25’, the sector, with 490 fintech firms, was valued at $161 billion in 2023-24 and is projected to more than double to $306bn by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.6 per cent. This outpaces conventional fintech growth (11pc), underscoring the sector’s dynamism and investor appeal.
Islamic fintech refers to the use of financial technology solutions specifically designed to comply with the principles of Islamic finance. In simple terms, it is the intersection of technology, innovation, and Islamic finance — creating digital financial products and services that avoid interest (riba), excessive uncertainty (gharar), and prohibited activities (such as gambling), while promoting ethical finance, transparency, and risk-sharing.
Several global trends are shaping the future of Islamic fintech, including digital Islamic banks and alternative finance platforms, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven applications, digital credit scoring and assessments, blockchain and asset tokenisation, smart payment solutions, and central bank digital currencies.
Islamic digital banks and fintech firms are challenging traditional norms. Players like AEON Bank (Malaysia) and STC Bank (Saudi Arabia) are redefining retail banking for younger, tech-savvy customers. By combining real-time analytics, tailored offerings, and instant compliance monitoring, they illustrate the future of Shariah-compliant banking.

As Islamic fintech gains momentum globally, Pakistan presents the ideal environment for growth if forward-looking policies are implemented

Artificial intelligence is increasingly integral to Islamic fintech. AI systems can now automate Shariah compliance audits, improve credit risk assessment, detect fraud, and deliver personalised investment advisory services. These applications help build consumer trust and expand financial access to underbanked populations.
Blockchain-based applications are also transforming Islamic capital markets. Digital sukuk pilots in Russia and Nigeria have demonstrated how distributed ledger technology reduces settlement costs and improves transparency. In Malaysia, tokenisation platforms such as Kapital DX are opening new investment opportunities by enabling retail investors to access Shariah-compliant assets such as healthcare and infrastructure projects.
 
 

Countries including Iran and Pakistan are exploring legislation or pilots for Shariah-compliant central bank digital currencies and virtual assets. These digital currencies can ensure asset-backed stability and enhance cross-border remittances — critical for remittance-dependent Muslim economies.
With growing investor appetite, venture capital is increasingly flowing into Islamic fintech. For example, Saudi Arabia’s Arbah Capital, alongside international partners, has invested nearly $40 million in early-stage fintech firms. Similar momentum is visible in Egypt, Malaysia, and across the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting investor confidence in the sector’s scalability and profitability.
On the domestic front, Pakistan has made significant progress, ranking among the Top 10 Islamic fintech hubs for the first time in the 2024-25 Global Islamic Fintech Index. This achievement reflects improvements in regulation, ecosystem readiness, and talent availability. Although smaller in absolute size, Pakistan’s fintech market holds enormous growth potential given its demographics: a large Muslim population, low financial inclusion, and rapid digital adoption.
According to the ‘Global Islamic Fintech Report’, Pakistan hosts 19 Islamic fintech firms, spanning digital wallets, small and medium enterprise (SME) financing, earned-wage access, credit scoring, and wealth management, thereby addressing diverse needs of underserved segments. The ecosystem is buoyed by a young, digitally active population. With over 200m mobile connections and rising smartphone penetration, Pakistan offers fertile ground for fintech adoption. The expansion of e-commerce further fuels demand for Islamic wallets, gateways, and embedded finance platforms.
However, challenges persist for local fintech firms. These include limited access to venture funding, regulatory overlaps, low financial literacy, weak digital infrastructure in remote areas, high customer acquisition costs, and cybersecurity concerns that affect consumer trust.
Realising the full potential of Islamic fintech in Pakistan will require focused and coordinated policy measures, with the objective of establishing a comprehensive and resilient Islamic fintech ecosystem by December 2027 — the mandated deadline for transitioning to a fully Shariah-compliant financial system.
To promote Islamic fintech in Pakistan, regulators such as the State Bank and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan should expand Shariah-compliant sandboxes, simplify licensing, and set clear rules for Islamic crowdfunding, peer-to-peer financing, and digital assets.
Access to capital must be enhanced through dedicated venture funds, tax incentives, and partnerships with Gulf Cooperation Council investors. Strong digital infrastructure — including broadband, open banking, and cybersecurity — is also vital for growth and trust. At the same time, nationwide financial literacy campaigns, supported by apps in Urdu and regional languages, can drive adoption.
Collaboration between fintechs, Islamic banks, and the government through innovation hubs, along with cross-border partnerships with Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will further strengthen Pakistan’s position. Developing skilled talent in fintech and Islamic finance, while expanding beyond payments into Zakat, Waqf, SME lending, wealth management, and tokenised Sukuk, will ensure a robust ecosystem.

The plan, long in the pipeline, was finally formalised when the Sindh-Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) filed a petition with the Thar Coal Energy Board (TCEB) in June, seeking — through a multi-year tariff — an increase in coal price to support the planned expansion of coal extraction capacity from the current 7.6 million tonnes to 11.2m tonnes for power generation as well as use by other industries.
A public-private partnership venture of the Sindh government and a consortium of private firms, SECMC’s petition has requested for a levelised tariff of $37.30 per tonne for the next 30 years. The proposed tariff includes a capacity payment of $19.89 a tonne. This translates into over 53pc of the tariff, which will be $39.42 per tonne (including $21.77 as a capacity charge) for the first 10 years and $28.79 per tonne (carrying the capacity payment of $12.79 per tonne) for the next 20 years.
In July, while chairing a meeting of TCEB held to deliberate on measures to bolster Pakistan’s indigenous coal-based energy sector, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah (who is also chairman of TCEB) said that Thar’s coal power initiatives were already generating over 2,600 MW of electricity at a significantly lower cost of around Rs4.8 per kWh compared to power from imported coal that costs roughly Rs19.5 per kWh. “This has resulted in savings of approximately $1.3 billion in foreign exchange for the country since 2019,” he explained.
The TCEB — an entity for accelerating Thar coal development — had reviewed ongoing projects and unanimously approved several strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing the region’s coal mining and electricity generation capabilities.

Civil society organisations and Thar residents reject SECMS’s coal tariff petition, lamenting the severe damage mining has caused the surrounding region

However, civil society groups have a different view. The petition, they argue, is riddled with legal, procedural, environmental, and financial deficiencies that make its acceptance not just questionable but dangerous. In its comments submitted before the board, the Alliance for Climate Justice and Clean Energy (ACJCE), a coalition of civil society organisations committed to Pakistan’s transition from fossil fuels, rejected the petition for the revision of the Thar coal tariff and expansion of mining.
“It would deepen Pakistan’s already unhealthy reliance on coal, flying in the face of the commitments the country has made under the Paris climate accord,” Abdul Rafay from ACJCE shares. He urged policymakers, regulators, the media, and the public to recognise the grave implications of unchecked coal expansion. “This is not merely an environmental issue to be brushed aside as the cost of development; it is fundamentally a question of economic justice, legal accountability, and public welfare.”
 
 

Local communities have on multiple occasions pointed out that the damage already inflicted on Thar’s fragile water resources by existing mining and coal-fired power generation is undeniable.
“To authorise further expansion is to knowingly accelerate the depletion of water, intensify ecological harm, and condemn local communities to bear disproportionate costs for a model of energy that serves short-term corporate and political interests over long-term national welfare,” laments Leela Ram, a resident of Gorano, one of the worst-affected villages due to coal mining in the region.
Mr Ram is also suspicious of the TCEB for trying to keep the developments related to the tariff petition under wraps. “For one, the local communities were not informed about the public hearing on the tariff petition to deprive them of the opportunity to present their point of view. When we raised the issue with the board, they told us that they had done their job by putting out a message about the hearing in the newspapers. Secondly, the hearing was organised in Karachi to prevent the affected local communities from attending it,” he complains.
Nonetheless, this couldn’t deter him or other villagers from ensuring their presence at the hearing and submitting their views. “It is extremely concerning that the expansion of coal mining in Thar will severely undermine the rights of Thar citizens to a healthy, clean and sustainable environment guaranteed by the constitution. Given that coal mining and coal-based power generation have already damaged Thar’s precarious water resources, any expansion in mining activity will only increase the speed and intensity of this damage,” Mr Ram goes on, referring to various independent studies on the impact of coal extraction and power generation on the environment, livelihoods and health of local communities.
ACJCE points out that the tariff petition fails to include critical documentation such as updated feasibility studies, environmental and social impact assessments, details of engineering and procurement contracts, financing term sheets, and evidence of public consultation.
“The absence of these disclosures not only contravenes transparency, but also renders the petition legally untenable and susceptible to regulatory capture,” the submission from the alliance emphasises.
Similarly, the petition has failed to assess or disclose the broader environmental implications, such as deeper resource extraction, intensified dewatering, increased waste generation, and further land acquisition. “This has resulted in a gross underestimation of environmental, social and economic harms caused by expansion in the coal mine.”
Mr Rafay also questions the legality of diverting Thar coal to industries other than power generation. It argues that the land for the Thar coalfield was acquired for a specific public purpose: to set up mine-to-mouth electricity production plants. “Any change in the coal’s end-use constitutes a material alteration of that public purpose and, therefore, violates the land acquisition law,” he says.
The anguished voices rising from Thar’s villages should serve as a stark reminder that Pakistan’s coal ambitions are exacting an unacceptable human cost. In their submissions, residents of Thario Halepoto, Bitra, Khario Ghulam Shah, Meehari, and other villages reject the tariff petition. Their grievance is simple: decisions that will upend their lives are being taken in boardrooms far from their homes, without their consent, and without acknowledgement of the devastation they already endure.
The villagers are not rejecting “development”. They are asserting something more fundamental: their right to live with dignity, safety and justice. They speak of poisoned water, vanishing lands, dislocated families, and a culture under siege. At the very least, this requires a written and publicly accessible resettlement and compensation policy for all villages affected by existing and future coal mining and coal-based power generation in Thar.

The  High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules-2025 were passed at the recent full court meeting of the IHC by a narrow margin, with six of the 11 judges voting in favour.
Justice  Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar  Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — the five senior judges who opposed the move and demanded certain amendments — would file their dissenting notes.
The newly promulgated rules substantially enhanced the authority of the chief justice, empowering him to nominate any judge to the powerful administration committee, while simultaneously eliminating the inclusion of the senior puisne judge as a de facto member of that body.

Dissenting notes ready to be filed after new rules divide judges

‘Misuse of powers’
A  day before the full court meeting, Justice Babar Sattar and Justice  Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan wrote a letter among their colleagues, expressing  grave concerns that administrative powers were allegedly being misused  to “sideline dissenting judges”. Later, they also objected to the way  the rules were presented at the meeting, complaining that “insufficient  time” had been provided for a proper review.
Also, according to  Justice Ejaz, the new Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR) were officially gazetted without meaningful debate or approval by the full court. He claimed the voluminous document — spanning more than 600 pages — was circulated only a day and a half before the meeting, thereby reducing consultation to a “mere formality and making substantive input impossible”.
A senior IHC official, however, disputed this claim,  insisting that every judge had been fully on board during the rule-making exercise. He cited an office order, dated June 12, 2019, and issued by then chief justice Athar Minallah, which constituted a committee to draft the rules in line with those of the Lahore High  Court. The committee included additional registrars Ijaz Ahmed and  Salamatullah.
Input of all judges sought
According to the official, the draft rules were duly circulated among all the judges,  months before the meeting was convened, and their input was solicited.  Apart from Justice Sattar, he said, no judge provided any suggestions.
However,  the recommendations submitted by Justice Sattar were rejected by the then chief justice on the grounds that they appeared tantamount to empowering judges with suo motu authority.
One of the dissenting judges, nonetheless, claimed that the version of the rules presented at  the full court meeting was “different from the one previously  circulated”.
Administration committee
Defending the changes, the official maintained that only minor alterations had been made. For instance, Rule 237 now provides that the administration committee, headed by the chief justice, shall ordinarily comprise three judges, though the chief justice may nominate additional members if deemed necessary. Likewise, Rule 239 now stipulates that each member of the administration committee shall serve as an administration judge,  with their powers and responsibilities to be defined by the chief justice from time to time.
Previously, the senior puisne judge automatically served as an administration judge, granting him significant authority over court affairs. Under the revised framework,  however, the chief justice has complete discretion to assign administrative functions, a change that effectively curtails Justice  Kayani’s role.
Justice Sattar and Justice Ejaz reportedly objected to the way case assignments were being structured, alleging that the  process was “manipulated to favour” judges transferred to the IHC along with the chief justice, while sidelining permanent judges who had opposed his transfer.
Special bench
They specifically referred to the formation of a special bench to address the backlog of tax cases. on which both dissenting judges were placed and assigned more than 200 tax references to be heard daily from 9am until the court’s rising.
Their pending cases were reassigned to other judges. The IHC official, on the other hand, rejected the objections, citing the LHC  practice where specialised benches are also assigned to senior judges.
Referring to the ‘Roster of Sitting’ at the LHC’s principal seat, he pointed out that Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh and Justice Javid Iqbal Wains sit on a bench for tax and commercial cases and hear such matters full-time from  Monday through Friday.

The intensity and frequency of floods, torrential rains, cloudbursts, windstorms, heatwaves, and droughts have risen sharply, alongside an ever-increasing risk of crop diseases and pest outbreaks. These recurring natural calamities — most recently the catastrophic super flood of 2025 — have left farmers extremely vulnerable.
Particularly, small farmers — those holding less than 12.5 acres — are in deep misery in flood-affected areas. Out of 11.7 million farms in the country, nearly 97 per cent of farms are smaller than 12.5 acres, as per the 7th Agricultural Census 2024. In other words, the proportion of such vulnerable farmers is extremely high. Their Kharif crops have already been wiped out, leaving them with no fallback option.
Looking ahead, they face two daunting challenges. First, sustaining their families, especially when many have lost stored wheat stocks and, in some cases, livestock as well; and second, securing agricultural inputs for the upcoming Rabi (wheat) crop, whose sowing is just a month and a half away.
The government has no comprehensive plan to cope with floods or safeguard farmers’ livelihoods. Instead, it continues to focus on reactive, firefighting responses rather than proactive adaptation measures. Successive governments in the past have largely relied on announcing discretionary relief programmes for affected farmers. But these ad hoc, ex-post measures are often plagued by corruption, bureaucratic delays, and time-consuming procedures. In a recent TV talk show, Khalid Hussain Batth, Chairman of Kissan Ittehad, disclosed that a large number of farmers have still not received the compensation announced for the 2022 floods.
 
 

Given the growing scale of climate-induced calamities, it has become imperative for the government to shift from a relief-based model to ex-ante risk management mechanisms. This is particularly urgent for floods, which, unlike droughts and heatwaves, have a sudden and devastating impact on vast agricultural lands, often causing long-term soil degradation.

As climate change intensifies and agricultural risks mount each passing year, the case for universal crop insurance has never been more compelling

The 2025 flood has inflicted unprecedented devastation in Punjab. It is largely due to unchecked settlements on riverbeds in rural areas. Across the Sutlej and Ravi rivers, it is common to see agricultural fields, farmers’ private bunds, and even houses and livestock sheds built on raised platforms after filling up land in the riverbeds. These obstructions have narrowed the river’s natural water-carrying capacity, leading to the inundation of vast tracts that were never previously considered at risk. At the same time, such choke points have placed immense pressure on upstream embankments and bunds, resulting in breaches.
Moreover, in several locations, poorly designed highways and river bridges have obstructed the natural flow of floodwaters. For instance, the Baba Farid bridge on the Sutlej river, connecting Pakpattan to Minchanabad, lacks culverts along an eight-kilometre stretch of its approach road. As a result, the river’s decades-old natural waterways, which allow excess water to pass during floods, have been blocked. Similarly, the bridge’s guide banks are too short in length to streamline the river’s flow through the bridge openings. Such design flaws and neglected maintenance of the structures have intensified upstream pressure, leading to widespread destruction.
 
 

Newspapers and TV talk shows are filled with demands from various stakeholders to remove encroachments from riverbeds. However, it is important to note that unlike canals, rivers naturally shift their course over time.
In many instances, they now flow through land privately owned by farmers for generations. Therefore, if the government truly intends to create space for rivers by clearing artificial choke points to avert future devastation — even partially — it will inevitably need to acquire private lands on a large scale under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, or alternatively enforce the Punjab Irrigation, Drainage, and Rivers Act 2023 (section 4).
Equally pressing is the need to strengthen the financial resilience of farmers in flood-prone areas. Unfortunately, the scope of the federal government’s Crop Loan Insurance Scheme has remained narrow and restrictive, which makes them ineffective in many ways. It covers only small- and medium-sized farmers (up to 25 acres) who take agricultural production loans from banks, excluding millions of non-borrowing farmers. Moreover, coverage is limited to major field crops — wheat, rice, cotton, maize, and sugarcane.
As climate change intensifies and agricultural risks mount each passing year, the case for universal crop insurance has never been more compelling. Such a scheme should ensure that all farmers — regardless of landholding size, access to bank loans, or crop type — are automatically covered against flood risk, with a meaningful sum insured that can genuinely protect farmers’ livelihoods. Advances in computer-based modelling now make it possible to mark flood-prone areas precisely, factoring in weather forecasts, topography of the area, and hydrological data.
In conclusion, creating room for rivers and extending crop insurance to all farmers in flood-prone areas are two fundamental measures needed to address the flood challenge, which carries both technical and humanitarian dimensions. Though these steps demand considerable financial resources, the real question is not about funding but whether the government has the political will to make them happen.

Across the capital, from upscale sectors to suburban communities, residents are hosting online Mahafil-i-Milad, streaming live naat sessions, and attending digital Seerat conferences.
Prominent platforms such as Zoom, Facebook Live, YouTube, and WhatsApp have become key tools for organising and participating in these spiritual events.
University students are actively conducting online naat competitions, Seerat quizzes, and live Q&A sessions with scholars — playing a proactive role in combining religious expression with modern technology.
Anam, a media student at International Islamic University Islamabad, said social media gave people the chance to make religious content more accessible, especially to younger audience.
Many mosques in Islamabad are also adapting the trend.
Some have launched daily live sessions covering Seeratun Nabi, while others have set up online donation channels to fund charitable activities during Rabiul Awwal.
Renowned Islamic scholars have taken to YouTube and Facebook to deliver special lectures, reaching thousands of viewers in real time.
Sadaf Sajid, a Qaria from Sector G-10, said Digital Milad is not a substitute but an extension of devotion.
“It allows people from different cities, even countries, to come together and celebrate the blessed month,” she said.
Joint online gatherings, where families from different cities and countries participate in collective recitations and prayers, are becoming increasingly popular.
Shireen, a resident of F-8, said her son was studying in the UK, and this was the second year they have included him in their family Milad via video call.
While physical celebrations — such as illuminating homes, distributing sweets, and attending mosque events — continue as per tradition, the rise of Digital Milad points to an evolving pattern of religious observance in Pakistan’s urban centres.

The cabinet was told this during its meeting held with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in the chair, said the chief minister’s aide on information and public relations, Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif. He said that the meeting was also attended by cabinet members, chief secretary, additional chief secretaries, senior member board of revenue, administrative secretaries and KP advocate general.
According to Mr Saif, the cabinet also approved raising minimum wage from Rs36,000 per month to Rs40,000 per month for adult, unskilled, juvenile and adolescent workers besides approved enhancing share of net hydel profit (NHP) for developmental activities in districts hosting dams, from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.
Mr Saif in a press release that during the meeting, a cabinet committee was formed to finalise Terms of Reference (TORs) for distribution and utilisation of NHP funds, reflecting the province’s increased share following successful deliberations with the federal government.

Cabinet expresses satisfaction over wheat stocks

The cabinet sanctioned Rs1,247.500 million for Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to provide food and non-food support to voluntarily displaced families owing to targeted operations against terrorists in certain villages of Bajaur district.
“The chief minister issued directions that the funds should be released without delay. He stressed that government bears full responsibility of care of displaced people, whether in camps or with host families,” Mr Saif quoted the chief minister as saying during the meeting.
He said that the cabinet approved a wide-range of initiatives covering rehabilitation and welfare, public health services, law and order, archaeology and tourism, forestation and amendments in various Acts and rules.
“A major development was the approval of provincial government’s communication strategy in line with changing dynamics of media and field of public relations in the province,” he said.
Mr Saif said that the cabinet approved reconstruction of Malak Saad Shaheed Police Lines, construction of residential hostels for police personnel at police stations of Daudzai and West Cantonment, and establishment of five new police stations and eight police posts in Peshawar district under a non-ADP scheme worth Rs3,625 million.
He said that four-kanal land was allocated for a new police station in Akbarpura, Nowshera. He said that the cabinet also approved declaring the newly-constructed sub-jail in Swabi as district jail and shifting 165 posts to operationalise its newly-built section, enabling transfer of prisoners from the old facility.
He said that the cabinet approved enhanced cost for upgradation of rural health centre in Oghi to Category-D Hospital, the fund flow mechanism for outsourced health facilities and a grant of Rs10 million for Rukhsana Mother and Childcare Trust Hospital. He added that Rs9.5 million was approved for celebration of the festivals of Kalash and Baha’i communities.
Mr Saif said that the cabinet approved procurement of 50 additional buses for BRT Peshawar. He said that the cabinet approved establishment of the country’s largest safari park in Nowshera by transferring 560 acres of land to wildlife department.
He said that 14,718 acres of barren land in Bund Piru, Tank, was transferred to forest department for its conversion into forest in the first phase and wildlife in the second phase. He added that the cabinet also approved transfer of the historic portion of Chashma Rest House in Dera Ismail Khan from irrigation department to archaeology department for preservation and opening it as an archaeological site.
The meeting sanctioned establishment of ‘KP arts and crafts display centre’ at Small Industries Development Board Plaza in Islamabad. Legislative approvals include KP Healthcare Commission Rules of Registration and Licensing, 2024, amendments in Rule 04, Sub Rule (II) of KP Commission on the Status of Women Rules, 2017, and KP Stamp (Amendment) Act, 1899.
Additional approvals include handing over a government-owned building for establishment of a Nadra office in Dera Ismail Khan on a rental basis, sanctioning MBS-II remuneration for provincial ombudsman under KP Ombudsman Act, 2010, and Rs6 million for kidney transplant of a patient belonging to Dera Ismail Khan.

Camo-clad soldiers seemed omnipresent as the Indonesian Military (TNI) began deploying its troops, at least in Jakarta. Dozens of armed troops on dirt bikes and in vehicles were seen passing major streets in Central Jakarta to the cheers of bystanders.
In comparison the police, which have been the target of public outrage due to their heavy-handed responses to the demonstrations, were nearly absent. Jayakarta Mil­itary Command (Kodam Jaya) commander Maj Gen Deddy Suryadi said the large-scale patrols aimed to ensure public safety in the wake of the series of demonstrations that had turned violent.
The Army meanwhile confirmed that the patrols were not limited to Jakarta, but were also deployed in major cities nationwide. The military has dismissed fears that the mobilisation of troops might lead to a state of emergency, when martial law can be declared to allow the TNI to take necessary measures to restore security and order, including seizing private assets and stifling civil liberties.
Deputy TNI chief Gen Tandyo Budi Revita reaffirmed the military’s allegiance to the Constitution, brushing off speculation that the option of martial law was on the table.

Many people believe that the current domestic security response to the ongoing protests isn’t what they fought for as they still remember the sight of troops in camouflage on Jakarta’s streets almost three decades ago

The wave of demonstrations that erupted last week descended into rioting and looting in some areas. Angry mobs broke into and ransacked the homes of several government officials over the weekend, while an unidentified group attempted to attack an upmarket residential complex in Bekasi, West Java, where many ethnic Chinese reside.
These violent actions signaled an escalation to a level of crisis that the National Police were not equipped to handle. Just a little over two months since the 27th anniversary of the May 1998 tragedy, we have been struck by déjà vu. Notwithstanding the TNI’s brushing aside a martial law scenario, the mass deployment of soldiers in our cities is a reality. The law allows for domestic deployment of the military to support the police’s public order operations.
One high-ranking official said no less than 76,000 troops were guarding Jakarta, which is likely why President Prabowo Subianto could take off to Beijing for his China visit after canceling the trip on Saturday. There is no official data on the number of Kodam Jaya troops on the ground across Greater Jakarta, but according to its former commander in 2020, the provincial command had around 15,000 soldiers ready to support flood mitigation efforts in the capital.
 
 

The chatter about potential martial law has emerged, especially on social media, as a reaction to escalating tensions due to mass demonstrations in cities across country, parti­cularly where mobs have vandalized public facilities and targeted government buildings, including those housing regional legislative councils. The arson attack on the Makassar Legislative Council on Aug 29 claimed three lives.
A potential declaration of martial law as a means to restore public order only indicates authorities’ collective failure to identify and resolve the root cause of the protests. People have take to the streets to vent their disappointment, if not anger, with officials’ poor performance and behavior, especially of those elected to represent their interests and aspirations in government.
The people’s struggle to make ends meet contrasts sharply with the privileges their representatives enjoy, such as a monthly housing allowance around 10 times the minimum wage.
This yawning gap, combined with some officials’ arrogance and lack of empathy and the police’s use of excessive force, has fueled the unrest. Their aspirations for fair wages and just governance are in line with the civil liberties protected by the 1945 Constitution, and should not warrant ceding responsibility for public order to the military, let alone give soldiers a full mandate to maintain domestic security, however demoralised the police might be at present.
Regulation in lieu of Law No. 23/1959 on a state of emergency, which remains effective today, states that martial law is to be declared only in the event of a large-scale rebellion, natural disaster or war that threatens the nation’s very existence.—The Jakarta Post/ANN

Sardar Akhtar Mengal, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, former National Party senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai remained unhurt in the suicide attack as they had left the venue just a few minutes before the blast.

Traders, transporters, and businesses pledge support to opposition alliance

Leaders of six opposition parties — Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal), Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Aain-i-Pakistan, Awami National Party (ANP), Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and National Party — strongly condemned the tragic incident in a meeting and announced a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike throughout the province.
They declared that during the strike highways, intercity roads, and routes leading to Quetta airport and railway station would be blocked. Other airports in the province would also be shut, with no air travel allowed.
 
 

Opposition leaders and their supporters also distributed pamphlets about the strike among traders, business centres, hotels, and the general public. They urged the business community and transporters to support the strike.
Trader organisations and transporters had already expressed their support for the strike call. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with other business associations, also announced closure of businesses across the province in solidarity with the victims of the suicide bombing.
Though the government has not announced the closure of its educational institutions today, the Private Schools Association declared that all private schools, colleges, and universities would remain closed.

The 22-year-old Alcaraz won 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to capture his second US Open crown and sixth Grand Slam title, avenging his lone defeat in a major final by Sinner at Wimbledon in July.
“It’s a great feeling. I’m working really hard just to lift this trophy. It’s my second one but it’s still a dream come true,” said Alcaraz.
Alcaraz will reclaim the world number one ranking from Sinner, returning to top spot on Monday for the first time since September 2023 after ending the Italian’s 27-match winning run at hard-court Grand Slams.
 


“It was one of the first goals that I had, to recover the number one (ranking),” said Alcaraz, who also defeated Sinner in an epic French Open final in June.
Alcaraz has now won seven of the past eight meetings and is 10-5 overall against Sinner.
“I tried my best today. I couldn’t do more,” said Sinner. “I felt like he was doing everything slightly better today.
“He raised his level when he had to … He played better than me today.”
Alcaraz and Sinner have shared the last eight Grand Slams on offer, winning four apiece to assert their superiority over the rest of the sport, including Novak Djokovic.
But while Sinner is 109-4 against the rest of the tour over the past two seasons, Alcaraz has had his number.
“It’s going to be on me if I want to make changes or not,” said Sinner. “That’s what I have to do, trying to become a better tennis player.”
 


Sinner’s defeat at Flushing Meadows extends the longest drought without a successful men’s title defence of any Grand Slam in the Open era.
No man has retained the US Open crown since Roger Federer won five in a row from 2004 to 2008.
Anticipation for the third straight Grand Slam final between the game’s top two players assumed an even greater dimension with the presence of Trump.
It was the latest in a series of visits to major sporting events for the US leader after his trip to the NFL’s Super Bowl in February and the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.
 


He appeared before the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, waving to the crowd, which greeted him with a mix of cheers and boos. He was given a frostier reception later in the match though, when shown again on the stadium’s big screens.
A constellation of showbiz and sports icons turned out as well on Sunday, with rock star Bruce Springsteen, fashion icon Tommy Hilfiger, actor Michael Douglas and basketball superstar Stephen Curry all on hand.
 






Start delayed by Trump visit
The start of the final was pushed back 30 minutes to allow fans additional time to enter Arthur Ashe Stadium as a result of tighter security measures in effect due to Trump’s attendance.
Even then, the 23,000-capacity venue was no more than three-quarters full when Alcaraz broke Sinner in the opening game of the match.
As he did in the Wimbledon final, Alcaraz pinned Sinner on the back foot early and broke a second time for a 5-2 lead before serving out to love.
With hundreds of spectators still waiting to get in at the start of the second set, Alcaraz sought to hammer home his advantage against Sinner.
He created a break point but Sinner hung on and stalled Alcaraz’s momentum, belatedly ramping up his game and surging 3-1 ahead as the Spaniard suffered a brief dip on serve.

Sinner levelled the contest at a set apiece but Alcaraz stormed back with another break early in the third, wriggling out of a tight spot on serve with the help of a sensational baseline smash that sliced away from his rival for a 3-0 edge.
He padded his lead with another break and quickly wrapped up the set, keeping his foot down to corner Sinner again to begin the fourth set.
This time Sinner saved two break points but Alcaraz made another charge in the fifth game, delivering the decisive blow for an advantage he never relinquished as the Spaniard became only the fourth man to win multiple majors on hard courts, grass and clay.</p><small>2025-09-08 05:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/080803035703fb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940394/pakistan-to-have-cancer-registry-national-institutes-of-health-bill-signed' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to have cancer registry; National Institutes of Health bill signed</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: In a bid to reform the health sector, President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday appro­ved the National Institutes of Health (Reorganisation) Amendment Bill 2025, which aims to reorganise the institution and also set up a cancer database.
The president also approved the Anti-Dumping Duties Amend­ment Bill 2025 for legal clarity regarding the imposition of anti-dumping duties on projects funded by Chinese grants.
The National Assembly passed the NIH bill on August 12, 2025. “There is a dire need for establishing the national cancer registry to understand the actual burden of disease, and to implement a nati­onal action plan for cancer prevention, and management strategies to control the growing epidemic,” according to the bill.
“Through this bill, the structure and governance of the National Institute of Health will be made more effective. The purpose of the amendment is to ensure the reorganisation of the institution and enhance its performance,” the President Secretariat’s press wing said in a press release. It said that the approval of the bill marked a significant step toward reforms in the health sector and institutional improvement.
The NIH bill said that the centre “shall assure the registration of cancer patients in central repository” to understand the actual burden of disease and to implement a national action plan for its prevention.
It also envisaged management strategies to control the growing epidemic, collect data on the cancer cases and establish a database of the cancer pat­ients.
Through this bill, the government also aimed to encourage awareness at the village and union council level and to work with other governmental and non-governmental agencies whose goal was the eradication of cancer.
It said the center would register the cancer cases under the ‘confirmed cancer cases’, ‘deaths due to cancer’, ‘recoveries from cancer’, ‘hospitalised pendency of cancer’, and cancer demographic information (age, gender, location).
 
 

As per the bill, the personal particulars of a cancer patient would not be disclosed to any unauthorised person without the prior written consent of the patient.
The bill said the cancer cases were rising globally at a remarkable rate. According to the Global Cancer Observatory, the total number of cases in Pakistan was 178,388 in 2020; and these figures were provided by the Punjab Cancer Registry, which represented the population of Lahore and some parts of central Punjab.
“Considering the overall 220 million population, these figures are severe underestimation of the true cancer burden in Pakistan,” the bill added. It said that several atte­mpts at establishing a national cancer registry in the country had failed in the past due to resource limitations.
Anti-dumping duties bill
President Asif Ali Zardari has approved the Anti-Dumping Duties Amendment Bill 2025. “Following his approval, the duties will be effective from July 1, 2020. The bill was sent to the President after (it was) adopted by the National Assembly and (the) Senate,” the President Secretariat’s media wing said.
 
 

It said that the bill was approved to provide legal clarity regarding the imposition of anti-dumping duties on projects, funded by China.
The decision for this amendment was made during the progress review meeting of the Gwadar projects in October 2022.

The force said 857 people had been arrested under anti-terror laws for supporting a proscribed group during Saturday’s demonstration, with an additional 33 arrested for other offences including assaults on police officers.
“We have a duty to enforce the law without fear or favour. If you advertise that you are intending to commit a crime, we have no option but to respond accordingly,” Deputy Assis­tant Commissioner Claire Smart said in a statement.
The government in July proscribed Palestine Action under the UK’s Terrorism Act, 2000, following several acts of vandalism, including against two planes at a Royal Air Force base, which caused an estimated 7 million pounds in damage.
Critics, including the United Nations, have condemned the ban as legal overreach and a threat to free speech, but ministers insist that people are still able to attend pro-Palestinian marches.
“The contrast between this demonstration and the other protests we policed yesterday, including the Palestine Coalition march attended by around 20,000 people, was stark,” Mr Sm­art added. “You can expr­ess your support for a cause without committing an offence under the Ter­rorism Act or descending into violence and disorder, and many thousands of people do that in London every week.”
An estimated 1,500 took part in the Palestine Action protest outside parliament, with the Met condemning the “intolerable” abuse it claims its officers suffered. Of the 33 people arrested for non-terror offences, 17 were for assaults on police officers, the force said.
The organisers of the protest, the campaign group Defend Our Juries, said the “Lift the Ban” rally had been “the picture of peaceful protest.” Many of those detained for showing support for Palestine Action appeared to be older people.
Most face six months in prison if convicted, but orga­nisers of the rallies could be sentenced to up to 14 years if found guilty.

At least 46 people have been killed in strikes on a school, tents and houses across Gaza on Sunday, while a drone launched from Yemen hit an airport in southern Israel forcing suspension of flights for some hours.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the army was “deepening” its assault in and around Gaza City, as it seeks to step up pressure on the Palestinian group Hamas.
Israeli air strikes have flattened two high-rises in Gaza City as troops intensified their operations in the area, aiming to conquer the Palestinian territory’s largest urban centre. “We are deepening the manoeuvre on the outskirts of Gaza City and within Gaza City itself,” Netanyahu told ministers at the start of a cabinet meeting, according to a video shared by his office.

Netanyahu says army ‘deepening’ assault on Gaza City

“We are destroying terrorist infrastructure, we are demolishing identified terror towers,” Netanyahu said.
Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 64,368 people and wounded 162,776 others since October 2023.
The Israeli military has claimed that the two high-rises flattened in the latest strikes were used by Hamas to “monitor” Israeli troops — an accusation denied by the Palestinian group.
The escalation has fuelled fears of a further deterioration in already dire humanitarian conditions for Palestinians living in the area.
Netanyahu said that Israel had “established another humanitarian zone to allow the civilian population in Gaza to move to a safe area”.
Netanyahu said around 100,000 residents had already left Gaza City, accusing Hamas of trying to prevent evacuations and of using civilians as “human shields”.
Mustafa Al-Jamal, who lives in Gaza city, told AFP that he did not plan to leave. He said the area in southern Gaza residents were told to evacuate to has been repeatedly bombed despite being declared “a safe zone”.
“Where can we go? We have no money, no tent, no house, no food.”
Meanwhile, families and supporters of Israeli prisoners take to the streets, demanding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sign a deal to secure the release of their loved ones instead of prolonging the war. Israeli protesters took to the streets to call on their government to reverse the decision to conquer Gaza City, fearing for the fate of prisoners believed to be held there.
“I am mortified by the fact that the Israeli army is conquering Gaza right now,” said Edith, a protester in Jerusalem who declined to give her full name.
Ramon airport hit
Earlier, Israel’s Airports Authority said that a drone launched from Yemen struck the arrivals hall at Ramon Airport near the Red Sea city of Eilat. It said takeoffs and landings at the airport were halted. Hours later, normal operations were restored.
The Israeli military said it was investigating the crash of a drone that was launched from Yemen and fell in the airport’s area. The military said the incident was under review without providing details on the impact.
The airport located near the resort city of Eilat on the border with Jordan and Egypt mostly handles domestic flights.
Israel’s military said it intercepted on Sunday three drones launched from Yemen, whose Houthi rebels have vowed to avenge the killing of their prime minister in an Israeli air strike last month.
“A short while ago, the IAF (Israeli air force) intercepted three UAVs that made their way from Yemen,” the military said in a statement, adding two were downed before entering Israeli airspace. It did not specify what happened to the third.
Israel assassinated the head of the Houthi government together with 11 other senior officials in air strikes two weeks ago. In retaliation, the Yemeni group launched eight ballistic missiles and seven UAVs at Israel, all of which were intercepted or fell on the way, according to Israeli media reports.

“Following the interior minister’s directives, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency has constituted a special inves­tigation team to probe into the matter and submit its report within 14 days,” says an official press rel­ease issued by the Interior Ministry here on Sunday.
It said the team will thoroughly examine the circumstances and those involved in the data leakage will be identified and brought to justice through legal action.
Media reports say that data of all SIM holders, including Interior Minister Naqvi, was sold at Google.
They further said that information regarding mobile location was being sold for Rs500, mobile data record for Rs2,000 and details of foreign trips for Rs5,000.
A couple of months ago, the National Cyber Emer­gency Response Team of Pakistan (PKCERT) iss­ued an advisory warning that the login credentials and passwords of more than 180 million internet users in Pakistan have been stolen in a global data breach, urging people to take immediate protective measures. Media reports said PKCERT had identified the global breach involving a publicly accessible, unencrypted file containing more than 184 million unique account credentials.
“The breach exposed user names, passwords, emails and associated URLs tied to major social media services, as well as government portals, banking institutions, and healthcare platforms worldwide,” the reports said quoting the PKCERT’s advisory.
“The leaked database is believed to have been compiled using infostealer malware — malicious software that extracts sensitive information from compromised systems,” it added.  “This data was stored in plain text and left completely unprotected, without encryption or password safeguarding.”
PKCERT is a federal government entity responsible for protecting Pakistan’s digital assets, sensitive information, and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, and cyber espionage.
It outlined the potential impacts of the data breach, warning that the stolen credentials could be used for account takeovers, identity theft and unauthorised access to government portals or other sensitive sites.
The advisory highlighted that the publicly hosted database was storing credentials stolen from “infected endpoints” without any form of authentication or protection and “included sensitive login information for major platforms, enterprises, government agencies, and financial institutions”.
“Attackers may exploit this breach through credential stuffing across services with reused passwords; phishing attacks using associated emails and historical data; targeted social engineering leveraging exposed personal content; unauthorised acc­ess to business and gove­rnment accounts; and malware deployment using credentials,” the advisory warned.
The advisory also recommended that people change their passwords annually and use a credible online service to find out about potential breaches.
In March 2024, a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) formed to probe a data leak from the National Database and Registr­ation Authority (Nadra), told the interior ministry that the credentials of as many as 2.7 million people had been compromised between 2019 and 2023.

• Judges, bar councils wary of rules approved by circulation instead of deliberations in full court
• Justice Shah sent letter to CJP on the issue
ISLAMABAD: While the full court comprising all Supreme Court judges is scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon, other than the tweaks suggested by Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) to the proposed Supreme Court Rules 2025, no feedback on the matter has been received by the four-member committee that had prepared the draft months ago.
Senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, however, in a recent strong-worded letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had questioned why the historic revision of the 1980 rules was ‘approved by circulation’, rather than after a thorough discussion in the full court.
An informed source said when the draft of the new rules was circulated among the judges for consideration, some senior judges opposed the idea of approving them without a full court meeting, while legal fraternity also expressed reservations about certain provisions.
Subsequently, CJP Yahya Afridi convened a full court meeting on Sept 8 (today) to finalise the rules and reconstituted the four-judge committee under Rule 1(4) of the proposed rules to recommend solutions for any difficulties in implementation.
The same committee comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had earlier prepared a comprehensive draft on March 13 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025 after deliberation and thorough review of the earlier Supreme Court Rules, 1980. However, apart from SCBA, the committee has not received any other suggestions.
The committee had formulated the draft with an aim to enhance transparency, efficiency and overall effectiveness in judicial proceedings. It had invited proposals from judges, office of the Supreme Court, bar councils and associations, keeping in view modern legal requirements and the need for streamlined procedures.
Once the new rules were uploaded on the Supreme Court’s website, various stakeholders, including bar councils and associations raised concerns. Some senior judges were also of the opinion that instead of circulating the draft, the proposals should be discussed in a session of the full court.
The full court, comprising all Supreme Court judges, will meet on Sept 8 (today) at the start of the new judicial year. The meeting will be held on the administrative side in the committee room, not in Courtroom No. 1. Deliberations are expected to begin at 1:00 pm, with the CJP presiding, and will focus solely on written suggestions submitted by SCBA and earlier statements issued by the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC).
It is also expected that a newly-built facility centre in the Supreme Court building will be inaugurated on the occasion of the new judicial year.
On Sept 3, SCBA proposed open inquiries by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) into complaints against superior court judges, arguing that open hearings would not only ensure accountability but also uphold the constitutional guarantees of equality before law under Article 25 and the right to fair trial under Article 10A.
According to SCBA, once a complaint is admitted, the SJC should hold open proceedings subject to safeguards of dignity and decorum and decide references within a fixed time frame, preferably six months.
The key reform proposals include rationalisation of court fees demanding withdrawal of the recent increase to ensure inexpensive justice, as seen in Norway and Germany, where only nominal fees are charged.

Besides CM Khan, members of GB Legislative Assembly Surayya Zaman, Shamsul Haq Lone, Raja Nasir Khan Maqpoon, Raja Azam Khan Amacha, Syed Amjad Zaidi, Mushtaq Ahmad, Haji Shah Baig, Dilshad Bano, Abdul Hameed and Fazal Rahim were given formal termination notices, all containing identical wording.
“This letter serves as formal notice of termination of your membership, effective immediately. This decision has been made in accordance with party’s policy and procedures. The reason for this termination is your actions in the GB Assembly, specifically making a forward bloc and voting against the party decision, which is a clear violation of our party’s policy.
“Your actions have caused harm to the party’s interests and reputation,” stated the letters issued by Additional Secretary General of PTI Firdous Shamim Naqvi.

Party announces complete support for strike in Balochistan against lawlessness

All the 11 lawmakers were directed to “refrain from using party’s [PTI] name, designation and/or membership in any manner or whatsoever, failing which the party reserves to take action against you which may also lead to legal action,” the letters stated.
However, according to a party insider, the issuance of letters may not make any difference to them, as the “whole system” was allegedly backing them.
Also, the PTI issued a show-cause notice to former GB governor Raja Jalal Hussain Maqpoon, according to Dawn.com. The notice, dated Sept 5, said it had come to PTI’s notice that Mr Maqpoon had “conspired against the party and approached party members for defection”.
“In view of these reported activities, you are hereby called to explain yourself in writing within two days of this notice. If your reply is unsatisfactory or you do not respond, further action will be taken as per party policy and rules,” it added.
Backs strike in Balochistan
Meanwhile, acting on the direction of PTI founder Imran Khan, the PTI announced complete support for the wheel-jam and shutter-down strike in Balochistan on Monday against escalating lawlessness, rising terrorism, and the government’s failure to protect citizens.
The call for province-wide strike was given by a six-party opposition alliance comprising Balo­chistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M), Pasht­unkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), Awami National Party (ANP), National Party (NP), and Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen (MWM).
A statement from PTI’s central media department explained that the coalition had announced the joint protest against the recent attack at Shahwani Stadium on BNP-M rally, which claimed several precious lives and left many others injured. It emphasised that the strike was intended not only to mourn the victims of the tragedy but also to expose the government’s abject failure to provide security to its citizens.
The PTI warned that militancy and extremism were witnessing an alarming resurgence in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and other parts of the country due to government’s policies and priorities.
“PTI strongly believes that the people’s voice cannot be suppressed by terrorism, state oppression, or the use of coercive force. Our democratic struggle for peace, justice, and fundamental rights will not only continue but will be pursued with renewed determination and even greater resolve,” it stated.
On the other side, the PTI extended felicitations to the nation on Pakistan Air Force Day. It stated, “September 7 stands as a symbol of the unmatched bravery, sacrifice, and valour demonstrated by the Pakistan Air Force in the defence of our homeland.
On this day, we pay tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives to safeguard the nation’s sovereignty.”

• Authorities order evacuations in downstream cities; seven die

LAHORE: An extremely high flood threatened to engulf Jalal­pur Pirwala, a tehsil of Multan district, as the water level in the Chenab River continued to rise on Sunday, prompting the authorities to evacuate residents from a city with a population of 500,000.
Multan City Police Officer (CPO) Sadiq Ali Dogar told Dawn that low-lying areas of the city had been inundated and could be completely submerged by Sunday night. He, however, assured that evacuations from most areas had been completed. The police official stated that the water was not moving towards Head Panjnad and could submerge the entire city, and the administration had called in helicopters to rescue people from hard-to-reach areas.
A senior official, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that the government attempted to breach a bund to divert the water, but the villagers did not allow them to do so. He claimed that the government was planning to “save the city by diverting the water towards villages but did not succeed”. He said it was not possible to divert the flow since the water had already started entering the city. Residents of Jalalpur also confirmed this version.
In order to aid the administration in relief measures, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority provided three helicopters for aerial rescue — two from the army and one from Askari Civil Aviation. The PDMA director general said a coordinated rescue operation was underway, involving multiple agencies.
 
 

A rescue spokesperson said that 38 additional rescue boats were sent to the most-affected areas of Jalalpur Pirwala. “Another shipment of boats has been dispatched for Jalalpur Pirwala,” the spokesperson said.
Amid rising water levels, the authorities ordered evacuations in the downstream cities. According to the rescue spokesperson, an appeal has been made to the people of Muzaffargarh, Alipur and Jatoi to evacuate immediately.
Seven drown
Meanwhile, five people, including four children, drowned in Jalapur Pirwala after a boat capsized in the Chenab during the evacuation.
“The causes of the boat accident are being carefully examined. Initially, five deaths… have been confirmed,” Multan Deputy Commissioner (DC) Wasim Ham­id Sindhu was quoted as saying in a statement. A statement from the PDMA also put the toll at five. “Rescue operations are being carried out to search for more people who were present on the boat,” Sindhu said.
The initial report from Rescue 1122 explained that while evacuating people from floodwaters in Jalalpur Pirwala, the boat had hit a tree and overturned due to the strong current. It added that mostly the women and children were on board and the water was 15 to 20 feet deep where it had capsized.
According to the rescue authorities, more than 9,000 people had been rescued in the Multan district, while over 350,000 people and more than 300,000 animals had been evacuated in advance.
In another incident, a man drowned while trying to cross the Chenab near Head Panjnad on Saturday evening. His body could not be recovered. A young man in Alipur tehsil drowned as he atte­mpted to reach his submerged house in a catchment area near Head Panjnad.
River flow
As of 10:30pm on Sunday, the Marala Headworks on Chenab reported a steady flow of 89,604 cusecs, while both Khanki (steady) and Qadirabad Headworks (rising) reported flows of 147,294 and 147,039 cusecs.
At the Chiniot bridge, the flow was steady with 91,528 cusecs and Riwaz Bridge was holding steady with 521.60 ft (max value 525 ft). Trimmu Headworks (steady) reported a very high flow of 543,579 cusecs.
Jassar on River Ravi was steady with 48,360 cusecs and Ravi Syphon reported a steady flow of 91,463 cusecs. Sidhnai Headworks was rising with a very high flow of 120,239 cusecs. On the River Sutlej, G.S Wala reported an exceptionally high flow of 319,295 cusecs and Sulemanki Headworks reported 135,832 cusecs. Islam Headworks was steady with 110,028 cusecs, while Punjnad Headworks reported an extremely high flow of 609,664 cusecs. Mailsi had reported flows of 99,811 cusecs and steady.

The practice now covers a wide range of animals, from dogs and cats to turtles, parrots and even goldfish.
Rising demand has invigorated the industry, drawing in new providers and expanding available services. Yet calls for better accessibility remain strong, as many owners still struggle to find nearby facilities to bid farewell to their closest companions.
A study by the KB Financial Research Institute in June found that 64.6pc of Ko­­reans who had lost pets held a funeral — either through a funeral home or a veterinarian — up sharply from 38.7pc in 2023.
The share opting for cremation, which costs at least 150,000 won ($108) and is pricier than veterinary disposal, also rose from 29.5pc to 49.5pc. The surge is partly explained by legal restrictions.
Under Korean law, animal bodies are classified as waste, which makes unauthorised burials illegal. For those who do not choose a funeral, the only legal option is to dispose of the remains in a designated garbage bag, an idea that many pet owners find unthinkable. To some, the emotional relief that funerals provide is a stronger reason.
“Of course, there were no other legal options. But a much bigger reason was that I could be with her sincerely until the very end, even if it meant spending hundreds of thousands of won,” Kim said. “The feeling of ‘this is really our fa­­r­ewell’ gave me a chance to settle my heart.”
Lee Woong-jong, an animal welfare professor at Yonam College, noted that the rise in pet funerals reflects a shift in public perception in Korea, as pets in the past were often treated like “toys.”
“For current Koreans, pets carry deep meaning. Losing them can cause serious emotional distress, sometimes leading to what is known as pet loss syndrome. Funerals help families bring a beautiful closure to their bond with their pets.”

Around a hundred people, mostly women, had gathered for a Holy Quran recital at a community hall in West Java’s Bogor district to commemorate the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) birthday when the building suddenly collapsed, said Adam Hamdani, an official from the local disaster mitigation agency.
“According to initial data, 84 people are being treated, three people died,” Hamdani said. 
He said it was likely the building, which was used as a meeting hall as well as a place of worship, collapsed because it was overcrowded.

“Perhaps the structure was not strong, as people were enthusiastic to follow the event to commemorate the holy prophet’s birthday,” he said.
All the people inside had been accounted for, he said.
Victims were immediately taken to nearby hospitals, with the majority suffering minor injuries.
Hamdani said it was not raining at the time and there did not appear to have been a landslide.
Lax construction standards have raised widespread concerns about building safety in Indonesia.
In 2022, a three-storey minimarket in South Kalimantan collapsed and killed five people. Two people were also injured when a five-storey building in Jakarta partially collapsed two years earlier.
Teenagers rehearsing for a musical show were among seven people killed in Cirebon, east of Jakarta, in 2018 when the building they were in collapsed.
At least 75 people were also injured the same year when a mezzanine floor at Indonesia’s stock exchange building in Jakarta collapsed into the lobby.
