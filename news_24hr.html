However, no casualties were reported.
Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that information about a fire at a textile industry near Nauras Chowrangi was received around 6:15pm.
He said 10 fire tenders of Rescue 1122, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) fire brigade and two snorkels were busy controlling the blaze.

 


“Fire tenders have been called across the metropolis as the fire has been declared a third-degree blaze,” he said.
Khan said the affected factory was a clothes-dyeing unit, adding that chemicals were also stocked there. However, no casualties had been reported so far, he said.
Meanwhile, Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Javed Alam Odho took notice of the incident and directed personnel to immediately reach the spot, cordon it off, and secure the surrounding areas.
The IGP also directed officials to clear a pathway for the fire brigade and rescue teams.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in a post on X, said, “Fire has erupted at a factory in SITE industrial area and is being attended to.”







“No injury or loss of life has been reported so far. Fire and rescue team is present dealing with the situation. Will keep everyone posted,” he said.
Separately, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah directed officials to take emergency steps to control the blaze. He also ordered an inquiry to ascertain the cause of the fire.
According to an official statement, he also issued instructions for a comprehensive audit of all factories in the province.
He said chemical safety protocols should be implemented strictly in industrial units, and action should be taken against those who stocked chemicals without any permission.
He said fire safety and chemical storage should be examined in factories and an inspection drive of all industrial units should be initiated.
“An audit report should be submitted to the CM office immediately,” Murad directed, vowing that no one would be allowed to play with the lives of the people.</p><small>2026-02-26 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26203729fa8fed9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975912/security-forces-kill-10-terrorists-in-balochistans-zhob-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 10 terrorists in Balochistan’s Zhob: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The military’s media affairs wing said on Thursday that 10 terrorists were killed by security forces during an operation in Balochistan’s Zhob.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that after an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Zhob on February 24, in which eight Indian-sponsored terrorists were killed, security forces conducted a comprehensive sanitisation operation on Wednesday to hunt down “hiding khwarij” belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij.
Fitna al Khwarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“During the conduct of the operation, own forces tracked down Khwarij on multiple routes and effectively engaged their locations. After an ensuing fire exchange, ten Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” the statement said.
It added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area,” it said.
The statement added that the security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to act against terrorism at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.
According to state-run APP, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to security forces over the successful operation in Zhob, noting that in line with the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam, security personnel “are achieving major successes against terrorism”.
A statement carried by APP quoted the PM as saying that the entire nation was standing with the army in the fight against terrorism.
“We are determined to eliminate all kinds of terrorism from the country,” he said.







Separately, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said in a post on social media platform X that the successful operation in Zhib by security forces was proof their professional expertise and unwavering resolve against terrorism.
“Azm-i-Istehkam will continue until stability is restored in Balochistan,” he said.

A second Super Eights defeat, where Sri Lanka never threatened to get near their 169 target against New Zealand, ended their hopes of reaching the semi-finals.
It also provoked unprecedented booing from the 35,000-strong crowd in Colombo and calls for heads to roll.
The group win over Australia had hopes high for a run to at least the semi-finals, but it is now a distant memory after Sri Lanka’s batting was exposed time and again on turning pitches.
Sri Lanka head coach Sanath Jayasuriya had already informed the board that he would step down after the World Cup.
Now, captain Dasun Shanaka and the selectors seem likely to follow or be axed after an embarrassing campaign.
“We have one more game in the competition and we will address what went wrong during the World Cup after that game and take the necessary steps,” a Sri Lanka Cricket spokesperson told AFP.
Former captain Marvan Atapattu was scathing about Sri Lanka’s preparations.
“Most teams have moved on with the times playing T20 cricket, but we have stagnated and made little progress, “Atapattu told AFP.
“You need to identify your core players and stick with them,” he said.
“In Sri Lanka’s case, they had no idea what their team was going to be even a week before the tournament,” he added.
“It doesn’t work that way in international sport.”
Sri Lanka lost three front-line bowlers to injury in the first week of the tournament, with fingers being pointed at the amount of lucrative franchise cricket being played.
“When your players are involved in league cricket all over the world, there is a good chance that they break down just before a crucial campaign and that’s what happened to Sri Lanka,” Atapattu added.</p><small>2026-02-26 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26201703616a2f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975914/a-day-after-ordering-a-recount-ecp-again-notifies-ppps-ali-hassan-zehri-as-winner-of-2024-polls-in-hub' target='_blank'><strong>A day after ordering a recount, ECP again notifies PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri as winner of 2024 polls in Hub</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan on Thursday again declared PPP’s Ali Hassan Zehri the winner of Balochistan’s PB-21 (Hub) constituency.
The development comes more than two years after the 2024 general elections and a day after the electoral watchdog ordered a recounting of votes polled in the constituency’s 39 polling stations “as soon as possible but not later than 3 working days positively”.
Subsequently, the ECP said in its notification issued on Thursday: “Pursuant to the order dated February 25, 2026 passed by the ECP […] and as a result of recounting at (39) polling stations conducted by the returning officer, PB-21 Hub, the notification dated December 19 2024, is hereby restored, whereby Ali Hassan Zehri was declared the returned candidate from PB-21 Hub.”
Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court also took up the matter and directed that the operation of the Feb 25 order shall remain suspended until the next date of hearing.
The recounting saga
Originally, Balochistan Awami Party’s (BAP) Muhammad Saleh Bhootani, who had secured more than double the votes obtained by Zehri, was declared the winner in the constituency.
But, a recount at 39 polling stations two months after the Feb 8, 2024 general elections led to Zehri being declared the winner.
While the original count had not even declared him the runner-up, the recount not only got him the top spot but also pushed down Bhootani to the third spot. After the recount, the percentage of polled votes had also changed from 55.15 per cent to 58.48pc.
The significant change in the electoral figures was linked to a saga involving the arrest of five individuals from the strong room where the electoral record had been stored. They were allegedly found with three plastic bags containing fake ballot papers and were attempting to tamper with ballot papers on Feb 11, 2024, hours after the ECP ordered a recount at 39 polling stations for the first time.
Interestingly, the increase in the number of rejected votes exactly matched the decrease in the votes originally secured by BAP’s Bhootani.
The votes secured by Bhootani were reduced from 30,910 to 17,403, translating into a difference of 13,507. The number of rejected votes increased from 3,648 to 17,155, also a rise of 13,507.
Meanwhile, the number of polled votes jumped from 76,976 to 87,483, showing an increase of 10,507 votes. Of these, 9,854 were secured by Zehri originally, taking his total from 14,120 to 23,974.
A further 441 votes were added to the tally of Rajab Ali, the initial runner-up, keeping his position unchanged, while the remaining 212 votes were distributed among other candidates, except Bhootani.
Zehri was subsequently notified as the winner from PB-21 on Dec 19, 2024.
The ECP initially ordered a recount on Feb 11, 2024, but the process was marred by violence, arrests, and allegations of fake ballots. After multiple rounds of litigation, the Supreme Court on Nov 20, 2024, annulled all proceedings and directed the ECP to decide the matter afresh.
Despite this, the electoral watchdog on Dec 16, 2024, in a split 3-2 decision, upheld the recount and notified Zehri as the winner, prompting Bhootani to approach the Balochistan High Court and later the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
Earlier this month, the FCC suspended Zehri’s notification and directed the ECP to re-examine the pending requests for a recount.
In its judgment, the FCC observed: “Recounting is always allowed on the basis of some material establishing illegality and irregularity in the count, and the powers to recount should be exercised sparingly after satisfaction, on the basis of material or evidence, that there has been any inclusion or exclusion of ballot papers in the count.
“The sanctity of the ballot is sacrosanct and, therefore, should not be permitted to be violated on frivolous, vague or indefinite allegations not supported by adequate statements of detailed material facts. It should only be allowed to do full justice between the parties, without a roving inquiry aimed at fishing for material to declare the election void.”
Last week, Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail removed Zehri from the Sarfaraz Bugti-led provincial cabinet with immediate effect. Zehri had earlier submitted his resignation to the chief minister.
IHC issues notices on Bhootani’s plea
As the ECP kept the winner in the PB-21 constituency unchanged on Thursday, the IHC took up a plea filed by Bhootani against the ECP’s February 25 order.
Subsequently, the court noted in its written order that the petitioner had sought a declaration that the ECP’s Feb 25 was “illegal and unlawful”.
The petitioner further sought a direction to the ECP to uphold the election result as incorporated in Form-47 prepared after provisional consolidation, and also sought instructions for the returning officer to prepare Forms-48 and 49 accordingly, the order said.
Form-47 provides a detailed look at the number of votes cast and/or cancelled while Form-48 provides an insight into the number of votes cast for each candidate in a particular constituency. Form-49 is the official result of each constituency and candidate.
The IHC order further said that the petitioner’s counsel contended that the Feb 25 order, prima facie, was “illegal and was passed in clear violation of Section 95(6) of the Elections Act, 2017”.
The counsel argued that it was coram non judice (lacking proper authority) and that there was no reason or material available before the ECP to justify the order for recounting, the IHC noted.
Rather, the lawyer insisted, the ECP’s order was passed merely on the basis of a “hypothetical assumption”.
“Even otherwise, no reasons were recorded, which is mandatory under Section 95(6) of the Elections Act, therefore, the order, being coram non judice, is liable to be set aside,” the IHC order further quoted the lawyer as saying.
The counsel also argued that when the recounting order was issued, the ECP did not issue a proper notice to the petitioner, “and without affording an opportunity of hearing, passed the order in violation of Article 10-A of the Constitution”.
The counsel requested the court to issue notices to the respondents “with the direction to file their report and para-wise comments within fortnight”.
After issuing notices to the respondents, the court decided that the operation of the Feb 25 order shall remain suspended until the next hearing.</p><small>2026-02-26 15:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653112-security-forces-kill-10-india-sponsored-terrorists-in-balochistans-zhob-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 10 India-sponsored terrorists in Balochistan's Zhob: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

What is at stake?
Iran has, over decades, developed an advanced and large-scale uranium enrichment programme. While enriched uranium can be used as fuel in power plants at various purity levels, at high levels it can be used to make nuclear weapons.
Until Israel and the US attacked its nuclear facilities last June, Iran was enriching uranium to up to 60 per cent purity, a short step from the roughly 90pc that is weapons grade.
It had enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for 10 nuclear weapons, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency yardstick, and more at lower levels.
The IAEA, the UN nuclear watchdog, has not, however, been able to verify how much of that uranium stock remains. Iran has yet to declare what happened to it or allow the agency to inspect its bombed nuclear facilities.
Iran’s enrichment plants were destroyed or badly damaged in the attacks, though their exact status, like that of the uranium stock, has yet to be verified.
What do both sides want?
After the June bombings, the two sides expressed incompatible demands: the US said it wanted Iran to give up enrichment, and Iran said it would never do that.
As a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran has the right to enrich uranium as long as it does not use it to produce nuclear weapons, which it says it would never do.
While an agreement might include an initial phase in which Iran suspends enrichment, there are limited options in terms of what any deal might let it do with its enrichment programme:
Enrich elsewhere
In previous rounds of talks, the idea was floated of a regional enrichment consortium, which would involve setting up a joint venture outside Iran with one or more other countries from the Middle East. Tehran has always rejected that as an alternative to enriching on its soil.
Enrich for other purposes
Centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium, can be used for other purposes, such as the production of so-called stable isotopes, which have a range of applications in medicine and scientific research.
The landmark 2015 deal between Iran and major powers, which Trump pulled the US out of in 2018, allowed centrifuges at Iran’s underground Fordow site to be used only for the production of stable isotopes.
One retaliatory step by Iran after Trump’s withdrawal was to start enriching uranium at Fordow, which the US bombed in June.
Enrich to a low level
It becomes exponentially easier to enrich to weapons-grade uranium, the more highly enriched uranium you start with. In terms of effort, once you have enriched to 5pc purity, you are more than halfway to weapons grade.
Keeping Iran at arm’s length from being able to race towards nuclear weapons will involve limiting the purity it can enrich to and how much enriched uranium it can amass.
The 2015 deal let Iran enrich to 3.67pc purity. Diplomats have said only half-jokingly that Trump’s rejection of that deal is so great that 3.67pc is the one enrichment level he will not accept now.
What else needs to be addressed?
Any deal would also have to require thorough accounting for Iran’s stock of enriched uranium. Any doubts about that could trigger a new conflict.
As in 2015, a deal would most likely require the dilution or removal of enriched uranium and limit the number of centrifuges and where they can be used.
Since Iran knows how to enrich with advanced centrifuges, and has an unknown number of those centrifuges stored at unknown locations, the risk of it enriching in secret could hang over any future deal.
That makes verification, most likely by the IAEA, a central issue.</p><small>2026-02-26 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261926154e14297.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975911/one-mans-garbage-is-another-mans-treasure-pakistani-sculptor-turns-scrap-into-colossal-metal-artworks' target='_blank'><strong>One man’s garbage is another man’s treasure — Pakistani sculptor turns scrap into colossal metal artworks</strong></a><br><p>Sparks fly and metal groans in a cavernous workshop on the outskirts of Islamabad, where artist Ehtisham Jadoon fuses discarded car parts into colossal pieces inspired by Transformers movies and dinosaurs.
The 35-year-old sculptor’s studio brims with cogs, chains, hubcaps and engine parts as his hulking creations — a lion with a mane of twisted steel, a giant Tyrannosaurus rex and a towering Optimus Prime — take shape.

“I have always been fascinated by metal objects,” Jadoon told AFP after assembling the 14-foot Transformers character, his biggest creation yet.
“When I see metals in scrap, I imagine forms in which it could be utilised.”
It took Jadoon and his team months of welding and warping to fashion his Optimus Prime, with over 90 per cent of its parts sourced from discarded vehicle pieces.

The arms are forged from motorbike springs and gears, its shoulders are curved from car rims, the spine is moulded from a fuel tank and its knees are pieced together with chains and suspension parts.

Even its piercing eyes are crafted from vehicle bearings, completing a sculpture that is both intricate and awesome.

“Whenever I see an object, I visualise a form,” Jadoon said.
“I could imagine a block transforming into a shape, so I simply solve the puzzle and bring it to life.”

‘Waste becomes valuable’
Jadoon, a former martial artist who once worked in the steel fabrication business, has never formally studied art. He designs his gargantuan models spontaneously while working.
He told AFP he has to visit a doctor almost every week due to sparks affecting his eyes and burns on his hands and arms, yet he insists this is the only work in which he can channel the energy of his training as a fighter.
Jadoon’s work primarily focuses on crafting giants, beasts and powerful forms, which he describes as a reflection of aggression.

“Setting the anatomy and proportions requires visualisation from multiple angles and repeated adjustments,” he said.
Every week, Jadoon tours scrapyards in Islamabad, sifting through tons of discarded metal in search of pieces that fit into his imagination and then become sculptures.

“What is waste to us became something valuable in his hands,” scrapyard owner Bostan Khan told AFP.
“It’s incredible to witness.”</p><small>2026-02-26 14:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261837090a6877b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975910/strikes-in-afghanistan-carried-out-to-ensure-safety-of-pakistani-citizens-prevent-imminent-terrorist-attacks-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Strikes in Afghanistan carried out to ensure safety of Pakistani citizens, prevent imminent terrorist attacks: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday said that Pakistan’s recent strikes against neighbouring Afghanistan were carried out to ensure the “safety of Pakistani citizens” and to prevent “imminent terrorist attacks”.
FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi made the statement while responding to a question during his weekly press briefing.
Pakistan targeted terrorist camps and hideouts overnight in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces of Afghanistan over the weekend, with an official saying that “more than 80” terrorists had been killed in the air strikes. The strikes were the most extensive military engagement between the two neighbours since border clashes broke out in October last year.
During Thursday’s press briefing, the FO spokesperson was asked about civilian casualties in the strikes, the total number of terrorists killed, and the locations of the camps targeted.
In his response, he said, “Let me begin by reiterating that the intelligence-based selective targeting of these seven terrorist camps and their hideouts in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region, was primarily to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani citizens and to prevent imminent terrorist attacks against Pakistan, particularly against our law enforcement officials and our civilians living near the border regions”.
Andrabi stressed that the strikes were “proportional, based on careful planning with necessary due diligence and were directed solely against identified terrorist camps and hideouts”.
“We exercised utmost caution to prevent any harm to civilians,” the spokesperson said.
He recalled statements made by the UN Security Council in reaction to terrorist attacks against Pakistan, with the latest being about the February 6 attack on an imambargah in Islamabad.
The spokesperson maintained that the UNSC had “repeatedly underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, abettors, sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”.
He further added that the UNSC had also urged states to cooperate with Pakistan in the matter, stressing that Pakistan’s actions must be viewed through the above-mentioned context.
He said that Pakistan “remained committed to peace in the region” and called on the Afghan Taliban government to “comply with these obligations”.
However, FO maintained that Pakistan would take “all necessary measures in the exercise of the right to self-defence against terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan”.
Responding to the third part of the question regarding the location of the terrorist camps, the spokesperson recalled the Feb 21 statement issued by the Ministry of Information in the aftermath of the strikes and said he had “nothing to further add in terms of either the location or numbers of terrorists killed”.
During the briefing, the FO spokesperson was also asked about India’s response to the strikes, specifically the statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), wherein it had condemned Pakistan for the move.
The FO spokesperson said that Pakistan “rejected” the statement and maintained that the statement vindicated Pakistan’s stance that “India continues to aid and abet terrorism” in the country through its support for Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other terrorist organisations in the region.
The spokesperson further said that Pakistan held “concrete evidence of India’s involvement in sponsoring and abetting terrorism”.
The spokesperson maintained that the statement issued by the MEA and another issued after the recent spate of attacks in Balochistan, “reinforce this conclusion”.
“These statements provide additional evidence, circumstantial evidence, of India’s complicity in promoting terrorism in Pakistan,” FO said.
He maintained that the message that Pakistan “will respond swiftly, strongly in exercise of our right to self-defence” had been put across “through all international stakeholders”.
He reiterated Pakistan’s demand for action against “terrorist outfits operating with impunity and with freedom from Afghan soil”.
In response to another question, the FO spokesperson also said that he was not aware of “any structured dialogue” between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Asked if Qatar was playing any diplomatic role between the two countries, given the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Doha, the FO spokesperson said: “On the role of Qatar, the issue may have come up in a broader context”.
Referring to PM Shehbaz’s recent meeting with Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, he said that the two leaders exchanged views on regional and national developments, emphasising the importance of dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful resolution of disputes.
“To that extent, of course, we would welcome Qatar’s role in settling all these issues, including Afghanistan,” he said.
Pakistan demands fair trial for perpetrators of Samjhota Express attack
In response to being asked to comment on the 19th anniversary of the Samjhota Express attack, the spokesperson said, “We express our severe disappointment at the Indian government’s callousness towards the plight of families of Pakistani nationals and others, including Indian nationals, I believe, who await justice even after the passage of so many years.”
On February 18, 2007, two crude incendiary bombs exploded inside the security-sealed Samjhota Express train headed from Delhi to Lahore, killing 68 people, including 44 Pakistanis.
Andrabi maintained that the Indian government’s response confirmed its “role as an official and political accomplice in the heinous terrorist attack carried out on its soil against innocent civilians, Pakistanis and others alike”.
FO also condemned the “shameless acquittal and exoneration” of the four perpetrators behind the attack. He expressed concern that the “Hindutva extremism and saffron terror had motivated this inhumane attack 19 years ago, has intensified manifold under the current regime in India”.
On that note, the spokesperson demanded a “fair trial” of the perpetrators, stressing that the “families of innocent Pakistani nationals mercilessly killed at the hands of the Hindutva-motivated extremists deserve justice”.
He further added: “India routinely indulges in anti-Pakistan propaganda, including by exploiting the bogey of terrorism. And in this backdrop, India’s own systemic exoneration of the perpetrators of the Samjhauta terrorist attack is yet another example of Indian duplicity and state sponsorship of terrorism against Pakistan.“

According to a statement issued by the alliance on the social media platform X, the opposition leaders voiced their concerns during TTAP’s central committee meeting, including an Iftar gathering at the residence of TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar in Islamabad.
The gathering was attended by National Assembly Opposition Leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) Sahibzada Hassan, and others.
According to the statement, the TTAP leaders demanded that Imran be provided immediate medical treatment at Shifa International Hospital, be examined by his personal doctors, and that restrictions on his access to his lawyers and meetings with family members be lifted forthwith.
It added that the ex-premier had been unjustly imprisoned and should be released.
In the statement, the TTAP leaders also condemned the “government’s continued illegal secrecy” regarding Imran’s health and medical treatment, and reiterated the demand that he be shifted to Shifa International Hospital for specialised treatment and be examined by his personal physicians, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Aasim Yusuf.
“Opposition leaders expressed grave concern over the continued concealment of Imran’s medical reports and test results from his family, saying that such actions were further increasing doubts and fears about the PTI founder’s health condition,” the statement said.
“The TTAP leaders further warned that criminal negligence regarding the former prime minister’s health could push the country’s political crisis onto an even more dangerous path,” it said.
The statement reiterated that Imran Khan, who had been incarcerated in false cases, must be released, as this was the demand of the majority of the people of Pakistan.
The statement also drew attention to incarcerated SIC Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza, and demanded his release as well the release of other political prisoners, including Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry, Ali Wazir, and Mahrang Baloch.
Meanwhile, the statement also expressed serious concerns over the “alarming increase” in terrorism across the country, deteriorating ties with Afghanistan, the prospects of war in the region, the worsening economy, and growing repression and lawlessness.
Expressing deep concern over the increase in terrorist attacks across the country in recent weeks, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the statement said that the federal government, in collaboration with provincial governments, all political stakeholders, and the public, should formulate a concrete national strategy to address the issue.
The statement further urged the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to “avoid further confrontation and to initiate concrete, sincere, and meaningful negotiations to seriously address the problem of terrorism”.
“They also demanded that contacts be made with neighbouring countries and friendly governments such as Saudi Arabia and Türkiye to find a solution to the crisis that would save Pakistan and the entire region from further bloodshed and sabotage by external and hostile forces,” it added.
During the meeting, TTAP also expressed concern over the worsening economic conditions caused and drew attention to recently released figures showing that poverty in the country had risen to 29pc and unemployment has reached a 21-year high, the statement said.
“Contrary to the government’s claims of major economic agreements, both foreign and domestic investment have declined sharply,” it said.
“The exit of hundreds of major multinational companies from the Pakistani market in recent months was evidence of the country’s deteriorating risk profile,” it said.
The statement said that the government had no concrete plan to deal with the economic crisis.
It added that opposition leaders in the coming months would present an alternative budget and a series of economic and policy proposals with the help of experts, offering concrete solutions to the economic and legal crises facing the country.
The statement also cautioned against threats of a US attack on Iran and termed any such move as a cause of devastation for the region.
“The government should play a diplomatic role to prevent any such American action,” it said. It stated that US and Israel were attempting to encircle Iran and destroy and divide it through military attacks.
“At this moment, Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran is the need of the hour in order to protect Pakistan and the region from the destructive consequences of Zionist aggression.”
The TTAP leaders also condemned the current government’s joining of Donald Trump’s Board of Peace.
“Board of Peace is an attempt by the US to establish a non-representative alternative to the United Nations, and the exclusion of Palestinians from the board exposes the sinister intentions behind the plan … something Pakistan must not be part of under any circumstances,” they said.</p><small>2026-02-26 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653080-opposition-accepts-govts-offer-to-hold-negotiations-amid-deadlock-over-imrans-eye-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition accepts govt's offer to hold negotiations amid deadlock over Imran's eye treatment</strong></a><br><p>

The two countries will also pursue joint development, production, and transfer of technology in defence, Modi said at the end of his two-day trip aimed at strengthening ties with Israel.
Modi said Tel Aviv and New Delhi agreed there was “no place for terrorism in the world”.
“India and Israel are clear that there is no place for terrorism in the world, in any form… We will oppose it shoulder to shoulder. We will always oppose it in the future,” Modi said at a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
“Humanity must never become a victim of conflict,” he added.







Following their meeting, Netanyahu’s office said the “two leaders will sign a series of agreements between Israel and India in economic, security, and diplomatic fields”.
Separately, Modi said he and Israeli President Isaac Herzog held “extremely fruitful and wide-ranging” talks.







In his post on X, which included Hebrew and Hindi translations, Herzog said, “The people of Israel and India are stronger together.”
“Fully agree with you, President Herzog,” Modi replied.
“It was a delight to meet you and discuss diverse aspects of the India-Israel friendship. There is immense scope in futuristic areas such as technology, innovation, startups and more,” he added.







Talks opened in New Delhi on Monday for an India-Israel Free Trade Agreement (FTA), India’s government said in a statement, noting that merchandise trade reached $3.62 billion in 2024-2025.
Modi landed on a two-day visit to Israel on Wednesday, drawing sharp criticism at home.
He addressed the Israeli parliament, where he affirmed that India stands “firmly” with Israel.
While Modi did not explicitly mention the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed in Gaza by Israel’s offensive, he said that India “supports all efforts that contribute to durable peace and regional stability”.
Days ago, Netanyahu listed India, Greece, Cyprus and unnamed Arab, African, and Asian countries as part of a “hexagon of alliances” against “radical axes” of Muslim nations.</p><small>2026-02-26 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26163235b369813.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975874/iran-us-hold-talks-in-geneva-in-push-to-avert-war' target='_blank'><strong>Iran, US hold talks in Geneva in push to avert war</strong></a><br><p>Iran and the United States held talks in Switzerland on Thursday, in a last-ditch bid to avert war under the shadow of the biggest American military build-up in the Middle East in decades.
The Oman-mediated discussions follow repeated threats from Donald Trump to strike Iran, with the US president last Thursday giving Tehran 15 days to reach a deal.
The US and Iranian delegations arrived at the venue at the Omani ambassador’s residence amid tight security, following a protest by Iranian exiles at their talks last week who threw objects at the Iranian motorcade.







Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi confirmed that discussions had begun, saying the two sides expressed “unprecedented openness to new and creative ideas and solutions”.
He later said the talks had been paused but would resume later in the day.







Iran’s president insisted ahead of the talks that the Islamic republic was not “at all” seeking a nuclear weapon.
“Our Supreme Leader has already stated that we will not have nuclear weapons at all,” President Masoud Pezeshkian said, in a reference to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
United Nations nuclear chief Rafael Grossi would likely also attend the discussions in Geneva, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman said.
While Iran has insisted the talks focus solely on its nuclear programme, the US wants Tehran’s missile programme and its alleged support for militant groups in the region curtailed.
As part of the dramatic US build-up, the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, sent to the Mediterranean this week, left a naval base in Crete Thursday, an AFP photographer said.
The developments follow massive protests in Iran that rights groups say saw thousands of demonstrators killed after the movement called for the end of the Islamic republic.
Trump makes case for invasion of Iran
In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump accused Iran of “pursuing sinister nuclear ambitions”, though Tehran has always insisted its programme is for civilian purposes.
Trump also claimed Tehran had “already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas, and they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America”.
The Iranian foreign ministry called these claims “big lies”.







The maximum range of Iran’s missiles is 2,000 kilometres, according to what Tehran has publicly disclosed.
However, the US Congressional Research Service estimates they top out at about 3,000km — less than a third of the distance to the continental United States.
Trump’s State of the Union accusations in Congress were delivered in the same forum in which then-president George W. Bush laid out the case for the invasion of Iraq in 2003.

 

Ahead of Thursday’s talks, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Iran must also negotiate on its missile programme, calling Tehran’s refusal to discuss ballistic weapons “a big, big problem”.
He followed up by saying that the “president wants diplomatic solutions”.
But US Vice President JD Vance told Iran to take Trump’s threats “seriously”, saying the US president had a “right” to use military action.
“You can’t let the craziest and worst regime in the world have nuclear weapons,” Vance told ‘America’s Newsroom’ on Fox News.







‘People would suffer’
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who is leading the Iranian delegation at the talks, had called them “a historic opportunity”, adding that a deal was “within reach”.
The US will be represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka.
The two countries held talks earlier this month in Oman, then gathered for a second round in Geneva last week.
A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.
In January, Tehran launched a crackdown on nationwide protests that have posed one of the greatest challenges to the Islamic republic since its inception.
Protests have since resumed around Iranian universities.
Tehran residents who spoke to AFP were divided as to whether there would be renewed conflict.
“There would be famine and people would suffer a lot. People are suffering now, but at least with war, our fate might be clear,” 60-year-old homemaker Tayebeh said.</p><small>2026-02-26 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261625065dc685c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975899/3-european-countries-pakistan-agree-on-promoting-legal-pathways-to-counter-illegal-migration-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>3 European countries, Pakistan agree on promoting legal pathways to counter illegal migration: Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Three European countries — Italy, Spain and Greece — and Pakistan reached a consensus on Thursday to promote legal pathways to “effectively combat illegal migration”, according to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
The consensus was reached at a four-nation conference in Rome, Naqvi said in a post on social media platform X, adding that ministers from Italy, Spain and Greece attended the meeting.







“Productive meeting in Rome with my counterparts from Italy, Spain and Greece at the four-nation conference on curbing illegal migration.
“Pakistan, Italy, Spain and Greece agreed on a coordinated strategy against illegal migration, human smuggling and narcotics, including a joint policy framework and rapid-response mechanism,” he said.
The interior minister added that a consensus was also reached at the conference on “promoting legal pathways to effectively counter illegal migration [and] repatriation of criminals to face the law”.
“European partners appreciated Pakistan’s strong actions, noting a 47 per cent reduction in illegal migration, and agreed on enhanced European Union-supported capacity building,” he said.
Separately, a statement by the interior ministry also said that the three European countries endorsed Naqvi’s proposal of establishing legal pathways as a strategy to combat illegal migration and human smuggling during the conference.
Italy’s Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, Spain’s Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska and Greece’s Migration Minister Athanasios Plevri agreed that creating regulated legal channels for migration was the “most effective way to dismantle the networks of human smugglers and discourage dangerous irregular journeys”.
Agreeing with Naqvi’s proposal to curb illegal migration through legal pathways, they also decided to “extend full support” to Pakistan for capacity building via the European Union.
The participants also agreed to adopt a “coordinated strategy at all levels to combat illegal migration”, and a joint policy framework was finalised to counter illegal migration, human smuggling and narcotics trafficking.
Moreover, it was agreed that criminals involved in “serious offences” would be repatriated from Europe to Pakistan to face legal proceedings, the interior ministry’s statement said.
The four ministers emphasised the need for strengthening coordination and enhancing a joint and rapid response mechanism to curb illegal migration, the statement said, adding that they also decided to hold the next meeting in Pakistan later this year.
The statement quoted Naqvi as telling the European ministers that mafias involved in illegal migration had been brought under the law.
He noted that Europe was one of the most affected regions by illegal migration and stressed that a coordinated mechanism could effectively address this challenge.
The three European countries also “appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for curbing illegal migration and lauded the 47 per cent reduction” in such cases, the statement said.
It quoted the Italian minister as saying that “Pakistani institutions have taken excellent steps” against illegal migration. Meanwhile, the Spanish minister commended the “exemplary actions taken under Naqvi’s leadership”, the statement said.</p><small>2026-02-26 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261749305005381.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975907/unbeaten-south-africa-thrash-west-indies-in-t20-world-cup-statement-win' target='_blank'><strong>Unbeaten South Africa thrash West Indies in T20 World Cup statement win</strong></a><br><p>South Africa captain Aiden Markram led from the front with an unbeaten 82 as South Africa all but secured a T20 World Cup semi-final berth with a brutal nine-wicket thrashing of the West Indies in Ahmedabad on Thursday.
After the West Indies fought back from deep trouble at 83-7 to post 176-8, Markram and Quinton de Kock put on 95 for the first wicket to set the platform for a thumping victory.
South Africa raced to their target with 23 balls to spare, scoring 177-1. Ryan Rickleton was not out on 45 at the end.
They are the only unbeaten side in the tournament, having also dismantled pre-tournament favourite India by 76 runs in the Super Eights.
An India win against Zimbabwe in Chennai later on Thursday will guarantee South Africa’s progress to the last four.
It will also make India’s clash against the West Indies in Kolkata on Sunday a winner-takes-all decider for the final semi-final berth.
Markram reached fifty off 27 balls and hit four sixes and seven fours.
De Kock scored 47 off 24 balls, with four sixes and Rickleton hit two sixes in his 28-ball knock in an utterly dominant display of batsmanship.
The West Indies has earlier needed a record eighth-wicket partnership by Romario Shepherd and Jason Holder to get to 176-8 afer an early collapse.
The pair came together with their team in deep trouble at 83-7 and put on 89, the highest eighth-wicket stand in the history of T20 internationals.
Shepherd was unbeaten on 52 off 37 balls with four sixes. Holder was run out off the penultimate ball of the innings for 49 off 31 balls with three maximums.
Both teams came into the match with a perfect five wins in the T20 World Cup so far.
South Africa have played four of their five matches in Ahmedabad and captain Aiden Markram had no hesitation in opting to bowl when he won the toss.
The West Indies took 17 off the first over, bowled by left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.
Kagiso Rabada’s introduction halted their charge as captain Shai Hope (16) edged his second ball to keeper Quinton de Kock.
Shimron Hetmyer was dropped at mid-on by Corbin Bosch off the next delivery, but lasted only two more when he miscued to midwicket, where Maharaj snapped up the catch.
Lungi Ngidi got in the act in his first over when Brandon King on 21 edged to De Kock and two balls later Roston Chase chopped on.
From 29-0 after two overs, the West Indies had slumped to 43-4 after four. Ngidi took 3-30 from his four overs, Rabada 2-2 and Bosch 2-31.</p><small>2026-02-26 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/261713431bf863c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975904/breathe-pakistan-partners-with-alertli-to-strengthen-citizen-led-climate-reporting' target='_blank'><strong>Breathe Pakistan partners with Alertli to strengthen citizen-led climate reporting</strong></a><br><p>Breathe Pakistan, a flagship climate change awareness initiative by DawnMedia, has partnered with Alertli, a socially intelligent platform powered by voice and location-based artificial intelligence (AI), to strengthen citizen-led climate reporting and resilience efforts across Pakistan.
According to a press release issued on Thursday, the collaboration will enable citizens to report climate-related incidents in real time, including urban flooding after heavy rainfall, heat-related emergencies, weather-induced road blockages, and climate-linked property damage.
The statement said these reports will contribute to a broader national framework for climate awareness and preparedness “at a time when rising temperatures and increasingly extreme weather events are placing unprecedented strain on urban infrastructure, public health systems, and everyday mobility”.
It added that under the partnership, Alertli will serve as an “official citizen-reporting tool across Breathe Pakistan’s platforms”.
User-submitted reports will be analysed using AI to generate structured, actionable insights, helping surface on-ground realities, identify emerging climate patterns, and strengthen data-driven climate discourse, the statement said.
A spokesperson for Breathe Pakistan said the partnership reflected the initiative’s continued commitment to meaningful public engagement.
“Climate resilience depends on timely information and active participation. By bringing together credible media, technology, and citizen voices, this collaboration helps translate lived experiences into knowledge that can inform awareness, response, and long-term preparedness,” the spokesperson said.
Meanwhile, a representative for Alterli said that critical reporting played a critical role in understanding climate impacts.
“When individuals share what they witness and experience, those realities become data. This initiative transforms everyday observations into actionable insights that can support more informed climate responses,” the representative said.
The statement further said that beyond real-time reporting, the partnership reinforces Breathe Pakistan’s broader mission to drive practical climate solutions.
It went on to say that the partnership complements existing efforts such as carbon footprint tracking tools and national climate change conferences that convene policymakers, experts, businesses, and communities to move from conversation to action.
“Together, Breathe Pakistan and Alertli aim to position Pakistan at the forefront of citizen-powered, AI-supported approaches to climate resilience, demonstrating how media and technology can work in tandem to build a more informed and prepared society,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2026-02-26 12:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26160819e1a8318.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975900/punjab-cm-launches-e-taxi-scheme-says-initiative-part-of-efforts-for-establishing-e-mobility-ecosystem' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM launches e-taxi scheme, says initiative part of efforts for establishing ‘e-mobility ecosystem’</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Thursday launched an e-taxi scheme in the province, saying that the initiative was part of the government’s efforts to establish an “e-mobility ecosystem”.
At a ceremony held for the scheme’s inauguration, the Punjab chief minister announced that around 1,100 e-taxies will be provided under the scheme at a subsidised rate, with a 30 per cent quota reserved for women.
“Punjab has become the first province to launch an e-taxi scheme, the first of its kind, not only for the environment, but it will also open up employment opportunities,” the chief minister said while addressing the ceremony.
“I am happy that over 30 pc of the scheme’s beneficiaries are women,” the chief minister added.

 


CM Maryam maintained that the initiative was a part of the government’s efforts to establish an “e-mobility ecosystem”.
“We have green buses as well — an example for the rest of the country,” she said, outlining plans to expand the service to “all 148 tehsils of Punjab”.
Turning her attention back to the e-taxis, the chief minister said that the government was providing “a subsidy of up to Rs4 billion on these 1,100 cars”.
She further announced that out of the 30pc down payment required, the Punjab government would cover 15pc.
“You can take this car home for Rs690,000 today,” she added, gesturing to the pink and green taxis lined behind her.
CM Maryam also announced that “for women, the government will bear 60pc of the downpayment cost”.
“Within the next 48 hours, you will see these e-taxis on the roads of Lahore and other districts in Punjab,” the chief minister added.
Separately, in a post on X, the Transport and Mass Transit Department of Punjab said, with the newly launched scheme, the government was “marking a major step towards clean mobility, employment generation, and inclusive transport opportunities”.






</p><small>2026-02-26 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26153237838100e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975894/how-job-design-improves-happiness-and-productivity' target='_blank'><strong>How job design improves happiness and productivity</strong></a><br><p>Have you ever come home from work feeling completely drained, even though you didn’t do anything physically exhausting? Surprisingly, this feeling is often less about the amount of work we do and more about the nature of the work and the structure of our jobs.
In today’s world, most people spend nearly a third of their lives at work. Yet many jobs are structured in ways that leave people bored, stressed, or disconnected. It is understandable that jobs needn’t be fun, but they also don’t need to be frustrating.
Even when people choose careers that they are passionate about, many gradually lose that passion and end up leaving the very jobs they once worked day and night for.
This often happens because of how jobs are structured, how tasks are organised, and whether people feel they have control and meaning in their work. All of this affects employee productivity and happiness.
Consider a job in which someone performs the same task every day, such as working in a print shop or performing desk work with minimal interaction. By contrast, consider someone who works in the same office but has the opportunity to handle customers, collaborate with colleagues, and help resolve issues.
Although both roles are in the same office, the second feels more engaging because it offers greater variety and responsibility. The difference lies in the job design.
Job design essentially involves organising duties, responsibilities, and decision-making processes within a workplace. Workplace satisfaction depends on these fundamental aspects, which, when met, enhance a sense of fulfilment at work. Incorporating a variety of daily tasks helps prevent monotony.
Recognising the importance of the work being performed contributes to overall job satisfaction. And finally, the freedom to make decisions rather than being told what to do at every step. This, along with regular feedback, will significantly improve employee productivity and overall well-being.
These simple elements might seem small or even obvious, but if no conscious effort is made to ensure their presence, work quickly becomes draining and irrelevant. When they are present, even demanding jobs begin to feel meaningful and worthwhile. When work engages our minds, it naturally becomes less tiring.
People seldom experience burnout simply from working hard. Instead, burnout occurs when their efforts seem futile or when they have little control over their tasks. Many assume that salary is the biggest factor in job satisfaction.
Of course, fair pay is necessary, but beyond meeting the basic needs, money doesn’t guarantee anything. That’s why many people earning high salaries feel dissatisfied with their lives and work.
Good job design is not just about employee well-being. It is also beneficial for the organisation. When employees feel connected to their work, they put in genuine effort to complete the task rather than merely doing the minimum.
Reflect on the last time you exerted yourself at work or observed a colleague do so. Then, revisit the effort you’re currently putting in to identify any changes. Is it the nature of the job, or is there another reason?
To implement the improvements, organisations need to make minor changes to their processes. They should rotate jobs among employees whenever possible and allow staff to engage in creative work rather than perform repetitive, monotonous tasks. Additionally, they need to avoid micromanaging and trust that their employees will complete the task.
If organisations want to grow, they need to consider how to better treat their employees to unlock their full potential, rather than focusing solely on keeping them in the office for long hours and making them work.
Ultimately, job design is not just a management concept. It is closely tied to mental well-being. Work that allows people to use their abilities, make decisions, and see the impact of their efforts supports both productivity and emotional health.
Here is something to consider. If work often feels exhausting or uninspiring, ask yourself whether the issue lies not in how hard you work, but in how your work is structured. And if you are in a position to influence others’ work, consider how small changes could help people feel more valued and motivated.
Work will always be part of life. The real challenge is ensuring that it supports well-being rather than depleting it.
Perhaps the next step is to initiate conversations in workplaces about designing jobs that not only get work done but also help people feel engaged while doing so.

At the outset of the meeting, Syed Aminul Haque, the committee chairman, noted that there were reports regarding the firewall. Meanwhile, Sadiq Memon called for a briefing on this system and its utility for the nation. He also enquired about the difference between an internet firewall and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s Web Monitoring System (WMS).
Information Technology Secretary Zarar Hashim Khan denied that any such system had been dismantled.
“The PTA’s WMS is fully operational,” Khan said, adding that neither a firewall nor the WMS had caused any delay in internet services.
After the initial briefing by the IT secretary, the floor was given to PTA Chairman Hafeezur Rehman, who clarified that the word firewall was a colloqial term for the WMS, adding that it had been in place in Pakistan since 2006.
“This system has been upgraded four times, with the most recent upgrade carried out in 2023,” he said. The PTA chairman said that like firewalls, the WMS was meant to provide security for digital connectivity in the country.
He informed the committee that the WMS was installed to eradicate grey traffic in telephony, block social media platforms, and illegal websites within the country’s jurisdiction.
“Our digital borders must also be protected,” the PTA chairman said, adding that cyberattacks originating from India were thwarted during periods of heightened tension between the two countries.
“However, social media platforms are blocked on the directives by the government or under court orders,” he asserted.
Rehman further informed the committee that social media platforms had been blocked seven times so far on orders either from the government and or the court.
“But this does not mean that the internet speeds experience a slowdown or anything else happens due to the WMS,” he added.
The committee was told that regulatory mechanisms were in place to safeguard the national cyber infrastructure while ensuring continuity of telecom services, particularly ahead of the upcoming 5G rollout.
The committee was also briefed on preparations regarding the upcoming 5G spectrum scheduled for March 10. It was also told that all three telecom operators in the country — Jazz, Ufone and Zong — had expressed the will to participate.
The PTA chairman said that in the past 12 years, a total of four spectrum auctions had been held and the government had released 69 megahertz (MHz). He said that in the upcoming auction, 597 MHz was being offered and each participant had to obtain a minimum of 100 MHz each.
He added that the availability of more spectrum would not only help introduce 5G in Pakistan but also help improve and increase 4G coverage across the country.
Meanwhile, a senior official of the IT ministry told Dawn that the WMS was not designed to block any particular social media account and referred to the X account of PTI founder Imran Khan, highlighting that it continued to operate while the ex-premier was in prison.
“If the WMS could stop individual accounts, why did the government wait so long and finally approach the X management to block this account?” the official asked.
The development comes amid reports and speculation on social media regarding the government’s decision to shut down the so-called firewall ahead of the 5G spectrum auction.
In August 2024, after months of speculation about the installation of a so-called firewall that could be leading to internet disruptions, the country’s IT minister finally confirmed that the government was indeed upgrading its “web management system” to cope with cybersecurity threats.
Despite the rather ambiguous terminology used by Minister of State for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja, this was the first time an official had acknowledged the government’s actions, which were blamed for everything from slow browsing speeds, the arbitrary blocking of social media platforms and WhatsApp connectivity issues on mobile data.
Up until then, official stakeholders — Khawaja’s ministry and the PTA — had either been feigning ignorance in response to public outcry and media queries, or claiming that the problems were because of telecom and internet service providers, or even Meta.</p><small>2026-02-26 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653066-indias-reaction-to-balochistan-attack-effectively-corroborates-pakistans-stance-fo' target='_blank'><strong>India's reaction to Balochistan attack ‘effectively corroborates' Pakistan's stance: FO</strong></a><br><p>

Dar was received at Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport by Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the OIC Ambassador Fawad Sher, Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Farooq, and Consul General in Jeddah Syed Mustafa Rabbani, FO said.







The meeting is taking place against the backdrop of the Israeli government approving a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the occupation of the territory in 1967.
The move is in violation of international law, which states that an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
At the OIC session, FM Dar would share Pakistan’s perspective on the “latest illegal measures by Israel to convert areas of the Occupied West Bank into so-called ‘state land’”, FO said.

 

He would also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states on the sidelines of the ministerial meeting, the FO statement said, adding that he would “undertake brief visits to the Holy Cities” as well.
The OIC — along with Pakistan, the Arab League and 20 other Muslim and European countries — have jointly condemned Israeli attempts aimed at the “unacceptable de facto annexation” of Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank.
Last week, 93 states — including the eight-nation Muslim bloc — and the European Union (EU) also slammed Tel Aviv’s move. They called for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of West Bank.</p><small>2026-02-26 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26153233146c00a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975895/street-smart-new-zealand-can-topple-england-to-make-t20-world-cup-semis-coach' target='_blank'><strong>‘Street smart’ New Zealand can topple England to make T20 World Cup semis: coach</strong></a><br><p>New Zealand’s “street-smart” cricketers can find a way to beat England and guarantee their semi-final place at the T20 World Cup, coach Rob Walters said on Thursday.
A win for New Zealand in Friday’s Super Eights clash in Colombo will see them top Group 2 and join the already-qualified England in the final four.
A defeat would leave the door ajar for Pakistan to beat eliminated Sri Lanka on Saturday with the second semi-final berth then being decided on net run rate.

 

Mitchell Santner’s New Zealand were in trouble at 84-6 against Sri Lanka on Wednesday before the captain steered them to 168-7 and a thumping 61-run win which knocked out the co-hosts.
“I think if you look historically at the Black Caps, you would probably say that they’re a team that have been great problem solvers,” Walters told reporters.
“They are street smart; they find a way to understand the conditions quickly.
“It’s certainly something that we pride ourselves on. We can adapt to conditions quickly and find a method.”
England are the only team to secure a place in the semi-finals so far after skipper Harry Brook’s match-winning century against Pakistan.
New Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra is aware of England’s threat.
“You’re always confident going into these fixtures, especially when we know what the surface is going to be like,” said Ravindra, who took four wickets against Sri Lanka.
“But I think it’d be silly to underestimate England at any point,” he said.
“They’re obviously such a quality unit and they’ve shown this in how well they’ve been bowling. They’ve got world-class batters throughout their order.”</p><small>2026-02-26 10:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26134225f44c769.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975889/ihc-to-hear-imran-bushras-pleas-for-sentence-suspensions-in-ps190m-graft-case-on-march-11' target='_blank'><strong>IHC to hear Imran, Bushra’s pleas for sentence suspensions in £190m graft case on March 11</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) is set to hear former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi’s petitions seeking the suspension of their sentences in the £190 million corruption case on March 11.
A division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan resumed the case proceedings on Thursday.
During the hearing, the bench expressed displeasure as dozens of lawyers affiliated with PTI stood up and approached the rostrum simultaneously.
“What is this? Are you trying to influence the court?” the IHC chief justice asked.
Imran’s counsel, Barrister Salman Sardar, replied: “Not at all.”
He argued that the matter had assumed greater urgency in view of the former premier’s sudden eye ailment. He further submitted that Bushra Bibi, despite being a woman, was serving a seven-year sentence and that her petition for suspension of sentence had been fixed after six months.
“We request you to suspend the sentence. The last order was passed on November 9,” he contended.
Justice Dogar observed that most of the miscellaneous civil applications seeking early hearing had turned infructuous, but ordered that the office objections on the suspension petitions be overruled.
Barrister Sardar then requested the court to fix the petitions for hearing next week.
However, the chief justice directed the registrar’s office to fix both the petitions seeking suspension and the main criminal appeals on March 11 and adjourned the proceedings.
Separately, in a related development, IHC’s Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro removed office objections on the petitions seeking suspension of Imran and Bushra’s sentences in the Toshakhana 2.0 case.
The judge directed the registrar’s office to number the petitions as well as the appeals against the convictions of Imran and Bushra Bibi and fix them for hearing in accordance with court policy.
An Islamabad special court on Dec 20, 2025 sentenced the couple to a total of 17 years in the case, which pertained to the purchase of a Bulgari jewellery set — gifted to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021 — at a throwaway price.
‘Delay’ in case proceedings
Imran — imprisoned since Aug 5, 2023 for concealing details of Toshakhana gifts — is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in the £190m case.
He was convicted in another Toshakhana case in December 2025 and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
On his behalf, Imran’s legal team has repeatedly approached the IHC for early fixation and decisions on the multiple cases pending before the court.
A day earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum had criticised the delay in the proceedings in cases pertaining to the PTI founder. “We come and sit in court for hours, but cases are not fixed,” she had said.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also pointed out that contempt petitions filed against the Adiala jail administration over non-compliance with IHC orders allowing jail meetings were not heard.
He said the IHC had become a “closed door” for the party.

 

Also on Wednesday, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan lamented that the pleas regarding the suspension of sentence in the £190m Al-Qadir Trust case had been pending for over a year, even though such cases “should be decided within 35 and 60 days as per the Judicial Policy”.
In January, Imran’s counsel wrote to Justice Dogar, seeking consolidation of all cases pending against the ex-premier before the high court and requesting urgent hearings.
The letter had contended that repeated adjournments or delayed fixation had caused serious prejudice to Imran.
The PTI has also moved the Supreme Court, seeking the early fixing of the concealment of assets case and Imran’s treatment at a hospital of his choice.
The £190m corruption case
An accountability court in Islamabad had sentenced Imran and Bushra to 14 and seven years in prison, respectively, on Jan 17, 2025 in the £190m graft case, also known as the Al-Qadir Trust case.
Both had challenged their convictions before the IHC on January 27 that year.

 

The case alleges that the couple obtained billions of rupees and land worth hundreds of kanals from Bahria Town Ltd to legalise Rs50 billion identified and returned to the country by the United Kingdom during the PTI government.</p><small>2026-02-26 10:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653026-190m-case-ihc-fixes-imran-khan-bushra-bibis-pleas-for-hearing-on-march-11' target='_blank'><strong>£190m case: IHC fixes Imran, Bushra's pleas for suspension of sentences on March 11</strong></a><br><p>

The advance placed the index 2.59 per cent above its previous close of 164,626.29 points.
During trading, a total of 291 scrips advanced, 145 declined, and 131 remained unchanged from their previous close. A total of 355,320,144 shares were traded by market close.
The index touched an intraday low of 162,953.63 and a high of 169,374.27. The range reflected the elevated volatility that has persisted from earlier in the week into today’s trading.
According to Topline Securities, “as the session progressed, the tone changed”. The brokerage house noted that selling pressure eased, and buyers returned with renewed confidence, turning a tentative recovery into a broad-based rally.
The strong close suggested some improvement in investor sentiment. On Wednesday, the index had also staged an early rebound, but ultimately closed in the red, shedding 1,632.25 points, suggesting continued fragility.

Peers across party lines pressed the Labour government to intensify diplomatic engagement with Islamabad and consider linking aid and trade to human rights benchmarks.
The issue was raised during oral questions led by Labour peer Baroness Alexander of Cleveden, who asked about discussions with the government of Pakistan regarding Imran’s incarceration.
Responding on behalf of the Foreign Office, Minister of State Baroness Chapman of Darlington reiterated that while Pakistan’s judicial processes are a matter for its own authorities, the UK had consistently raised concerns over fundamental rights.
“While Pakistan’s judicial processes are, of course, a matter for Pakistan, we are clear that the Pakistani authorities need to respect fundamental freedoms, including the right to a fair trial, due process, humane detention and access to appropriate medical treatment,” she said.
“This applies to Imran Khan as it does to all Pakistani citizens.”







The minister added that UK ministers and officials had “regularly raised” with their Pakistani counterparts the need to uphold Pakistan’s constitution and international human rights obligations, including in relation to Imran.
Family access and medical concerns
Several peers highlighted reports that Imran had been denied access to lawyers, family members and doctors, and was being held in solitary confinement.
Conservative peer Zac Goldsmith — also the former brother-in-law of Imran — described the situation as “an international outrage”, later writing on X that peers had urged the UK foreign minister to “step up”.
During the debate, he said: “We understand that Imran Khan has been denied access to lawyers, denied access to his family, including his two sons, denied access to doctors, and that he has been kept in solitary confinement, with his health deteriorating rapidly.”







Goldsmith asked whether the UK should reconsider its aid contribution to Pakistan, noting that it has often been among the top recipients of British assistance. He suggested that aid should be contingent on Islamabad demonstrating a clear commitment to the Commonwealth Charter, including judicial independence and the rule of law.
In response, Baroness Chapman said the UK maintained a consistent position that all prisoners should have access to healthcare and family visits, and that this message would continue to be conveyed to Islamabad.
On development spending, she noted that the UK had already reduced its aid budget by 40 per cent and that further announcements regarding country allocations would follow shortly.
Comparisons with other cases
The debate also touched on comparisons with other high-profile cases.
The minister drew a distinction between the case of jailed Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai and Imran, noting that Lai is a British citizen, giving the UK specific consular responsibilities that do not apply in the same way to foreign nationals.
Labour peer Lord Sikka said there was “very soft criticism” when authoritarian acts were committed by countries regarded as Britain’s trade and defence partners.
Arguing that the government possessed the tools to exert pressure on the country’s military leadership, he suggested ending aid and imposing trade sanctions. He asked what moral principle guided UK foreign policy in such cases, compared to its approach towards states such as China, Iran, Russia and North Korea.
In response, Baroness Chapman said it would not be right to end all aid to Pakistan, stressing that such a move was not the government’s position.
She said British assistance addressed genuine need and supported UK interests, including cooperation on climate issues and counter-terrorism, which she described as “absolutely in the interest of our country”.
Crossbench peer Lord Shaffaq Mohammed referred to the case of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who was allowed to travel to London for medical treatment in 2019 while serving a sentence in Pakistan.

 

He asked what the government’s response would be if Imran sought permission to travel to the UK for medical care. Baroness Chapman replied that any such request would fall under the jurisdiction of the Home Office and immigration authorities.
Conservative peer Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon asked whether the government could facilitate access for Imran’s sons to visit their father during medical treatment.
The minister said that, in principle, prisoners undergoing medical treatment should have access to family, but decisions relating to immigration and prison access ultimately rested with Pakistani authorities.
Military courts and trade ties
Concerns about Pakistan’s wider democratic trajectory and the role of the military also featured prominently.
Liberal Democrat peer Lord Purvis of Tweed said that several opposition figures had been prosecuted and sentenced following protests, and warned of “significant worry about the extent of state capture of the Pakistani economy by the military”.
He asked whether human rights would be explicitly integrated into the UK-Pakistan trade dialogue.
Baroness Chapman acknowledged “very real concerns” about the operation and transparency of military courts, and said that human rights were integral to the UK’s trading relationships.

 

“It would not be the right thing to do to end all aid to Pakistan,” she said.
“The need is there, British interests are there, and we work with Pakistan on counter-terrorism, which is absolutely in the interest of our country.”



Democracy and elections
The debate concluded with broader reflections on Pakistan’s political future.
Conservative peer Lord Hannan of Kingsclere said no British government could be indifferent to developments in Pakistan, describing it as a Commonwealth ally with 1.5 million Britons of Pakistani origin.
He argued that Pakistan would struggle to achieve stability and attract investment without the restoration of democratic norms.



Baroness Chapman said the UK had raised concerns about Pakistan’s 2024 elections and would continue to engage with Islamabad on inclusive politics and rule of law, while maintaining trade and development ties.
“There are many countries where we have concerns about rule of law and democracy and yet maintain close relationships,” she said, adding that Britain does not limit its foreign relations only to countries that mirror its own governance model.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/26131334cb524eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975888/japan-births-fall-for-10th-straight-year' target='_blank'><strong>Japan births fall for 10th straight year</strong></a><br><p>The number of births in Japan fell for the 10th straight year in 2025, official data showed on Thursday, highlighting the challenges for Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi.
A total of 705,809 babies were born in Japan, the preliminary health ministry data showed, down 2.1 per cent from 2024.
The data includes births to Japanese nationals in Japan, foreign births in Japan and babies born to Japanese nationals overseas.
Meanwhile, 505,656 couples got married in 2025, up 1.1pc, while the number of divorces fell 3.7pc to 182,969 cases.
There were 1,605,654 deaths, down 13,030 or 0.8pc from 2024.
The internal affairs ministry estimated Japan’s overall population as of February at 122.86 million people, down 0.47pc, or 580,000, from a year ago.

 

The world’s fourth-biggest economy has one of the world’s lowest birth rates and a falling and ageing population.
This is leading to a host of problems, including labour shortages, a ballooning social security bill and fewer working people paying tax.
That in turn is adding to Japan’s huge debts. It already has the highest debt ratio among major economies.
Figures last year showed that the number of people aged 100 or older was almost 100,000, with close to 90pc of them women.
The shrinking population is also gutting rural communities. The number of abandoned homes in Japan is now around four million.
Over 40pc of municipalities risk extinction, according to a recent study.
Successive Japanese leaders — including Takaichi, the country’s first woman premier — have promised to increase births but with limited success.
Tokyo’s city government developed its own dating app which requires users to submit documentation proving they are single and to sign a letter stating they are willing to get married.
“The declining birth rate and shrinking population are a quiet state of emergency that will gradually erode our country’s vitality,” Takaichi said in parliament last week.
Takaichi’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won a two-thirds majority in February 8 snap elections.
Increasing immigration would help reverse Japan’s falling population and the associated problems in the labour market.
But under pressure from the “Japanese first” Sanseito party, the right-wing Takaichi has vowed tougher measures on immigration.
The government said on Thursday it is striving to build a stronger economy to reduce the economic burden of childcare for working families.
“I believe there were some successes. Unfortunately, however, we have not managed to reverse this trend (of falling births),” Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Masanao Ozaki told reporters.
“I believe (an important factor) is to achieve a strong economy,” Ozaki said.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/260947020dc3392.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975857/local-administration-imposes-section-144-12-hour-daily-curfew-in-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Local administration imposes Section 144, 12-hour daily curfew in South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>The district administration on Thursday imposed Section 144 in the districts of Upper South Waziristan and Lower South Waziristan due to rising security concerns and to facilitate the movement of logistics for security forces.
Officials said the move aims to ensure public safety, maintain law and order, and facilitate the uninterrupted operational movement of security personnel.
Upper South Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Asmatullah Wazir confirmed that Section 144 has been enforced in the tehsils of Sarvekai and Sararogha from 6am to 6pm. During this period, all movement will be strictly prohibited, and all markets and commercial centres will remain closed.
The affected routes include Makin, Sararogha, Kot Kai and Spinkai Raghzai up to Nazar Khel. Additionally, the route from Dargai Bridge through Madi Jan, Sheen Warsak and Moley Khan Sarai to Chagmalai will also remain closed.
Officials said in the statement that residents have been instructed to stop their vehicles at least 50 metres before approaching security forces and to ensure that all passengers exit the vehicle if required. The DC emphasised that violators will be held personally accountable and that strict compliance with security directives is mandatory.
Meanwhile, Lower South Waziristan DC Musarat Zaman announced that Section 144 has also been enforced in various parts of Wana. The curfew, effective from 6am to 6pm, prohibits all non-essential movement. The measure comes in response to security threats and the movement of security forces.
Officials said that restricted routes include Wana, Tiarza Gate, Karb Kot, Tanai, and Azizabad Chowk up to Dargai Bridge. Movement is only allowed for emergency purposes with prior permission from police or security forces and submission of valid identification and travel documents.
The deputy commissioner urged citizens to strictly adhere to security instructions and avoid non-essential travel. Any violation will be the sole responsibility of the individual concerned, he said.
During the enforcement of Section 144 in both districts, only approved emergency movement will be permitted.
Citizens were advised to cooperate fully with security forces, remain patient, and avoid any activities that may compromise public safety. Markets, shops, and commercial centres will remain closed to maintain law and order.
Officials stressed that these measures were essential to maintain sustainable peace, support security operations, and ensure the safety of residents.
The South Waziristan region has seen a deteriorating security situation in the past few months, alongside a spike in terrorist activities across the province.
Earlier this month, Mehsud tribal elders and jirga members called on the Upper South Waziristan DC to highlight the lack of basic facilities and raise law and order concerns.
On Nov 10, 2025, the Cadet College in Lower South Waziristan’s Wana had come under attack by terrorists, who the government identified as Afghan nationals.
The attackers had targeted the college’s main gate and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy.
While all students and teachers were safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed, the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653001-fcc-upholds-tax-officials-power-to-raid-premises-without-prior-notice' target='_blank'><strong>FCC upholds tax officials' power to raid premises without prior notice</strong></a><br><p>

Eyewitnesses reported that 10–12 armed men entered the mosque, held worshippers hostage, and abducted three brothers before fleeing to an unknown location.
The abducted individuals were identified as Saeed Akhtar, a clerk at the commissioner’s office, and Amjad and Hazratullah serving in the Wazir subdivision’s police force.
Police officials confirmed that the two abducted police personnel were later brutally killed and their bodies were dumped along Marwat Canal Road, while the third brother remains missing.
Local Chairman Masoom Wazir said he received information about two bodies and, upon reaching the site, found both victims covered in blood. The bodies were immediately taken to the District Headquarters Hospital.
RPO Bannu Sajjad Khan stated that the kidnappers were affiliated with a militant group and that a full-scale operation is underway against them. He vowed that the martyrs’ blood would not be in vain and that the perpetrators would be brought to justice at all costs.
He strongly condemned the terrorists for violating the sanctity of a mosque, describing it as a deeply tragic and reprehensible act.
The RPO added that terrorist elements have previously used mosques as hideouts, but police continue to carry out operations against such groups to ensure the protection of places of worship and the lives and property of citizens.
The senior police official stated that police and other security agencies are jointly conducting search operations at various locations to recover the third abducted individual. He urged the public to report any suspicious activity to law enforcement authorities immediately.
Funeral prayers offered for martyred policemen
Funeral prayers for the two martyred police personnel were offered with full state honours at the Police Lines in Bannu today, bringing the community together in grief and solidarity.
Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan, Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Faheem Khan, senior police and civil administration officials, along with a large number of police personnel and local residents, attended the funeral.

A guard of honour was presented to the martyrs on the occasion, while special prayers were also offered for the elevation of their ranks in honour of their sacrifice. Prayers were further offered for the safe and early recovery of their abducted brother, who remains missing.
Earlier on February 21, during an intelligence‑based operation in the district, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack, prompting targeted operations.</p><small>2026-02-26 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2612242250128c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975884/karachi-atc-frames-charges-against-armaghan-co-accused-sheraz-in-mustafa-amir-murder-case' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi ATC frames charges against Armaghan, co-accused Sheraz in Mustafa Amir murder case</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Thursday framed charges against main suspect Armaghan Qureshi and co-accused Sheraz alias Shavez Bukhari in the Mustafa Amir murder case.
Amir, 23, was allegedly kidnapped and murdered by his friends — Armaghan and Sheraz — in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Jan 6, 2025. According to the police, the accused stuffed Amir’s body in the trunk of his car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
Both accused denied the charges before the court, which also summoned witnesses and adjourned the hearing until March 12.
A final charge sheet against Armaghan in the murder case was filed in August 2025.

 

In the document, Investigating Officer (IO) Muhammad Ali had said that the last known location of the victim and the two suspects was Armaghan’s house in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The IO stated that blood collected from Armaghan’s house allegedly matched samples taken from the body recovered from the car in Hub.
The report claimed that CCTV footage had been recovered showing the individuals cleaning Mustafa’s bloodstains from a carpet.
In the wake of the murder, three junior police officers, including the Darakhshan station house officer (SHO), were suspended and demoted to lower ranks over their “unprofessional conduct” while probing the kidnapping and murder case.
However, then-Sindh inspector general Ghulam Nabi Memon had defended senior police officials responsible for the investigation, saying they did face certain “handicaps” due to a host of factors during the initial probe.
Last month, a Karachi judicial magistrate granted Armaghan post-arrest bail in a case involving an illegal call centre and credit card data theft.
Other cases
Besides the murder case, Armaghan is facing several other charges.
Armaghan had been implicated in a data theft case in a first information report (FIR) registered with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on April 16, 2025.

 

The case accused Armaghan of operating an “illegal call centre” in Karachi’s DHA, which was used for harassment, fraudulent activities, identity impersonation, cheating, spoofing, phishing, and extortion.
In July 2025, the IO of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) informed a judicial magistrate that Armaghan had rented two properties to set up call centres in Lahore and Islamabad after Amir’s murder.
Cases had previously been filed against him for injuring policemen during a February 2025 shoot-out that led to his arrest, as well as for the recovery of imported illegal weapons and money laundering.</p><small>2026-02-26 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699f69e4a5b0f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975757/several-coaches-locomotive-of-greenline-express-derail-in-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Several coaches, locomotive of Greenline Express derail in Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: Several coaches and the locomotive of the empty rake of the Greenline Express train derailed a kilometre away from Rawalpindi Railway Station on Wednesday, apparently due to the poor condition of the track as described by railway officials.

Except for the locomotive and two passenger coaches, the remaining coaches were put back on track and moved swiftly to Rawalpindi Railway Station from where Greenline Express departed for Karachi with a delay of half an hour.
The waiting passengers at the Margalla Railway Station were moved to Rawalpindi station by buses and coaches by the railway administration of Rawalpindi, for onward journey.
Divisional Superintendent of Pakistan Railways Nooruddin told Dawn that the cause of the derailment was apparently ‘weak track’ on this particular point located close to Bakery Chowk. The weak track of the mainline has raised concern over the poor maintenance of track being used for train and freight services.

The divisional superintendent further said the train service from Peshawar and Hazara to Rawalpindi remained unaffected in view of the dual track. Arrangements have been made to put the locomotive and two coaches back on track, he added.
Greenline Express is among the trains operating in the luxurious category in the Pakistan Railways system.It is a flagship rail of Pakistan Railways and is considered as the country’s most premium train service between Islamabad and Karachi operating on daily basis, offering luxury travel.
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Railways, at a meeting on Wednesday, expressed serious concern over the frequent train accidents reported during the past year.
Committee Chairman Senator Shahadat Awan observed that disciplinary action had largely been confined to train drivers, while no senior officers had been held accountable. He directed the railways ministry to ensure that all responsible officials are proceeded against in accordance with law.
Highlighting security gaps at railway stations and onboard trains, the chairman emphasised the need for comprehensive security arrangements in view of the upcoming festival of Eidul Fitr. The committee also sought an update on new recruitments aimed at strengthening the railway security wing. The chairman directed the DIG Railways to provide periodic briefings to the committee on theft cases and related preventive measures.
Taking note of concerns raised by Senator Rubina Khalid regarding inadequate train services in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the chairman directed the ministry to brief the committee in forthcoming meetings on consultations held with the provinces regarding the upgradation and expansion of the railway network. The ministry briefed the committee on budgetary allocations for new development schemes and apprised members of the projects completed by the ministry.
The committee was informed that the Main Line-1 (ML-1) project extended from Karachi to Peshawar, covering a total length of 1,726km.
Officials stated that approximately 70pc of the country’s population travelled through the ML-1 corridor. It was further informed that the track from Karachi to Lahore is double track, whereas the section from Lahore to Peshawar is single track. The committee was also informed that recent floods have caused significant damage to the railway infrastructure.
Senator Shahadat Awan directed the railways ministry to expedite the disposal of all pending matters of departmental committees on a priority basis and to submit a comprehensive report detailing disposed and pending audit paras.
He further instructed the ministry to furnish, within one month, a complete list of cases related to the National Accountability Bureau and the Federal Investigation Agency. The committee also sought details within three months regarding progress made in the vacation of encroached railway land.

Fortunately, no casualties were reported.
The incident occurred in the Miami Kabul Khel Dorazinda area of the Shewa tehsil. Government High School Shamazan Kot sustained extensive damage, with nearly 80 per cent of its structure reportedly reduced to rubble.
According to local sources, a powerful explosion was heard across the surrounding villages, triggering panic and fear among residents. However, the blast took place at night while the school was closed, ensuring that students and staff remained unharmed.
A senior district administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that an investigation has been launched to determine the exact nature and cause of the explosion. Authorities are collecting evidence from the site to ascertain whether it was a drone strike or another form of attack.
District police and security personnel have cordoned off the area and initiated a search operation. In an official statement, authorities said security around educational institutions would be further tightened, and emergency measures would be taken to rehabilitate and reconstruct the damaged school building.
Local residents expressed deep concern over the incident, particularly as schools across the region were due to reopen on March 1. Parents and students fear the attack may disrupt the fragile return to normalcy in the conflict-affected district.
“Education here is already struggling. If schools themselves are targeted, what future will our children have?” said an elderly tribal elder while speaking to this correspondent.
A parent of one of the students told Dawn that the government must not only ensure the immediate reconstruction of the school, but also establish lasting peace in the area so that children can pursue their education without fear.

 

Educational institutions in North Waziristan and adjoining tribal districts have previously been targeted in various incidents. In some cases, militant elements have blown up school buildings using explosive materials, while in others, structures have reportedly sustained damage during security operations.
Only a few weeks ago, another alleged drone strike in the same area left students and a teacher injured. Investigations into that incident are still underway.
While attacks targeting infrastructure are fairly common in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has also seen a rise in such incidents in recent months.
In May 2024, a private girls’ school in Shewa was also blown up by unidentified militants. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up. No loss of life was reported in the incidents.</p><small>2026-02-26 07:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652979-jailed-pti-leaders-urge-cjp-to-ensure-justice-is-done-in-imran-khans-medical-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>Jailed PTI leaders urge CJP to ensure 'justice is done' in Imran Khan's medical treatment</strong></a><br><p>

Gerald Brown, 65, was arrested in Indiana after having recently returned to the United States from China, where he had been since December 2023, a Justice Department statement said.
He is accused of having “conspired with foreign nationals to provide combat aircraft training to pilots in the Chinese Air Force” without a required license from the US State Department, the statement said.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director Kash Patel posted on X: “Major story… the FBI and our partners have arrested a former US Air Force Pilot who was allegedly training pilots in the Chinese military.”







Brown had a 24-year career in the US Air Force during which he “commanded sensitive units with responsibility for nuclear weapons delivery systems, led combat missions, and served as a fighter pilot instructor and simulator instructor on a variety of fighter and attack aircraft”.
He had retired from the military in 1996 and worked as a cargo pilot, the statement said, but he later began a role as a US defence contractor training pilots to fly the A-10 and state-of-the-art F-35 fighter jets.
He allegedly began negotiating a contract in August 2023 with Stephen Su Bin — a Chinese national who was imprisoned in the United States for four years beginning in 2016 over another espionage scheme — and travelled in December 2023 to China to begin his training job.
“The Chinese government continues to exploit the expertise of current and former members of the US armed forces to modernise China’s military capabilities,” said Roman Rozhavsky, an official with the FBI’s Counterintelligence and Espionage Division.
“This arrest serves as a warning that the FBI and our partners will stop at nothing to hold accountable anyone who collaborates with our adversaries to harm our service members and jeopardise our national security,” he added.</p><small>2026-02-26 05:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652964-rising-gas-bills-experts-ask-pm-to-end-monopoly' target='_blank'><strong>Rising gas bills: Experts ask PM to end monopoly</strong></a><br><p>
