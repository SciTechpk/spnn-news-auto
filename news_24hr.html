The fire, which erupted on Saturday night at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road, had been brought under control by about 70 per cent by late afternoon, officials said.
Speaking to the media at around 7pm, CM Murad said, “I say with utmost grief that so far, it is confirmed that six people have lost their lives, including KMC firefighter Furqan.”
He added that 22 others were hurt and had now been discharged from hospitals as they had faced minor injuries.
“But what is very concerning […] is that around 58 people — some people even say more than 60 — are missing. May God give them more life.”
According to a list shared with Dawn around the same time, the South district office had received reports of 53 missing people from their families so far.
The Sindh government has established a helpline to report anyone missing due to the fire or to direct their queries, which can be contacted at 0313-5048048, 021-99206372 and 021-99205625.
A separate statement by the South Zone police also listed the following helpline contact numbers: 021-99205670, 021-99201196 and 021-99205691.



Hundreds of people had gathered around the building today, including distraught store owners whose businesses had turned to ash.
During his media talk, CM Murad noted that the mall was a three-storey building with a basement and housed more than 1,000 shops.
While the chief minister noted that the cause of the fire could not be ascertained for sure at this stage, he said a short circuit was being blamed for igniting the blaze in a shop with flammable material.
Terming it a “very upsetting” incident, he stressed that authorities were making efforts to find missing people.
The Sindh CM detailed that around 26 fire tenders, 10 bowsers and multiple snorkels took part in the fire extinguishing operations.
CM Murad, citing what he had been informed, said an alert about the fire was received at 10:16pm, and the first fire tender had reached the site at 10:27pm.
“All municipal authorities acted immediately, according to what I have been informed, and all these things will be verified.”



Asked whether Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had contacted him regarding the blaze, the Sindh CM said he had not been reached out to personally but “maybe he contacted the [provincial] government”.
Pointing out that the mall was constructed in the 1980s, he said, “I admit that we could not control the deterioration that, without any study, multi-level buildings were allowed. And now if we stop them, the builders make a fuss that they are being bothered.”
He highlighted that many buildings do not have materials to extinguish fire available inside the buildings, and stressed the need for fire exits to be properly marked.







‘Flammable material biggest challenge’
At around 4pm, South Deputy Commissioner (DC) Javed Nabi Khoso told Dawn that the fire had been brought under control by up to 70pc.
Speaking to Geo News, DC Khoso said authorities were gathering information about the number of people trapped inside the building.
“We have cordoned off the area and are trying to extinguish the blazes phase-wise,” he said.
Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer (COO) Abid Jalal told Geo News in the afternoon that “firefighting is under way from all three sides”.
He also said that the fire had been brought under control by about 70-75pc. However, he stressed that the building was very dilapidated.
“The backside has collapsed, and the front area is also about to collapse.”
Terming flammable material inside the mall as the “biggest challenge” in fully dousing the blaze, COO Jalal pointed out that accessing the building was very difficult.
“Sending firefighters inside right now is not without danger,” the rescue officer said. Therefore, he added, the team’s strategy was to control the fire first and then begin the search once they were able to enter the mall.
COO Jalal detailed that over 125 people, including firefighters, were engaged in the ongoing operations and about 20-22 vehicles of the fire brigade were involved.



A DawnNewsTV correspondent present at the site reported that all sides of the mall had been impacted, with one having “completely collapsed”.
He added that several people had come to look for their relatives, including shopkeepers working at the mall.
Delhi Colony residents Mansoor and Jameel told DawnNewsTV that they were unable to contact six of their family members who had come to Gul Plaza last night for shopping.
They said their last contact was at around 10:10pm last night, after which their mobile numbers were not reachable. The missing members comprised three women, two men and a 14-year-old girl.



Speaking to the media at the site in the afternoon, Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad said the search for missing people will begin after the fire has been put out and the cooling process has been completed.
‘Very old’ building
“There were goods such as crockery, clothes, electrical appliances, cosmetics and perfumes in various shops, due to which the fire intensified,” Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan explained.

The spokesperson added that on Sunday morning, 20 fire tenders from different departments and institutions were being employed to extinguish the blaze.
“But the building appears very old, and there is a danger that its structure may fall at any time because of the impact of the fire. Thus, the rescue operation is being carried out with extreme caution,” he said.
“When we arrived, the fire from the ground floor had spread to the upper floors, and almost the entire building was already engulfed in flames,” Khan told Reuters.
A Rescue 1122 spokesperson told BBC Urdu early on Sunday that the fire “spread over 8,000 square yards is very intense and the process to extinguish it [fully] could take one to two days”.







Earlier in the day, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed also confirmed that six bodies and 11 injured had been brought to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) so far. State-run APP reported that an emergency has been declared at the hospital.
In a statement run by APP, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said “more than 17 people” had been taken to hospitals due to suffocation, several of whom were discharged after receiving medical treatment.
Noting that Gul Plaza was an old building, he said the final cause of the fire will only be known after the completion of investigations. He added that 40 snorkels were taking part in the operation.
A firefighter identified as Furqan Shoukat also lost his life during the fire-extinguishing efforts, according to a statement by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab.
“In this time of grief, we stand with the family of martyred Furqan and the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation will provide full support to its martyred employees,” the mayor was quoted as saying by APP.
He said teams and machinery are fully engaged in extinguishing the fire.
In a separate statement, Wahab said all municipal departments have been directed to provide full support to the victims.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate statement reported by state-run Radio Pakistan, also expressed sorrow over the firefighter’s death.
He highlighted that Furqan sacrificed his life while saving the public, and prayed for his elevated ranks.
‘Seemingly caused by short circuit’
“It appears to have been caused by a circuit breaker,” Sindh Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Odho told reporters at the site, noting that Gul Plaza housed around 1,200 shops and also had a basement.
“The layout and construction of this market was such, and secondly, the nature of the items in it — such as carpets, blankets and other objects made of resins — so the fire is still simmering because of these.”



Garden Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Mohsin Raza also said in a statement on Saturday night that the fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit at one of the shops, before spreading to the entire mall.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed officials to divert traffic in the area to alternative routes for the safe passage of citizens.
In a statement, he said that the cause of the fire should be ascertained through a thorough investigation. He said that the building should be secured so that the fire does not spread.
The minister said the routes should be cleared so that fire brigade vehicles could access the scene.

A Sindh Rangers spokesperson said in a statement that personnel had been deployed to the scene of the incident.
“Rangers personnel are actively participating in rescue activities and rescue operations along with the fire brigade staff,” the statement, which was issued shortly after the fire erupted, said. “Officers and personnel will remain at the scene until the rescue operation is completed.”
The statement further read that in addition to aiding in rescue operations, a contingent of Rangers had been deployed to cordon off the building for the safety of civilians and to ensure traffic flow.
“Alongside fire tenders, Rangers personnel are evacuating trapped people and ensuring the safety of valuables,” the statement read, adding that protecting lives and preventing the fire from further spreading was a top priority.
President, PM vow assistance as traders fear huge losses
Traders feared huge losses as their goods were reduced to ashes by the blaze.
While the estimates vary, the All City Traders Ittehad Association (ACTIA) estimated losses worth around Rs2-2.5 billion, including “repair and reconstruction costs”.
In a statement, ACTIA patron-in-chief Sharjeel Goplani said chairman Zahid Amin and other members of the association had conducted an assessment of the affected mall.
Addressing the Sindh government and the prime minister, Goplani said, “Currently, 1,200 traders have suffered losses. This should be compensated immediately.”
President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz expressed their deep grief over the fire at Gul Plaza and the resulting loss of lives.
In a statement reported by APP, the premier instructed that all possible assistance should be provided to the affected traders and other individuals, and that all necessary facilities should be provided to the injured.
He stressed that all relevant departments should work together in the rescue operation.







In his statement, President Zardari directed that the Sindh government — which is of his PPP — and the relevant authorities “provide immediate and every possible assistance to the affected people and the traders”.
“No stone should be left unturned in providing the best medical facilities to the injured,” the statement quoted him as saying.







Memon, in a statement reported by APP, said the Sindh government will decide the future course of action after a complete assessment of the losses.
The minister said that whether it is the trader community or other affected individuals, the government will make every effort to provide maximum possible assistance within the framework of law and regulations.
CM Murad orders inquiry
Taking notice of the incident, CM Murad issued orders to Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi for an immediate inquiry into the matter and to prepare a report on the cause of the fire.
CM Murad was briefed about the incident earlier in the day at the CM House by Commissioner Naqvi and DC Khoso, who informed him that the fire broke out between 9:45pm and 10:15pm.
“The fire safety arrangements in the building should be inspected,” CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement.
He ordered the strict implementation of fire safety rules and action against those whose negligence or carelessness would be proven.
“A fire safety audit should immediately be conducted of Karachi’s commercial buildings,” CM Murad said.
According to the briefing, more than 1,200 shops were gutted in the incident. A massive emergency response was launched, involving 22 fire brigade vehicles, 10 water bowzers, four snorkel vehicles, and 33 Rescue 1122 ambulances.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed CM Murad and Wahab to deploy all resources to control the fire.
Expressing grief over the loss of lives and property, he demanded an immediate probe into the blaze and ordered that steps be taken to prevent such future tragedies.







Chief secretary, governor visit site
Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah visited the site of the incident earlier in the day to assess the rescue operations.
The South deputy commissioner and Rescue 1122 officials briefed him on the steps taken to control the fire.
The chief secretary issued orders for the deployment of all available fire tenders and additional rescue workers.
Soon after the fire began, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori had also visited Gul Plaza, where he was briefed on the rescue and relief operations.
Standing alongside the traders whose shops were ablaze, the governor issued directives for the rehabilitation of the affected.
Prior to his visit, in a statement from his office, Tessori expressed concern over the incident and ordered the relevant authorities to immediately expedite rescue and relief operations.
He also ordered an immediate report on the incident and firefighting operations, while assuring traders and others affected by the blaze of full cooperation.



Frequent fires in city
Gul Plaza has witnessed fire incidents in the past as well.
In August 2016, more than 25 shops were burnt in a huge fire that broke out in the multi-storey market. It was believed that a short circuit caused the fire.
A fire at a warehouse in Gul Plaza in August 2008, also caused by an electric short-circuit, destroyed some goods. However, no casualty was reported.
Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.

 

At a conference in October 2025 following multiple fire incidents, city planners, fire experts and disaster management authorities raised serious concerns over the deteriorating state of fire preparedness in Karachi.
They urged authorities to take immediate action to align the metropolis’s fire safety systems with international standards, warning that the current state leaves the city dangerously exposed to large-scale emergencies.
In December, the Sindh Assembly voted unanimously in favour of an opposition-sponsored resolution that called for the comprehensive modernisation of Karachi’s inadequate and substandard firefighting system.

While officials have confirmed six deaths so far, over 50 are reported missing.
Scenes from the site showed fire tenders, water tankers and ambulances sprawling MA Jinnah Road, where worried families had gathered in search of their loved ones.
Dawn takes a look at some of the scenes that marred the busy commercial road, crowded for an entirely different reason this time.

The TTAP delegation, led by the chairperson and the newly-appointed opposition leader in the National Assembly, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, has arrived in Sindh for four days. The visit is part of the mobilisation efforts for a nationwide ‘street movement’ called by the PTI, scheduled for February 8.
TTAP members also announced observing “Black Day” and nationwide strike on Feb 8, to commemorate the second anniversary of the last general elections in Pakistan, which they claimed were rigged.







According to the TTAP’s manifesto, “Democracy rests on the foundation of transparent elections; therefore, restoring public trust in the transfer of power is possible only through fair elections.”
The manifesto demanded “the immediate appointment of an impartial chief election commissioner and the holding of transparent elections under a new election commission.”
It further called for an independent investigation into the alleged rigging in the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, the identification of those responsible, and their punishment under Article 6 of the Constitution, which corresponds to high treason.
“Through the 26th and 27th constitutional amendments, the independence of the judiciary has been undermined by keeping the sword of judges’ transfers hanging over their heads,” it said.
“Conscientious judges, including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Justice Shams Mahmood Mirza, have been sidelined.”
“The TTAP manifesto said it “strongly condemned” the recent actions against Justice Tariq Jahangiri, terming his disqualification the “latest example of an attack on the judiciary”.
It further condemned the “false cases and convictions” against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife.
“TTAP demands the immediate release of all political prisoners, including former prime minister Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Umar Sarfaraz Cheema, Mian Mahmood ur Rashid, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Hassan Niazi, Ali Wazir, Haji Abdul Samad, Wali Mohmand, Dr Mahrang Baloch, and the detainees of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee,” the manifesto said.
Moreover, it called for an end to restrictions on meetings of party leaders and family with Imran.
Referring to the PECA law, the manifesto termed it a move to “silence critical voices and curtail media freedom”. It labelled the legislation as “black law” and demanded its “immediate revocation”.
During the APC, members slammed the “economic exploitation” of media networks, including Dawn TV, by imposing an advertisement ban.
The manifesto also demanded that the ongoing military operation in the Tirah Valley be “stopped immediately”, urging that the “federal government should take the provincial government into confidence on all matters”.
“All issues with Afghanistan should be resolved diplomatically,” the manifesto read, further asking the “unanimous demands” of the Jirga held in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly be immediately accepted.
‘Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if provinces get their rights’
Speaking to the APC, TTAP chief Achakzai said, “Everyone will chant Pakistan Zindabad if the provinces get their rights.
“We have to understand the problems of every province.”
“Come, let’s save our country,” Achakzai said, adding, “If you call the people of Waziristan and tell them that it is [Pakistan] your country, the terrorism will end.”
He alleged that the mandate of 25 million people was stolen in the Feb 8 elections.
“We have to come out on Feb 8 to protest peacefully,” he added, saying, “people will have to be united.”
‘90 per cent of people are in favour of Imran Khan’
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) head and nominated leader of opposition in the Senate, Allama Raja Nasir, said, “90 per cent of people in Pakistan are in favour of Imran Khan.”
“Despite keeping Imran in jail, they couldn’t keep people away from him. Only the public can pull Pakistan out of this turmoil,” he said.
Abbas also urged people to take to the streets and join the peaceful protest on Feb 8.
“If people come out on Feb 8, we will see a big difference on Feb 9.”
‘Over 200 FIRs and over two years in jail’
Former NA speaker Asad Qaiser said that Imran had been in jail for two years, and over 200 first information reports (FIRs) had been registered against him.
“His wife and nephew are also in jail,” Qaiser said, adding that the PTI founder had always opted for a life of struggle over lavishness.
“Despite problems, he [Imran Khan] stood firm and resolute.”
The ex-speaker said that Imran’s perspective was centred around human rights; therefore, he “will never compromise.”
He further stated that Imran had denied vengeance once he got in power.
“Our Constitution gives the freedom to express and assemble, but we are not allowed to hold public gatherings.“</p><small>2026-01-18 16:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1816032599c5cf7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967681/trump-invites-pm-shehbaz-to-join-gaza-board-of-peace-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Trump invites PM Shehbaz to join Gaza ‘Board of Peace’: FO</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been invited to be a part of the Gaza “Board of Peace” that is being formed by United States President Donald Trump, the Foreign Office has said.
“The prime minister of Pakistan has received the invitation from the president of the United States to join the Board of Peace on Gaza,” said FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi in response to media queries.
“Pakistan will remain engaged with international efforts for peace and security in Gaza, leading to a lasting solution to the Palestine issue in accordance with United Nations resolutions,” he added.







The so-called “Board of Peace” has begun to take shape as the US moves on to the second phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan for Gaza, which stands decimated after two years of Israel’s bombardment.
Trump had already declared himself the chair of the body, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in the Palestinian territory.
The United States has invited the heads of around 60 states to join the Board of Peace, including those of Turkiye, Egypt, Argentina, Indonesia, Italy, Morocco, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia.
However, the charter of the board, which does not mention Gaza by name, suggests that Trump has begun to position it as a rival to the United Nations.
On Friday, the US president named his Secretary of State Marco Rubio, former British prime minister Tony Blair, World Bank President Ajay Banga, and his senior negotiators Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff to the panel.
According to Reuters, the board also includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Israel has repeatedly opposed any Turkish role in Gaza.
Other members of the executive board include UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process Sigrid Kaag; Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay; and a minister from the United Arab Emirates, which established relations with Israel in 2020.
A Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo on Friday, which was attended by Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law who has partnered with Witkoff for months on the issue.

 

Former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, who is leading the committee, has an ambitious plan that includes pushing war debris into the Mediterranean Sea and rebuilding destroyed infrastructure within three years.
Analysts say the coming weeks will test whether Washington can translate the ambitious blueprint into tangible progress on governance, security and reconstruction in Gaza, as negotiations over demilitarisation and political transition intensify.</p><small>2026-01-18 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/18193841fc22843.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967685/policeman-martyred-by-unknown-assailants-riding-a-motorcycle-in-kps-bannu-district' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman martyred by unknown assailants riding a motorcycle in KP’s Bannu district</strong></a><br><p>BANNU: A target killing incident occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Sunday, where unknown assailants riding a motorcycle opened fire on a policeman, killing him on the spot.
According to a police statement, the incident occurred in the district’s Mamma Khel area, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Haved Police Station. It added that the martyred policeman was deployed at the Mazanga police checkpoint when he was attacked.
District Police Officer (DPO) Yasir Afridi said, “The martyred policeman, identified as Iqbal, was in his native village of Akhund Mamma Khel, when he was shot.”
“After offering evening prayers, he was on his way back home when motorcycle riders opened fire on him in front of his house, killing him on the spot,” the DPO added.
Following the incident, a heavy contingent of police reached the scene, cordoned off the area, and launched a search operation, while further investigation into the incident is underway.
The security situation in KP has worsened over the last three years with an increase in terrorist attacks, especially after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire deal with the government in 2022 and vowed to target security forces, police personnel, and law enforcement agencies personnel.
Last month, Bannu Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Sajjad Khan revealed that 27 cops were martyred in 134 terrorist attacks targeting personnel in the district in 2025. He added that during the attacks, 79 sustained injuries, while in retaliatory action by the police, 53 terrorists were killed and 163 were injured.
The DIG said that Bannu police carried out 168 intelligence-based operations across the district, resulting in the arrest of 105 terrorists. Overall, successful action was taken against 170 terrorists, he said.
Meanwhile, an important jirga was held in Bannu under the chairmanship of Brigadier Umair Niazi of 116 Brigade and Deputy Commissioner Faheem Khan, with the elders of Jani Khel, during which the security and administrative situation of the district was reviewed.
During the jirga, demands were raised regarding law and order, road repair and construction, action against absentee teachers, and the restoration of 4G internet services.
Brigadier Niazi assured the jirga elders that peace and stability would be ensured, directed government employees to resume their duties, stressed avoiding all contact with terrorists under a zero-tolerance policy, and announced that all roads in Bannu would be opened after the completion of security arrangements.
The elders appreciated the steps taken by the institutions and assured their full cooperation.</p><small>2026-01-18 15:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/181113049e1fcde.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967516/experts-warn-elite-capture-unchecked-development-eroding-islamabads-green-spaces' target='_blank'><strong>Experts warn elite capture, unchecked development eroding Islamabad’s green spaces</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Concerned citizens and experts speaking at a webinar raised apprehensions over the growing environmental crisis in Islamabad, caused by rapid, unplanned and largely irreversible urban development by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and various housing societies, often in violation of zoning rules and regulations.
Speakers stressed that the city’s green spaces were steadily being replaced by concrete due to weak governance, elite capture and a persistent conflict between populist decision-making and professional, science-based planning.
A key outcome of the discussion was a strong call for a new, collaborative approach to sustainable urban development through the establishment of a dedicated Islamabad-focused think tank. Participants emphasised the need to bring together independent professionals, policymakers, civil society and creative communities, including architects, designers and artists, to develop long-term, people-centred solutions.
The webinar underscored that environmental degradation was not only an ecological issue but also a major public health concern, making citizen engagement and collective responsibility essential.
The webinar was organised by the Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) on the theme “Islamabad’s Green Future – Coping with Irrational Development”. It brought together environmental experts, policymakers, civil society members and concerned citizens to deliberate on the growing environmental challenges facing the federal capital.
Environmental expert Dr Tariq Banuri highlighted that environmental protection efforts were being undermined by institutional weaknesses and the marginalisation, and at times harassment, of environmental professionals and activists working to safeguard protected hills, forests and wildlife habitats.
Participants agreed that without transparent, democratic and inclusive governance, Islamabad’s ecological balance would continue to deteriorate.
Dr Banuri focused on the environmental consequences of rapid and often unplanned urban development and underscored the urgent need for sustainable governance models that balance economic growth with environmental conservation.
He said Islamabad’s environmental degradation was a symptom of deeper governance challenges, pointing to elite capture, weak institutional frameworks and the ongoing tension between populism and professionalism as key factors driving the replacement of green spaces with unchecked concrete development.
Dr Zafar Mirza strongly condemned the ongoing tree-cutting in Islamabad, terming it a brutal act against nature and a direct assault on public health and environmental sustainability. Emphasising the power of citizen-led action, he suggested forming active citizens’ forums modelled on initiatives such as “Lahore Bachaao”, which have played a critical watchdog and advocacy role in urban conservation.
He said similar collective platforms in Islamabad could significantly contribute to protecting green spaces and the Margalla Hills National Park by raising public awareness, monitoring violations and holding authorities accountable for safeguarding the city’s natural heritage.
Former senator Mian Attiq stressed the urgent need to establish an independent, multidisciplinary think tank to guide the CDA on sustainable planning and environmental governance in Islamabad.
He said evidence-based advice from professionals and experts was essential to correct the city’s current development trajectory.
Former Pak-EPA director general Ziaul Islam criticised the ineffective bureaucratic approaches dominating environmental governance in Islamabad, noting that such top-down systems often ignored ground realities and community knowledge.
Devcom Director Munir Ahmed said Islamabad was witnessing an alarming wave of tree-cutting that threatened the very identity of the capital as a green and liveable city. “The unchecked felling of trees in the name of development reflects a serious failure of planning and governance,” he said.
He emphasised that the Islamabad High Court and relevant parliamentary committees should play a proactive, pro-citizens role, calling for accountable governance, restoration of institutional mandates and meaningful participation of independent environmental professionals and citizens in decision-making.
Internationally known ecosystems expert Ashiq Ahmed Khan said sustainable development was fundamentally a governance challenge as much as an environmental one.
He said true sustainability could not be achieved without inclusive and democratic decision-making processes that gave space to collective voices, particularly those of independent experts, local communities and civil society.
Others who spoke on the occasion included Rabia Raheel, Ivan Carmody, Abdul Shakoor Sindhu, Almas Shakoor and Silvia Shamoon.

Demonstrations sparked in late December by anger over economic hardship exploded into protests widely seen as the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in years.
Iranian officials have said the demonstrations were peaceful before turning into “riots” and blamed foreign influence, namely from Iran’s foes, the United States and Israel.
The rallies subsided after the crackdown carried out by security forces amid a communications blackout that started on January 8 as the protests grew in size and intensity.
Government officials have said calm has been restored, with schools reopening on Sunday — Iran’s weekend falling on Thursday and Friday — after a week of closure.
Late Saturday, the Tasnim news agency reported “the relevant authorities announced that internet access would also be gradually restored”, but gave no further details.
Citing an unnamed “informed source”, the agency said local messaging applications “will soon be activated” on Iran’s domestic intranet.
On Sunday morning, AFP was able to connect to the internet from its Tehran office, though the vast majority of internet providers and mobile internet remain cut.
Outgoing international calls have been possible since Tuesday, and text messaging was restored on Saturday morning.
For days, text messages and international phone calls — and at times even local calls — were cut off.
Iran has since been relying on its intranet, which has supported local media websites, ride-hailing apps, delivery service and banking platforms.
Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) alleges it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces. However, the media cannot independently confirm the figure, and Iranian officials have not given an exact death toll for the protests.
On Saturday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said “a few thousand” people had been killed by what he called “agents” of the United States and Israel, and Iranian local media has reported multiple deaths among security forces.
Khamenei said authorities “must break the back of the seditionists”, as local media has reported thousands of arrests and rights groups have estimated up to 20,000 people have been detained.</p><small>2026-01-18 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/18172945bd075d4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967682/unknown-assailants-blow-up-another-key-bridge-in-north-waziristans-mir-ali-cutting-off-access-and-sparking-anger' target='_blank'><strong>Unknown assailants blow up another key bridge in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali, cutting off access and sparking anger</strong></a><br><p>NORTH WAZIRISTAN: Another key bridge was blown up using explosives in the Mir Ali tehsil of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, causing severe difficulties for residents and triggering widespread anger.
According to the police, the explosion occurred in Khushhali (Makinah) village of Mir Ali, where unidentified assailants carried out the blast late at night, destroying the bridge and cutting off the area’s land connectivity with nearby settlements, markets and agricultural lands.
Soon after the incident, police and security forces cordoned off the area and launched an investigation.
Per a police statement, the destruction of the bridge has paralysed daily life. Residents say that school-going children, patients, the elderly and women are the worst affected, while agricultural activities and local businesses have also suffered heavily. With no alternative routes available, ambulances and other emergency services are facing serious hurdles, adding to public distress.
Expressing strong resentment, local tribal elder Malik Din Sardar said, “This bridge was the lifeline of our area. Now it has become extremely difficult to transport patients to hospitals. How long will we keep paying the price for such actions?”
He questioned why ordinary citizens are made to suffer losses and hardships for no fault of their own.
Social activist Jalal Khan said, “We had pinned our hopes on peace, but repeated destruction of bridges shows that the hardships of common people are being ignored.”
Residents of the area strongly condemned the incident and demanded the immediate arrest of those responsible, urgent reconstruction of the bridge on an emergency basis, and improved long-term security arrangements to prevent such incidents in the future.
Police said the nature of the explosives used in the blast was being determined, evidence had been collected, and investigations were underway from multiple angles.
Official sources said search operations and intelligence-based actions had been intensified to bring the perpetrators to justice, while the restoration of a temporary alternative route for public convenience was also under consideration.
KP has seen a rise in attacks targeting infrastructure in recent months.
On January 15, another important bridge over the Kurram River was destroyed with explosives. Work on that bridge has yet to begin. Due to the prolonged hardships, many local tribes have reportedly started migrating to safer areas.
On Dec 7, terrorists blew up a link bridge in the Mamandkhel area of the Bannu district using explosive material, affecting public movement in the area. Within a span of a week, Mir Ali tehsil later witnessed two incidents of terrorists blowing up government schools.
November also saw two incidents of terrorists attempting to blow up bridges in Bannu. One plot was foiled by the police’s bomb disposal squad, while the improvised explosive device in the other detonated prematurely, killing the attacker.
A series of such incidents has not only raised serious questions about the security situation but has also made life increasingly difficult for ordinary citizens.
Public circles have urged the federal and provincial governments to ensure the protection of critical infrastructure in North Waziristan, provide immediate compensation for losses, and take concrete and effective measures to restore peace and order.</p><small>2026-01-18 14:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645828-sindh-cm-orders-commercial-buildings-fire-safety-audits-after-karachi-mall-blaze' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CM orders commercial buildings' fire safety audits after Karachi mall blaze</strong></a><br><p>

“It’s blackmail what he’s doing … and it’s not necessary. It doesn’t help the alliance (Nato) and it also doesn’t help Greenland,” David van Weel said in an interview on Dutch television.
In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said additional 10 per cent import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain countries that have agreed to contribute personnel to a Nato exercise on Greenland.
Van Weel said the Greenland mission was intended to show the US Europe’s willingness to help defend Greenland, and he was opposed to Trump making a connection with diplomacy over the island and trade.
Trump has insisted he will settle for nothing less than full ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which he has said is vital to US security because of its strategic location and mineral deposits.
Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.
Ambassadors from the European Union’s 27 countries will convene on Sunday for an emergency meeting to discuss their response to Trump’s tariff threat.</p><small>2026-01-18 10:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645795-no-information-about-my-child-woman-breaks-down-during-search-for-missing-son' target='_blank'><strong>‘There is no information': Families search for loved ones after Gul Plaza fire</strong></a><br><p>

The White House announced this week the setting up of a “Gaza Executive Board,” which would operate under a broader so-called “Board of Peace” to be chaired by US President Donald Trump as part of his 20-point plan to end the war in Gaza.

 

The executive board, described as having an advisory role, includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi, alongside other regional and international officials.
Late on Saturday, Netanyahu’s office objected to the composition of the executive board.
“The announcement regarding the composition of the Gaza Executive Board, which is subordinate to the Board of Peace, was not coordinated with Israel and runs contrary to its policy,” the office of Netanyahu said.
“The prime minister has instructed the foreign affairs minister to contact the US secretary of state on this matter.”
It did not explain the reason for its objection, but Israel has previously objected strongly to any Turkish role in post-war Gaza, with relations between the two countries deteriorating sharply since Israel’s assault on Gaza began in October 2023.
In addition to naming Turkey’s foreign minister to the executive board, Trump has also invited Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to join the overarching Board of Peace.
Media reports said that leaders of the country’s ruling coalition were scheduled to meet on Sunday to examine the composition of the executive board.
“There is a meeting scheduled of the coalition at 10am (0800 GMT),” the spokesman of Netanyahu’s Likud Party told AFP, declining to provide further details.
Alongside Likud, the coalition includes the Religious Zionist Party led by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) led by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir.
The White House said Trump’s plan would include three bodies: the Board of Peace, chaired by Trump; a Palestinian committee of technocrats tasked with governing Gaza; and the Gaza Executive Board, which would play an advisory role.
The Palestinian technocratic committee held its first meeting in Cairo on Saturday.
The diplomatic developments came as the United States said this week that the Gaza truce plan had entered a second phase, shifting from implementing a ceasefire to the disarmament of Hamas.</p><small>2026-01-18 09:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645788-karachi-gul-plaza-fire-what-we-know-so-far-or' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Gul Plaza fire: What we know so far</strong></a><br><p>

At the far corner of the pediatric unit at Karachi Burns Center, a woman desperately tries to latch her daughter for feeding. The infant, covered in gauze, fails to hold on as her shrill cries fill the room, cutting through the white walls of the facility.
Two-year-old Fariha Hassan bears the burns of a fire that ripped through her apartment in Kharadar last week. The story is not unheard of; a gas cylinder explosion that engulfed her family into flames.
The incident, one of many reported across the metropolis every week, was preventable if only a handful of safety rules and regulations were followed.
According to an analysis of five-year data compiled by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), at least six fires erupt in the city daily. The reasons behind these fires may vary from case to case, but the casualties and injuries that arise from them are easily preventible if only the authorities and citizens themselves take some basic precautions.
Doctors say Fariha, who sustained burns on 30 per cent of her body, will eventually recover, albeit with scars. They deem her ‘lucky’ to have survived despite the intensity of the fire. Unlike her, thousands of families have lost their loved ones to fires that erupt across Karachi almost every day.
Last November, Bilal Tajuddin bid farewell to his mother and left for the night shift at a coffee shop located at Karachi’s RJ Mall. The next morning, Bilal’s father was jolted awake by a phone call.
“A fire has broken out in the building and I am stuck inside, just pray for me,” the 24-year-old said frantically. That was the last time Bilal’s family heard from him.
“The day was hell for us,” his uncle, Zubairuddin, recalled. “Bilal was the second eldest son of the family and shared the responsibility of supporting his father and four younger siblings,” he told Dawn.com.
Eleven people, including Bilal, died in the blaze that erupted at the mall. Officials said that the deaths occurred because the completely covered six-storey commercial building lacked proper ventilation shafts, which could have allowed the victims and smoke to escape.
The post-mortem reports of the deceased also confirmed that the victims had died from suffocation, not burns.
What could and should be
KMC data shows that 1,515 commercial fires were reported at banks, restaurants, plazas, hotels and small cabins across the city over the last five years. Another 1,952 residential and 1,203 factory fires were also recorded during the same period.



All of these incidents could have been prevented if only the Civil Defence Department, Sindh Building Control Authority (SCBA), and the KMC Fire Department enforced existing safety laws and mechanisms, designed to minimise damage and provide immediate relief in the event of an accident.
These include the Factory Act 1934 (amended in 1997), the Sindh Factories Act, 2015 and the Karachi Building and Town Planning Regulations, 2002 (KB&TPR). The first two are neither stringent nor very comprehensive on fire safety. However, the KB&TPR, which covers basic aspects of fire safety, are bound to be taken into consideration by the SBCA when approving a building plan and granting a completion certificate.
According to the SBCA by-laws, buildings that are ground plus three or above 43 feet should have a set of vertically installed standpipe systems, allowing the connection of fire hoses for manual fire fighting.
Ishtiaque Ahmed, KMC’s chief fire officer, told Dawn.com that these inlets are only present in a few buildings, most of which are located in industrial areas. But in residential areas, these water-filling points are like “salt in flour”, he said, using a metaphor to describe the rare find.
The laws also mandate the installation of an automatic sprinkler system in every institutional building with a parking area where combustible products are sold, displayed, or manufactured. The sprinkler system should be connected to a tank capable of supplying water for up to 20 minutes.
Besides, the law also mandates the availability of at least one manual fire extinguisher for every 2,400 square feet of space in public assembly buildings such as wedding halls and other enclosed public spaces. Similarly, at least one extinguisher should be available at every stairway landing in residential and commercial buildings.
As per the by-laws, an interior fire alarm system should be installed in all hotels, motels and dormitories with more than one floor and a capacity of 50 or more occupants. All hospital and institutional buildings accommodating over 20 occupants above ground must also have this alarm system installed.
Furthermore, buildings are required to have a signal connected to the nearest fire station to ensure immediate response in case of a blaze.
The by-laws state that buildings should have fire-resistant structures such as non-combustible materials for walls to withstand fire heat for some time and prevent collapse.
Moreover, buildings must incorporate protected shafts constructed solely for stairways, lifts, chutes, ducts, or any other purposes that allow people, objects, or air to pass between different compartments. These shafts help smoke escape the building during a fire.
Ironically, the by-laws entirely overlook fire exits.
To address this and other deficiencies, the Building Code of Pakistan (BCP) Fire Safety Provisions 2016 was introduced. However, compliance with these provisions is rarely observed in city buildings.
“The BCP emphasises means of egress, stipulating a three-foot safe passage in high-rise buildings leading to exit staircases and final discharge doors,” explained Sufyan Sheikh, secretary general of the Fire Protection Association of Pakistan (FPAP).
He highlighted that fire alarm systems, extinguishers, and emergency drill training requirements for residents and staff were mandatory. But while these additional provisions are present, their implementation varies based on occupancy and risk assessment.
“Converting these codes into an Act is imperative,” Sheikh stressed. But there is a long way to go because today even the mandated laws aren’t followed.
“It is all about saving money … using the right certified material to prevent these accidents would cost money. Builders always want to minimise their cost,” lamented Architect Arif Belgami.
“The other problem is that the contractors involved in the construction of these buildings, whether it be a single-storey or 19-storey building, have no qualifications; anybody can do this work as long as they have the basic know-how,” he added.
This lack of knowledge, the architect explained, meant that the contractors did not understand the importance of safety measures and often completely skipped them.
Authorities in deep slumber
Although the Sindh government has not set these provisions in law, the Civil Defence Department — which operates under both the provincial and federal governments under the provisions of the Civil Defence Act of 1952 — is mandated to inspect and ensure the implementation of safety measures enlisted in the BCP.
“Every district of Karachi has a deputy controller, additional controller and technical team responsible for ensuring the implementation of fire safety protocols,” said Safdar Ali Bghio, the director of the Civil Defence Department, describing the workings of the authority.

According to the law, the authority’s representatives may inspect any building at any time and issue warning letters. If the owners or occupiers of the building do not comply with the orders, they can be fined and face imprisonment of up to three years.
“We inspect buildings against the safety guidelines set in the BCP and provide owners with a fire assessment report which tells them the safety measures needed in their building,” said Mirza Mursalin Baig, senior technician at the Civil Defence Department.
He explained that each building has different requirements depending on the size of the plot, covered area and several other specific details.
But despite having powers to hold individuals responsible, the authority has failed to ensure the implementation of these laws. When asked about the reason, Shahabuddin Siddiqui, additional controller for East, Korangi and Malir, stated: “There is a huge staffing problem. Most appointed people have retired, and new appointments have been stalled for the past 20-25 years.”
“A primary problem in all old and even under-construction buildings is the lack of emergency exits,” Baig sighed. “This provision can easily be implemented when the building is being planned or built but the SBCA never shows us the layout plan before giving approvals.”
“How are these high-rise buildings that don’t even have emergency exits being given completion certificates?” he questioned. However, when asked if the Civil Defence Department took any action in the absence of compliance with safety measures, Baig had no answer.
It is important to note that the Civil Defence Department is also responsible for educating people about the use of fire safety equipment, such as operating a fire extinguisher. However, most people have no idea how to operate the equipment in case of an emergency.
Ali Hassan, a 36-year-old mechanic from Gharo, sustained burns on 20pc of his body when a fire broke out in the rice factory he worked at. The incident took place while he was replacing a broken wire, bare-handed.
“The factory owners do provide us safety gadgets but I have never used them because we haven’t seen anyone doing the same,” he said.
Not important enough?
Dr Ehmer-al-Ibran, a consultant plastic surgeon who worked at the Burns Centre for over a decade, told Dawn.com that most of the deaths in incidents of fire take place from smoke inhalation injuries rather than burns.
“When a fire breaks out, it releases carbon monoxide, which deposits in the respiratory tract, making it difficult to breathe and eventually leading to death,” he explained.
Another reason for the high casualties is the lack of safety exits in most buildings. “Buildings, whether commercial or residential, usually have a single entrance and exit. If that too is blocked, the chances of injuries increase because people start jumping off the floors to escape.
“Fewer people die from the fires and more from these incidents,” he said.



Despite this, rarely do people consider implementing fire safety mechanisms when building houses. As KMC’s Ahmed highlighted, most of the interest lies in measures such as barbed wires and adapters for protection against thieves and short circuits.
“But almost no importance is given to fire precautionary measures,” he said. “If they do consider fire safety, it usually involves placing equipment as decoration pieces, not realising that they need to be serviced every six months.”
The chief fire officer pointed out that some of the most prestigious organisations rely on outdated fire safety measures such as buckets filled with sand. “They realise the importance of proper safety measures only when an incident occurs.”
The Civil Defence Department’s Baig concurred. Residents buy apartments in buildings worth millions without even giving a second thought to the availability of emergency exits. “They never think how they will escape from their fancy flats in the event of an earthquake or fire,“ he lamented.
Unfortunately, while people neglect these basic safety details, so do the authorities. The latter only feel compelled to take action on safety matters when an incident occurs. Otherwise, the issue is conveniently brushed under the carpet.
Fractured system
In 2021, a division bench of the Sindh High Court, headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar, directed the SBCA to formulate a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), requiring builders to obtain a no-objection certificate from Civil Defence and fire departments before constructing buildings.
Three years later, the fractured system has yet to be fixed.
It was only when the RJ Mall fire occurred that the government finally jolted awake. Immediately after the incident, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab ordered a ‘fire security audit’ of all high-rises located along three major arteries of the city. The then Karachi commissioner Muhammad Saleem Rajput issued orders to all Deputy Commissioners (DC) and related departments to conduct the fire safety audits of all high-rises in the city.
The orders stated that the teams should inspect fire safety mechanisms in all shopping malls, centres, plazas, and residential, commercial and government buildings. The commissioner also instructed the teams to examine approved building plans and assess whether the SBCA building by-laws have been implemented. The deputy commissioners were to submit a report within seven days, besides follow-up reports every quarter.
A month on, some districts reported back while others are still conducting their survey. Dawn.com compiled survey reports of six districts, for which the data was available. An analysis of the surveys unveiled the incompetence of authorities and mishaps — the absence of layout plans, training and emergency exits among others.



DC Korangi Jawwad Muzaffar explained that the survey teams comprised representatives from nine departments. They were responsible for assessing fire safety provisions and declaring them as satisfactory or unsatisfactory.
Commenting on the findings of the survey, Korangi Assistant Commissioner Imran ul Haq noted: “Most big industries fulfilled the requirements, it is the cottage industries that lacked them.”
Meanwhile, AC Landhi Madiha Narejo, while talking about the survey conducted in her jurisdiction, said: “The civil defence representatives accompanying us knew which factory had the provisions and which company lacked what requirements; they know what is going on where.“
Dawn.com reached out to the South district office multiple times, requesting the detailed survey, but was only given a summary. It stated that buildings in the Saddar sub-division did have more than one exit but none of them were declared an emergency exit. In the Arambagh sub-division — a high-density old town locality — 90 per cent of the buildings are constructed in contravention with the SBCA layout plans, with basements converted into godowns and fire exits blocked.
In the sub-division Civil Lines, it said that in various shopping malls surveyed, loose wiring was a common problem while fire alarm systems, fire extinguishers and fire safety-related signage were absent. It added that the management of these malls “instead of acknowledging their shortcomings, kept blaming builders”.
According to the report of the Lyari sub-division, a low-income and predominantly residential area, builders were alien to the concept of layout plans, fire detection systems, fire extinguisher mechanisms and emergency response planning. However, people acknowledged fire hazards and the management of the buildings committed to fire safety systems in the minimum time possible.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Rajput said he had instructed deputy commissioners of each district to meet building owners and associations to decide on a phased implementation of fire safety provisions.
“I have directed the DCs to give them six months to implement these measures,” he said. Rajput explained that residents could not be held accountable as building owners are usually unreachable after they sell off their properties and purchasing safety equipment could be expensive.
The former commissioner noted another problem: the quality of the fire safety equipment available in the market, which, according to him, was often sub-standard. “We have cracked down on markets to resolve the issue, but the results have remained the same.”
In a meeting chaired by former caretaker chief minister Justice Maqbool Baqar, it was relayed to the DG SBCA that strict action would be taken against officials if any building is constructed without adhering to the by-laws. “I have told officers to inspect all buildings for fire safety provisions and ensure their implementation,” Abdul Rasheed Solangi, the director general of the SBCA, told Dawn.com.
Solangi said he had also directed officials to ensure that future layout plans included fire exits and that no completion certificates would be issued to buildings that have not implemented fire safety provisions. He added that notices had been issued to officers who issued completion certificates for buildings lacking the requirements.
When Dawn.com pointed out that the commissioner had already conducted a survey, the DG replied that he had only recently been appointed and was unaware of the survey. “We will still conduct our own survey, which has already begun,” he said.
While the authorities repeatedly take the same actions without result, emergency workers like Muhammad Farooq are left to pull burnt bodies from buildings.
“I still get nightmares. The victims of the Baldia factory fire ask me, ‘Why didn’t you do enough to save us?’” said Muhammad Farooq, who is in charge of emergency rescue operations at Edhi Foundation. He was referring to the deadliest industrial fire in the country’s history, when 260 trapped workers were burnt or suffocated to death inside a garment factory in Baldia Town, Karachi, in 2011.
After a long pause, Farooq broke the silence. “Nobody wants to lose their life. Everyone tries their best to save themselves. They did too. There were 15-20 bodies piled on top of each other at every blocked exit and barricaded window. They just wanted a gasp of air to survive a few more minutes,” he told Dawn.com.
“The odour is so strong that it stays with us for days. The cries of those families are so loud that they echo in my ears for the nights to come,” Farooq said as he collected his equipment and headed out to address yet another fire emergency call.

District South Deputy Commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso said that the restaurants and other food shops had been sealed because they had placed their furniture on the walkways.  
He said that the sealed outlets would be unsealed after payment of fines and undertaking by the restaurant owners to fully comply with the standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
Mr Nabi said that the commissioner had directed all deputy commissioners to take strict action against the “soft encroachments” that hindered the vehicular and pedestrian movement in any part of the city.  
He said that most of the shops and eateries were sealed in Arambagh sub-division where Burns Road Food Street was also located.  
The DC said that all shopkeepers would have to pay fines and submit written assurances of compliance with the SOPs. 
He said that some of the restaurants and shops sealed two days ago would be allowed to re-open their outlets as they had already paid fines and submitted required affidavits.  
Meanwhile, the anti-encroachment operation also continued in other parts of the city.  
Korangi DC Masood Bhutto said that two restaurants were sealed in in Model Colony and five others in Korangi and other parts of the district.  
It may be noted that the city authorities have launched a massive operation against encroachments on footpaths and walkways across the city, sealing several markets, including the largest motorcycles market at Akbar Road, Saddar.

The controversy over the hunting permits for markhor and grey gorals emerged when the wildlife department received minutes of a recent meeting with the climate change and environmental coordination ministry where minister Musadik Masood Malik was in the chair.
“The chair directed that a legal opinion be obtained to clarify the matter and that a subsequent meeting be convened to finalise the non-exportable quota in line with relevant international conventions. Till that time, no quotas for non-exportable trophies will be allocated by any province,” reads minutes of the meeting available with Dawn.
Sources in KP wildlife department told Dawn that the federal ministry of climate change and environmental coordination had bound intermediaries, formally called outfitters, to take no objection certificates before moving permit holders to the region for hunting, a move that was an encroachment on the province’s jurisdiction.

Wildlife dept insists permit restriction encroachment on its domain will discourage hunters

In a formal response to the federal government’s NOC move, the KP wildlife department has feared that the restriction would discourage hunters, mostly foreigners.
It said that Section-11 of the KP Wildlife and Biodiversity (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Act, 2015, declared that “All wild animals, free ranging or captive, tamed or untamed, found within the territorial jurisdiction of the province shall be deemed to be the property of the government.”
The official documents reveal that the management of wildlife within the province vests with the KP wildlife department as per provision of the said act. In this context, matters relating to non-exportable hunting quota, which do not involve international trade appropriately, remain within the provincial regulatory framework and are not in contravention to the act ibid. The wildlife department has informed the federal government in its reply that “Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Fauna and Flora Rules, 20218 has no provisions to determine local Quotas.”
Also, under the Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Fauna and Flora Act, 20212, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Management Authority is mandated to regulate matters relating to export, import and re-export of wild fauna and flora.
Rules 3 of the Pakistan Trade Control of Wild Fauna and Flora Rules, 2019 provides that the functions of the Management Authority include coordination, facilitation and consideration of advice from the scientific authority and relevant stakeholders.
The rules say that decisions concerning wildlife conservation and management benefits for provincial units shall be made in light of close consultation with the provincial government with a view to develop informed and consensus-based outcomes consistent with constitutional devolution and field realities.
An official of the wildlife department told Dawn that six permits for hunting gray goral had been sold for $398,500 and one of them had already been used.
He added that action on other permits had got blocked as the federal wildlife authority had linked it with its permission.
The official insisted that hunters were reluctant to approach that authority.
He also said the wildlife department had sold 11 permits of non-exportable trophies for $553,300 and only five of them had been used.
The official said that 80 per cent of the revenue generated from the sale of permits was spent on the welfare of communities in the respective areas, while the rest went to the exchequer.
He said the community’s share was spent on public welfare initiatives.

In a review published in the British journal The Lancet Obstetrics, Gynaecology & Womens Health on Saturday, the team said they had focused on amassing the best-quality evidence to address the claims.
Paracetamol is safe to use in pregnancy, said lead author Asma Khalil, professor of obstetrics and maternal foetal medicine at City St Georges, University of London.
The key message is reassurance: When used as recommended, the best available evidence does not support a causal link with autism, ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) or intellectual disability.

President Trump claimed last year the painkiller could be linked to autism in children if taken during pregnancy

Khalil said she had been asked about the popular pain medication also known as acetaminophen by her patients after Trump in September told pregnant women not to take the drug. At the time, national and international medical groups decried the presidents comments, saying they were not evidence-based.
Paracetamol/Tylenol is the only pain reliever considered safe for pregnant women, and doctors already advise them to use the smallest amount for the shortest time to control pain and fever during pregnancy. Untreated, these conditions can be risky for both pregnant women and their babies. The researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing data, finding 43 studies that were then assessed for quality and bias using a standard tool.
The team particularly focused on studies that looked at children born to the same mother who took paracetamol/Tylenol during one pregnancy but not the other. These take into account shared genetic factors and family environments that could be linked to autism or the other conditions studied, Khalil said.
There were only three studies of this type, but they were large, covering more than 260,000 children assessed for autism, and around 335,000 and 405,000 for ADHD and intellectual disabilities respectively.
They showed no significant link between use of the drug and any of the conditions studied. This remained the case when results from all of the high-quality studies that were assessed were pooled, the authors said.
Khalil said much of the work showing a potential link, including a review of 46 studies cited by Trump officials, was prone to bias or confounding factors that her team’s review had tried to account for. Grainne McAlonan, professor of Translational Neuroscience at King’s College London, who was not involved in the research, praised the study, adding: I hope the findings of this study bring the matter to a close.

Speculation abounds about what made US President Donald Trump change his mind — from entreaties by Gulf friends, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman, to a seemingly bizarre New York Times report that claimed that the apartheid state’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also asked the US leader not to launch military strikes for the time being.

 

However, in Trump’s own words “nobody” made him change his mind and it was the staying of 800 hangings of protesters that Iran had supposedly planned that was the main reason he had called off the strikes and also because the protesters’ “killing has stopped”.
Whatever led to the pause, temporary or permanent, it is a welcome development for the region, which seemed to be sliding towards strife, with worries in the Gulf about Iran’s possible retaliatory missile strikes against American military bases and, who knows, even economic infrastructure such as oil and gas facilities.

Pakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country’s western borders.

Perhaps, the most serious challenges would have come Pakistan’s way in either a regime change or collapse-chaos scenario. In the case of regime cha­­­nge, it would not have been surprising to see an administration in Tehran sympathetic to Isra­­el. That would have meant a hostile entity like Israeli intelligence enjoying far greater access to Iran than, for example, Indian intelligence has at present.
Pakistan’s nuclear weapons are like a sty in Israel’s eye. And, therefore, you can well imagine the consequences of the latter’s intelligence sitting on our nearly 1,000-kilometre border with Iran, adding to our existing security concerns due to the situation on the Indian and Afghan borders. Coastal security would be another concern.
In the other scenario, where a central authority collapse would lead to chaos and fragmentation, it would be reasonable to assume that Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province would be one of the regions affected by any such development, which, in turn, would lead to even more issues across our common, often porous, border.
With the same ethnicity straddling the border, you can well imagine the boost the insurgency in our Balochistan could get from the collapse of the central authority in Iran. Israel has enhanced its security through internal strife in Syria. It is the Mossad playbook for all states around it who are not in its pocket.
So, Pakistan can heave a sigh of relief that no further destabilisation has happened on the country’s western borders and up the coast, in the short run at least. But Trump’s decision to impose another 25 per cent tariff on anyone doing business with Iran will deepen the crisis in the sanctions-clamped nation.

 

It was the economic crisis, with the rapidly falling value of the Iranian currency and inflation, that triggered the recent round of street protests. There can be no doubt that the Israeli intelligence service Mossad was involved in arming and instigating some of the protesters as the former CIA chief and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo openly tweeted, but the protests erupted due to the economic mess where even purchasing bread is becoming a problem.
This fact was acknowledged by Iran’s spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who said the government needed to address the legitimate concerns of the protesters who had a right to take to the streets. Now a new budget is expected to be presented before parliament to replace the earlier proposal rejected by it. But then, the protests turned violent and the security services were ordered to crack down.
Some Tehran-based sources say the protests were peaceful till some elements from among the protesters fired at the security forces and also attacked infrastructure. These sources claimed that, of the 2,000 people killed, some 700 were law-enforcement officers. But these claims were impossible to verify independently.
Trump’s tariffs on top of sanctions could create further problems for the Iranian leadership as even the thus far recalcitrant India is having second thoughts about doing business with Iran and has pulled out of the Chabahar port project, which it saw as vital to expanding its trade ties all the way to Central Asia.
With the exception of China and Russia, additional US tariffs would be sufficient to discourage the smaller economies from trading with Iran, which would worsen the resource crunch in that country. The oppressive Iranian regime has some serious thinking to do over the coming weeks.
The immediate threat of US-Israeli military action may have receded somewhat but the economic crisis is going to worsen. Iran may consider easing restrictions on how women should be attired and create more space for peaceful expression of dissent as a means of reducing tensions within its society.
Side by side, it should consider what price tag it wants to attach to its nuclear programme. With its successful and lethal missile programme, it has already gained a degree of effective defence. Only Iran can tell if stopping its enrichment programme in exchange for lifting of sanctions and economic relief is worthwhile.
If its missile stockpile, particularly of the hypersonic variant, is what prompted many of its Gulf neighbours and, by some accounts, even Israel, to ask the US not to provoke it by attacking, Iran’s defence shield seems to be working. Only the decision-makers in Tehran will know if that is enough or whether their pursuit of nuclear weapons is non-negotiable.
Their past experience of doing a deal with the Obama administration in 2015 to cap enrichment that Trump later annulled is not encouraging. Even then, it’s not clear what other options a country facing economic ruin and internal strife can exercise.

But the human losses have left a deep new wound on the Iranian psyche. The immediate threat of a US-Israeli strike has also dispersed. Washington and Tel Aviv, backed by most Gulf capitals, recalibrated their stance after strategic assessments highlighted the danger of a wider regional war and the absence of any realistic plan for a post-regime change scenario.

 

Inside Iran, resistance against the establishment still struggles to form a unified front or leadership. However, this does not mean the US, Israel or their allies have dropped the goal of political change in Tehran. Instead, they are adjusting their methods. Media reports indicate the regime will not collapse quickly due to a strong security apparatus, loyal institutions, and backing from a sizable segment of the population.
Even so, external actors, along with internal resistance networks, are unlikely to allow the regime much time to fully recover from this crisis. Pressure is expected to persist, shifting from low to high intensity, to gradually soften the ground for change.
A key indicator that the ground is fertile for such a shift are the visible cracks within the Assembly of Experts (Majles-i-Khobregan-i-Rahbari), the Guardian Council (Shura-i-Negahban), and disputes within or between the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the regular military (Artesh). All these critical institutions are still aligned with Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei’s core strategic worldview, as one Iranian-origin expert noted.

The recent internal resistance has emboldened separatist elements in Arab and Kurdish regions.

To break the regime’s coherence, external actors would not only seek to energise internal political resistance but also exploit other domestic fault lines, including fuelling dormant or active insurgencies.
Analysts speculate that separatist and anti-clerical movements are concentrated in several key regions: Khuzestan province in the southwest, where many Arab Iranians harbour grievances; the western border areas, including Kurdistan and West Azerbaijan, where Kurdish separatists remain active; and, from a Pakistani perspective, the Baloch districts in Sistan-Baluchestan and parts of the Khorasan region, where anti-regime Baloch insurgent groups continue their operations.
As Vali Nasr explains in his latest book, Iran’s Grand Strategy, the clerical regime’s doctrine of ‘forward defence’, projecting power abroad to protect the state at home, can also be turned against Iran. Its adversaries can adopt the same approach to weaken the regime from within. Iran’s enemies have already disrupted the Axis of Resistance, the network of Iranian regional proxies built around this forward defence strategy. The next step, as a few analysts suggest, could be the deployment or activation of proxies inside Iran itself.
If this occurs, the primary objective would be to draw the Iranian Revolutionary Guard into a deeper engagement on the internal front. An amalgam of political resistance and armed struggle can strain Iranian forces, especially when their proxies cannot come to their aid, as Iran’s Axis of Resistance is weak and unable to provide any support.
These broader trends are now evident on the ground. Although reports suggest that the recent internal resistance has emboldened separatist elements in Arab and Kurdish regions, it is in the Sistan-Balochestan belt where several militant outfits have reportedly formed a stronger coalition to intensify their campaign against the Iranian state.
Jaishul Adl is a Baloch separatist group operating along the Iran-Pakistan border. It frequently targets Iranian security forces in Baloch-majority regions. The group now calls itself the People’s Fighters Front (PFF). Three smaller militant outfits, the Nasr Movement, the Pada Baloch Movement, and the Muhammad Rasul Allah Group, have reportedly merged into this new organisation.
This rebranding is significant. By shedding its overtly religious identity, Jaishul Adl is attempting to project a more accommodative, secular nationalist profile that resonates better with the region’s relatively moderate Baloch population. It also aligns the group’s ideology with that of other nationalist insurgent movements, such as the terrorist Baloch organisations BLF and BLA and Kurdish groups like PJAK. Such a shift is also likely to make the organisation more eligible for support and funding from the Baloch and Iranian diaspora, as well as other external backers.

 

Strategically, the makeover aims to make the group acceptable to the West and the Arab world. It mirrors Abdolmalik Rigi’s approach. He was the founder of a Baloch militant group in Iran and sought Western backing but failed, as the global war on terrorism was at its peak then.
This is a different time. If separatist groups inside Iran become more active, they might join forces with Baloch separatists in Pakistan, who have sharpened their skills. Some experts are unsure about this, arguing that the PFF has long been seen as Saudi-backed. Since Riyadh maintains strong ties with Pakistan, the alliance seems unlikely. But if the PFF has gained support from other external players, it could act with more strategic independence.
Baloch separatist groups on both sides of the border ultimately subscribe to the idea of a ‘Greater Balochistan’. This concept spans regions of Iran, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, making cross-border cooperation a possibility.
If turmoil grows in Sistan-Baluchestan, many terrorist actors could get involved. These could include IS elements and militants who have left Ahmed al-Sharaa’s networks in Syria. As this region is part of the Golden Crescent, a hub for drug trafficking and human smuggling, the ongoing instability could create a chaotic zone across Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Any significant political shift in Iran will inevitably affect Pakistan with its broad geopolitical and geoeconomic consequences. While certain outcomes may offer limited strategic advantages for Pakistan, escalating instability along the Iran-Pakistan border would raise internal security pressures and could generate serious frictions with the regime in Tehran.

Donald Trump has not received the Nobel Peace Prize. He has simply acquired the medal. This is akin to holding a friend’s Oscar during a selfie and then captioning it ‘great night’.
The distinction, however, has never really troubled the American president, who had campaigned for the honour for years. He had listed his achievements numerous times, compared himself favourably to past winners and expressed bafflement that the committee kept missing the point — him. That pursuit was not subtle.

 

President Trump spoke of the Nobel as something he had earned but been unfairly denied, a prize that history had misplaced. The grievance lingered, resurfacing whenever foreign policy or legacy came up.
What irony then, that María Corina Machado, the actual Nobel laureate, simply handed the medal to him. With the trophy now sitting on Mr Trump’s desk, destiny must feel restored.
The custodians of the prize were quick to clarify matters. The Norwegian Nobel Institute reminded everyone that the Nobel cannot be transferred, shared or quietly passed along. The medal may move. The honour stays put.
The natural question that arises then is, why hand over the cherished prize at all? For Ms Machado, the gesture is less about personal generosity than political leverage.
Post-Maduro, Venezuela’s future is being argued in Washington, and she arrived with an unusually shiny lobbying tool. It cost her nothing, and flattered him enormously, a rare bargain in diplomacy.
Mr Trump has chosen to keep the medal, and although it is a symbolic prize, it implies responsibility. That means calm, restraint, and thinking before tweeting.
No one is updating the laureates’ list. No Oslo speech is pending. Still, now that peace is sitting on his desk, expectations may quietly follow. After all, it would be awkward to own the medal and then start a fight with it.
Published in Dawn, January 18th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-18 05:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967629/gaza-second-phase' target='_blank'><strong>Gaza second phase</strong></a><br><p>MORE than three months since the ceasefire in Gaza took effect, the second phase of President Donald Trump’s peace plan for the occupied Palestinian territory has been launched.
Among the features of this phase is the announcement of the so-called Gaza ‘Board of Peace’, which the American leader will head. Other luminaries serving on this body include his son-in-law Jared Kushner, administration staffers Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff and former British prime minister Tony Blair, among others. In Mr Trump’s own words, this “is the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled”.

 

Meanwhile, a serving American general has been named to head the International Stabilisation Force, which is supposed to oversee security and disarmament in Gaza, while Ali Shaath, an ex-Palestinian Authority official, is to head the Gaza governance committee.
All the hyperbole notwithstanding, it remains to be seen whether these interim governing structures will succeed in addressing the still dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, and stopping Israel from committing more slaughter in the Strip.
While Tel Aviv had butchered over 70,000 Palestinians since Oct 7, 2023, more than 400 people have been murdered in Gaza by Israel since the ceasefire took effect. Moreover, Israel continues to occupy the Palestinian territory.
There are also questions about how much liberty the Palestinian committee will have in running Gaza’s affairs. There are genuine fears that the foreign-led Board of Peace — in true colonial fashion — will be making the actual decisions that matter, with little to no Palestinian input, seeking to protect Israel’s interests over all else.
Interestingly, the board’s goals include bringing “investment attraction” to and initiating “capital mobilisation” in Gaza. Rather than a humanitarian effort, this sounds more like a business deal.

 

Also, the inclusion of Tony Blair in the board has raised eyebrows. As UK prime minister, Mr Blair was an enthusiastic supporter of America’s devastating invasion of Iraq. It should be remembered that Iraq has yet to fully recover from that disaster.
As for the ISF, its mandate is still unclear. Will the force, led by an American general and consisting of troops from Muslim countries, take Hamas’s weapons by force if the Palestinian group refuses to give up its guns? Will Muslim states be willing to participate in such an endeavour? Pakistan, and other states that are mulling sending troops, must consider these scenarios.
The fact is that the plan is a temporary fix at best, and a cover for permanent Israeli occupation at worst. If there is to be lasting peace in Gaza and the rest of the occupied territories, then the question of Palestinian liberation must be addressed in unambiguous terms. A clear roadmap is needed, which leads to the end of the Zionist occupation and the establishment of a Palestinian state.

MUZAFFARABAD: The Jammu and Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) has accused the government of violating a landmark agreement signed in October last year and has urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene, citing serious delays in implementation and expressing concern over the induction of a “controversial figure” into the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) ahead of the upcoming elections in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).

 

In an open letter addressed to the prime minister on Saturday, the JAAC said the agreement was signed on October 3–4, 2025, following deadly protests in late September that claimed several lives. A high-powered delegation from Islamabad, dispatched on the premier’s directives, had visited Muzaffarabad and concluded what the committee described as a historic accord, reassuring the people of AJK of Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding their legitimate rights.
However, the committee alleged that the agreement had been repeatedly breached. It pointed out that the final clause required meetings of the negotiating committee to be held every 15 days, followed by the issuance of an official communiqué. Over the subsequent three months, however, only two meetings were held, on October 21 and November 4. A third meeting scheduled for January 5 this year was boycotted by the JAAC.
The committee also highlighted delays and shortcomings in the implementation of the Health Card Scheme. Although funds were released after a delay of more than 100 days, many major local hospitals in AJK were not included in the State Life Insurance Corporation’s panel. This, it said, would force even poor patients to travel to Rawalpindi or Islamabad for treatment, undermining the utility of the scheme.
Referring to compensation for victims of the protests, the JAAC said the agreement promised financial compensation equivalent to law enforcement allowances for those killed on October 1 and 2, Rs1 million for each gunshot injury, and a government job for a family member of each deceased person within 20 days.
“However, this clause has yet to be fully implemented, which amounts to a serious breach of the agreement,” the letter stated.
The committee further said that FIRs registered against JAAC members and members of the public between May 9, 2023, and October 4, 2025, were to be withdrawn under the agreement, but the issue remained unresolved. It added that young people continued to face difficulties in obtaining police character certificates, while several individuals seeking employment abroad had been offloaded from flights and arrested after being placed on exit and passport control lists, causing financial losses and mental distress.
The JAAC also accused the authorities of violating another clause calling for the formation of a high-powered committee to review the issue of AJK Assembly members elected from constituencies outside the territory. It said the committee’s formation had been unjustifiably delayed, while MLAs elected on refugee seats were granted parliamentary privileges and standing committee positions. The committee further alleged that non-residents continued to be admitted to educational institutions under refugee quotas, in violation of the agreement.
Expressing alarm over political developments ahead of the forthcoming AJK elections, the JAAC strongly criticised the PML-N for inducting Saqib Majeed, whom it accused of opening fire on peaceful protesters in Muzaffarabad on September 29, 2025, killing three people and injuring dozens. The committee said the incident had triggered widespread protests and clashes across AJK, resulting in further loss of life.
It noted that Mr Majeed, the son-in-law of Muslim Conference chief Sardar Attique Ahmed Khan and a former chief organiser of the party, was now being given political cover by the PML-N, a move it said had generated strong resentment across the region.
The JAAC said it had boycotted the negotiation process in protest against Mr Majeed’s inclusion in the PML-N and urged the prime minister to take personal interest in the matter, hold the local PML-N leadership accountable, and reconsider the party’s decision to induct what it described as an individual responsible for killing peaceful demonstrators.

It is a nation’s strategic DNA. From the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, which fenced off the western hemisphere from European monarchs, to the 1947 Truman Doctrine that looked to aggressively ‘contain’ Soviet communism, these blueprints signal a country’s core values, and the consequences for those who cross them.
In 1968, the Soviet Union introduced the Brezhnev Doctrine, asserting Moscow’s right to militarily intervene in socialist countries being threatened by capitalist/pro-US forces. Fast forward to the 21st century, and the blueprints have become increasingly aggressive. 
We’ve seen the Bush Doctrine’s ‘strike first, ask questions later’ approach (‘preemptive strikes’), and Russia’s Gerasimov Doctrine, which treats disinformation and cyberattacks as the new artillery. We see the Xi Jinping Doctrine seeking to enhance China’s glory through the sprawling veins of the Belt and Road Initiative, while Donald Trump’s recent ‘Donroe’ Doctrine is an obsession with border walls, drug cartels and keeping Chinese influence out of ‘America’s backyard.’
But doctrines are not static. They mutate. They adapt to the scent of power and economic reality. This is apparent in Pakistan as well. Pakistan began with its founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s high-minded idealism, but was quickly forced into a security-first straitjacket by the shadow of a much larger India.

Pakistan’s national ‘doctrine’ has continued to mutate according to the whims of those in power, thus resulting in an often erratic and haphazard approach to strategy-building

By 1958, the harsh realities of the Cold War had taken hold. Upon seizing power, Gen Ayub Khan established a doctrine that firmly anchored Pakistan within Western alliances. This manoeuvre was shaped to leverage US military and economic assistance to balance the scales with India, while simultaneously energising an ambitious industrialisation and modernisation programme at home. 
The Ayub regime fell in 1969. Under another dictator, Gen Yahya Khan, the country’s eastern wing broke away in 1971 to become Bangladesh. Rising to power in the wake of the 1971 crisis, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose party had secured a majority in the country’s western wing during the 1970 elections, began to forge a new national path. 
Bhutto’s doctrine was designed to reinvent Pakistan’s identity and champion a strategy that moved away from heavy Western dependency in favour of stronger ties with oil-rich Arab states, the ‘Islamic Bloc’, and the burgeoning ‘Third World’ movement. Most significantly, the doctrine established the groundwork for Pakistan’s nuclear programme, which Bhutto envisioned as the essential equaliser to offset India’s military strength. 
Bhutto’s regime fell in a military coup in 1977. The coup-maker, Gen Ziaul Haq decided to stay on. A Zia Doctrine emerged. It prioritised a policy of domestic ‘Islamisation’, while positioning Pakistan as a frontline state in a US-backed anti-Soviet ‘Afghan jihad.’ Consequently, the Zia dictatorship secured extensive American support, which Zia used as a cover to accelerate the country’s nuclear programme under a cloak of plausible deniability.



 
During this era, the concept of ‘strategic depth’ also took root. This strategy sought to establish a pro-Pakistan government in Afghanistan, to ensure a secure territory where Pakistani armed forces could regroup in the event of conflict with India. Following Zia’s death in a 1988 plane crash, the Zia Doctrine remained a powerful influence over Pakistan’s foreign and domestic policies throughout the turbulent ‘decade of democracy’ that followed.
In 1999, the political landscape shifted again when Gen Pervez Musharraf seized power in a coup. Now there was a Musharraf Doctrine. It was fundamentally defined by the global upheaval of the 9/11 attacks. Adopting a ‘Pakistan first’ mantra, Musharraf attempted to balance a high-stakes role as a key US ally in the ‘War on Terror’ with a domestic social vision known as ‘enlightened moderation.’ 
However, the doctrine ultimately collapsed as the country faced the dual pressures of surging Islamist militancy and widespread internal unrest. From 2008 onward, a ‘hybrid system’ began to take shape, creating a political mechanism through which civilian governments were elected to office but remained tethered to strategic doctrines drafted by the military leadership. 
A landmark shift occurred in 2013, with the emergence of the Raheel Sharif Doctrine, authored by the-then army chief. This doctrine represented a fundamental departure from traditional thinking by officially acknowledging that internal militancy posed a far greater existential threat to Pakistan than its historical rivalry with India. 
This shift was swiftly operationalised through a massive military offensive launched to dismantle Islamist sanctuaries and neutralise militant networks. Then, a Bajwa Doctrine surfaced during the tenure of Imran Khan, marking an attempt by former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to once again alter Pakistan’s national security focus. The core of this doctrine was a shift toward geo-economics, prioritising regional trade, transit and the infrastructure connectivity promised by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
However, this vision ultimately fractured under the weight of mounting civil-military discord. While the military leadership sought regional stability to facilitate economic growth, the Khan administration remained preoccupied with an aggressive campaign against political rivals and a polarising effort to ‘rehabilitate’ Islamist militants. 
This divergence in priorities, exacerbated by the stagnation of key CPEC projects, strained the working relationship between Khan and Bajwa. The resulting deadlock concluded in 2022, with Khan’s removal from office through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence.
Appointed as Bajwa’s successor by a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led coalition, Gen Asim Munir oversaw the emergence of what is often referred to as the ‘Munir Model.’ Its outcome is perhaps the most rooted institutionalisation of military authority in Pakistan’s history. 
At its heart lies the concept of economic sovereignty, a framework where the military has moved to take a more active role in steering the nation’s economics. Strategically, the model is defined by a ‘zero-tolerance’ posture, as it maintains a relentless, uncompromising stance against Islamist militants and Baloch separatists. 
The model views internal security and economic stability as two sides of the same coin. By fusing state survival with economic growth and military muscle, the doctrine aims to project Pakistan as an assertive regional power. Geopolitically, the Munir Model is characterised by an intense anti-India tilt. It is deeply pro-China, and closely aligned with Saudi Arabia, while maintaining a pragmatic engagement with the US.
Domestically, the model identifies political populism as an existential threat to the state’s functional integrity. Notably, the doctrine seeks to trim the Islamist dimension from Pakistani nationalism that was added by the Zia Doctrine. 
While Munir’s doctrine remains rooted in Pakistani nationalism, it replaces Islamist fervour with a brand of ‘rational Islam’ and hard-nosed pragmatism. The model has been a success on many fronts, but it will continue to be tested in an increasingly turbulent and mutating geopolitical landscape.

Light snowfall was recorded in parts of Skardu, Kharmang, Shigar, Ghanche, Astore and Ghizer on Friday and Saturday. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast further rain and snowfall in several areas until Jan 23.
Officials said Skardu received about two to three inches of snow on Saturday, while parts of Ghizer saw intermittent snowfall over the past two days.
Light snow was also reported in Hunza, Nagar and other areas last week, but residents said most valleys remained dry, with mountains largely bare and rocky.

Experts warn ‘snow drought’ could worsen flood risk downstream

Muhammad Ali Alam, a resident of Skardu, said the region typically received heavy snowfall by mid-January. “The mountains should be snow-clad by now, but the first snow of the season in Skardu and adjoining areas only fell on Friday,” he told Dawn. He said residents had observed later and lower snowfall over the past two years.
Karim Hayat, a resident of Hussaini village in Upper Hunza’s Gojal valley, said snowfall usually began in late November.
“It is alarming that we are facing a snow drought till January,” he said, adding that the light snow on surrounding peaks would melt quickly in the sun. He also said temperatures remained unusually high until the end of December.
Saeed Farooqi from the Tirashig area of Astore said the district would normally be blanketed in snow by this time. “This year, the area remained dry through January,” he said.
Experts said a shift in winter patterns had been observed across GB in recent years, with snowfall starting later, the areas receiving less snow and temperatures remaining higher than usual.
Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn the region’s fragile ecosystem was being disturbed by climate change and environmental degradation.
He said snowfall had increasingly shifted to mid-January and February, reducing the chance of snow compacting and turning into ice on mountains and glaciers.
“Late snowfall does not compact and can melt rapidly when the summer season starts, which increases the risk of floods downstream,” he said.
Mr Hussain said climate change was a major driver of the shift, but local factors were also contributing. He cited deforestation, unplanned construction of roads and other infrastructure, the influx of tourism and increasing human activity near glaciers.
“Greenhouse emissions, increasing traffic discharge emissions in the fragile environment, human settlements near glaciers, burning of tyres, animal dung and cutting of forests for firewood impacted glaciated areas,” he said.
He said uncontrolled population and increasing human activities in environmentally sensitive areas also contributed to the weather pattern change in the area.
Citing data collected by GBEPA, he said the average temperature in GB rose by about 0.6 degrees Celsius between 1987 and 2013. He said the region had faced a rise in flash floods, accelerated glacial melt and other climate-linked hazards in recent years.

The impressive performance enabled Pakistan to overtake Vietnam and emerge as the world’s third-largest rice exporter, behind India and Thailand, during the month.
According to trade data, Pakistan exported 489,000 tonnes of rice in December 2025, excluding shipments to Iran, compared to Vietnam’s 387,000 tonnes. This marks Pakistan’s best monthly rice export performance, underscoring renewed momentum in the sector.
The UAE remained the top destination for Pakistani rice, importing 74,897 tonnes, including 16,850 tonnes of Basmati. China followed closely with 74,685 tonnes, while other major destinations included Tanzania (62,900 tonnes), Kenya (60,300 tonnes), Ivory Coast (41,700 tonnes), Guinea-Bissau (31,850 tonnes), Malaysia (23,930 tonnes), Madagascar (17,800 tonnes), Kazakhstan (17,050 tonnes), Saudi Arabia (16,032 tonnes, including 5,350 tonnes of Basmati), the EU and UK combined (21,100 tonnes, including 15,600 tonnes of Basmati), Oman (5,770 tonnes), the United States (2,230 tonnes), and Canada (1,321 tonnes).

December surge boosts rankings despite structural challenges

A notable development during December was Pakistan’s growing footprint in Central Asian markets. Exports to Kazakhstan exceeded 17,000 tonnes, including 10,300 tonnes of Basmati, while shipments to Uzbekistan stood at 10,382 tonnes. Industry experts say this reflects a structural shift, as Pakistan is now exporting directly to Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Previously, much of this trade moved indirectly through Afghanistan, but the closure of the Afghan border has prompted direct export routes, making Pakistan’s presence in the region more visible.
Despite the encouraging December figures, the rice export sector continues to face deep-rooted challenges. Structural, financial, marketing, and capacity-related weaknesses persist, with one of the most significant gaps being Pakistan’s negligible exports to Iraq — currently the world’s second-largest importer of Indian Basmati rice after Saudi Arabia. Similarly, Pakistan’s exports to Turkiye, a key transit hub for Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and parts of Eastern Europe, remain minimal.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has recently directed authorities to formulate a comprehensive strategy to boost rice exports and reduce the widening trade deficit.
Government officials have attributed the downturn to low-priced Indian rice and phytosanitary rejections at borders. However, exporters argue that Pakistan’s rice sector is suffering primarily due to policy missteps.
Hamid Malik, a rice sector analyst, says the causes include intense global competition, higher global production — especially in India — weakening international demand, rising ocean freight and logistics costs, inconsistent fiscal and monetary policies, irrational regulatory frameworks, inflated domestic prices caused by hoarding and undocumented money, and security-related border closures.
Amid these challenges, Malik sees several positive developments as a silver lining. “There is strong demand for Pakistani rice in Bangladesh, although higher freight costs have eroded competitiveness.”
Central Asian states are also emerging as promising markets since the start of Pakistan’s harvesting season in October 2025. Additionally, a 50pc tariff imposed by the United States on Indian rice exports has begun to benefit Pakistan, with shipments to the US gradually picking up, says Abu Bakr, an exporter.
Another significant development is unfolding in Iran, where foreign exchange shortages have led the Iranian Central Bank to stop issuing subsidised foreign exchange for rice imports. Iranian traders are now importing rice using their own funds, a shift that has favoured Pakistan due to geographic proximity. Pakistani exporters report a surge in Iranian demand, while Indian exporters have been adversely affected.

The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected Rs6.159 trillion during July-December FY26 against the target of Rs6.490tr, a shortfall of Rs331bn. However, it is 10pc higher compared to the year-ago figure of Rs5.618tr.
The borrowing in 1HFY26 means the government spent much higher than the last year.
This is also interesting to note that the State Bank reported a net profit of Rs2.5tr for FY25, which was transferred to the federal government. Despite this additional liquidity, the government is borrowing heavily from banks.
Banks are comfortable to invest in the government papers as they get risk-free high yields which made the financial sector most stable financial sector.
Last week the banks bids for the treasury bills auctions were Rs2.5tr reflecting the eagerness of banks to park their liquidity in the safest place.
“Investments in government securities remained the main driver of banking sector balance sheet,” said the State Bank in its annual report for 2024-25.

According to an official of the polio laboratory located at the National Institute of Health (NIH), Islamabad, as many as 127 sewage samples from 87 districts were tested for the presence of poliovirus in December 2025. Of these, 87 samples tested negative, while 40 samples were found positive for poliovirus.
“As many as 23 samples were collected from Balochistan, of which 21 were found negative and two were found positive. A total of 34 samples were collected from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, of which 26 were negative and eight were found positive. From Punjab, 31 samples were collected, of which 25 were negative and six were positive. In Sindh, six samples were found negative and 23 were positive. In Islamabad, one out of five samples was found positive. However, five samples collected from Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan were found negative,” the official said.
Replying to a question, the official explained that if the virus causing the crippling disease was found in sewage, the sample was termed positive, while the paralysis of a child caused by the virus was recorded as a positive case. “A sewage water sample from an area is a basic parameter used to determine whether polio vaccination campaigns are being carried out successfully. After detection of positive samples, polio campaigns are immediately launched to eradicate the virus from the area,” he said.
“A polio case can be reported in any city due to the frequent movement of people from one city to another, but the presence of the virus in sewage water means that a vaccination campaign in the area did not meet its target. The presence of the virus in sewage water also indicates that the immunity level of local children has fallen and that they are at risk of the disease,” the official explained.
According to a statement, in 2025 the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, led by the government of Pakistan, conducted six vaccination campaigns, including five nationwide and one subnational drive, reaching over 45 million children.
As part of this roadmap, the first nationwide polio campaign of 2026 will be conducted from February 2 to 8 in all four provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad, aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children under the age of five.
“To further strengthen immunity, the government of Pakistan continues to provide free routine immunisation services for all children up to two years of age. Together, routine immunisation and repeated polio vaccination provide the strongest and most reliable protection against polio and other preventable diseases.
Parents and caregivers are strongly urged to en­­sure that children under five re­­ceive polio drops during every vaccination campaign to protect them from lifelong disability,” it stated.
