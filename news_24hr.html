Urban flooding
The heavy downpour resulted in urban flooding which crippled life in cities like Lahore, Multan, and Faisalabad.
The water submerged underpasses and low-lying neighbourhoods.
In Lahore’s Nishtar Town, continuous rainfall caused flooded roads, leading to traffic jams and power outages.
 
 

PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia has said families of the deceased will be compensated and assisted under the government policy.
He further said that this spell of monsoon rains will continue till July 1. Citizens have been requested to take precautionary measures.
Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman has directed all relevant government departments to be on high alert to deal with potential urban flooding.
In a meeting at the Civil Secretariat, the chief secretary reviewed precautionary measures being taken to address urban flooding.
All deputy commissioners virtually attended the meeting.
Mr Zaman emphasised the importance of putting safety arrangements in place and asked the officers to ensure regular cleaning of drains and sewerage lines.
He said rainwater should be immediately drained from low-lying areas. All dewatering pumps and other machinery must be kept operational to enable swift emergency responses.

• Calls registrars’ role vital in safeguarding interests of men, women
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has ordered the government to simplify Nikahnamas and ensure that nikah registrars are qualified, knowledgeable and persons of integrity to preserve the rights of the bride and groom in a marriage.
The directions were issued in a verdict released on Thursday.
The verdict was authored by Justice Athar Minallah, who was part of a three-judge bench that heard appeals filed by a man and woman who disagreed over the provisions of dower mentioned in the Nikahnama.
Fakhra Jabeen, the woman, filed an appeal against the Dec 13, 2021, verdict of the Lahore High Court, which held that entries in the Nikahnama must always be interpreted in favour of the groom because he has to bear the burden of the liabilities recorded in the contract.
In the 22-page judgement, Justice Minallah regretted the large number of disputes reaching the Supreme Court over the interpretation of entries recorded in Nikahnamas.
The judgement stated that the Nikahnama annexed in the Family Rules needed to be reviewed and made more user-friendly so that “even a literate person of ordinary prudence does not have difficulty in understanding its requirements and the columns”.
The expressions used in the prescribed form are ambiguous and, therefore, open to being misconstrued.
The federal and the provincial governments may, therefore, consider reviewing the Nikahnama to make it more user-friendly and remove the ambiguities likely to arise from the vague and ambiguous expressions used in the headings of the columns, the judgement said.
“This would not only protect the rights of the parties in general, and the women in particular, but would also reduce litigation since a more user-friendly prescribed form of the Nikahnama will give rise to lesser disputes,” the judgement said.
 
 

Qualified registrars
In many cases, the judge noted, such disputes may not have arisen if the headings of the columns were not open to be misconstrued or if the nikah registrar had fulfilled their duties under the law.
He observed the integrity, competence, knowledge and understanding of nikah registrars were crucial for effectively safeguarding the rights of the parties, particularly the women.
These officials were licensed under Section 5(2) of the Muslim Family Laws Ordinance to ensure that both parties exercise their rights and that the entries recorded in the Nikahnama correctly reflect their intention, the judgement said.
The government has a statutory duty to guide union councils in setting out adequate qualifications and criteria for granting licences to nikah registrars.
Moreover, the training and evaluation of these officials would further ensure that social or cultural norms and influences do not prevail over the absolute rights bestowed upon women under the law.
In Punjab, the provincial assembly has made it mandatory for the registrars to accurately fill all columns of the Nikahnama with specific answers of the bride and groom.
Breaching this duty exposes the registrar to penal consequences, i.e. imprisonment for up to one month and Rs25,000 fine, the judgement said, adding the purpose of this legislation was to “protect women from exploitation and provide them with expeditious resolution of family disputes and ancillary matters”.
 
 

The court also directed that the judgement’s copies be sent to the cabinet secretary and provincial chief secretaries to consider the suggestions and observations regarding Nikahnamas and registrars.
“We expect that effective steps would be taken to ensure safeguarding the rights of the parties to a marriage contract, particularly the bride who may be more vulnerable on account of multiple factors, including the cultural and social norms and beliefs,” the judgement observed.

He also thanked the federal cabinet and allied political parties for their support in finalising the budget.

Chairs cabinet meeting; discusses strengthening of Pakistan-US ties with Marco Rubio

Addressing the recent regional developments, PM Shehbaz welcomed the Israel-Iran ceasefire, calling it “crucial to avoid further escalation and loss”.
He expressed gratitude to God for the peaceful resolution and acknowledged the role played by various countries, including Saudi Arabia, in brokering the ceasefire.
“Iran openly thanked the people of Pakistan, its political parties, military, and political leadership for their role in ensuring the ceasefire between the two countries,” PM Shehbaz said.
Regarding the recent attack by Iran on Qatar, he said Pakistan had issued a condemnation statement, reiterating the country’s strong ties with the “brotherly nation”.
Regarding Muharram, PM Shehbaz ordered authorities to enforce strict law and order during processions and gatherings.
He instructed the interior minister to coordinate with provincial governments, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir to maintain peace and security during the month.
Earlier, the cabinet offered Fateha for Major Moeez Abbas Shah, killed in an operation against terrorists in South Waziristan.
The meeting decided to form a committee on gas production and supply, which will submit its suggestions to the Supreme Court.
PM Shehbaz also briefed the cabinet on recent decisions made by the National Security Committee.
The meeting paid tribute to PM Shehbaz, Field Marshal Asim Munir, and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar for their “effective role in de-escalating tension between Iran and Israel”.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb later briefed the cabinet on proposed amendments and suggestions included in the finance bill.
PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction with the fiscal measures taken to stabilise the economy. Later, the federal cabinet approved determining the petroleum levy to the Ministry of Petroleum.
Talks with Rubio
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz spoke with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the PM Office said in a statement.
Mr Sharif praised US President Donald Trump’s “bold and decisive leadership” that led to the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, according to the statement. The prime minister also thanked Rubio for the key US role in a separate Pakistan-India ceasefire.
The two officials agreed to continue working to strengthen bilateral relations, particularly through trade, the statement added.
Exchanging views on the current situation in the Middle East, the premier said Pakistan will maintain its constructive role in Middle East peace efforts.
Mr Rubio responded with desire to collaborate with Pakistan for regional peace and stability.

• US president’s support for PM draws criticism from Israeli politicians
JERUSALEM: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked a court on Thursday to postpone his testimony in his long-running corruption trial, after US President Donald Trump called for the case to be cancelled altogether.
Trump’s move in support of Netanyahu over the case drew criticism from some Israeli politicians, including a member of the Israeli leader’s own coalition and the leader of the opposition.
It came days after Trump and Netanyahu declared victory over Iran in a 12-day conflict that saw Israel bombard the Islamic republic and US planes also drop powerful missiles on its nuclear installations.
In a filing to the tribunal, Netanyahu’s lawyer Amit Hadad said the premier’s testimony should be delayed in light of “regional and global developments”.
“The court is respectfully requested to order the cancellation of the hearings in which the prime minister was scheduled to testify in the coming two weeks,” the filing said.
It said Netanyahu was “compelled to devote all his time and energy to managing national, diplomatic and security issues of the utmost importance” following the conflict with Iran and during ongoing fighting in Gaza.
Trump on Wednesday described the case against Netanyahu as a “witch hunt”.
In a message on his Truth Social platform, Trump said the Netanyahu trial “should be CANCELLED, IMMEDIATELY, or a Pardon given to a Great Hero”, after the end of the war with Iran.
Netanyahu on Thursday thanked Trump for his “heartfelt support for me and your incredible support for Israel and the Jewish people”.
“I look forward to continue working with you to defeat our common enemies, liberate our hostages and quickly expand the circle of peace,” Netanyahu wrote on X, sharing a copy of Trump’s Truth Social post.
 






Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said in an interview with news website Ynet: “We are thankful to President Trump, but… the president should not interfere in a judicial trial in an independent country.”
Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing in the trial, which has been delayed many times since it began in May 2020.
In a first case, Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, are accused of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods such as cigars, jewellery and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favours.
In two other cases, Netanyahu is accused of attempting to negotiate more favourable coverage in two Israeli media outlets.
One of Netanyahu’s coalition allies, Simcha Rothman of the far-right Religious Zionism party, also called for Trump to stay out of the court case.
“It is not the role of the president of the United States to interfere in legal proceedings in the State of Israel,” said Rothman, who chairs the Israeli parliament’s judicial affairs committee.

• Bill to set up autism centre tabled, among others
• Treasury MPA slams ‘illegal raid’ by police                       
LAHORE: The Punjab Asse­mbly on Thursday passed a tax-free budget worth  Rs5.33tr for the fiscal year 2025-26 with a majority vote. It also passed the Finance Bill 2025-26. 
No new taxes have been imposed in the budget, and the existing tax structure also remains unchanged. There are no changes to provincial revenues, property tax, or transport tax. No additional taxes have been levied on any sector, including industry, agriculture, health, or education.
The focus of the budget, in the words of Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman, was on development, with 18 new projects allocated funds across various sectors as the government aimed to stay the course by encouraging economic activity without further tightening the tax net.
Prior to this, 41 demands for grants totaling over Rs4,31bn for various departments were approved, while all the eight cut motions presented by the opposition PTI were rejected by the house with a majority vote.
According to the budgetary allocation, over Rs120bn will be spent on the construction of roads and bridges in the upcoming fiscal year. Over Rs462bn have been set aside for pensioners. Around Rs258bn will be spent on health facilities, while a sum of over Rs137bn will go to the education system.
The police department has been given Rs200bn to maintain law and order, whereas more than Rs27bn will be spent on jail administration, and Rs1bn on civil defence services.
For the welfare of farmers, at least Rs26bn have been apportioned, while over Rs66bn have been earmarked for agricultural loans. 
An amount of Rs37.96bn has been allocated for irrigation projects and Rs18.22bn for industrial development.
Likewise, Rs161bn will go to government buildings, Rs19bn to veterinary services, Rs1.6 bn to fisheries. 
Funds allocated for museums and provision of justice were also approved by the assembly, alongwith grants for registration, stamps, motor vehicle acts, and excise were also approved. 
Four bills tabled
Minister Rehman also tabled four important bills in the house: the Punjab Autism School and Resource Centre Bill 2025, the Urban Immovable Property Tax Amendment Bill 2025, the Essential Commo­dities Price Control Amendment Bill 2025 and the Punjab Labour Courts Bill 2025. These bills were referred to the relevant standing committees, and the speaker requested a report within two months.
During the session, treasury member Saeed Akbar Niwani raised objections about serial numbers 35 and 41 in the dem­a­nds for grants being identical. 
He suggested that it would be better to combine them instead of having separate demands. 
In response, Mr Rehman sta­ted that this has always been the practice and that their PC-1 (Project Concept-1) are different.
He added that if the honoruable member is suggesting combining them, he would inquire whether it is technically possible.
Earlier, the house proceedings started over four hours later than the scheduled time. Spea­ker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan chaired the session.
At the outset of the session, treasury MPA Munawar Ghous erupted on a point of order, condemning the alleged illegal actions of the CCD. He stated that their former councillor was arrested by a CCD DSP, handcuffed, paraded through the market, humiliated, slapped, and had videos made of him. “People’s doors were knocked at and they were told to watch him and make his videos,” he asserted, calling it a violation of the Constitution.
The speaker said if a video clip had been made, it’s illegal and a violation of the high court’s orders and asked the minister for parliamentary affairs to look into this matter, terming it a bad precedent. Mr Rehman assured the chair that he would look into this matter at the earliest.
The speaker also called for disarming the people, saying one person’s enmity is terrifying entire villages. “My request to the minister for parliamentary affairs is to take this matter to the cabinet. Weapons in people’s hands are a cause of fear and terror. Murders are happening in the courts.”
The minister responded that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was already working on disarming the people and eliminating the culture of arms from society.

British-born Wintour, 75, has been one of the most influential and formidable figures in fashion and magazine journalism for decades, famous for her ever-present sunglasses and unchanging bob haircut.
She was widely seen as the inspiration behind The Devil Wears Prada, a hit 2003 novel and 2006 movie, in which the role of a tyrannical magazine editor was played by Meryl Streep.
Wintour, who took the helm at US Vogue in 1988, announced her departure at a staff meeting, but she will stay on as group owner Conde Nast’s global chief content officer and as editorial director at Vogue, People magazine reported.
Several other publications also reported this news.
Wintour, who held the title of Vogue’s editor-in-chief, was made a British dame in 2017 and in February this year was made a companion of honour, joining a select group never numbering more than 65 recognised for major contributions in their field.
At the ceremony in London in February, she removed her trademark sunglasses to receive the award and said she had told King Charles III that she had no plans to stop working.
Wintour, who was raised in the UK by a British father and an American mother, is described by many as the single most powerful person in the global fashion industry.
Her choice of covers for the monthly magazine was seen as authoritative in the publication’s heyday, and she was renowned for her strict control over content, sometimes axing work without discussion.

Karachi has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Last month, a woman was killed and her husband injured when a water tanker hit their motorcycle and ran them over in Korangi, prompting an angry mob to set the water tanker on fire.
Sindh IGP spokesperson Syed Saad Ali revealed in the statement today that the driving school has been established at the Saeedabad Police Training College.
“The Driving Training School will provide training in driving cars, motorcycles, as well as light transport vehicles and heavy transport vehicles,” the statement said.
“Citizens will be taught driving and traffic rules during an 18-hour training course in three phases. The training will include classroom lectures, field driving and computerised education.”
According to the statement, Sindh IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon visited the school, along with other senior police officers and the principal of the school.
He was briefed by the deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Driving License about the school building, classrooms, computer lab and other facilities, the statement said.
IGP Memon was quoted as saying, “The first driving school has been established in Karachi under a pilot project.”
He said that driving training schools will also be established in Hyderabad, Larkana and Khairpur, adding, “The driving training school will also be upgraded this year with the facility of driving simulators.”
He added that the administrative and teaching matters will be under the control of the DIG training branch.
The statement further quoted him as saying, “We have started a training project to promote safe driving because we value the lives and property of citizens.”
Calling road safety the police’s “top priority”, he said, “Learning to drive properly as a responsible citizen is a necessity for every individual, and Sindh Police stands with them in this responsibility.”
“We want every driver to not only be safe on the road but also to be a guarantor of the safety of others,” he said. “The only way to prevent accidents is to have trained drivers. We are working towards that goal.”</p><small>2025-06-26 18:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/26225904fa30a70.jpg?r=230051' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920317/un-climate-chief-warns-lot-more-to-do-before-cop30' target='_blank'><strong>UN climate chief warns ‘lot more to do’ before COP30</strong></a><br><p>UN climate chief Simon Stiell urged countries on Thursday to accelerate negotiations ahead of the COP30 in Brazil, as there was a lot left to be done.
Speaking after two weeks of technical talks in Bonn, Stiell closed the annual climate diplomacy event saying: “We need to go further, faster and fairer.”
Bonn is home to the UN Climate Change Secretariat, which coordinates international climate policy and hosts preparatory talks each year ahead of climate summits.
“I’m not going to sugar coat … we have a lot more to do before we meet again in Belem,” he said.
COP30 is due to be held on November 10-21 in the Amazonian city, which is the capital of Para state.
At last year’s UN COP29 summit in Azerbaijan, rich nations agreed to increase climate finance to $300 billion a year by 2035, an amount decried as woefully inadequate.
Azerbaijan and Brazil, which is hosting this year’s COP30 conference, have launched an initiative to reduce the shortfall, with the expectation of “significant” contributions from international lenders.
This year’s COP (Conference of the Parties) comes as average global temperatures in the past two years have exceeded the 1.5° Celsius benchmark set under the Paris climate accord a decade ago.
“There is so much more work to do to keep 1.5°C alive, as science demands. We must find a way to get to the hard decisions sooner,” Stiell said.
Under the Paris Agreement, wealthy developed countries — those most responsible for global warming to date — are obliged to pay climate finance to poorer nations.
Other countries, most notably China, make voluntary contributions.</p><small>2025-06-26 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/26211305bb657f1.jpg?r=212308' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920309/sco-moot-in-china-unable-to-adopt-joint-statement-pakistan-reaffirms-commitment-to-fight-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>SCO moot in China unable to adopt joint statement; Pakistan reaffirms commitment to fight terrorism</strong></a><br><p>Defence ministers attending the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting on Thursday failed to reach a consensus on a joint statement due to India’s refusal, while Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reaffirmed the country’s commitment to combating terrorism and promoting regional peace and security within the SCO framework.
The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. Their defence ministers’ meeting was held as a precursor to the annual summit of its leaders set for the autumn.
Addressing the session, Asif condemned Israel’s recent 12-day war against Iran and stressed the importance of collective efforts to address evolving global and regional security challenges, state broadcaster PTV News reported.
“Terrorism is a common threat. Pakistan calls on all states to desist from politicising the joint effort of the International Community to fight the means of terrorism to deflect attention from their internal failures,” the defence minister stated.
Noting that Pakistan denounced terrorism in all of its forms, Asif, according to PTV, said that the country condemned the April terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which left 26 people dead.
“We call upon all states to hold these states and their state actions to account who planned, financed and sponsored the terrorist attack as Jaffar Express in Balochistan,” Asif added, not naming the country that aided the attack.
“We have in our custody … a serving Naval Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav [who] confessed to financing, planning and perpetrating multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan.”
 






The defence minister highlighted Pakistan’s continuing role in counter-terrorism, using ongoing operations against the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, the Balochistan Liberation Army and the Islamic State as an example.
The minister “welcomed SCO’s efforts against the ‘three evils’ — terrorism, separatism, and extremism — and emphasised the need to strengthen cooperation in cyber security, anti-narcotics, and counter-extremist ideologies”, PTV’s report read.
During his address, Asif also called for a ceasefire in Gaza and emphasised the need for a stable Afghanistan “for regional connectivity and long-term stability”.
However, a joint communique could not be signed by all members due to what the Indian foreign ministry deemed “a lack of consensus on referring to ‘terrorism’”.
“Certain members, member countries, could not reach [a] consensus on certain issues and hence the document could not be finalised on our side,” Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters at a weekly media briefing, according to The Times of India.
“India wanted concerns on terrorism reflected in the document, which was not acceptable to one particular country, and therefore, the statement was not adopted,” he said, without naming the country.
According to The Times of India, New Delhi refused to sign the document after it omitted a reference to the Pahalgam attack.
A Pakistani official at the moot, who requested anonymity, told Dawn.com that, “India faced diplomatic isolation at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation meeting, where Pakistan achieved significant success.
“India failed to link the Pahalgam incident to Pakistan in the joint communique, declined to sign the communique to cover its embarrassment, received no support from any member state on the Pahalgam issue and also stood alone in its differing stance on Israeli aggression against Iran,” he stated.
Meanwhile, Reuters reported that the foreign ministries of China and Pakistan did not immediately respond to a request for comment on India’s statement.
Earlier on Thursday, when asked about the joint statement, a Chinese defence ministry spokesperson said the meeting had “achieved successful results”, without elaborating.
The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Following the allegations, India launched a series of missile strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations, 24 impacts were recorded across six locations, leaving 33 Pakistani civilians dead and 76 injured. In response, Pakistan’s military shot down five Indian jets and destroyed brigade headquarters and multiple checkposts along the Line of Control.
On the morning of May 10, India targeted several Pakistani airbases, prompting a swift military response from Pakistan under the retaliatory campaign codenamed Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos. It took US intervention for the two countries to declare a ceasefire the same day.
Thursday’s summit was the first time that senior ministers from India and Pakistan had shared a stage since the clash.</p><small>2025-06-26 17:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611095-finding-my-way-malala-says-her-new-book-set-to-launch-in-october-this-year' target='_blank'><strong>'Finding My Way': Malala says her new book set to launch in Oct this year</strong></a><br><p>

Accordingly, the Ashura — Muharram 10 — will be observed on  July 6 (Sunday).
Muharram is the first month of the Islamic calendar. It is also a month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide, commemorating the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where, amongst many, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Imam Husain, was martyred, and other family members were martyred or subjected to humiliation.
A notification by The Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said, “In pursuance of the decision of the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee, in its meeting held today at Quetta, the Federal Government in the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Islamabad, hereby announces that the moon of Muharram-ul- haram 1447 AH has been sighted.”
“Therefore, the 1st Muharram-ul-haram 1447 AH, shall commence from Friday, June 27 2025,” it added.
Govt to tackle religious hate online
Earlier in the day, the Ministry of Interior announced that it planned to take strict action against elements spreading religious hate on social media as part of a security plan ahead of the month of Muharram.
According to a statement from the ministry today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi chaired a meeting aimed at reviewing the security plan for the month.
“It was decided that action will be taken against elements inciting religious hatred on social media in light of Muharram,” it said.
“In this regard, PEMRA (Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority) has been instructed to monitor hateful content on electronic and social media.”
The meeting reviewed the security plan for Muharram in all provinces, including Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Islamabad, in detail, planning to take necessary administrative measures to ensure a peaceful Muharram across the country.
Naqvi promised to cooperate on all possible fronts to ensure peace, particularly in AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad.
On the matter of internet and mobile phone service being suspended during processions, the meeting detailed that the decision will be taken in consultation with each province, keeping in view the security situation of each respective province.
“All the necessary steps and decisions will be taken with the mutual consultation,” the minister said, warning that no one would be allowed to incite religious hatred or provocation.
Karachi police sets up control rooms for security
A day earlier, Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi directed all deputy commissioners to finalise Muharram arrangements in consultation with religious leaders, ulema, and concerned permit holders and organisers of Muharram processions.
According to a statement, deputy commissioners prepared their contingency plans and submitted the details to the commissioner. They said that they have established control rooms for guidance and facilitation.
Karachi district administration decided to provide foolproof security for processions during Muharram.
The commissioner directed all relevant departments to prioritise alternative traffic arrangements, cleanliness, civic facilities, road repairs, water supply, and street lighting.
Commissioner Naqvi also asked K-Electric to avoid load-shedding at processions on Ashura.
A meeting, chaired by Additional Commissioner Ghulam Mehdi Shah,  was attended by senior police officials, Rangers, traffic police, security agencies, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, water board, Sindh Solid Waste Management Board, and other departments.</p><small>2025-06-26 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611057-muharram-moon-sighted-ashura-on-july-6' target='_blank'><strong>Muharram moon sighted, Ashura on July 6</strong></a><br><p>

US President Donald Trump’s administration on Wednesday ordered the resumption of student visa appointments but significantly tightened its social media vetting in a bid to identify any applicants who may be hostile towards the country, according to an internal State Department cable reviewed by Reuters.
US consular officers are now required to conduct a “comprehensive and thorough vetting” of all student and exchange visitor applicants to identify those who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles”, said the cable, which was dated June 18 and sent to US missions on Wednesday.
In Instagram posts uploaded today, the consulates said: “Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to ‘public’ to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States.”

They added that since 2019, the US has required visa applicants to provide social media identifiers on immigrant and nonimmigrant visa application forms. The post stated that applicants had to fill out social media identifiers and account handles for each platform on the application form.
“Omitting social media information on your application could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future US visas,” the consulate warned.
F and M are different student visa types, while the J visa is a nonimmigrant visa for individuals approved to participate in exchange visitor programmes in the US.
On May 27, the Trump administration ordered its missions abroad to stop scheduling new appointments for student and exchange visitor visa applicants, saying the State Department was set to expand social media vetting of foreign students.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said updated guidance would be released once a review was completed.</p><small>2025-06-26 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/26183252ea14ca3.jpg?r=184233' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920303/finance-bill-sails-through-parliament-to-greenlight-rs1757tr-budget' target='_blank'><strong>Finance Bill sails through parliament to greenlight Rs17.57tr budget</strong></a><br><p>The Finance Bill, 2025, was approved by parliament on Thursday, meaning that the Rs17.57 trillion budget for the coming fiscal year has been greenlit.
The PPP on Wednesday voiced strong reservations over a set of politically unpopular provisions in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, urging the government to amend “contentious” clauses ahead of its expected approval in the National Assembly today (Thursday).
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s amendments to various legislation, including the Income Tax Ordnance, 2001, were all approved, while opposition amendments were rejected, according to a Dawn.com correspondent.
The bill was read out in the assembly and approved clause by clause. The session has been adjourned until 11am tomorrow.
 






Addressing the House, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said his party would “happily support the budget,” since the government had accepted the party’s proposals.
“We appreciate the government’s efforts as BISP’s (Benazir Income Support Programme) budget has been increased,” he said. “Moreover, the salaried class will not be taxed if their income equals to Rs1.2m per year and the solar tax has been reduced by 50 per cent.”
Bilawal added that after the PPP’s initial rejection, their recommendations regarding the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) were accepted.
“We are grateful to the government and the prime minister for accepting our proposals,” Bilawal said.
Meanwhile, amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, presented by Aurangzeb were approved by a majority vote in the House.
The amendment granted the finance committee powers to arrest traders involved in tax fraud exceeding Rs50 million. The federal government had earlier proposed an amendment to give the powers of arrest to the tax commissioner.
“The FBR will not have the power of arrest during the investigation stage,” the amendment added.
All amendments introduced by the opposition in the Sales Tax Act were rejected by majority vote.
Similarly, an amendment to the Salaries and Allowances Act was presented with the support of the finance minister, according to which ministers and ministers of state will receive the same salary as members of parliament.
The amendment was approved by a majority vote.
107 institutions granted tax-exempt status
During the session, 107 entities— including lawyers’ bodies, hospitals and government projects — were granted tax-exempt status as part of amendments to the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.
The finance minister’s amendments were all approved, while those presented by the opposition were rejected.
According to the amendments, the following institutions and organisations are exempt from tax:

Provincial bar councils
Pakistan Bar Council
The Military Foundation
Army Welfare Trust
Foundation University
Forman Christian College
LUMS
Ghulam Ishaq Khan University
FBR Foundation
Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital
The Edhi Foundation
Al-Shifa Trust and Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital
The Poverty Alleviation Fund
National Rural Support Programme
National Endowment Scholarship
Pakistan Agricultural Research Council
Audit Oversight Board

Under the amended ordinance, the pensions of former presidents and their widows will also be tax-exempt.
Earlier this month, Aurangzeb unveiled Pakistan’s annual federal budget in a charged National Assembly session, outlining ambitious proposals to drive 4.2 per cent economic growth in the coming fiscal year while cutting back on overall spending and tightening tax measures.
The federal budget for fiscal year 2026 has a total outlay — the sum of expenditures and net lending of funds — of Rs17.573 trillion, representing a 6.9 per cent decrease from the previous year’s budget.
The government has proposed Rs16,286bn for current expenditure in the FY26 budget, a 5.33pc decrease from the previous year.

Illegal production jumped to 3,708 tons, nearly 34 per cent more than in 2022, and more than four times higher than 10 years earlier, when it was at a low, the Vienna-based UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said in its annual report.
The current surge is mainly due to an increase in the size of the area under illicit coca bush cultivation in Colombia and updated yield data, it added.
Global cocaine seizures, too, recorded a high of 2,275 tons, marking a 68pc rise in the four years to 2023. The number of cocaine users also grew to 25 million in 2023, up from 17 million ten years earlier.
 






“Cocaine has become fashionable for the more affluent society,” UNODC chief researcher Angela Me said, noting a “vicious cycle” of increased use and production.
While Colombia remains the key producer, cocaine traffickers are breaking into new markets across Asia and Africa, according to the report, with organised crime groups from the Western Balkans increasing their influence.
Captagon
“A new era of global instability has intensified challenges in addressing the world drug problem, empowering organised crime groups and pushing drug use to historically high levels,” UNODC noted.
In 2023, 6pc of the population aged between 15 and 64 are estimated to have used a drug, compared to 5.2pc of the population in 2013.
Cannabis remains the most widely used drug.
Seizures of amphetamine-type stimulants also reached a record high in 2023, making up almost half of all global seizures of synthetic drugs, followed by synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, UNODC said.
The fall of ruler Bashar al-Assad in Syria last December has “created uncertainty around the future of the captagon trade”, UNODC added.
Earlier this month, Syria said authorities had seized all production facilities of the illicit stimulant, which became Syria’s largest export under Assad.
“The latest seizure data from 2024 and 2025 confirm that captagon is continuing to flow — primarily to countries of the Arabian peninsula — possibly indicating the release of previously-accumulated stockpiles or continued production in different locations,” UNODC said.</p><small>2025-06-26 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/261758184432f42.jpg?r=181026' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920247/7-killed-39-injured-in-multiple-incidents-as-rain-lashes-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>7 killed, 39 injured in multiple incidents as rain lashes Punjab</strong></a><br><p>At least seven people were killed and 39 others were injured in multiple rain-related incidents as Punjab was battered by heavy monsoon showers on Thursday, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and Rescue 1122.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. They are also vital for agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security for South Asia’s nearly two billion people.
Earlier today, the PDMA said that four people died and 19 were injured in rain-related incidents.
According to the data, 13 incidents were reported across Punjab, with the majority of them in the Okara district. Two children are among the four deceased.
The majority of incidents were roof collapses caused by rain.
“Two citizens were killed by the collapse of dilapidated and decaying buildings in Okara and Bahawalnagar,” a PDMA handout read. “Two citizens drowned in Jhelum … 13 dilapidated and mud houses were affected by monsoon rains.”

According to the data, one child was killed in Okara, one in Bahawalnagar and two men in Jhelum.
Punjab rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmed said that the deceased child in Okara was a five-year-old girl.
“[The girl] drowned in a storm drain in Basti Riazabad in Okara,” Ahmed was quoted as saying in a statement. “Another person drowned in a storm drain in Jhelum, while two people were injured in Sohawa. A search operation is underway.”
The spokesperson added that a person in Okara was injured in a lightning strike.
“The public should avoid electric poles, hoarding boards and low-lying areas,” the spokesperson warned, urging them to call 1122 in case of emergencies.
A statement by the Rescue 1122 also confirmed the deaths of one each in Okara, Bahawalnagar, and two in Jhelum.
It further said that two people died when a wall collapsed in Muzaffargarh, while one person died and another was injured after lightning struck in Khanewal.
Rescue 1122 said that emergency rescue services were provided to a total of 46 people in the last 24 hours, including 39 of those who were injured and taken to the hospital.
The statement said, “In Multan, three people were injured when a wall collapsed in Basti Rata,” adding that three others were injured when a roof collapsed in Latifabad.
Another roof collapse incident in Faisalabad injured one person, while two people were injured in more roof collapse incidents each in Shorkot and Sahiwal, according to Rescue 1122.
In Mandi Bahauddin, two children were injured by electrocution, the statement added.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia issued instructions to provide the best available medical assistance to the injured.
“As per the instructions of the Punjab Chief Minister, losses incurred by citizens will be compensated,” Kathia said. “Assistance will also be ensured to the families of the deceased under the government policy.”
DG PDMA also directed citizens to take precautionary measures, stating that this spell of monsoon rains will continue until July 1.
Separately, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had earlier predicted rainfall and thunderstorms across the country, warning of the risk of flash floods and urban flooding.
In a weather forecast, the Met Office said, “moist currents from [the] Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are penetrating in most parts of the country. A westerly wave is also affecting the upper parts of the country.”
The weather agency forecast widespread rainfall and thundershowers on Thursday in Azad Kashmir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and the federal capital Islamabad.
It added that rain thundershowers with gusty winds may also occur at isolated places in southeast Sindh and northeast/south Balochistan during the period.
“On Friday, widespread rain and thundershowers with isolated heavy rainfall is expected in Azad Kashmir, KP, Islamabad, and upper and central Punjab. Rain thundershowers with gusty winds are likely in south Punjab, Sindh and northeast and south Balochistan,” it added.
In the previous 24 hours, the weather agency reported rain and thundershowers in Upper KP, Upper Punjab, Islamabad, Azad Kashmir and northeast Balochistan. Hot and very humid weather prevailed over other parts of the country, it added.

The maximum temperatures recorded yesterday (Wednesday) were Dalbandin 46°C, while Sibbi, Jacobabad, Bhakkar, Bahawalpur, Dadu, and Nokkundi recorded 45°C.
The Met Office warned that heavy rainfall may generate flash floods in local streams of Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, DG Khan, and parts of northeast Punjab and Azad Kashmir.
It further warned that heavy downpour may cause urban flooding in low lying areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera, Charsadda and Peshawar, and in Karachi and Hyderabad on June 27.
“Landslides may cause road closures in the vulnerable hilly areas of KP, Murree, Galliyat, Azad Kashmir during the wet spell,” it added.
It warned that heavy downpour, windstorm and lightning may affect daily routines, and may damage weak structures of houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels during the forecast period.
In light of the forecast, the Punjab government intensified emergency measures following the prediction to receive 25 per cent more monsoon rains this year in the province.
Monsoon rains have commenced in Punjab and the first spell will continue till July 1. Rainfall with strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted in most districts of the province.
Rain expected in Karachi

A Brussels summit held by the group to raise money on Wednesday was overshadowed by a video message sent by US Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, who raised sweeping vaccine safety doubts without evidence and announced an end to Washington’s support.
“We were disappointed to see the video,” Gavi CEO Sania Nishtar told AFP in a phone interview.
“Of course, we disagree with many of the things that were narrated in the video. It’s unfortunate but we are hopeful of a positive relationship with the United States. We will continue to engage them.”
The United States’s funding withdrawal comes as Gavi and the United Nations reported in April that outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles, meningitis and yellow fever are on the rise globally amid misinformation and cuts to international aid.
Gavi secured more than $9 bn (7.7 bn euros) in pledges on Wednesday, short of the $11.9 bn the group said it needed to fund its operations for the next five years, when it hopes “to protect 500 mn children from preventable disease”.
Yet, Nishtar said that was a “positive result” at a time when many donor nations had other priorities, including ramping up defence spending, and as international aid as a whole is in decline.
Despite Washington pulling support, Gavi was “in a very good position,” she added. The United States currently contributes around 13 per cent of the group’s core budget.
Blistering attack
On Wednesday, Kennedy — who spent decades spreading vaccine misinformation before becoming President Donald Trump’s top health official — said the United States “won’t contribute more” until Gavi re-earns “public trust”.
In a blistering attack, he accused the group of pushing unsafe vaccines in the developing world.
“When vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem,” Kennedy said in a clip that was played at the summit.
“In its zeal to promote universal vaccination, it has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,” he added.
 






He raised concerns in particular over a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough, known as DTPw, which is widely used in lower-income nations.
Gavi replied that the DTPw vaccine is used in developing nations as the disease burden there is much higher than in high-income parts of the world.
The shot is more potent, with longer-lasting effects than the alternative used in the West, it added.
“In places where access to hospitals is limited and disease risk is high, the stronger protection from DTPw against these life-threatening diseases far outweighs the temporary side-effects this vaccine may cause,” Gavi said.
Nishtar also questioned the idea that her organisation had to regain public trust.
“We have so much demand for vaccines from the countries that we support that we are unable to fulfil them. When you go to the field, you see women lining up to get the children vaccinated,” she said.
“There’s immense trust already there,” she added
European countries and the European Union jointly pledged more than two billion euros to Gavi, according to Brussels. Another $1.6 bn was offered by the Gates Foundation of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.</p><small>2025-06-26 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/26170052f7eb287.jpg?r=173721' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920290/german-police-shoot-dead-afghan-man-after-officer-stabbed' target='_blank'><strong>German police shoot dead Afghan man after officer stabbed</strong></a><br><p>German police said on Thursday they had shot dead an Afghan man after he used a knife to attack officers trying to arrest him, seriously wounding one of them.
The incident happened in the southern city of Wangen when two officers attempted to detain the 27-year-old man at his home to take him to serve a prison sentence for assault.
“In the course of the operation, the man suddenly pulled out a knife and attacked the officers without warning,” police and prosecutors said in a joint statement. “As a result of the attack, the police officers fired several shots.”
The Afghan died at the scene despite efforts to resuscitate him, they said. One officer was seriously injured after being stabbed several times, but was not in a life-threatening condition.
The authorities have launched an investigation into the use of a firearm by police.
Several serious attacks in Germany carried out in recent times — some by migrants — including knife attacks and car-rammings, fuelling a heated debate on immigration.

On Monday, a pro-military account on Facebook shared a video of two soldiers allegedly recording a video in gratitude to Pakistan.
“Our nuclear programme is safe. Thank you, Pakistan, for protecting it with your intelligence support,” they said.
The post was captioned: “An Iranian soldier thanking Pakistan, saying: Thank you, thank you, thank you.”
The post gained 1.4 million views and 12,000 reactions.
The viral clip was also shared here, here, here, here and here, and on X here, here, here and here.
Another similar video went viral with among social media users on Wednesday, showing Iranian soldiers expressing gratitude to Pakistan, as can be seen here, here, here, here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in diplomatic relations between Iran and Pakistan amid the conflict with Israel.
An observation of the video revealed signs of AI-generated content, including a plastic-like skin texture, unnatural lip movements, and fixed eyes with no blinking throughout the viral clip.
Analysing the video using tools to detect manipulation revealed that Hive Moderation assigned it a 57 per cent suspicion rating, Attestiv.ai gave it a 30pc rating while Deepware did not flag the content as a deepfake.
 


The viral clip also featured a Veo logo on the bottom-right corner, a text-to-video model developed by Google DeepMind.
Looking up the username @isipakistan440 as visible in the clip yielded a TikTok account, featuring similar AI-generated videos with nationalistic content.
As for the second video, an observation showed the same signs of AI-generated content.
Analysing the video using the tool revealed that Hive Moderation assigned it a 31pc suspicion rating, while Deepware did not flag the content as a deepfake.
 


It also featured a Veo logo in the bottom-right corner.
A reverse image search yielded a TikTok post from account @waggyai, featuring the same video posted on Monday.

As evident from the account name, the user routinely posts AI-generated media exploring geopolitical themes.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that viral videos show Iranian armed forces thanking Pakistan for intelligence support against Israel is false. The videos are AI-generated.
Multiple claims
At the same time, iVerify Pakistan observed multiple other claims regarding celebrations in Iran after the ceasefire. Here are more claims that were debunked by the platform.
- Image of Tehran celebrations — FALSE
On Tuesday, a pro-Iranian user shared an image of Tehran’s Milad Tower on X, captioned: “Tehran now … The Iranian capital is celebrating the great victory. Tap like and share the photo.”
The post was seen by more than 2.5m people.
The same image was also shared on X by an Indian actor and film critic, where it garnered over 88,000 views.
Several other X users also shared the same claim as can be seen here, here, here, here, here and here, collectively gaining more than 30,000 views.
It also appeared on Facebook, receiving over 1,000 reactions.
A reverse image search led to an Instagram post by the account lorestan_travel_guide, a self-described tour guide, dated October 27, 2020. The post featured the same image with the caption: “Milad Tower, also known as Tehran Tower, is a multi-purpose tower in Tehran, Iran. It is the sixth-tallest tower and the 24th-tallest freestanding structure in the world.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Additionally, the same image had been shared previously in September and November 2024.
Therefore, the claim that an image shows celebrations in Tehran after the ceasefire is false. The image is not from recent celebrations and has been online since at least 2020.
- Tehran rally thanking Pakistan — FALSE
On Wednesday, an X user shared an eight-second clip showing a large crowd of people gathered on a city street, appearing to be in a celebratory or protest mood.
The caption on the post read, “In today’s rally held in Tehran, young people are holding the Pakistani flag and expressing their gratitude to Pakistan.”
The post received 43,600 views.
“The same clip was shared by several other X users as seen here, here, and here, collectively accumulating 6,000 views.
The clip was also found on TikTok.
Examining the viral clip reveals several inconsistencies. The walking style of the crowd appears unnaturally fast and gliding, giving the impression that individuals are being slid rather than walking naturally.
At the five-second mark, people can be seen moving in different directions and oddly passing through one another. Additionally, those raising their hands while chanting slogans display unusual hand movements — some hands visibly pass through others’ heads.
 


The presence of the “Veo” watermark at the bottom-right corner indicates that the video was created using AI-generated inputs.
Examining the video using AI detection tools revealed that Hive Moderation flagged it with a 99.9pc likelihood of being AI-generated.
 


Therefore, the claim that a video shows Iranians thanking Pakistan in a Tehran rally while carrying the flag is false. The video is a deepfake.

After waves of Israeli attacks on nuclear and military sites and retaliatory missile fire from Iran since June 13, the United States bombed three key Iranian atomic facilities at the weekend.
The extent of the damage in Iran, where Israel said it had acted to stop an imminent nuclear threat, has become the subject of profound disagreement in the United States.
An initial classified assessment, first reported by CNN, was said to have concluded that the strike did not destroy key components and that Iran’s nuclear programme was set back only months at most.
Another key question raised by experts is whether Iran, preparing for the strike, moved out some 400 kilogramme of enriched uranium — which could now be hidden elsewhere in the vast country.
 
 

The US administration has hit back furiously, with Trump repeatedly saying the attack “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear facilities, including the key site of Fordo buried inside a mountain.
“I can tell you, the United States had no indication that that enriched uranium was moved prior to the strikes, as I also saw falsely reported,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.
“As for what’s on the ground right now, it’s buried under miles and miles of rubble because of the success of these strikes on Saturday evening,” she said.
 






Trump said that Hegseth, whom he dubbed “war” secretary, would hold a news conference at 8am (5pm PKT) on Thursday to “fight for the dignity of our great American pilots”.
CIA chief John Ratcliffe said in a statement on Wednesday that “several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years”.
 






The Israeli military said it had delivered a “significant” blow to Iran’s nuclear sites but that it was “still early” to fully assess the damage.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that “we have thwarted Iran’s nuclear project”.
“And if anyone in Iran tries to rebuild it, we will act with the same determination, with the same intensity, to foil any attempt,” he said.
Nuclear talks?
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei told Al Jazeera that “nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that’s for sure”.
After the war derailed nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, Trump said Washington would hold discussions with Tehran next week, with his special envoy Steve Witkoff expressing hope “for a comprehensive peace agreement”.
Trump told reporters that Israel and Iran were “both tired, exhausted”, before going on to say that talks were planned with Iran next week.
“We may sign an agreement. I don’t know,” he added.
Iran has systematically denied seeking a nuclear weapon while defending its “legitimate rights” to the peaceful use of atomic energy.
It has also said it was willing to return to nuclear negotiations with Washington.
In both Iran and Israel, authorities have gradually lifted wartime restrictions.
Iran on Wednesday reopened the airspace over the country’s east, yet without allowing flights to and from the capital Tehran.
In the Israeli coastal hub of Tel Aviv, 45-year-old engineer Yossi Bin welcomed the ceasefire: “Finally, we can sleep peacefully. We feel better, less worried… and I hope it stays that way.”
State funeral
While Iran and Israel have been locked in a shadow war for decades, their 12-day conflict was by far the most destructive confrontation between them.
The Israeli strikes on Iran killed at least 627 civilians, Tehran’s health ministry said.
Iran’s attacks on Israel killed 28 people, according to official figures.
According to Mehr news agency, the funeral of Revolutionary Guard commander Hossein Salami, who was killed in an Israeli strike, will no longer be held in his hometown on Thursday.
Instead, a state funeral will be held on Saturday in Tehran for top commanders, including Salami and nuclear scientists, killed in the war.</p><small>2025-06-26 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/261446234e377d9.jpg?r=144941' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920266/interior-ministry-vows-to-take-strict-action-against-religious-hate-online-during-muharram' target='_blank'><strong>Interior ministry vows to take strict action against religious hate online during Muharram</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Interior on Thursday announced that it planned to take strict action against elements spreading religious hate on social media as part of a security plan ahead of the month of Muharram.
The government has ramped up security efforts in the past few weeks as the first month of the Islamic calendar inches closer. KP and the Punjab government have planned to impose Section 144 across the province from Muharram 1 to 10, barring public gatherings, protests, or other actions that might disrupt peace.
The central Ruet-e-Hilal committee is set to meet today for the sighting of the moon for Muharram.
According to a statement from the ministry today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi chaired a meeting aimed at reviewing the security plan for the month.
“It was decided that action will be taken against elements inciting religious hatred on social media in light of Muharram,” it said.
“In this regard, PEMRA (Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority) has been instructed to monitor hateful content on electronic and social media.”
The meeting reviewed the security plan for Muharram in all provinces, including Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Islamabad, in detail, planning to take necessary administrative measures to ensure a peaceful Muharram across the country.
Naqvi promised to cooperate on all possible fronts to ensure peace, particularly in AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad.
On the matter of internet and mobile phone service being suspended during processions, the meeting detailed that the decision will be taken in consultation with each province, keeping in view the security situation of each respective province.
“All the necessary steps and decisions will be taken with the mutual consultation,” the minister said, warning that no one would be allowed to incite religious hatred or provocation.
Detailing further security measures, he shared that Muharram processions will be monitored via modern technology.
Inspector general (IG) of police and Secretaries from all provinces, including Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan, Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, as well as the capital, gave a briefing on the security plan at the meeting.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, federal secretary interior, acting chairman CDA, commandant Frontier Constabulary, deputy commissioner Islamabad, deputy inspector general of police Islamabad, ministry of interior and senior officials of law enforcement agencies were also present at the meeting.
Meanwhile, other senior officials of law enforcement agencies attended the meeting via video link.
Muharram is a month of mourning, observed in particular by Shia Muslims worldwide.
It commemorates the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD, where, amongst many, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Imam Husain, was martyred, and other family members were martyred or subjected to humiliation.
Keeping in view the need for extra security due to the spike in religious activity during the first 10 days of Muharram, authorities make arrangements accordingly.
Last week, the Punjab home department took additional security measures, including the deployment of armed forces where required, to ensure peace in the province during Muharram.</p><small>2025-06-26 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611038-will-punjab-suspend-cellular-services-during-muharram' target='_blank'><strong>Will Punjab suspend cellular services during Muharram?</strong></a><br><p>

The London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed moments after takeoff from India’s Ahmedabad city on June 12, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and the rest on ground in the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
The black boxes of the plane — the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) — were recovered in the days that followed, one from the rooftop of a building at the crash site on June 13, and the other from the debris on June 16.
 
 

They were transported to national capital Delhi on Tuesday, where a team led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau began extracting their data, the ministry said in a statement.
“The Crash Protection Module (CPM) from the front black box was safely retrieved, and […] the memory module was successfully accessed and its data downloaded […] the analysis of CVR and FDR data is underway,” it said.
The CPM is the core part of a black box that houses and protects data recorded during a crash.
 
 

India said last week that it was yet to decide where the black boxes would be analysed. The data retrieved from them could provide critical clues into the aircraft’s performance and any conversations between the pilots preceding the crash.
The air disaster has also brought renewed attention to violations of norms by airlines in the country.
India’s aviation regulator said on Tuesday that multiple instances of aircraft defects reappearing were found at the Mumbai and Delhi airports — two of India’s busiest.
Reuters has reported that warnings were given by India’s aviation regulator to Air India, which has come under increased scrutiny since the crash, including for permitting some aircraft to fly despite emergency equipment checks being overdue.
The airline has also been warned for violations related to pilot duty scheduling and oversight.
Air India has said it had implemented the authority’s directions and was committed to ensuring adherence to safety protocols.
It also said it was accelerating verification of maintenance records and would complete the process in the coming days.</p><small>2025-06-26 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611024-provinces-to-be-consulted-on-muharram-mobile-internet-suspensions' target='_blank'><strong>Provincial govts to be consulted on suspension of mobile, internet services during Muharram</strong></a><br><p>

Enacted in January this year, the act aimed to transform Pakistan into a “digital nation” by enabling a digital society, digital economy, and digital governance. The bill was approved by the federal cabinet in June 2024.
The bill said it was expedient to enable the people to become a digital nation by leveraging the transformative power of digital technologies, responsible use of data, innovative service delivery models and robust digital public infrastructure to accelerate sustainable economic development, improve citizen well-being, and modernise governance frameworks for efficient and effective public service delivery.
According to a notification issued today by the ministry of IT and telecommunication, “the search committee will appoint a chairperson and two members of the PDA.”
Federal Minister for IT Shaza Fatima Khawaja has been appointed as the convener of the search committee.
 
 

The committee will recommend three candidates for each position and make recommendations regarding salaries and benefits of the chairman and members.
Other members of the committee include the federal minister for the economic affairs division, as well as secretaries of the cabinet division, establishment division and IT and telecom division.
The Digital Nation Bill encompasses the establishment of three new bodies. The PDA will comprise a chairperson and two members, to develop, implement, and monitor the national digital master plan. This authority will also establish a monitoring and evaluation framework for digital transformation projects.
The srategic oversight committee will be headed by the IT minister, with secretaries of IT, finance, and planning, and representatives from the private sector as its members.
Upon being passed, Chairman of the NA committee Syed Aminul Haque highlighted the importance of approving the bill, stating that it was essential to transform Pakistan into a digital nation.
“The aim is to create a progressive digital society as well as promote a thriving digital economy, for which we need to establish a shared digital governance ecosystem,” Haque said, adding that all measures should not be viewed through the political lens.
He stressed that digitisation was a technical matter — a need of the times.</p><small>2025-06-26 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/26134225c66bbfe.png?r=134242' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920254/pakistan-concerned-over-worst-form-of-torture-in-palestine-indian-occupied-kashmir-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan concerned over ‘worst form of torture’ in Palestine, Indian-occupied Kashmir: FO</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has expressed concerns over the “worst forms of torture” the people of Palestine and Indian-occupied Kashmir are being subjected to by foreign occupation powers, the Foreign Office said in a statement on Thursday.
There have been widespread reports of systematic torture and human rights violations by Indian occupation forces in held Jammu and Kashmir since the region was unilaterally annexed in 2019. Pakistan continues to provide political, moral, and diplomatic support to Kashmiris until they realise their inherent right to self-determination as per the UNSC resolutions.
In Gaza, Israeli forces have killed 56,156 people and injured 132,239 in the enclave since launching a military onslaught in October 2023. A human rights monitor published a report detailing the “shocking” treatment of Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons.
“Pakistan remains gravely concerned at the widespread and systematic use of torture as an instrument of oppression in situations of foreign occupation” the FO statement said on the occasion of the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.
“The people of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) continue to be subjected to the worst forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the occupying powers to suppress their right to self-determination.”
Pakistan stands in solidarity with the victims of torture worldwide and reaffirms its continued commitment to eradicating torture and upholding human dignity, it added.
“Islam upholds the sanctity and dignity of every human being. Any act of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is incompatible with the values of justice, mercy, and compassion that are at the core of Islamic teachings.
“Guided by these values and its international obligations Pakistan remains committed to eradicating torture and strengthening protections for all individuals,” the statement said.
It added that “legal reforms, institutional safeguards, and oversight mechanisms continue to be strengthened by Pakistan to ensure accountability and uphold the rule of law,” adding that “measures are also being taken to provide victims with medical, legal, and psycho-social support.”
Pakistan reiterates its call on the international community to condemn the crimes of these occupying powers and to hold them accountable, in addition to helping end the plight of the victims of their torture and oppression, the FO concluded.
The UN General Assembly proclaimed 26 June as the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture. It marks the moment when the in 1987 when the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment came into effect.
The day is an opportunity to call on all stakeholders including UN member states, civil society and individuals to unite in support of people around the world who have been victims of torture and those who are still tortured today.</p><small>2025-06-26 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611017-karachi-braces-for-first-spell-of-monsoon-rains-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi braces for first spell of monsoon rains from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>

Beijing has long sought to present the 10-member Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as a counterweight to Western-led power blocs and has pushed to strengthen collaboration between its member countries in politics, security, trade and science.
The Qingdao meeting of the organisation’s top defence officials comes as a fledgling ceasefire between Israel and Iran holds after 12 days of fighting between the arch-foes.
It is also being held the day after a summit of Nato leaders in The Hague, where members agreed to ramp up their defence spending to satisfy United States President Donald Trump.
Beijing’s ties with Moscow are also in the spotlight.
China has portrayed itself as a neutral party in Russia’s war with Ukraine, although Western governments say its close ties have given Moscow crucial economic and diplomatic support.
 
 

Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov painted a bleak picture of a world seeing “worsening geopolitical tensions” when he addressed his counterparts at the meeting.
“The current military and political situation in the world remains difficult and shows signs of further deterioration,” he said, according to a statement by the Russian defence ministry.
His Chinese counterpart Dong Jun also framed Thursday’s meeting in Qingdao, home to a major Chinese naval base, as a counterweight to a world in “chaos and instability”.
“As momentous changes of the century accelerate, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise,” Dong said as he welcomed defence chiefs from Russia, Iran, Pakistan, Belarus and elsewhere on Wednesday, according to state news agency Xinhua.

“Hegemonic, domineering and bullying acts severely undermine the
international order,” he warned.

He urged his counterparts to “take more robust actions to jointly safeguard the environment for peaceful development”.
Backing for Iran?
Recent fighting between Israel, Iran and the US will likely also be discussed in Qingdao.
Beijing refrained from offering anything more than diplomatic support to its close partner Tehran throughout that conflict, reflecting its limited leverage in the region and reluctance to worsen relations with the US.
“Public backing for Iran will come in the form of words, rather than deeds,” James Char, an expert on the Chinese army at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, told AFP.
“Other than condemning the US strikes on Iran, Beijing can be expected to continue treading cautiously in the Middle East’s security issues and would not want to be dragged into the region’s security challenges,” he said.
Iran’s defence minister will likely “discuss with China the supply of weapons but I doubt China would agree”, said Andrea Ghiselli, an expert in China foreign policy and a lecturer at Exeter University.
“It would be seen as provocative by both Israel… and, even more important for China, the US, with which Beijing is trying to stabilise relations,” Ghiselli said.
India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, also in attendance in Qingdao, said SCO members should “collectively aspire to fulfil the aspirations and expectations of our people as well as tackle today’s challenges”.
“The world we live in is undergoing a drastic transformation.
Globalisation, which once brought us closer together, has been losing momentum,” he said in comments his office posted on social media platform X.

The Special Investigation Unit of the Sindh police and an intelligence agency conducted the raid on a tip-off, SIU SSP Mohammed Shoaib Memon said, adding that they had links with the Indian intelligence agency — the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).
He identified the suspects as Mohammed Khan alias Gullu, Yameen Malah, Akhter Thaheem and Ghulam Qadir alias Akash, and claimed that they were found involved in espionage activities.
With their arrest, a plot to carry out terror attacks in the country was foiled, he said.
SSP Memon said that two hand grenades, a Kalashnikov, a rifle, two pistols and mobile phones were seized from them. The mobile phones, believed to be containing sensitive digital material, have been sent for a forensic analysis, he said.
“The suspects had made videos and captured pictures of the country’s sensitive installations, which they used to send to RAW using specialised software,” the SIU officer claimed.
According to him, the suspects admitted that they used to meet officers of RAW and Indian Border Security Force in border areas.
They received large sums of cash, liquor and valuable gifts from Indian agencies’ personnel, the SSP said.

Speaking at a webinar titled “Opportunities in Pakistan’s Mining Sector – Unlocking Mineral Potential”, the minister highlighted the country’s rich endowment of mineral resources, including gold, copper, coal, rare earth elements and other critical minerals vital for the global energy transition.
The event was jointly organised by the Ministry of Energy and the US Embassy in Pakistan to promote investment opportunities in the country’s minerals and mining sector.
Mr Malik assured that both the Government of Pakistan and the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) are fully committed to facilitating international companies seeking to partner in unlocking Pakistan’s mineral reserves.
He emphasised Pakistan’s growing role in the global shift towards clean energy, citing the nation’s abundant reserves of critical minerals as a key enabler of a green transition. “Renewable energy development is central to our climate goals and economic future. We are facilitating this shift by supporting the mining of essential minerals and improving ease of doing business,” he stated.
 
 

The minister underscored the international significance of the Reko Diq copper-gold project, while also referencing recent discoveries in Balochistan’s Chaghi district and KP’s Waziristan region.
Mr Malik lauded the success of the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025 (PMIF25), held earlier this year, which attracted over 5,000 participants and global attention. “PMIF25 marked a turning point, showcasing Pakistan as a serious player in the global minerals economy,” he remarked.
US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker reaffirmed the strong economic ties between the US and Pakistan. “Pakistan offers immense opportunities in the minerals sector. With one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits at Reko Diq, and a strong commitment to economic reforms, this is the right time for US investors to explore and engage,” she said.
Ms Baker welcomed Pakistan’s recent policy initiatives aimed at unlocking the sector’s potential and pledged continued support from the US Embassy in facilitating American businesses. “We are here to foster connections and build win-win partnerships. US investors have long contributed to Pakistan’s development, and we see great promise in this sector,” she added.
She concluded by reaffirming the US government’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s economic development and strengthening bilateral economic ties. “We believe in Pakistan’s potential and see shared opportunity in its journey toward inclusive, sustainable growth,” she said. The webinar was broadcast from the head office of Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL) and brought together senior officials from the Ministry of Energy, leading mineral and energy firms, SIFC representatives, US diplomats, and energy sector stakeholders.
