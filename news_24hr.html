The talks, which began in April, are the highest-level contact between the foes since the United States quit a landmark 2015 nuclear accord during President Donald Trump’s first term.
Since returning to office, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran, backing talks but warning of military action if diplomacy fails.
Iran wants a new deal that would ease the sanctions which have battered its economy.
“The fifth round of Iran-US talks have concluded today in Rome with some but not conclusive progress,” Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said on X, adding that he hoped “the remaining issues” would be clarified in the coming days.
 






Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei had earlier said that chief US negotiator Steve Witkoff had left the talks “due to his flight schedule”.
The fourth round of talks, in the Omani capital Muscat, ended with a public spat over enrichment.
Witkoff said Washington “could not authorise even one per cent” enrichment — a position Tehran called a red line, citing its rights under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
‘Fundamental differences’
Ahead of Friday’s talks, Araghchi said “fundamental differences” remained with the United States, while adding that Tehran was open to its nuclear sites undergoing more inspections.
“We will not have an agreement at all” if the United States wants to prevent Iran from enriching uranium, he said.
The talks came ahead of a June meeting of the UN nuclear watchdog, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the October expiry of the 2015 accord.
The deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, aimed to allay Western suspicions that Iran was seeking a nuclear weapons capability, an ambition that Tehran has consistently denied.
 
 

In return for curbs on its nuclear programme, Iran had received relief from international sanctions. But the accord was torpedoed in 2018 when Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States and reimposed sanctions.
A year later, Iran responded by ramping up its nuclear activities.
It is now enriching uranium to 60pc — far above the deal’s 3.67pc cap but below, though close to, the 90pc level needed for a nuclear warhead.
‘It’s quite simple’
Analysts in Tehran said Iran was unlikely to back down.
“It’s quite simple; if the US expects Iran to halt nuclear enrichment, then there can’t be a deal,” said Mohammad Marandi, a political scientist who was once an adviser on the nuclear issue.
The Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran says the country’s nuclear industry employs 17,000 people, similar to other countries where uranium is enriched for civilian use.
“The Netherlands, Belgium, South Korea, Brazil and Japan enrich [uranium] without possessing nuclear weapons,” its spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said.
Iran’s enmity with Israel, whose main backer is the United States, has been a constant backdrop to the talks.
In a letter to the United Nations, Araghchi wrote: “We believe that in the event of any attack on the nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Zionist regime, the US government will also be involved and bear legal responsibility.”
The warning came after CNN, citing unnamed US officials, reported Israel was making preparations to carry out such a strike.
The White House said Trump had a “productive discussion” with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday about Iran and the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staff in Washington.
‘Irreversible’
The 2015 deal provides for the possibility of UN sanctions being reimposed through a mechanism called “snapback” if Iran fails to fulfil its commitments.
The agreement’s three European parties — Britain, France and Germany — have warned they will trigger the mechanism if the continent’s security is threatened.
Araghchi said such a move would have “consequences — not only the end of Europe’s role in the agreement, but also an escalation of tensions that could become irreversible”.</p><small>2025-05-23 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23150002e7ab7a5.jpg?r=204314' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912830/khuzdar-attack-driven-by-indian-provocation-had-nothing-to-do-with-baloch-identity-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Khuzdar attack driven by Indian provocation, had nothing to do with Baloch identity: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has reiterated that “Indian state-sponsored terrorism against Pakistan” — which he said had been ongoing since the inception of the country — was also responsible for the recent attack in Balochistan’s Khuzdar.
On May 21, at least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
On Thursday, the army’s top brass, during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC), had also pointed out India’s involvement in the incident, vowing that the armed forces will prevent the country’s peace from being compromised by “externally-sponsored terrorism.”

Key points

Initial findings confirm that Khuzdar attack fits pattern of violence sponsored by India through Fitnah al Hindustan
“Pakistan has irrefutable evidence of Indian involvement in terrorism,“says DG ISPR
DG ISPR, interior secretary reiterate that Pakistan will not let India succeed
Says BLA has expressed willingness to be Delhi’s “practical and military arm”
DG ISPR vehemently criticises BYC, says media needs to “unmask” the group
Says attacks have no relation to Baloch identity


Lt Gen Chaudhry was addressing a press conference in Islamabad today alongside the Interior Secretary, Captain (retd) Khurram Muhammad Agha.
“India was planning and instructing terrorist activities taking place in Pakistan, the funding for which is also provided by India,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The attack in Balochistan had nothing to do with the Baloch identity, rather it was just India’s provocation.”
The DG ISPR highlighted that the attack on the Chinese envoy in Karachi in Oct 2024 also had Indian backing. “The Indian social media accounts affiliated with the Indian intelligence agency RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) posted about the attack beforehand.”
 
 

He added that the same thing happened during the hijacking of the Jaffar Express train in March when more than 400 passengers were taken hostage by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists.
“Before the Jaffer Express incident occurred, they [the social media accounts] were asking followers to ‘keep an eye on Pakistan today and tomorrow’.”
Lt Gen Chaudhry pointed out that the Indian media was “celebrating” the attack in Khuzdar.
“These are all Indian accounts, affiliated with RAW [and] posting for BLA and Fitnah al Hindustan, he said, referring to the government-designated term for all terror outfits in Balochistan. “What kind of a country celebrates acts of terrorism?”

Indian involvement in terrorism ‘since inception of Pakistan’
The DG ISPR also maintained that New Delhi had been involved in perpetrating terrorism across the country “since the inception of Pakistan.”
“In 2009, the Pakistani government handed a dossier containing irrefutable evidence [of India’s involvement in terror attacks across Pakistan] to the Indian prime minister,” he said. “The publicly disclosed documents released in 2010 are part of history. In 2016, the world saw another ugly face of India-sponsored terrorism in Balochistan in the form of [Indian spy] Kulbushan Jadhav, a serving Indian naval officer,” he said.
Jadhav was arrested on March 3, 2016, in a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan’s Mashkel area for his involvement in espionage and sabotage activities against Pakistan.
“Then in [2020], a dossier full of evidence was presented to the United Nations. Very recently, the international media has seen confessions and acknowledgement of multiple surrendered terrorists of this Fitnah al Hindustan,” he said.
Interior Secretary Agha also said that India was behind the terrorist incident in Khuzdar on May 21.
“In the aftermath of the despicable terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar in the early morning of May 21, this cowardly attack targeted innocent children, our future, resulting in the tragic loss of six children and injuries to 31 others.
“Let me be unequivocal that this was not an attack on a bus alone, it was an attack on our values, our education, and the very fabric of our society,” Capt (retd) Agha said.

“On behalf of the government of Pakistan, I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims, we share their grief and we stand by them in this hour of immense suffering. The Ministry of Interior, in close cooperation with the provincial authorities and the law enforcement agencies, is looking into all [aspects] of this dastardly attack.”
Capt (retd) Agha said initial findings confirmed that this attack was a continuation of a broader pattern of violence sponsored by India through Fitnah al Hindustan, operating under the tutelage and intelligence of the Indian intelligence agency, RAW [Research and Analysis Wing].
“Having miserably failed in the so-called Operation Sindoor, the terror proxies of Hindustan have been tasked to accentuate their heinous attacks of terrorism in Balochistan and elsewhere. Let me be absolutely clear here, the people of Pakistan will not let them succeed.
“Pakistan and its people, particularly in Balochistan, reject this nefarious design. The state has the capacity and the will to dismantle these networks and bring the perpetrators and their handlers to justice. Such actions will have consequences.”
He said in the past couple of years, having suffered immense casualties in their attempts against hard targets, Fitnah al Hindustan has resorted to hitting soft targets, wayfarers, labourers working on development projects, infrastructure and machinery to paint a picture of loosening control of the State.
“Much against the tradition and culture of the Baloch, these terrorists have stooped so low that innocent school children have now been targeted. I assure you that the State, in collaboration with the provincial governments and the state apparatus, will defeat them.
“These Indian-sponsored terrorists have no place in Pakistan and our national discourse. We have … commitment to bring an end to this violence. Our resolve is firm and our response will be decisive. They will not succeed.”
‘Will we be deterred? Absolutely not’
Lt Gen Chaudhry then spoke about the Indian attacks on Pakistan on May 6 and 7, which were carried out by New Delhi after blaming Islamabad for April’s Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir and led to civilian deaths.
“Never in modern history have you seen any nation, any media celebrating the killing of children and women the way [India] is celebrating.
“This is the low moral fibre and level that the current Indian political elite has brought the society to.”
 
 

He said that one of the proxies of the Fitnah al Hindustan on May 11 issued a press release displaying a post from BLA.
In the post, he said that the BLA had assured India that if it received “political, diplomatic and defence support” from New Delhi, “We, along with the entire nation, is ready to attack from the western border and we will become its [India’s] practical and military arm”.
He said that RAW made BLA issue this press release “because they are unable to deter the state of Pakistan … They attack but the resolve of Pakistani people has not diminished.”
“Will we be deterred by the Fitnah al Hindustan with such press releases and cowardly actions? Absolutely not. Never,” he said.

He further said, “Instead of refraining from their oppression of minorities or finding a solution, India is carrying out terrorist activities in Pakistan and the region.”
“They are externalising internal issues and when anyone asks for evidence, they do not have evidence. Who is the state sponsor of terrorism and the epicentre of destabilisation in this region?” he questioned.
The DG ISPR also called out the Indian media for spreading propaganda and said: “The Indian media is not free but controlled by the state,” he said, adding that those who were questioning media freedom in Pakistan were now aware of how free it was, compared to the “conditions of media in a so-called democracy [India].”
‘Terrorists who surrendered confessed to having links with India’
Speaking about terrorists who had surrendered before the State, the DG ISPR said: “There were some brave ones who stood up and surrendered because they realised that they were not there to fight India’s war. They [surrendered terrorists] come and tell us how India was involved.”
He highlighted the case of Adeela Baloch, a former militant who had surrendered herself to the authorities.
“She was exploited and blackmailed by the Fitnah al Hindustan to become a suicide bomber,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, adding that India was “exploiting young women from Balochistan.”
In response to a question about a policy to counter Fitnah al Hindustan, the DG ISPR replied: “I would say that our one-liner policy is that the nation, this iron wall, we fought in a gallant and exemplary manner against the Indian military aggression on the night of [May] 6 and 7, and you saw it again on May 10.
“This steel wall needs to be in unison and turned against the forces of terrorism.”
The DGR ISPR further said: “We need to understand certain facts. Why did the Indians feel the need to resort to this military escalation? One of the very important reasons was that all elements of national power over the last two years have gelled together.”
He went on to say that Pakistan had begun “squeezing the space for terrorists to operate” and that in the first five months of this year, 203 terrorists had been killed in Balochistan alone.
“Illegal Afghans are being pushed out and actions are being taken against the crime-terror nexus. In Balochistan, illegal trade routes are being shut down to stop funding for these terrorists,” DG ISPR added.
Answering another question, the DG ISPR vehemently criticised the Baloch Yakjehti Committee and its leader Dr Mahrang Baloch, saying that the media needed to “unmask” the group and its membership.
“The state has taken action against the BYC [and] their space has been squeezed,” he said.
He said that India’s military escalation was a necessity to create space for their proxy groups in the region, but stated that Pakistan did not disengage a single soldier from its counterterrorism force.
“Did we take even one soldier out? No. Because we knew they would operate in unison.”
He added that India was growing frustrated and desperate, stating that the country’s media was “howling” about Balochistan.
“It is clear that this is not a war of the Baloch, it is a war against Indian terror proxies who are killing children for money. Once they know it, then they get worried,” DG ISPR said.
‘A rational player’
DG ISPR reiterated that Pakistan was the “rational player” in the scenario with India and stated that the Pahalgam attack took place due to “India’s own oppression in Kashmir”.
“Their response was totally irrational, illogical and unilateral,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “Pakistan is approaching the issue of terrorism in Balochistan rationally because we are resolving it in unison and with the synergetic application of all elements of national power.
“[The] military is one part, where we have carried out more than 93,000 operations across Pakistan in one and a half years,” he added. Another part is socioeconomic, another is diplomacy, while the other part is us sitting here telling the people and the international community that this has nothing to do with Balochistan.
“This is state-sponsored terrorism by India.”
DG ISPR added that Pakistan “striking Indian cities and temples” would not resolve the problem, adding that “that is not how a rational state acts.
“We are going to tell the world … that this is the epicentre of destabilisation in this region, India,” he added. “[They have] a history that starts from 1971 with the Mukti Bahini, and even before. And in multiple countries of this region. I will not name it now but there is proof, the world knows it.”</p><small>2025-05-23 16:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2320444684bd3c5.jpg?r=205004' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912859/20-year-term-sought-for-french-surgeon-in-mass-patient-abuse-trial' target='_blank'><strong>20-year term sought for French surgeon in mass patient abuse trial</strong></a><br><p>A French prosecutor on Friday requested the maximum 20-year sentence for a former surgeon who admitted to sexually abusing almost 300 mostly child patients.
An additional trial will also likely be required for Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, to cover the cases of further victims whose abuse is not part of the current process, said prosecutor Stephane Kellenberger as he outlined the sentencing demands.
Le Scouarnec has been on trial since February accused of 111 rapes and 189 sexual assaults on 299 people, mostly of minors under 15, at a dozen hospitals in western France, in one of the country’s largest child sex abuse cases.
He admitted in March to sexually abusing all 299 victims between 1989 and 2014, many while they were under anaesthesia or waking up after operations.
Le Scouarnec, who is already in prison for a previous conviction for child sex abuse, should receive the maximum possible term of 20 years in jail on the single charge of aggravated rape, said Kellenberger.
Warning of the “high risk of re-offending” in the case of Le Scouarnec, Kellenberger said the defendant should serve at least two-thirds of his term in jail before being allowed any chance of parole.
Even once released, he should be placed in a centre for treatment and supervision, in a special but rarely used measure allowed under French law, the prosecutor added, pointing to the accused’s “serious personality disorders and the danger posed by these disorders”.
The verdict is expected on Wednesday.
Other victims ‘not forgotten’
The months of hearings have been marked by horror over the acts of the ex-surgeon, who confessed to the abuse, but also frustration over the failure of medical and judicial authorities to act sooner.
Kellenberger said that “in a case of this magnitude”, spanning from 1989 to 2014 and across multiple areas in France, the judicial authorities have not identified every one of the victims, at least within the time limits set for this trial.
But “these victims have not been forgotten”, and “further investigations are underway and could lead to a trial”, he said.
“There will probably be another Le Scouarnec procedure,” he told the court.
The former surgeon practised for decades until his retirement in 2017, despite a 2005 conviction for owning sexually abusive images of children.
Directly addressing the question of why the surgeon was allowed to carry on practising, the prosecutor asked: “Should Joel Le Scouarnec have been alone in the dock?”
“It could have been done better, could have been done differently, even with the well-known complexities of French bureaucracy, with everyone happily passing it on until it’s lost and hurts innocent people,” he said.
‘Utterly guilty’
The former surgeon told the court on Tuesday he also felt “responsible” for the deaths of two of the victims — Mathis Vinet, who died after an overdose in 2021 in what his family says was suicide, and another man who was found dead in 2020.
Le Scouarnec said he had “come to terms” with his actions.
The former doctor is already in prison after being sentenced in December 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces.
“He is utterly guilty,” said one of his lawyers, Maxime Tessier.
While the surgeon admitted responsibility, he also repeatedly said he did not remember his acts anymore.
There has been frustration among some parties in the trial that it has not had the impact in France that they hoped for. The case has not won the attention given to the case of Dominique Pelicot, who was jailed last year for recruiting dozens of strangers to rape his now ex-wife Gisele.
Many victims’ lawyers also questioned the sincerity of Le Scouarnec’s apologies, which he repeated almost mechanically over the weeks of the trial, sometimes word for word.</p><small>2025-05-23 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/231837156eedf60.jpg?r=184437' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912850/pakistan-met-all-economic-targets-eff-decisions-taken-by-consensus-imf' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan met all economic targets, EFF decisions taken by consensus: IMF</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Friday said that its executive board approved funding for Pakistan after the country “met all the targets” under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, adding that the loan programme for Islamabad was only for stabilisation of foreign exchange reserves and not related to the budget financing.
Despite Indian attempts to derail Pakistan’s loan programme, the IMF approved the immediate disbursement of about $1 billion to Pakistan under the ongoing EFF and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
During a press briefing in Washington D.C., IMF Director of the Communications Department, Julie Kozack, said, “Our Board found that Pakistan had indeed met all of the targets.  It had made progress on some of the reforms, and for that reason, the Board went ahead and approved the programme.”
An Indian journalist asked the spokesperson on the recent bailout package by IMF to Pakistan, saying “the Indian government has expressed a lot of displeasure with Pakistan planning to use this package to build—rebuild—areas that allegedly support cross-border terrorism.” She also asked a question related to the “majority vote that was received in approving this bailout package for Pakistan on May 9.”
Another journalist asked about the implications of the escalation between Pakistan and India on both economies, while another questioned what “safeguards the IMF has that its funds won’t be used for military or in support of military actions.” The journalist also asked about the controversy about the termination of India’s IMF Executive Director, KV Subramanian.
In response to the questions, Kozack said the IMF’s Executive Board approved Pakistan’s EFF programme in September of 2024.
“The first review at that time was planned for the first quarter of 2025.  And consistent with that timeline, on March 25th of 2025, the IMF Staff and the Pakistani authorities reached a Staff-Level Agreement on the First Review for the EFF,” she said.
She added that the agreement was then presented to the Fund’s Executive Board, which completed the review on May 9.  “As a result of the completion of that review, Pakistan received the disbursement at that time,” she said.
Kozack explained that the global money-lender had a standard procedure in place under its programmes which allowed its executive board to conduct periodic reviews of lending programs to assess countries’ progress. The board, she said, particularly looked at whether the programme was on track, whether the conditions under the programme were met, and whether any policy changes were needed to bring the programme back on track.
She then said that Pakistan’s programme was approved after the country successfully met all of the required targets.
Regarding the question on safeguards, she clarified that IMF financing was provided to members for the purpose of resolving balance of payments problems, therefore, in the case of Pakistan, all the disbursements received under the EFF were allocated to the reserves of the central bank.
“So, those disbursements are at the central bank, and under the programme, those resources are not part of budget financing.  They are not transferred to the government to support the budget,” she said.
The IMF spokesperson added the programme provides additional safeguards through conditionality that includes targets on the accumulation of international reserves.
“It includes a zero target, meaning no lending from the central bank to the government.  And the programme also includes substantial structural conditionality around improving fiscal management,” she said, adding that any deviation from the established programme conditions would impact future reviews.
Kozack said that the appointment and resignation of an executive board member was the prerogative of any country, and it was completely up to the country’s authorities to determine who represented them at the Fund.
On the Pakistan-India tension, Kozack expressed regrets and sympathies for the loss of life and hoped for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.
Earlier this month, the IMF had approved two major financing arrangements for the country — a $1 billion disbursement under the EFF and a new RSF aimed at supporting climate-related initiatives.
In a statement, the IMF said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme supported by the EFF Arrangement.
“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR or special drawing rights 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),” it said.
It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.
“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP. Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.
President lauds IMF programme’s role in Pakistan’s economic stability
In a separate development on Friday, President Asif Ali Zardari held a meeting with a delegation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), led by the Director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department Jihad Azour, highlighting the Fund’s positive role in promoting economic development in developing nations.
Discussing Pakistan’s current economic situation and the ongoing IMF programme, the president acknowledged and appreciated the IMF’s contribution to Pakistan’s economic progress, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
The delegation members expressed satisfaction over Pakistan’s efforts for economic reforms and implementation of the IMF programme, which they observed was progressing in the right direction.
“The delegation further emphasised that the programme assisted in reducing inflation and fiscal deficit and strengthening Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves,” per the report.
President Zardari thanked the IMF for its continued support and cooperation with Pakistan and also appreciated the finance ministry for its efforts to improve the national economy, it added.
A day prior, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also held a meeting with the delegation, reaffirming his government’s commitment to fast track institutional reforms alongside macroeconomic stabilisation, asserting that Pakistan was now firmly on the path to economic development.
“Pakistan is now moving from economic stability toward sustainable growth,” the prime minister had said, emphasising that the government’s top priority was not only to sustain macroeconomic gains but to expedite comprehensive institutional reforms, crucial for long-term resilience.

The visit comes a fortnight after Pakistan and India reached a US-brokered ceasefire following a brief military confrontation. During the conflict, the Iranian foreign minister visited both nations to act as a mediator.
According to the FO’s statement, the PM will have “wide-ranging discussions” with the leaders of the four countries on issues including bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance.
“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” the FO added.
“The prime minister will also be attending the International Conference on Glaciers in Dushanbe, Tajikistan from 29-30 May 2025,” the statement read.
 






Earlier this week, the PM decided to send a “high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda” in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
“In a telephonic conversation with Chairman Pakistan People’s Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the prime minister has entrusted the leadership of the delegation to him,” the report said.
The delegation comprises Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Senator Sherry Rehman, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani, it added.
“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris, and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” the report added.</p><small>2025-05-23 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605868-bilawal-seeks-pms-guidance-on-highlighting-pakistans-position-in-world-capitals' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal seeks PM's guidance on highlighting Pakistan's position in world capitals</strong></a><br><p>

“With the stroke of a pen, the government has sought to erase a quarter of Harvard’s student body, international students who contribute significantly to the University and its mission,” Harvard said.
“Without its international students, Harvard is not Harvard,” the 389-year-old school added.
Harvard asked a federal judge to block the revocation, citing “the immediate and irreparable harm inflicted by this lawless action.” The case was assigned to US District Judge Allison Burroughs.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson dismissed the lawsuit.
“If only Harvard cared this much about ending the scourge of anti-American, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist agitators on their campus they wouldn’t be in this situation to begin with,” Jackson said.
“Harvard should spend their time and resources on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing frivolous lawsuits,” she added.
The termination of Harvard’s Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, effective with the 2025-2026 academic year, was announced by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
She said the termination was justified because of Harvard’s “fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party.”
Harvard defends ‘refusal to surrender’
In a letter to the Harvard community, the school’s president Alan Garber condemned the administration’s actions.
“The revocation continues a series of government actions to retaliate against Harvard for our refusal to surrender our academic independence and to submit to the federal government’s illegal assertion of control over our curriculum, our faculty, and our student body,” Garber wrote.
Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, equal to 27 per cent of total enrollment.
 
 

In its complaint, Harvard said the revocation would force it to retract admissions for thousands of people and has thrown “countless” academic programs, clinics, courses and research laboratories into disarray, just a few days before graduation.
The revocation follows Noem’s demand on April 16 for a large trove of information from Harvard about student visa holders.
In a letter to Harvard, which was attached to the complaint, Noem said the information was needed because the university had “created a hostile learning environment for Jewish students due to Harvard’s failure to condemn antisemitism.”
On Thursday, Noem said Harvard could restore its certification by turning over within 72 hours a raft of records about international students, including video or audio of their protest activity in the past five years.
In his letter on Friday, Garber said Harvard responded to Homeland Security Department requests as required by law.</p><small>2025-05-23 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23203119c64355a.jpg?r=203131' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912849/airspace-ban-on-indian-airlines-extended-until-june-24-paa' target='_blank'><strong>Airspace ban on Indian airlines extended until June 24: PAA</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) on Friday announced that the airspace ban on Indian airlines was extended until June 24 amid the recent escalation with India.
New Delhi had accused Islamabad, without evidence, of orchestrating last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
On April 24, Pakistan’s top brass had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country.
According to today’s statement by the PAA, “The ban on Indian aircraft flying over Pakistani airspace has been extended until 4:59 am on June 24, 2025. All Indian registered, operated, owned or leased aircraft will remain under the ban.
“No flights operated by Indian airlines or operators will be able to use Pakistani airspace,”  the authority said, adding that the ban also applied to Indian military aircraft.
The two neighbouring nations closed their airspaces multiple times during the hostilities earlier this month. Pakis­tan reopened its airspace for all types of flig­hts on May 10 after the ceasefire was announced.</p><small>2025-05-23 14:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605859-pakistan-extends-airspace-ban-for-indian-aircraft-till-june-24' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extends airspace ban for Indian aircraft till June 24</strong></a><br><p>

Trump threatened to impose a 25 per cent tariff on Apple for any iPhones sold, but not manufactured, in the United States. More than 60 million phones are sold in the United States annually, but the country has no smartphone manufacturing. He also said he would recommend a 50pc tariff on the European Union to begin on June 1, which would result in stiff levies on luxury items, pharmaceuticals and other goods produced by European manufacturers.
Markets dropped on the news. S&P 500 futures lost 1.5pc in premarket activity and the Eurostoxx 600 fell 2pc. Shares of Apple fell 3.5pc in premarket trading, along with shares of other technology bellwethers. Trump did not give a time frame for his warning to Apple.
“I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
“If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25pc must be paid by Apple to the US”
The White House has been in negotiations with numerous countries over trade issues, but progress has been unsteady.
 
 

Trump’s aggressive tariffs in April, which would have raised the rate consumers and businesses would have to pay for imported goods by roughly 25pc, sparked a selloff in US assets, including stocks, the dollar and Treasury bonds. Markets have since rebounded.
It is not clear if Trump can levy a tariff on an individual company. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
After Trump’s levies on China rose to more than 100pc in early April, the White House backed off due to market turmoil, granting exclusions from steep tariffs on smartphones and some other electronics imported largely from China, in a break for Apple and other tech firms that rely on imported products.
Apple aims to make most of its iPhones sold in the United States at factories in India by the end of 2026, and is speeding up those plans to navigate potentially higher tariffs in China, its main manufacturing base, a source told Reuters. Apple is positioning India as an alternative manufacturing base amid Trump’s tariffs on China that have raised supply-chain concerns and fears of higher iPhone prices.
The iPhone maker said most of its smartphones sold in the United States would originate from India in the June quarter.</p><small>2025-05-23 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605829-pakistanis-are-now-top-asylum-seeking-nationality-in-uk' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistanis are now top asylum seeking nationality in UK</strong></a><br><p>

The WB officials included its managing director Anna Bejerde and country director Najy Benhassine. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah also accompanied them as they visited the flood rehabilitation housing project in Nazar Muhammad Laghari village in Shaheed Benazirabad district.
This project, under the Sindh Peoples Housing for Flood Affectees (SPHF) programme, aims at rebuilding homes destroyed by the 2022 devastating floods, said a statement by the CM House.
During the visit, Aseefa and Bejerde distributed ownership rights certificates to women homeowners, and interacted with female members of the Village Reconstruction Committee, as the latter showcased their handicraft work. The committee was briefed that 32 homes were destroyed in the village and had now been rebuilt.
 






Bejerde reaffirmed the Bank’s commitment to supporting the Sindh government in flood recovery efforts, praising the resilience of the local people and the leadership’s dedication.
She emphasised that sustainable community-level rehabilitation is achievable despite climate change challenges.
Aseefa highlighted that granting women ownership rights under the SPHF project is a historic socio-economic empowerment initiative by the Sindh government, significantly benefitting rural women.
The Sindh chief minister noted that over 2.4 million homes were destroyed in the 2022 floods. He said the Bank initially provided $500m to kick start the recovery, later increasing funding by $450m over two years. Murad said this assistance helped construct 778,000 homes, and allocate $54.92m for water, sanitation, and hygiene, benefitting 66,691 families in 1,000 villages.
SPHF CEO Khalid Mahmood Sheikh informed them that 104,822 homes were destroyed in Shaheed Benazirabad; about 60,000 are under construction, while nearly 40,000 are completed.
He said across Sindh, over 111,000 disabled people are receiving accessible homes, and more than 800,000 women have opened bank accounts for the first time, thereby promoting financial inclusion. He elaborated that the programme provides safe shelter to over six million people and creates more than a million new jobs.
They later also visited the Basic Health Unit Jam Sahib in Shaheed Benazirabad.
 






Earlier this month, Aseefa distributed ownership documents of houses to flood-hit people in Mirza Farrukh Baig village of Daur taluka.
Accompanied by Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, she visited the village and met womenfolk of the flood-hit families. She sat with some of the families in their newly-built houses and inquired about their problems.
Aseefa distributed ownership documents of the houses among female beneficiaries of the free residential project. The women apprised her of their issues which she assured that would be resolved.
“I have come here on behalf of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to give you the ownership documents … now you have your own roof with the ownership rights … I have fulfilled the promise made to you by my grandfather and former prime minister Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,” she said.</p><small>2025-05-23 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605818-field-marshal-munir-pcc-ceo-discuss-digital-future-at-ghq' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir, PCC CEO discuss digital future at GHQ</strong></a><br><p>

A statement issued by the CTD read that it conducted an IBO to arrest the terrorists.
However, the terrorists opened fire on the police.
In an exchange of fire, the terrorist killed three of their own while the remaining six escaped.
The police found rifles, three hand grenades, bullets and explosives on the slain terrorists.
A search operation was underway to arrest the terrorists who had escaped, the statement said, adding that the teams had set up a blockade near Rehmanikhel.
The process of identifying the slain terrorists was underway, the statement continued.
It added that the terrorists who were targeted had completed their planning for carrying out major attacks on police posts.
Separately, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police, in a statement, said that unidentified miscreants carried out “unsuccessful attacks” on Fatehkhel chowki in Bannu district and Takia post in Bara tehsil of Khyber district, adding that both attacks were repelled by the police’s immediate response.
A young man was injured in an exchange of fire in Bannu, the statement said.
KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed said police foiled the attacks with professionalism and courage, adding that the evil elements in society will be brought to their end.
“The soldiers showed great devotion to duty by remaining alert,” IG Hameed said, adding that the morale of the youth was high and they were determined to continue the struggle until terrorism was eradicated.
The IG paid tribute to the bravery of KP police and announced cash rewards and certificates of appreciation.
In a statement, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid tribute to the forces for foiling the attack on a police post in Bannu and the killing of three terrorists in Mianwali.
He said that the Bannu police personnel bravely confronted the terrorists and foiled the attack.
He congratulated KP Police personnel for foiling the nefarious intentions of the terrorists, emphasising that the KP police were fighting the war against terrorism with courage.
The country “is proud of the brave sons of the KP police”, Naqvi said.
Speaking about the Mianwali incident, Naqvi said that CTD personnel bravely fought the terrorists.
Naqvi said he was proud of the CTD’s professional skills, adding that the team deserved praise for bringing down the terrorists.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022, vowing to target security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies personnel.
Earlier this month, a policeman was shot dead by unidentified assailants in the limits of the Mandan police station in Bannu.

The summit marked a historic milestone in her pursuit of the world’s 14 peaks above 8,000m.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Mingma G, famous Nepali climber and the owner of Imagine Nepal, said that Kiani stood at top of the peak at 6am local time (5:15 am PKT).
Mingma G added  that after the successful summit, the expedition team started their descent to camp four and were heading towards basecamp.
Secretary Alpine Club of Pakistan, Karrar Haidri, congratulated Kiani for the feat.
According to press release issued by Kiani’s team, the achievement cemented her place not only in Pakistan’s mountaineering history but also on the global stage, etching closer to a rare and elite global record: becoming one of fewer than 20 women in history to summit all 14 of the world’s 8,000m peaks.
It said that the summit push began at approximately 6:30pm on Thursday and continued through the night in severe high-altitude conditions, including intense snowfall and sub-zero temperatures.
“Despite the challenges, Kiani safely reached the summit, driven by unshakable determination and the support of a nation behind her,” the statement said.
“From Pakistan to Kanchenjunga, this summit is not just a personal milestone, it’s a message to every girl and woman in Pakistan and beyond: you are stronger than you think,” Naila said during her descent, according to the statement.
“I’m proud and grateful, but the journey has just started. Pakistan, this is for you.”
Before starting the summit push, through a message to her team, Kiani had said, “Climbing Kanchenjunga has been an incredibly difficult expedition and a harsh reminder of how hard it is to climb mountains over 8,000m.”
Kiani has already summited 11 out of the world’s 14 peaks above 8,000m, including Everest, K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II, Annapurna, Lhotse, Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu.
“Kanchenjunga is known for its treacherous terrains and unpredictable weather,” she added.
“But with determination and the support of my family, team and followers, I’m hopeful for a successful summit.”
Kiani has a bunch of mountaineering feats to her name.
Earlier this month, Kiani became the first Pakistani woman to summit 11 8,000m peaks in the world.
In April last year, she became the first Pakistani woman to climb Nepal’s Annapurna peak, the world’s 10th-highest peak, standing 8,091m tall. The next month, she went on to summit Mount Everest, the world’s highest mountain, becoming the second Pakistani woman to do so.
In July, Kiani attained the feat of becoming the first Pakistani woman to climb the world’s ninth-highest peak, the 8,125m Nanga Parbat. The same month, she became the first Pakistani woman to summit Broad Peak, the world’s 12th-highest mountain at 8,051m.
Months later, Kiani and Sirbaz Khan became the first Pakistani duo to summit the 8,201m Cho Oyu, the world’s sixth-highest peak in China’s Tibet.</p><small>2025-05-23 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605774-pia-to-launch-weekly-direct-flights-to-paris-next-month' target='_blank'><strong>PIA to launch weekly direct flights to Paris next month</strong></a><br><p>

The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India —without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a ceasefire. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks.
Yesterday, the Indian premier said that Pakistan would not get water from rivers over which India has rights.
According to a statement issued by the FO on X today, “Pakistan categorically rejects the baseless, provocative, and irresponsible allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan.
 






“The remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains,” the FO said, adding that such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms responsible statecraft.
“Resorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation is a grave breach of the United Nations Charter and established principles of international law,” the FO said.
“This dangerous approach undermines regional peace and stability,” it added.
The foreign ministry said that Pakistan remained a “consistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism”.
“Any insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism is factually incorrect and patently misleading,” it continued.
It noted that the Indian premier’s tactic was “often employed to divert attention from India’s own internal challenges”, adding that the Indian attempts to mask its “serious human rights violations” in occupied Kashmir by scapegoating Pakistan were well-documented and increasingly recognised by the international community.
“The plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection.”
Pakistan urged the Indian leadership to “exercise responsibility and restraint”, the FO said.
“Escalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.
“Rather than resorting to fictitious narratives and warmongering for electoral mileage, India should demonstrate maturity by resolving outstanding disputes through peaceful dialogue and diplomacy,” the FO noted.
It added that Pakistan remained firmly committed to “peaceful coexistence, regional stability, and constructive engagement”.
“However, our desire for peace should not be misconstrued as weakness,” it said, adding that the people and the armed forced were “fully prepared and capable of defending the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
“Any misadventure or aggression will be met with a resolute and proportionate response,” the FO added.
It said that Pakistan has demonstrated its resolve in the past and will do so again, if required.
“The international community must take serious note of India’s aggressive posture and hate-driven narratives that threaten regional peace,” it said, adding that it was “imperative to discourage such rhetoric and actions to preserve stability in South Asia”.
“Glorification of conflict benefits no one, and the path to lasting peace lies in dialogue, mutual respect, and adherence to international law,” it concluded.</p><small>2025-05-23 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23102705aec89f7.jpg?r=102725' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912792/unsc-condemns-heinous-cowardly-terrorist-attack-on-school-bus-in-khuzdar' target='_blank'><strong>UNSC condemns ‘heinous, cowardly’ terrorist attack on school bus in Khuzdar</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations Security Council on Friday condemned “in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly” terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar earlier this week.
At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials said, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to “relentlessly pursue” the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were “Indian proxies”, adding that Islamabad would present “complete evidence” to prove New Delhi’s involvement in the attack on the school bus.
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, the UNSC condemned the “heinous and cowardly terrorist attack” on a school bus in Khuzdar in the strongest terms.
In a press release, the UNSC said that the “reprehensible act of terrorism resulted in the grievous loss”, with its members expressing deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government.
“They [UNSC members] wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured,” it added.
The council reaffirmed that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”, underlining the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.
It urged all states to cooperate actively with the government of Pakistan, reiterating that any acts of terrorism were criminal and unjustifiable.
The council reaffirmed the need for all states to combat by all means, according to the UN Charter and other international obligations.</p><small>2025-05-23 05:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605783-chinese-tv-narrates-j-10s-origin-story-as-pakistan-feasts-on-fighter-jets-accomplishments' target='_blank'><strong>Documentary released on J-10 after Pakistan's victory over India</strong></a><br><p>

• Respondents highlight inflation, taxation, inconsistent policies, rupee devaluation as key threats
ISLAMABAD: The latest survey conducted by the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has shown marked improvement in business confidence over the country’s economic and business outlook.
The OICCI released the results of its Business Confidence Index (BCI) Wave 27 survey that depicted a significant improvement in the overall business confidence, which improved by 16 percentage points to positive 11 per cent from negative 5pc in the previous wave conducted in October-November 2024.
This is the first time in nearly three years that business confidence has ente­red positive territory. The last time the index was in the green was in May 2022, when it stood at 17pc. Since then, it had remained negative, registering -4pc, -25pc, -18pc, -14pc, and -5pc in subsequent waves.
The survey was conducted by the US firm AC Nielsen across Pakistan in March and April 2025, before the period of a recent standoff with India. The positive shift in sentiment across various sectors of the economy can largely be attributed to macroeconomic stability, declining inflation, and anticipated improvements in business conditions over the next six months.
 
 

The manufacturing sector led the recovery in the overall business confidence, improving from negative 3pc to positive 15pc, followed by the retail/wholesale sectors, which rose from negative 18pc in the previous Wave 26 to positive 2pc in the latest survey, showing an overall improvement of 20pc. The services sector maintained a steady outlook and jumped from 2pc to 10pc positive in Wave 27, an overall improvement of 12pc.
“The uptick in business confidence is a clear sign that our economic direction is on the right track,” said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, who was given a briefing on the latest survey, on Thursday.
“We are focused on creating a conducive environment for investment, supporting private sector growth, and ensuring long-term macroeconomic resilience. The improved sentiment among businesses is both encouraging and a validation of our collective efforts,” he said.
Speaking at a news conference, OICCI President Yousaf Hussain said overall business confidence had shown a notable improvement over the past two years across the business community.
“This sharp recovery in the Business Confidence in the latest Wave 27 reflects the resilience of Pakistan’s business sector and its readiness to seize emerging growth opportunities”, he said, adding that it was heartening to see positive momentum across key sectors, which reflects improved sentiment and growing trust in the country’s economic direction.
He called for greater policy consistency, transparency and active engagement with the key stakeholders including OICCI members to maintain this growing positivity in the business confidence.
The BCI Wave 27 survey revealed increased optimism for the next six months, with 45pc of the respondents expressing positive expectations. Key contributors to this positive outlook include economic growth, improved government policies, investment climate and security situation, said OICCI Chief Executive Abdul Aleem.
Despite the positive trend, 53pc of the survey respondents reported a negative outlook on business conditions over the past six months, which is also a substantial improvement from 66pc negative sentiments in Wave 26. The key concerns indicated in the survey related to political stability, rupee-foreign exchange parity, energy and trade policies.
Foreign investors, including randomly selected OICCI members, showed a remarkable increase from positive 6pc to 17pc. This improvement was primarily attributed to a better global business climate, an improved industry environment in Pakistan over the past six months, and expectations of increased capital investment in the coming six months.
Mr Aleem said the latest survey results were better than anticipated, with positive expectations reflected across all major sectors. Employment prospects, expansion plans and investment expectations demonstrated notable gains, particularly in the manufacturing and retail sectors.
Despite notable improvement on the overall BCI, Mr Aleem said that the new investment plans overall showed an improvement of 19pc, but remained negative, which is an area of concern and needs to be addressed to further accelerate economic growth, energise large-scale manufacturing, trade and export.
Looking ahead, the BCI Wave 27 respondents highlighted inflation, taxation, inconsistent government policies and rupee devaluation as the key threats in order of priority. The top two concerns remain unchanged from the previous wave, indicating ongoing challenges in these areas.
The survey is conducted twice a year and reflects the views of major business stakeholders representing nearly 80pc of Pakistan’s GDP.
The survey covers responses from various sectors, including manufacturing, services, retail and wholesale, and assesses perceptions at regional, national and business entity levels.
Face-to-face interviews are held across major business centres of Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and Peshawar.

The South Asian nation of some 170 million people has been in political turmoil since a student-led revolt forced then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina to flee in August 2024. But this week has seen an escalation in political crisis with rival parties protesting on the streets of the capital Dhaka with a string of competing demands.
Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who leads the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections, told his cabinet he wanted to quit if political parties did not give him their full support, a source inside his office said.
“He wanted to tender his resignation, but his cabinet members persuaded him not to”, the source said.
Nahid Islam, leader of the National Citizen Party — made up of many of the students who spearheaded the uprising against Hasina — met with Yunus on Thursday evening, another top NCP leader Ariful Islam Adeeb said. “They spoke about the current political situation”, Adeeb said.
“The chief adviser said he is reconsidering whe­ther he can continue his duties under the current circumstances”. But Nahid Islam — who had initially been part of Yunus’s cabinet before resigning to form a political party —  “urged him to remain in office”, Adeeb said.
Shafiqur Rahman, the chief of Jamaat-e-Islami, the country’s largest Islamist party, has urged Yunus to call an all-party meeting to address the crisis, a party official said. Yunus’s reported threat to stand down comes a day after thousands of supporters of the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) rallied in Dhaka, holding large-scale protests against the interim government for the first time.

If a message posted on his X handle is to be believed, Imran Khan criticised the promotion in his interaction with lawyers, family members, and journalists during a hearing in the Adiala Jail  courtroom on Wednesday. The tweet was posted on Thursday morning,  however. It may be noted that the PTI leader had also met his sisters and lawyers, including Salman Safdar and Usman Gill, on the jail premises on  Wednesday.
 






The former premier doesn’t have access to his X account and someone else posts on his behalf, but the PTI has never revealed the identity of Mr Khan’s social media handler.
The PTI founder said it would have been more app­ropriate if Gen Asim Munir had been declared ‘king’ as Pakistan was being run according to the ‘law of the jungle’. He quipped that in the law of the jungle, “there is only one king”.
The harsh stance taken by the former prime minister comes in contrast to his party leaders, particularly Gohar Ali Khan, who also met him in jail on Thursday. Barrister Gohar told a local news channel that Allah has given the honour to COAS Asim Munir and also entailed responsibility. “I request all to improve/normalise the situation of the country,” he said.
Dawn.com quoted him as saying that there would be a formal statement by the PTI on the development. “This is why I am saying that the [army chief] has gotten this new honour of field marshal. [We] have congratulated, but after this new honour, there is an increased responsibility on him to play his role even more and make the situation better,” he told reporters outside the jail as per Dawn.com.

“We have no strife with the military. Khan sahib also said yesterday that we stand with our armed forces and whoever is related to the armed forces will be uncontroversial,” he added.
PTI leader’s sister Aleema Khan criticised the interim chairman, Barrister Gohar, in her interaction with media persons, saying that he gave the statement felicitating the army chief in his personal capacity. The opinion of the party is not the opinion of Barrister Gohar, she added.
“We have given the statement of the founder of PTI yesterday,” she said, adding that Barrister Gohar could speak for the PTI in the presence of the party founder. The founder clearly said yesterday (Wednesday) that there was “a law of the jungle here, it would be better if the army chief gave himself the title of the king”, she added.
Earlier this week, the federal cabinet approved the promotion of COAS Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal for his leadership in the recent conflict with India known as ‘Marka-i-Haq’.
‘No deal’
A post on Mr Khan’s X account said the rumours regarding a deal were not correct, but he still invited the establishment for talks for the sake of the country.
The post added Mr Khan did not want any deal or relief.
It was “unfortunate that the law only applied to the weak in Pakistan and it was against the principles of democracy and the rule of law”.
The post also criticised the drone attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and directed the provincial government to register a protest with the federal government and make sure that it was not repeated. He said that the killing of people with drones cannot reduce terrorism.
It added that Pakistan made a lot of efforts to stop drone attacks by the United States, adding that bombs should not be dropped on own people.
As per the post, Mr Khan praised the role of armed forces, especially the air force, which thwarted Narendra Modi’s attempts to attack Pakistan and suggested they be ready for such actions in future.
Gandapur’s IMF warning
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur warned the federal government that it could reconsider its cooperation with the federal government over the IMF conditions if party leaders were not allowed to meet the incarcerated leader.
Speaking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after meeting Imran Khan, the CM said the PTI founding leader was willing to initiate dialogue “in the best interest of Pakistan”.
He said that if party leaders were denied access to Imran Khan, the PTI would reconsider its cooperation with the government, including on key issues like compliance with IMF conditions.
Meanwhile, the PTI spokesperson issued a statement, condemning the delays in scheduling bail hearings in the cases of the party’s founding chairman.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a statement on Thursday, flayed the regime for allegedly subjecting Imran Khan to harsh conditions.
“Such oppressive and sinister tactics are destined to fail, as (Imran) Khan’s spirit remains unbroken and resolute as the entire nation stands firmly behind its leader. PTI will not hold talks…because they (government) did not have legal, constitutional and moral authorities in this regard,” he claimed.
He emphasised that the government should not trust India and refrain from resuming dialogue until it renounces terrorism, restores the Indus Waters Treaty, and reinstates the constitutional status of occupied Kashmir.

• Govt seeks relief measures in budget; Fund reviewing proposals
ISLAMABAD: Amid week-long talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on next fiscal year’s budget, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fast-track institutional reforms and maintain macroeconomic stability.
During a meeting with an IMF delegation led by Regional Director for the Middle East and South Asia, Jihad Azour, the prime minister said the country was now firmly on the path of economic development after a period of recovery and stability.
“By the grace of Allah, Pakistan is now moving from economic stability towards sustainable growth,” PM Shehbaz said in an official statement.
He said the government’s top priority was to sustain macroeconomic gains and expedite comprehensive institutional reforms, crucial for long-term resilience.
The high-level meeting took place at the last leg of negotiations between an IMF staff mission and Pakistan’s economic team to finalise next year’s budget in line with commitments made as part of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. The IMF mission has been in formal engagements with authorities since May 14 and is slated to conclude the visit on Friday (May 23).
The Fund wants the initial achievements under the programme to move into the next phase without compromising programme objectives. Central to that phase include effective implementation of Agricultural Income Tax across provinces, tangible recoveries from the retail sector alongside expansion of the tax net, financial devolution, and greater contribution from provinces for national security.
The engagements are likely to continue virtually until the announcement of the federal and provincial budgets and their passage by parliament to ensure no lapses from agreed budgetary propositions.
Sources said Pakistan has proposed modest relief measures in the upcoming budget, including a slight reduction in super tax, incentives for the real estate sector and relief for the salaried class.
However, the IMF has yet to reach a conclusion and is still examining the viability of such measures in the context of revenue target and expenditures and possible recoveries from litigation cases.
During the meeting, also attended by ministers for finance, planning, and economic affairs, besides the finance secretary and the FBR chairman, the discussions focused on the implementation and progress of the ongoing IMF loan programme. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the economic reforms undertaken by the government and their accruing positive outcomes, the official statement said.
The IMF delegation acknowledged the progress made under the reform agenda and assured the prime minister of continued support from the Fund in the country’s efforts for economic stability and inclusive growth, the statement added.
PM meets WB team
Separately, the prime minister also met a World Bank delegation led by Managing Director of Operations Anna Bjerde on Thursday and assured her of the steadfast implementation of the economic reform programme necessary to build a solid and sustainable growth. He told the delegation that the government was taking practical steps to achieve maximum benefits from the World Bank’s development investment.
He hoped that the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework would bring more than $20bn in development investment to Pakistan and appreciated the World Bank’s assistance to the victims of the 2022 floods in Pakistan that had impacted millions of people, destroying livelihoods and properties.
Ms Bjerde said that the World Bank valued its historic partnership with the government of Pakistan for the development and prosperity of its people. She also expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz for his effective role in strengthening the partnership and implementing the Country Partnership Programme.
Also appreciating Pakistan’s recent exemplary economic performance and stability, she said that through its positive actions for macroeconomic stability, Pakistan had achieved the impossible and the bank looked forward to continued cooperation to achieve the positive outcomes of the Country Partnership Framework and uplift the Pakistani people for which policy continuity for sustainable and inclusive growth was necessary.

• House passes resolution urging govt to condemn India for suspending Indus Waters Treaty
ISLAMABAD: Days before presentation of the federal budget for the next fiscal year, the National Assembly on Thursday passed an IMF-dictated money bill through a supplementary agenda and without any debate.
The Off the Grid (Captive Power Plants) Levy Bill, 2025, aimed at providing legal justification for the grid levy imposed on the supply of natural gas or imported liquefied natural gas to industrial captive power plants (CPPs) as of March 7, was tabled by Minister for Petroleum Division Ali Pervaiz after the house suspended the rules.
The minister moved the motion for the passage of the bill soon after presentation of the report of the standing committee on petroleum by its chairman Mustafa Mehmood. The bill cleared all the required stages in just one day as the committee had also approved it in a meeting held minutes before start of the NA session.
The opposition challenged the ruling of the chair on the motion allowing the minister to present the bill for passage, but faced a 99-44 vote defeat after the headcount.
Earlier on May 17, the NA had passed the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024.
According to an official handout, during the meeting of the NA Standing Committee on Petroleum on Thursday morning, the petroleum minister gave a detailed briefing on the bill, highlighting its significance as part of Pakistan’s commitments under the International Monetary Fund’s Extended Fund Facility.
He noted that while the phase-out of captive power generation had long been under consideration, its implementation had been delayed due to prolonged political and economic constraints.
The minister emphasised that transitioning industries from captive power systems to the national grid was intended to optimise surplus electricity generation, improve efficiency in the power sector, and relieve financial pressures on the economy.
The minister informed the committee that a comprehensive consultation process had been completed in drafting the bill and acknowledged the instrumental role played by the NA speaker in facilitating this process.
He assured the committee that the bill was aimed at serving public interest without disrupting industrial operations and that protections for the industrial sector had been incorporated. He also highlighted high electricity prices as a major concern and underscored the need to fulfill public demand through grid supply.
It may be recalled that the government had already enforced the law through an ordinance and in March it had notified an increase in gas rates for industrial CPPs by about 23pc and scale down temptation for a substantial cut in power rates to get the policy negotiations going with the IMF in March this year.
Since the ordinance was about to complete its constitutional life, it was necessary for the government to get its approval from the National Assembly. Since it was a money bill, it was not required to be passed by the Senate.
However, the Senate committee on finance, which was only required to give recommendations to the NA, approved it without making any recommendations on May 16.
Resolution
Besides this, the National Assembly also passed a unanimous resolution calling on the government to strongly condemn India’s unilateral decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), terming it a clear violation of the agreement and an “act of war.”
The resolution was presented by Minister for Water Resources Mueen Wattoo after a brief debate on the matter before the chair, Abdul Qadir Patel of the PPP, read out prorogation order of the president, thus announcing the end of the summer session which had begun on May 5.
In their speeches, the lawmakers criticised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for suspending the treaty and accused him of acting with a hostile mindset.
The lawmakers also condemned the school bus attack in Khuzdar, blaming India for supporting the attackers.
Earlier, the proceedings of the assembly remained suspended for few minutes during the Question Hour when PTI Iqbal Afridi pointed out lack of quorum.

• Senate panel slams India’s ‘provocative action’
NEW DELHI: Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, a month after a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir led New Delhi to suspend a key river water-sharing treaty between the neighbours.
The attorney general for Pakistan, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islam­abad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to the decades-old treaty.
The suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, was among a slew of measures announced by India against Pakistan last month after the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people.
New Delhi had said the attack was backed by Pakistan, an accusation Islamabad den­ied and the nuclear-armed neig­hbours were involved in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on May 10.
“Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack … Pakistan’s army will pay it, Pakistan’s economy will pay it,” Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan.
 
 

The Indus treaty provides water for 80 per cent of Pakistan’s farms from three rivers that flow from India but Pakistan’s finance minister said this month that its suspension was not going to have “any immediate impact”.
The AGP, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters that Pakistan is “willing to talk about or to address anything”.
He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty.
The treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said.
“As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,” he added.
The ceasefire between the countries has largely held, with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar saying there is no exchange of fire currently and “there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly”.
“The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message…that if there are acts of the kind we saw on April 22, there will be a response, we will hit the terrorists,” Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS.
“If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,” he added.
Senate committee
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources on Thu­rs­day said India’s actions threatening Pakistan’s water security were “illegal”.
The committee members warned Pakistan would not tolerate such provocations.
The meeting, presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan, discussed the IWT in the light of India’s actions.
Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Mehar Ali Shah briefed the panel on the issue.
He said the treaty was a bilateral agreement between Pakistan and India and cannot be held in abeyance unilaterally.
The committee unanimously condemned India’s “unlawful and unilateral” declaration of holding the treaty 1960 in abeyance.
“This provocative action would lead to a dangerous escalation and direct threat to the water security, agricultural productivity and livelihoods of 250 million Pakistani citizens that cannot be tolerated by Pakistan”, said the committee in a unanimous statement.
It said the World Bank president had also recently endorsed that the international agreement could not be held in abeyance by one party and continued.
“The committee is of the view that the treaty remains in force and must be implemented in letter and spirit.”
The members vowed to “vigorously defend” Pakistan’s rights under the treaty at all international forums.
This treaty is critically important for Pakistan as a lower-riparian state whose food security and agricultural productivity depend on consistent access to these waters, especially given our increasing climate vulnerability and erratic monsoon cycles, the committee observed.
The committee also condemned India’s attack on the Neelum Jehlum project, calling the action “nothing less than water warfare and aggression”.
“India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty constitutes a red line for the people of Pakistan and the continued interference with Pakistan’s rightful water access under the treaty could threaten the recently established ceasefire between the two countries”, the panel asserted.
The meeting called upon the international community to take immediate notice of India’s aggression.
“We urge all responsible members of the global community to impress upon India, the importance of honoring its international obligations.”
The panel reaffirmed that Pakistan was committed to a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues with India, including the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.
However, Pakistan “will not compromise on existential water rights”.

“PIA has decided to operate a weekly flight from Lahore to Paris every Wednesday,” a spokesman for PIA said. “With the launch of this flight, three direct flights per week will become part of PIA’s operations.”
The new route is part of the airline’s broader strategy to extend its network to Europe and meet growing demand from the Pakistani diaspora in France and Pakistan, the spokesman said.
“This direct route to Paris addresses a long-standing demand from the Pakistani community, offering affordable fares and time savings,” the spokesman added.
Earlier this year, to mark the relaunch of PIA flights from Islamabad to Paris, the airline decorated a Boeing 777 aircraft with a model of the Eiffel Tower on its tail and the slogan “I Love Paris” on the nose. The aircraft was modified to meet European Union aviation standards.
PIA had also previously introduced a wireless in-flight entertainment system on the Islamabad-Paris route, allowing passengers to access entertainment on their personal devices.

Titled, ‘Action on Armed Violence’ (AOAV), the report notes that the casualties in 2024 represent a nine per cent decrease from 2023.  However, there was a 11 per cent increase in incidents compared to 218 in 2023. Pakistan was listed at seventh position among the 15 most affected countries and territories in 2024.
The majority of civilians harmed was attributed to non-state actors, who were reported responsible for 76pc of civilian casualties.  In particular, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) killed and injured 119 civilians in Pakistan last year.
 
 

The BLA is among the biggest non-state users of explosive weapons in 2024, and it was the reported perpetrator of 15pc civilian casualties, marking a 440pc increase from 22 incidents recorded in 2023. Unknown non-state actors accounted for 54pc of civilian casualties (423), down from 541 recorded civilian casualties in 2023.
All suicide bombings in the country were carried out by non-state actors, most notably, of the known non-state actors, were the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), who were responsible for 2pc of all 9 incidents, but 89pc (92) of civilian casualties resulting from suicide bombings. Unknown non-state actors accounted for 6pc (5) of incidents, and 11pc of civilian casualties.
Overall, 2024 saw the highest number of recorded incidents in Pakistan since 2014, and the second highest number of civilian casualties since 2018, and the second highest number of armed actor casualties since 2015.

Trump is furious at Harvard, which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners, for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and “woke” liberal ideology.
“Effective immediately, Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor (Sevis) Programme certification is revoked,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States.
Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision.
“As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enrol foreign students,” Noem wrote.
“All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme regulations, to maintain this privilege,” she said.
“As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ policies, you have lost this privilege.”
More than 27 per cent of Harvard’s enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data.
Harvard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><small>2025-05-22 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2219112938702db.jpg?r=191404' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912622/armys-top-brass-vows-to-stop-externally-sponsored-terrorists-from-destroying-national-peace-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Army’s top brass vows to stop ‘externally-sponsored terrorists’ from destroying national peace: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The armed forces have vowed to prevent the country’s peace being compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
A day earlier, at least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the vow was made during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, chaired by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“A comprehensive review of the prevailing internal and external security environment was undertaken, with particular emphasis on the successful conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, a decisive chapter of Marka-i-Haq,” the statement read.
It was observed that “following its military failure in the wake of the Pahalgam incident, India so-called and self-claimed victim of terrorism, but actually a perpetrator of terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability, has upscaled the use of covert means, employing non-state actors to pursue its destabilisation agenda,” the ISPR said.
“The forum resolved that Pakistan will never allow its peace to be compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism. The Armed Forces, in close synergy with intelligence and law enforcement agencies, will pursue all proxies and facilitators of terrorism with unrelenting resolve.
“These hostile elements, trained and financed to incite chaos and fear, will be dismantled and decimated with the full force of national will and institutional strength.”
 
 

It further said that the nation will take “all measures necessary to safeguard its vital interests”.
The conference also deliberated on the regional environment in India-occupied Kashmir and along the working boundary with India, expressing “deep concern” over human rights violations committed by Indian forces against Kashmiris. The forum also congratulated COAS Munir on his promotion to the rank of field marshal.
“[The] forum underscored the urgent need for international attention and intervention to prevent further deterioration of peace and security in South Asia,” the statement read. “[The] forum reiterated full diplomatic, political, moral and humanitarian support for Kashmiri brothers and sisters and their just resistance for [the] right of self-determination.”
Additionally, the meeting paid tribute to the martyrs of Marka-i-Haq and reaffirmed that the “sacred blood of the shuhuda (martyrs)” would not go in vain, while also recognising the spirit and dynamic contributions of the youth and Pakistan’s “media and information warriors” for their role during the brief conflict.
 


A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday claimed that the Khuzdar attack was carried out by “state-sponsored proxies of India (Fitna al Hindustan)” and added that “dastardly terrorist incidents” were being orchestrated through proxies in Balochistan and KP, “deliberately targeting civilians in a futile attempt to destabilise Pakistan”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on May 2.
President, PM present baton of field marshal to COAS Munir
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday presented Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Asim Munir with the baton of field marshal, formally marking the latter’s promotion to the highest rank in the military.
The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — General Mohammad Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.
The federal cabinet on Tuesday approved the promotion of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir to field marshal for his leadership in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and the period of conflict against India known as Marka-i-Haq. He was formally promoted to the position with immediate effect in a notification from the Ministry of Defence under “Rule 199-A of the Pakistan Army Regulations (Rules), 1998”.

The ceremony to confer the baton was held at the Presidency in Islamabad on Thursday, attended by the president, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and civilian and military officials.
After he and President Zardari conferred the baton to Field Marshal Munir, PM Shehbaz said during his address, “Today is a moment of profound national pride and historic importance for Pakistan. We salute our national heroes, COAS Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
“You have led our brave armed forces to a remarkable victory against an enemy caught in its own web of arrogance and hubris,” the PM said, addressing Munir.
“The aggressor was brought to its knees and taught a lesson. What transpired during those challenging days will not only be remembered for all times to come as an outstanding military victory but also as a moral and diplomatic triumph.”
The PM said that the field marshal “led our armed forces with great tenacity and indomitable resolve”. He thanked Munir for “his command during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and his resolute courage in safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
“The nation was granted a most glorious victory, which we will remember for the rest of our lives,” he added. “He not only thwarted the nefarious designs of the adversary, but rewrote the history of warfare.”

President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces for defending “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our motherland against unprovoked Indian aggression”.
“The entire nation is proud of all of you,” he said.
The president officially promoted Munir to the rank of field marshal and conferred the baton “in recognition of extraordinary services to Pakistan through the turbulent period and with full confidence in his command and character”.
“Your military career is forged with courage and defined by wisdom and commitment to lead with vision, strength and honour at the highest level of our armed forces,” Zardari said. “Throughout this week of Marka-i-Haq Field Marshal Asim displayed a pragmatic understanding of the need to avoid escalation.”</p><small>2025-05-22 17:19</small></div><hr>
