<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24234855a1481ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957103/un-experts-sound-alarm-on-rights-violations-in-occupied-kashmir-after-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>UN experts sound alarm on rights violations in occupied Kashmir after Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>United Nations experts on Monday sounded the alarm over “serious human rights violations” in Indian-occupied Kashmir by the Indian government, issuing the warning in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
Pahalgam is the site where gunmen on April 22 killed 26 mostly Hindu tourists. New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation, triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict.
In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown.
The arrests were carried out across multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam.
“We unequivocally condemn the brutal terrorist attack on a tourist area and extend our condolences to the victims, their families, and the Government of India. However, all governments must respect international human rights law while combating terrorism,” the experts said in a press release issued today on India’s response to the attack.
They noted that Indian authorities launched sweeping operations across the territory in the attack’s wake, resulting in the arrest and detention of around 2,800 individuals, including journalists and human rights defenders.
They pointed out that some were detained and charged under the Public Safety Act or the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which permitted prolonged detention without charge or trial and contained “vague and overbroad definitions of terrorism”.
The experts noted that some detainees were allegedly tortured, held incommunicado, and denied access to lawyers and family members.
“We condemn reports of arbitrary arrests and detentions, suspicious deaths in custody, torture and other ill-treatment, lynchings, and discriminatory treatment of Kashmiri and Muslim communities,” the experts said.
They further highlighted reports of punitive house demolitions and forced evictions and arbitrary displacement, targeting families of individuals perceived as supporting freedom fighters, and carried out without court orders or due process.
“Such actions constitute collective punishment and defy the 2024 ruling by India’s Supreme Court, which found that such demolitions are unconstitutional and violate the rights to life and human dignity, which includes the right to protection against arbitrary displacement,” the experts said.
They also expressed concern at communication blackouts and restrictions on press freedom, saying that authorities reportedly suspended mobile internet services and blocked around 8,000 social media accounts, including those of journalists and independent media outlets.
“These measures are disproportionate restrictions on freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” the experts noted.
They remarked that India’s response to the attacks was “also felt elsewhere in India”, with Kashmiri students subjected to surveillance and harassment, following government directives requiring universities to collect their personal data.
“Hate speech and incitement to violence increased against Muslims, inflamed by political figures in the ruling party. Demolitions were reported in Gujarat and Assam, where thousands of Muslim homes, mosques, and businesses were destroyed.”
“Nearly 1,900 Muslims and Rohingya refugees were also expelled to Bangladesh and Myanmar, often without due process,” the press release said.
The experts stressed that such expulsions violated the international obligation of non-refoulement, which prohibited returning individuals to countries where they risked persecution, arbitrary deprivation of life, torture, or other serious harm.
They further highlighted what they said was the “persistent nature of violations” in the territory with several human rights defenders, including Irfan Mehraj and Khurram Parvez, being arbitrarily detained for years under draconian security laws.
“We urge the immediate unconditional release of all individuals arbitrarily detained in Jammu and Kashmir.”
The experts also urged India to bring its counter-terrorism laws and practices “in line with international human rights obligations and independently investigate all alleged violations” and ensure accountability, including through prosecutions.
“Excessive counter-terrorism measures not only violate human dignity, the Indian constitution and international law but counter-productively fuel social division and grievances that can spiral into further violence,” the experts warned.
They lastly asked Pakistan and India to peacefully resolve the Kashmir dispute, which they said had “fuelled human rights violations and the destructive cycle of cross-border violence”.</p><small>2025-11-24 19:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2423422523c3393.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957104/pakistani-diplomat-afghan-governor-meet-to-ease-bilateral-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani diplomat, Afghan governor meet to ease bilateral tensions</strong></a><br><p>A Pakistani diplomat in Afghanistan met a key Afghan governor amid tensions over rising terror incidents in Pakistan, saying efforts were underway to thaw bilateral ties, according to Afghan state media and Pakistani sources who spoke to Dawn.
The meeting was held hours after three Federal Constabulary men were martyred in a suicide attack on the force’s headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area this morning. Security forces quickly neutralised the attackers.
This was the first high-level contact in months between the Pakistani Consul General in Jalalabad, Shafqatullah Khan and Nangarhar Governor Mullah Muhammad Naeem Akhund.
Akhund is an important Taliban leader and is considered a confidant of Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.
Governor Akhund has previously served as deputy minister of Borders and Tribal Affairs and deputy minister of Civil Aviation during the Taliban’s first government from 1996-2001. He had played a key role in the Taliban’s military commission during the 20-year war against the US and its NATO allies and also led the Taliban’s military activities in southern Helmand province.
He was a close confidante of the late Taliban’s chief, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, and is considered a close associate of Defense Minister Mullah Yaqoob Mujahid.
“The Islamic Emirate has a constructive stance towards good relations, cooperation, and safeguarding common interests with the region, neighbouring countries, and other countries of the world, and relevant efforts in this regard are ongoing,” Afghanistan’s official Bakhtar news agency reported.
Pakistan has long said that terrorist groups have used Afghan soil to plot and stage attacks across the border; a charge the Afghan Taliban deny.
“The governor of Nangarhar noted the goodwill, brotherhood, and historical kinship of the Afghan people, and explained that the foundation of positive relations can remain strong in the presence of mutual respect, understanding and systematic coordination,” according to the report.
No statement was issued by the Pakistani consulate about the meeting. The consulate and the Foreign Office spokesman did not reply to queries when approached for comments.
However, sources with knowledge about the meeting said the Afghan governor told the diplomat that he has already “made efforts to reduce tension between the two countries”.
The diplomat explained Pakistan’s position on the current security issues to Akhund, who is also keen to bring the relationship back on track.
“The meeting discussed ethnicity, language, religion, culture, and other commonalities, and discussed the current situation in the region and the daily amenities of the people based on the tradition of good neighbourliness,” Bakhtar said.
The meeting was attended by Nangarhar Deputy Governor Maulvi Azizullah Mustafa, Foreign Affairs Director Maulvi Jan Mohammad Inqelab, provincial spokesman Qari Ehsanullah Usmani and a number of other officials.
Breakdown in Pak-Afghan ties
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.</p><small>2025-11-24 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/242227218fe7114.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957101/pti-slams-govt-for-1971-style-power-grab-in-by-elections-urges-course-correction' target='_blank'><strong>PTI slams govt for ‘1971-style power grab’ in by-elections, urges course correction</strong></a><br><p>The PTI lashed out on Monday at the incumbent government over the recent by-elections, alleging it revived the 1971 blueprint for stripping the people of their mandate to prolong its rule.
According to provisional results, the PML-N won all six National Assembly (NA) seats and six of seven Punjab Assembly seats up for grabs. One provincial seat was won by the PPP, which fielded its candidates in only three of the 13 constituencies.
Most of these seats were vacated following the disqualification of PTI members due to their convictions in May 9 cases.
Reacting to the results, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram slammed the authorities for repeating history’s “gravest mistakes”.
He insisted that the country was on the verge of security, economic, political and social collapse, and urged the authorities to learn from past mistakes by taking corrective and remedial measures instead of repeating old blunders while expecting different results.
Akram recalled that, just like the Awami League, the PTI secured a landslide victory in the February 8, 2024, general election, only to be “robbed” of its mandate, with a subsequent spree of disqualifications against PTI candidates under flimsy excuses and the denial of reserved seats.
He pointed out that in the 1970 election, the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a clear majority, but the party was deliberately cut down by declaring around 183 seats vacant, depriving it of the ability to form a government both at the federal level and in East Pakistan.
The PTI spokesperson expressed surprise at why the government was so adamant on replicating the same disastrous model of 1971, noting that those who repeated a calamitous model while expecting different results were “living in a fool’s paradise”.
He stated that instead of recognising the gravity of the situation and taking remedial measures to pull the country out of a deep abyss, the rulers were busy taking steps to perpetuate their rule, caring for nothing but retaining power.
Akram emphasised that such “controlled and rigged” polls could never serve as a true measure of PTI or former prime minister Imran Khan’s popularity.
He recalled that Imran had repeatedly demonstrated the overwhelming public support for him in the past.
The PTI spokesperson warned that even the PPP had not learned from past mistakes, as it allowed itself to be exploited for petty political gains and expediencies, ultimately paying a heavy price.
“Now, after securing a simple majority, PML-N could reveal its true colours and give the party a cold shoulder,“ he noted.
He challenged the government to announce fresh elections and dared all political forces to unite under one election symbol against the PTI. He vowed that the PTI would not just defeat, but obliterate all rival parties from the political landscape.</p><small>2025-11-24 18:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24170311550018f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957085/ash-cloud-from-ethiopian-volcano-eruption-to-have-no-significant-impact-on-southern-pakistan-says-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Ash cloud from Ethiopian volcano eruption to have no significant impact on southern Pakistan, says PMD</strong></a><br><p>The ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in northeastern Ethiopia would have no significant impact on the coastal areas of Pakistan, including Karachi, and would pass over the Arabian sea, confirmed the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday.
The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in Ethiopia’s Afar region about 800 kilometres northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border, erupted on Sunday for several hours. This was the first recorded eruption in nearly 12,000 years.
The eruption sent thick plumes of smoke up to 14 kilometres into the sky, blanketing nearby villages and drifting toward the Arabian Sea region. The volcano, which rises about 500 metres in altitude, sits within the Rift Valley, a zone of intense geological activity where two tectonic plates meet.
Met Office Spokesperson Anjum Nazeer Zaighum, while speaking to Dawn, said the effects of the ash cloud would not be felt in Karachi and it would pass over the Arabian Sea.
“The projections are from last night, and the impact would be felt in the deep Arabian Sea, in Oman, and within the Mumbai FIR (flight region),” the spokesperson explained, referring to earlier projections by Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) which stated that the ash cloud would affect southern Pakistan after passing over Yemen and Oman.
The spokesperson added that the ash cloud would be at an altitude of around 50,000 feet. He elaborated that the ash cloud was witnessed 60 nautical miles south of Gwadar today and the office has issued a warning to the concerned authorities, which is still in place.
 






A local resident told The Addis Standard that the eruption occurred eight kilometres from the main mountain itself.
“Afar TV … described a “massive eruption” late in the morning, noting that the force and sound of the blast were stronger than any previous events recalled by residents,” the Standard reported.
“‘We were extremely shocked by the sound and engulfed in fear,’ one resident said. Phone interviews conducted by the station indicated that the sound and its effects were felt as far away as Djibouti, Tigray and towns in the Wollo area.”
The Standard reported that the explosion caused tremors in the surrounding area and could be heard as far away as Djibouti. The subsequent ash cloud plunged surrounding settlements into “near-darkness”.

Citing Dutch news agency BNO News, the Standard said that the eruption began at 8:30am UTC (1:30pm PKT) and explosions continued throughout the afternoon.
“An advisory from the Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said ash rose to about 45,000 feet (13.7 km) before activity subsided,” the Ethiopian outlet reported, adding that according to the latest VAAC update they received, the eruption had reportedly stopped.
The Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program said Hayli Gubbi has had no known eruptions during the Holocene, which began around 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age.
Simon Carn, a volcanologist and professor at the Michigan Technological University, confirmed on Bluesky that Hayli Gubbi “has no record of Holocene eruptions”.
An update from flight tracking monitor FlightRadar at 3:31am this morning showed the projected path of the ash cloud, which was being blown towards the Arabian Peninsula and the Arabian Sea.
Pakistan will come directly in its path, the monitor showed in its post, stating that the cloud would arrive in approximately 18 hours.
 






An interactive map from VAAC shows that the ash cloud will pass over southern Sindh before heading northeast into India.

Saudi Armed Forces Chief of General Staff General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili is currently on a visit to Pakistan and held meetings with senior officials.
A statement from state broadcaster PTV News, on his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said: “General Al-Rowaili conveyed felicitations from the Saudi leadership to the prime minister and the people of Pakistan. He reaffirmed the kingdom’s strong desire to elevate the current excellent defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.”
PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed his firm commitment to further strengthening the “historic fraternal relations” between the countries in all sectors, including economic, defence and security.
“The prime minister welcomed General Al-Rowaili and commended Saudi Arabia for the unwavering support and solidarity it has always extended to Pakistan. He emphasised that the relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are based on shared faith, common values, and mutual trust.
“The prime minister mentioned his highly successful visits to Riyadh over the past two months, during which historic Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement was signed between the two sides. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to further deepening bilateral defence cooperation, including joint training, exercises, and exchange of expertise.”
PM Shehbaz also highlighted the joint resolve of both countries to combat all forms of terrorism and extremism and to promote peace and stability in the region.
 






Earlier, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s military leadership discussed strengthening the “longstanding and strategic” cooperation between the two countries, focusing on defence, security and counterterrorism efforts, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
The discussion took place during a meeting between Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir and General Al Rowaili at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, according to the ISPR.
“During the meeting, both leaders discussed matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on strengthening the longstanding and strategic military cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” the statement said.
“They emphasised the importance of further enhancing defence collaboration, security cooperation, and counter-terrorism efforts, which continue to be pillars of the deep-rooted bilateral relationship,” it added.
 






The visiting dignitary, according to ISPR’s statement, appreciated Pakistan’s cooperation in multiple fields with the Saudi armed forces and “reaffirmed his commitment to furthering the strong bonds of cooperation”.
“Upon arrival at GHQ, General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and was presented a Guard of Honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army,” said the statement.
 






General Al Rowaili later called on Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at the Joint Staff Headquarters.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed evolving global and regional security environment. The dignitaries also explored concrete measures to deepen engagements between the armed forces of both countries and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen defence and security ties.
“The CJCSC reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to safeguarding the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and ensuring the protection of Harmain al-Sharifain,” the ISPR said.
 






In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
Earlier this month, CGS Lieutenant General Aamer Raza met General Rowaily in Riyadh to discuss broadening strategic ties and strengthening the mutual defence agreement signed by the two nations.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.</p><small>2025-11-24 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/241907132f8bb0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957089/lahore-qalandars-peshawar-zalmi-and-quetta-gladiators-renew-psl-franchise-rights-for-next-decade' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore Qalandars, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators renew PSL franchise rights for next decade</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Super League (PSL) outfits Lahore Qalandars, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators have renewed their franchise rights for another 10 years, the country’s cricket board announced on Monday.
The agreements, finalised at market valuations determined by global audit firm Ernst & Young after what the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) described as a “comprehensive and transparent assessment”, come ahead of the league’s expansion to eight teams from its 11th edition next year.
Lahore Qalandars — the PSL’s most valuable franchise and winners of three of the last four editions under Pakistan ODI captain Shaheen Shah Afridi — were among the first to extend their rights.
“It gives me immense pleasure that Lahore Qalandars will continue to stay with its current owners,” PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement.
“[Qalandars owners] Atif Rana and Sameen Rana have worked extremely hard to turn this franchise into a household name across Pakistan and a reputable brand around the world.”
Peshawar Zalmi, one of the league’s most recognisable brands and champions in 2017, also renewed their decade-long rights on Monday.
Led by owner Javed Afridi, the franchise has cultivated one of the strongest fan bases in the league and was the most-watched team during the last PSL season, said the PCB.
Mohsin lauded Javed’s “commitment, professionalism and passion”, saying his leadership had “played a fundamental role in elevating the Zalmi brand into one of the most dynamic and admired sporting entities in Pakistan”.
“Javed Afridi’s vision has contributed immensely to the growth of the HBL PSL,” he added. “His decision to renew reflects a strong belief in the league’s future potential.”</p><small>2025-11-24 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24154447cb06b79.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957067/pakistan-seeks-to-buy-100000-tonnes-of-rice-for-supply-to-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks to buy 100,000 tonnes of rice for supply to Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has issued a tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of rice for supply to Bangladesh, it emerged on Monday.
After decades of troubled relations, Islamabad and Dhaka have seen improved ties and increased bilateral engagement since the August 2024 ouster of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.
The deadline for submission of price offers is 11:30am on November 28, according to the TCP tender issued on November 20, which was seen by Dawn.
The tender invites “separate sealed bids” from companies, partnerships and sole proprietors for buying 100,000 tonnes of long grain white rice (IRRI-6) “for export to Bangladesh in the shape of break bulk cargo” through Karachi ports.
Price offers have to be valid for 21 working days after submission. The rice must be available for shipment within 45 days after the contract award.
The bids shall be submitted for a minimum quantity of 25,000 tonnes, or multiples thereof, and a maximum quantity of 100,000 tonnes, +/- 5 per cent MOLSO (5pc variance margin).
 
 

As per the tender, the rice should be supplied from the “stocks of latest crop of Pakistan origin”, and must be fit for human consumption without any unpleasant odour, sign of mould, poisonous weed seeds, insects, and infestation.
According to Reuters, traders regarded the tender as a possible move to bring Pakistani rice into Bangladesh’s import supplies, with market expectations that Indian-origin rice will be used to supply some recent purchases by Bangladesh.
Bangladesh also announced another rice tender today, continuing a series of import tenders in the last few weeks to cool local prices.
Pakistan and Bangladesh started direct government-to-government trade in February with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice.
At the 9th Joint Economic Commission (JEC) last month, Pakistan offered the use of Karachi Port Trust as a gateway for Dhaka’s trade with regional countries, including China and the Central Asian states.
Rice exports
Pakistan’s rice exports fell 28pc in the first quarter of FY26, raising concerns within the sector about policy and regulatory barriers that continue to undermine competitiveness.
A Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan official had attributed the decline to India’s 2024 decision to resume rice exports and the government’s removal of the basmati minimum export price (MEP) and zero-rate rice exports.
 
 

However, as Pakistani exporters avoided a direct price war, India’s re-entry failed to significantly disrupt Pakistan’s rice trade in the following six months (October 2024 to March 2025), with the latter retaining its foothold in high-end markets.
Moreover, a 50 per cent tariff imposed by the United States on Indian goods, including basmati rice, in August has provided Pakistan an opportunity to expand its share in the American market.
Data from Volza’s Global Trade platform showed that between November 2023 and October 2024, the US accounted for 24pc of Pakistan’s total basmati exports.</p><small>2025-11-24 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635293-adviser-to-iranian-supreme-leader-set-for-unprecedented-pakistan-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Adviser to Iranian supreme leader set for 'unprecedented' Pakistan visit</strong></a><br><p>

Local experts warn that without stronger protection and enforcement, several species could disappear from large parts of the country.
“Like many other birds, owls have lost their habitat and prey base, especially in and around urban areas,” Uzma Khan, a Lahore-based wildlife expert with WWF-Pakistan, told Anadolu. “Deforestation, pollution and unplanned urbanisation have drastically reduced tree cover and nesting sites.”
Gradual deforestation, ornamental tree planting and unplanned urbanisation have led to a steady decline in owl numbers, as most species prefer to nest in tree cavities or old nests of larger birds, she explained.
“Owls are predators and feed on small animals like birds, rodents, reptiles and some of them on insects as well,” she said. “But the unchecked conversion of agricultural lands for the construction of human settlements in recent decades has badly impacted owls’ prey base.”
Khan said illegal poaching adds to the pressure, as some owls are trapped and sold as pets or for use in traditional practices. Others die after colliding with vehicles. Reports have also surfaced of owls being killed or injured by people who use their body parts for black magic rituals.
Adapting to urban life
Pakistan is home to 16 species of owls, though comprehensive population data is lacking.
In Sindh, authorities have recorded at least 10 species, including the Indian scops owl, collared scops owl, pallid scops owl, short-eared owl, long-eared owl, rock eagle owl, dusky eagle owl, brown fish owl, eastern barn owl and spotted owlet.
Sindh Wildlife Department Director General Javed Ahmed Mahar said his department plans to conduct new surveys to assess owl and bird populations as part of a recently announced provincial government conservation policy.
Some localised studies indicate that owl populations have declined in several regions. Khan said research has shown that species such as the Himalayan barred owlet, oriental scops owl and pallid scops owl have disappeared from sites including Margalla Hills National Park in Islamabad, where they were recorded in the early 1990s.
Even so, she said the sighting of some smaller owl species has improved in urban areas.
“Some species, for example, the ‘spotted’ owl or ‘little’ owl, regularly use structures, houses, ledges and survive in human settlements, hence one sees them around frequently in urban areas,” she said.
Karachi-based wildlife researcher Zafeer Ahmad Shaikh said that the expansion of cities has, in some cases, created new habitats.
“Roofs of apartment buildings, in particular, serve as sanctuaries for little owls because no one owns them (roofs) and they usually remain abandoned or are used for the installation of water tanks. This provides a perfect place for little owls to inhabit,” he told Anadolu.
Forest and agriculture management
Despite their ecological importance, owls are often misunderstood in Pakistan. While many cultures associate them with wisdom or luck, locally they are frequently dismissed as “foolish”.
“In reality, owls are bio-regulators,” Shaikh said. “They help control rodent and reptile populations, which benefits both forests and agriculture.”
But under Pakistan’s wildlife laws, not all owl species are protected. Some can be hunted under permit — though such licenses are rarely issued — a loophole that enables illegal trade.
“Higher protection should be offered to owl species to preserve their precious ecological function and service,” Khan said.
Mahar, however, said the Sindh government has enacted specific provisions barring the use of owls in black magic and added penalties under the wildlife protection laws, in addition to a complete ban on the raptor’s hunting and poaching.
However, in Punjab, the country’s largest province, that is not the case.
“Hunting of some species is allowed through a special shooting license, but it’s very rare,” Kamran Bukhari, a senior official of the Punjab Wildlife Department, told Anadolu.

A media monitoring and advocacy organisation, Uks, for over two decades, has been engaged with the media on how to report women’s issues in general, and cases of violence against women in particular.
In the press release, Uks said it would observe “16 days of activism” against gender-based violence in Pakistan under the theme ‘Unite to End Digital Violence against All Women and Girls’.
The published reports are part of Uks’ 2023–2024 initiative ‘Safe Word, Safer Word’, which was done in collaboration with the World Association for Christian Communication (WACC).
The report, titled ‘365 Posts, One Message: Stop Online Sexualised Violence!’, is a collation of 365 harmful posts shared by Uks over the course of one year, tracking people’s responses.
“Respond they did, sometimes with support, sometimes with criticism, and sometimes with honesty,” the report read.
Uks said that the report, combined with the compendium, “offers a very telling snapshot of how women in Pakistan experience online spaces, and how the public engages when these issues are consistently highlighted”.
“The comments in this compilation make it clear that online misogyny is routine for many women. They also show that sustained conversation does make an impact,” the report read.
“This effort succeeded in documenting lived experiences and sparking a dialogue. It also encouraged individuals and institutions to take online abuse more seriously.”
Uks announced that alongside the publications, it launched a 16-video campaign featuring prominent people from media, show business, academia, civil society, and other walks of life, the press release read.
“It brings together diverse viewpoints on why women face disproportionate online harassment and how collective action can create safer digital spaces,” it read.
Uks also announced it would be publishing the Global Media Monitoring Project National Report on December 9, stating in the press release that it is “the world’s largest and longest-running research project on gender representation in news media, which has been conducted every five years since 1995”.
“It monitors how women are portrayed in print, broadcast, and online news across more than 100 countries,” the press release read.
“Uks has been the official GMMP national coordinator for Pakistan since the first cycle, and is responsible for gathering data, training volunteers, monitoring media content, and reporting on gender portrayal trends in Pakistan’s media landscape,” Uks added.
In February this year, Uks announced the launch of its Uks AI (Beta) platform, describing it as an artificial intelligence tool that calls out gender bias in media content, “whether it’s hiding in plain sight or lurking between the lines”.
In a press release, the organisation said the tool was built particularly for journalists, editors and reporters to address a “persistent challenge” in media creation: the unconscious perpetuation of gender stereotypes that shaped how society viewed and valued women.
Uks added that the tool scanned text for both glaring and subtle biases, offering “immediate, actionable feedback” to media professionals.</p><small>2025-11-24 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635290-pmd-issues-warning-as-ethiopian-volcanic-ash-drifts-into-pakistani-airspace' target='_blank'><strong>PMD issues warning as Ethiopian volcanic ash drifts into Pakistani airspace</strong></a><br><p>

The statistics were revealed in the Sustainable Social Development Organisation’s (SSDO) Factsheet on Violence Against Children (VAC) in Punjab, covering the period from January to June 2025.
A press release issued by the organisation said that of the 4,150 cases, challans were presented in 3,989 cases, while 3,791 were under trial, with an average of 23 cases reported daily, based on district-level police data obtained through the Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Act 2013.
It added that Punjab’s reporting mechanisms had improved over the past year, resulting in increased registration of cases. However, the SSDO noted that conviction rates remained “critically low and require immediate attention”.
It noted that “despite the volume and severity of offences, only 12 convictions were recorded during the six-month period”, making for a conviction rate below one per cent.
The SSDO said sexual abuse remained “one of the most troubling” categories with 717 cases registered, 658 challaned and 581 still under trial.
“The category saw 12 acquittals and eight withdrawals but zero convictions,” it pointed out.
Meanwhile, child beggary was the most frequently reported offence, with 2,693 cases registered across the province, adding that 2,674 of these were challaned and 2,669 remained under trial, yet none resulted in a conviction.
“Other forms of exploitation also pose serious threats. Child trafficking registered 332 cases, resulting in four convictions, while 182 cases of child labour led to eight convictions, the comparatively highest outcomes among categories, yet still alarmingly low relative to the number of offences. Meanwhile, 87 cases of physical abuse and 27 kidnapping cases produced no convictions.
“Child marriage continues to be severely underreported, with just 12 cases registered in the first six months of 2025 and no convictions or acquittals, pointing to entrenched cultural and procedural barriers that obstruct reporting,” the SSDO said.
It reported that district-level data identified Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi and Sialkot as the “major hotspots for child abuse, exploitation and trafficking.
“Lahore recorded the highest numbers of sexual abuse, child beggary and trafficking cases, while Nankana Sahib, Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin also showed elevated trafficking trends.”
The organisation said that its findings overall revealed “critical gaps” in Punjab’s child protection ecosystem, extremely low conviction rates, thousands of cases pending trial and persistent underreporting of sensitive crimes.
It called for urgent reforms, including strengthened investigative capacity, fast-tracked trials, increased coordination between departments, expanded child protection units and awareness efforts to encourage reporting at the community level.
“SSDO emphasised that protecting children in Punjab requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to ensure justice, accountability and long-term safety for every child.”
Earlier this month, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ministry of Human Rights launched consultations to prepare a national Strategic Action Plan on Violence Against Children, aiming to strengthen prevention and protect the country’s 112 million children.
The initiative addresses multiple forms of violence against children in Pakistan, including killings, physical and sexual violence, psychological abuse, and neglect. The plan comes as the country faces challenges where only one in three children under five is registered at birth and over 12.5 million are involved in child labour.
The consultations, which included experts, partners, participants from all provinces and self-governed areas, began in Karachi and concluded in Islamabad.
The new strategy will be grounded in the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the INSPIRE framework, an evidence-based package developed by international agencies under WHO’s leadership.</p><small>2025-11-24 16:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24185809f34193d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957086/pti-did-not-boycott-recent-by-elections-but-contested-all-13-seats-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>PTI did not boycott recent by-elections but contested all 13 seats: CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz claimed on Monday that the PTI did not boycott yesterday’s by-elections but rather participated in all 13 constituencies up for grabs.
By-elections were held on six National Assembly and seven Punjab Assembly seats on Sunday. The PML-N fielded its candidates on all seats except a provincial one in Muzaffargarh, and secured victory on all 12 of them.
The PPP contested on three seats but could only win the Punjab Assembly seat from Muzaffargarh. The PTI failed to grab either of the Haripur or Lahore NA seats it campaigned for.
“This was not even a boycott of the elections. What they are describing as a boycott, I have not seen such hypocrisy during my entire life,” CM Maryam said while addressing a meeting of provincial ministers today.
“PTI candidates contested in all constituencies. They contested on ‘qaidi No. 804’ (Imran) with photos of their leader. They set up polling camps, displayed pictures and campaigned while taking the [PTI’s] name.
“And when they lost, they said ‘we boycotted’,” the chief minister said.
 






The PML-N leader said the PTI employed a strategy where it would claim popular support “despite a boycott” if it won, but also attribute any loss to its boycott call. “This is a drama,” she quipped.
During her address, Maryam repeatedly criticised the PTI’s “narrative” of a boycott, contending that politicians never opt out of democratic processes even if they have slim chances of emerging victorious.
“[Lt] General Faiz Hameed went to jail, Umar Ata Bandial and Imran-daar judges went home, so they do not want to contest elections now,” she said, referring to the former intelligence chief and the ex-chief justice.
The Punjab CM slammed the PTI for indulging in “politics of narrative”, saying that narratives had a shelf-life, which had now ended.
The PML-N leader also recalled the July 2018 elections won by the PTI in the wake of the imprisonment of the top PML-N leadership, including her and her father Nawaz Sharif, who had been ousted as the prime minister the year prior.
“Even us in 2018, when Nawaz Sharif sahib and I were in jail, I was perhaps the first Pakistani woman they jailed and did many injustices to,” Maryam claimed.
“But we did not boycott the elections. We contested even in the worst circumstances,” she added, terming them the “most difficult elections” of the PML-N’s history.
“I was alone here; Maryam Nawaz vs the entire power of the state,” she said, adding that the now-banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was “also created during that election”.
 
 

“General Faiz’s entire power was with the PTI and Yasmin Rashid. It was the most difficult election in history [for us],” Maryam said.
Addressing the PTI, the Punjab CM said, “When you break laws, when you take up militancy, you have no right to call yourself a political party.”
“You conducted rigging, but were allowed to continue. You did manipulation and made people lose elections, but no one said anything. But the day you attacked your own country, your downfall started,” she said, referring to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Maryam went on to assert that the “extra votes in all constituencies” were from people who switched support from PTI to PML-N.
“The public accepted service, they stamped Nawaz’s ideology and buried the politics of lies, hypocrisy and conspiracy forever,” she added.

The launch of outlets in the eastern province of Dhahran and one for diplomats in the port city of Jeddah would be a further milestone in efforts, led by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to open up the country.
The kingdom last year opened an alcohol store serving non-Muslim diplomats in the capital Riyadh — the first such outlet since a ban was brought in 73 years ago.
Store planned in Aramco compound, says source
The new store in Dhahran will be set up in a compound owned by Aramco, one of the three people who talked to Reuters said.
That store would be open for non-Muslims working for Aramco, the source added, who said Saudi authorities had informed them of the plan.
Two of the sources said a third liquor store was also in the works for non-Muslim diplomats in the city of Jeddah, where many missions have honorary consuls.
Both stores were expected to open in 2026, but no timelines had been released, two of the sources said.
The government media office did not immediately reply to questions over the plans for the stores in both locations, which were previously unreported. Aramco declined to comment.
There was no officially announced change made to regulations after the opening of the Riyadh store in a nondescript building in the diplomatic quarter known to some diplomats as the “booze bunker”.
The Riyadh store’s customer base was recently expanded to include non-Muslim Saudi Premium Residency holders, two of the sources said. Premium residencies have been awarded to entrepreneurs, major investors and those with special talents.
Before the Riyadh store, alcohol was largely only available through diplomatic mail, the black market or home brewing.
In other Gulf countries, apart from Kuwait, alcohol is available with some restrictions.
Reforms cover events, women’s driving
While alcoholic drinks are still off limits for the vast majority of the population, under the crown prince’s reforms, both Saudis and foreigners can now take part in once-unthinkable activities, from dancing at desert raves to going to the cinema.
Other reforms have included allowing women
The kingdom has been easing restrictions to lure tourists and international businesses as part of an ambitious plan to diversify its economy and make itself less dependent on oil.
In May, a media report, picked up by some international media after appearing on a wine blog, said Saudi authorities had planned to allow alcohol sales in tourist settings as the country prepares to host the 2034 soccer World Cup.
The report, which was denied at the time by a Saudi official, did not give a source for the information.
That report had sparked a vigorous online debate in the kingdom.
Social liberalisation has proceeded at a breakneck pace, but the leadership have taken a more gradual and cautious approach to the question of alcohol. The ban on alcohol is still in place, a measure not uncommon in Muslim countries, where alcohol use is often restricted.
Saudi Arabia has been aggressively expanding its local tourism portfolio with the giant Red Sea Global development, which includes plans to open 17 new hotels by next May.
These ultra-luxury resorts remain dry.
Asked by Reuters this month if there were any plans to ease restrictions on alcohol to help attract foreign visitors, Saudi Tourism Minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb said: “We do understand that some of the international travellers want to enjoy alcohol when they visit the Saudi destinations, but nothing has changed yet.”
Pressed on whether “yet” meant that it could soon change, he said: “I will leave it to you on how to elaborate on it.”
Saudi residents report booze ban eased for select foreigners
Separately, diplomats and premium visa-holders in Saudi Arabia also told AFP that the conservative kingdom has quietly eased restrictions on purchasing alcohol for select foreign residents.
While the government has not made any statements regarding the sale of alcohol in recent days, the sources said non-Muslim individuals with so-called premium resident status are now able to buy booze at the country’s sole liquor store in Riyadh, which was previously reserved for diplomats.
AFP spoke with four people who said the rules had changed, including two diplomatic sources and a couple of residents with premium visa status.
“I heard about it from friends who tried it. I went there two days ago and it actually worked,” one premium visa-holder told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“It saved me a lot of money rather than buying from the black market. Prices are reasonable and we finally can buy alcohol.”
AFP reached out to Saudi authorities for comment on the reports, but they did not respond by the time the story was published.
Started in 2019, premium resident status in Saudi Arabia is available to a select group of foreigners who meet a variety of requirements, including making a one-time payment of 800,000 riyals ($213,000).
The visa allows people to live, work and invest freely in Saudi Arabia without a local “sponsor” — a kind of guarantor required for other non-nationals to live in the kingdom.
A premium residency-holder told AFP that he went to the liquor store and saw a man with the same status purchase alcohol before buying bottles himself.
“It actually worked for me, it’s so easy,” he said.
‘Walking out with 30 bottles’
A Western diplomat told AFP that acquaintances of his with premium residency had managed to buy alcohol in the past few days.
“Expats WhatsApp groups are being flooded with the news,” he added.
A diplomat told AFP that “the [liquor] store was packed” on Saturday, when she saw “people walking out with 30 bottles”.
 
 

The apparent loosening of the liquor regulations comes nearly two years after the kingdom opened its first and only liquor store in January 2024 in the capital’s diplomatic quarter, catering exclusively to non-Muslim foreign envoys.
There was no official announcement at the time, with two sources confirming the reports to AFP at the time.</p><small>2025-11-24 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635271-girl-missing-from-islamabad-reunited-with-parents-in-karachi-after-17-years' target='_blank'><strong>Girl missing from Islamabad reunited with parents in Karachi after 17 years</strong></a><br><p>

The attack occurred on one of the city’s busiest roads just after 8am. Video footage of the incident showed one terrorist, clad in a chaddor, approaching the gate and detonating himself. Seconds later, two other terrorists tried to enter the compound.
The attack occurred as an assembly for the first working day of the week was being held at the main compound.
“Initially, three militants tried to attack the headquarters. One terrorist blew himself up at the gate, while two others tried to enter the premises but were gunned down by FC personnel,” Peshawar Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad said while speaking to reporters.
He further said that three FC men had been martyred in the suicide attack at the gate, while two others were injured. He added that a clearance operation had been carried out.
Asked whether a threat alert had been issued prior to the incident, the police official said, “You are aware of the overall situation of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the country, so we are on high alert. They were unable to enter [the headquarters] due to this alertness. They were neutralised at the gate.”
The Jamatul Ahrar faction of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack.
The paramilitary force, originally called the Fron­tier Constabulary, was renamed by the government in July. The headquarters of the force is located in a crowded area, close to a military cantonment. The headquarters building houses barracks, hospitals, and residential quarters.
Meanwhile, an emergency was declared at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), Peshawar’s largest public sector hospital, and Khyber Teaching Hospital (KTH).
The spokesmen of the hospitals confirmed that 11 injured had been brought to LRH while one injured person had been brought to KTH.
Today’s incident is the second major terrorist attack on a security installation in Peshawar in the last three years. In February 2023, 84 people were killed in a suicide attack on a mosque in Peshawar’s Police Lines.
Terror attack condemned
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the terrorist attack and lauded security forces for their “timely action,” as per a statement issued by the PM Office.
“Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” he said, praying for the recovery of the injured.
He reaffirmed that the government remained resolute in eradicating terrorism, and vowed to crush any terrorist plots against Pakistan.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari also condemned the attack, offering condolences to the families of the martyrs.
He affirmed that “externally backed Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve”.
 






Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state uses to refer to the TTP.
In a statement condemning the attack, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the sacrifices of the martyred personnel would always be remembered.
Naqvi also paid tribute to the “brave soldiers of FC, who foiled the Fitna-Al-Khwarij attack by taking timely action”. He also expressed “heartfelt sympathies for the families of the martyred”.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement, paid tribute to the martyrs and security forces, stressing that “such cowardly attacks can not weaken our morale”.
Their sacrifice would not go in vain, he said, vowing to bring the terrorists to justice and continuing the war against terrorism with a “stronger resolve”.
CM Afridi affirmed that the provincial government stood with the police and law enforcement agencies, adding that “every resource available will be utilised to eliminate terrorism”.
The chief minister directed authorities to treat the injured and prayed for the families of the martyrs.
Later, he attended the funeral prayers of the martyred personnel, a statement issued by the CM’s Office said.
It added that CM Afridi paid tribute to the martyrs and said that their sacrifices “strengthen our resolve against terrorism”.
 






He also visited LRH before attending the funeral prayers and spoke to the media.
The CM said,“Terrorists have always intended to disturb peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan […]Those who will resort to this are our and Pakistan’s enemies, and we will not let them do this.
“They cannot weaken our resolve and courage.”
Asked whether he had held any talks with security agencies regarding security issues, CM Afridi said: “I have been briefed. The provincial government has ordered modern equipment for [police], but unfortunately, its delivery is taking time. Bullet cars are here, and we are working on capacity building of police.”
 






KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi posted on X that he “strongly condemn the cowardly terrorist attack on the FC Headquarters in Peshawar. Such acts of violence are an affront to the peace and security of our nation”.
“I commend the swift and courageous response of the FC personnel, which successfully prevented a greater tragedy. I extend my deepest condolences to the bereaved families of the martyrs, and pray for the swift and full recovery of all those injured in this attack.
“Let there be no doubt: neither cowardly attacks nor external threats can weaken our resolve. The entire nation, and especially the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, stand firmly with our security forces in the fight against terrorism,” he added.
 






In its condemnation, the PTI termed the attack “unfortunate”. The party posted on X that it extended condolences to the families of the martyrs and prayed for the quick recovery of the injured.
“We salute the sacrifices of our security institutions and are standing with them for the protection of our country,” the party’s statement read.
 






Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti also paid tribute to the security forces for foiling the attack.
 






PPP’s Sherry Rehman also condemned the attack. “Heartfelt condolences to the families of the FC martyrs. We all laud the courageous defenders from our security forces whose vigilance prevented the suicide bombers from going inside to pursue their nefarious goals,” she said in a post on X.
“No such #terrorist plots or attackers backed by external sources, which it seems they were, can or will weaken Pakistan’s unity, resilience or resolve,” she said.
 






PPP Chairperson and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also condemned the attack, saying that “such cowardly attacks cannot weaken our resolve” to end terrorism.
A statement on the PPP’s official X account further quoted him as saying: “The PPP will continue its struggle for the elimination of terrorism, safety of the people and lasting peace in the country.
“Our nation’s unity, courage and resolve against terrorism will ensure the failure of every conspiracy by terrorists.”
Bilawal also paid tribute to the martyred FC personnel and said their “sacrifices will not go in vain”. He prayed for the martyred personnel and their families, as well as for those injured in the attack, the statement said.
 






Senator Allama Raja Nasir posted on X: “I unequivocally condemn this morning’s despicable terrorist attack on the Federal Constabulary Headquarters in Peshawar, which claimed the lives of three brave personnel and left two others wounded. My deepest condolences go to the bereaved families of the shaheeds (martyrs), and I pray for the early recovery of the injured.”
He further said, “Although terrorism has intensified in recent years, a disturbing pattern has emerged in recent weeks with first the Cadet College in Wana, then the blast at Islamabad’s district courts, and now this assault on the FC Headquarters. These are not random acts, they are part of a calculated campaign by enemies of Pakistan who are exploiting our vulnerabilities.”
The senator asserted that “at this critical juncture, the country expects complete transparency, effective intelligence coordination, and decisive action so that those who plan and finance these attacks are brought to justice, no matter where the trail leads. We want our troops and law enforcement agencies to focus singularly on eliminating the menace of the TTP and its affiliates.”
 






Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in terror incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Today’s incident comes less than three months after a similar one in September, during which six soldiers were martyred and five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the FC Headquarters in Bannu.
According to the military, the attack was carried out by “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij”.

With more than 241.5 million people today, the country is on course to cross 300 million within the next five years and edge towards 400 million by 2050, a trajectory that demands far more serious national attention than it has so far received.
Data compiled by research organisation Population Council, UK Aid and the United Nations Population Fund shows the average annual growth rate — based on data from 2017 to 2023 — is 2.55 per cent, resulting in the population of 241.5 million, making Pakistan the fifth most populous country in the world.
The consequences of this growth are visible across every sector, such as malnutrition and a demand for jobs, infrastructure and healthcare that cannot be kept up with.
Here are some statistics from across the country.
National
The total fertility rate, defined as the average number of children a woman has during her reproductive age, is 3.6, which is the highest amongst countries in South Asia.
This high fertility contributes to issues of malnutrition, where 40pc of children under the age of five are stunted, 18pc are wasted, and 29pc are underweight.
At least 11,000 maternal deaths occur annually, though 3,800 mothers can be saved if contraceptive use rises from the current 34pc to 52pc.
Similarly, with respect to the infant mortality rate, 62 infants die before reaching one year of age per 1,000 live births, equating to 140,000 infants annually; however, infants can be saved if contraceptive use rises from the current 34pc to 52pc.
 


 


Punjab
Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province, has an estimated population of 127.7 million (as of 2023), growing at an average annual rate of 2.53pc.
Projections indicate the population could more than double to 253 million by 2050 if the current total fertility rate of 3.4 children per woman persists.
The province faces a rate of 5,200 annual maternal deaths, alongside an infant mortality rate of 73 per 1,000 live births. Increasing contraceptive use from the current 41pc to 59pc is projected to save 2,300 mothers and 73,000 infants annually.
Currently, 15.8pc of the population has an unmet need for family planning, which corresponds to couples of child-bearing age who are not using contraception but desire to, resulting in an average of one unintended child per couple.
This high fertility rate is also a key factor in the prevalence of malnutrition, with 23.5pc of children under five years of age reported as underweight.
 


 


Sindh
Sindh, while having a smaller estimated population of 55.7 million (2017-2023), is growing marginally faster than Punjab at 2.57pc; it has a higher total fertility rate of 3.6, projecting a population of 111.5m by 2050.
Sindh records 3,000 maternal deaths annually and has an infant mortality rate of 60 per 1,000 live births.
Furthermore, the unmet need for family planning stands at 17.7pc in Sindh, directly contributing to high rates of malnutrition, as evidenced by the staggering 50pc children being stunted in the province.
 


 


Balochistan
Balochistan, faced with a rapidly growing population, sees an increasing demand for food, schools, health facilities, jobs, and infrastructure.
The average annual growth rate of the population is 3.20pc (2017 to 2023), with the population being 14.9m as of 2023.
By 2050, it is estimated that the population of Balochistan will be 35.3m at the current rate of fertility decline. The total fertility rate is 4.0, representing the average number of children a woman has during her reproductive age.
Maternal mortality is a significant concern, with 1,000 maternal deaths occurring annually.
It is projected that 400 mothers can be saved if contraceptive use rises from the current 20pc to 41pc. The infant mortality rate is also high, with 48 infants dying before reaching one year of age per 1,000 live births. Increasing contraceptive use from 20pc to 41pc could save 10,000 infants.
Additionally, 27pc of children under the age of five are underweight, indicating that high fertility contributes to malnutrition.
 


 


Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s population is growing at an average annual rate of 2.38pc, having reached an estimated 40.9m in 2023, with projections suggesting it could rise to 78m by 2050 if current fertility trends continue.
The province records around 1,900 maternal deaths each year, though it is estimated that increasing contraceptive use from 25pc to 54pc could save 800 mothers annually.
The total fertility rate stands at 4.0 children per woman. Infant mortality remains high, with 53 deaths per 1,000 live births and an estimated 16,700 infants who could be saved if contraceptive use increased from 28pc to 54pc.
High fertility is also linked to malnutrition, and 23pc of children under five are underweight.

With the ban recently being declared “illegal and void” by the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) Adjudicator, Salman has already gotten back to work.
“We feel that justice has been served,” Salman told Dawn in a phone call while attending an overseas conference.
“And now, I’ll continue with the work I’m doing,” added Salman, who serves as the Asian Director of Development for World Athletics.
The Athletics Federation of Pakistan (AFP) imposed a lifetime ban on Salman on October 12, citing “gross violations of the AFP Constitution” due to “illegal and unconstitutional” elections held by the Punjab Athletics Association (PAA), of which Salman was president till August 6. The ban barred Salman from participating in any athletics activities nationally or internationally.
Salman appealed the ban, and PSB appointed Senator Pervaiz Rashid as adjudicator to the case.
In the meantime, Salman was cleared to travel with Arshad to the Islamic Solidarity Games in Riyadh, where the 28-year-old defended his gold medal.
A hearing held on November 13 — the final order of which was made available today — declared that “imposing a lifetime ban is without lawful authority, unconstitutional, ultra vires, and void ab initio.”
“AFP’s attempt to unilaterally declare PAA’s elections as ‘null and void’ is without jurisdiction, as election supervision lies with the provincial authorities and not AFP.
The order further stated that examination of the AFP Constitution revealed that “there is no provision authorising a lifetime ban upon an individual coach.”
The order also stated that no formal charge sheet was issued to the petitioner, nor was an inquiry report provided to Salman or a meaningful right of hearing or defence afforded.
The petitioner’s submissions regarding PAA elections, his coaching credentials, and the adverse impact on national athletes are supported by the record, the order stated.
“Accordingly, the lifetime ban has no legal effect and is declared void.”
PSB directed AFP to immediately withdraw all adverse communications sent to any national or international bodies regarding the ban. It also restored all “professional rights, status, and privileges” of Salman as a national athletics coach.
“AFP is restrained from issuing defamatory or prejudicial communications regarding the petitioner in future,” the order read.
It also took into account the impact on Arshad, who had written to the Pakistan Olympics Association (POA) on Oct 17 and endorsed support for Salman.
“AFP’s actions disrupted Pakistan’s high-performance preparations, created uncertainty for a leading Olympic athlete, damaged national medal prospects, risked reputational harm internationally,” the order read.
“Such actions are inconsistent with responsible governance of national sports federations.”
The order stated that circulating the ban to international bodies, including World Athletics and Asian Athletics, resulted in damage to Salman’s international standing and perception of Pakistan in global forums.
“Violation of norms of transparency and responsible international communication, AFP’s conduct is found to be improper, premature, and harmful to Pakistan’s sporting reputation.”</p><small>2025-11-24 12:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24142030e89577d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957065/judges-transfer-case-fcc-rejects-intra-court-appeal-filed-by-ihc-judges' target='_blank'><strong>Judges transfer case: FCC rejects intra-court appeal filed by IHC judges</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on Monday rejected on Monday a set of intra-court appeals, including one filed by five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges in a judges transfer case, for non-prosecution.
The case pertains to the transfer of three judges from other high courts to the federal capital, and the IHC judges had challenged a decision by the now-defunct Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court to uphold the transfers.
However, the appeal was fixed before the FCC following its establishment under the 27th Amendment.
A six-member FCC bench, headed by Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Ali Baqar Najafi, Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, Rozi Khan Barrech and Arshad Hussain Shah, took up nine appeals pertaining to the case today.
As the proceedings began, the court associate called out the names of each of the lawyers representing different clients, and when they did not appear, the FCC dismissed six of those appeals one at a time, dictating separate orders for each plea.
The rejected appeals included the one filed by IHC Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Saman Rafat Imtiaz and Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri. These judges were also not present at the hearing.
Apart from the appeal moved by the five judges through senior counsel Muneer A. Malik, the FCC also took up pleas filed by Tahir Faraz Abbasi through Advocate Abid Shahid Zuberi, Raja Muqsit Nawaz Khan and PTI founder Imran Khan through counsel Idrees Ashraf, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) and Lahore Bar Association (LBA) through counsel Hamid Khan, and the Karachi Bar Association, Muhammad Shoaib Shaheen and Riasat Ali Azad through counsel Faisal Siddiqi.
From these nine appeals, the FCC adjourned the hearing on three pleas for an indefinite period.
Among them was also Imran’s plea, whose counsel Ashraf sought directives for meeting the incarcerated former prime minister. He argued that he needed instructions from Imran after the enactment of the 27th Amendment.
The counsel pleaded that he had to file additional grounds since he had moved the appeal against the SC’s short order. Therefore, he argued, a meeting with the client was necessary.
However, Justice Aminuddin rejected the request, observing that the counsel should approach the forum that sentenced his client. Justice Aminuddin said the matter did not fall in the FCC’s domain.
But, the counsel argued that a directive by the FCC would “fulfil the requirement of complete justice” under Article 187 of the Constitution.
During the hearing, Advocate Ajmal Toor appeared before the court on behalf of senior counsel Hamid Khan, who is representing the LHCBA and LBA.
Advocate Toor sought more time from the court as Hamid was unavailable.
The court then also adjourned the hearing on the pleas of the two lawyers’ bodies for an indefinite period.
Pleas on judges transfer
On June 19, the now-defunct CB issued a 3-2 majority judgement, declaring that the transfer of three judges to the IHC from three other courts was within the framework of the Constitution.
The judgement was issued on petitions challenging the transfers of Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar from the LHC, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court and Justice Muham­mad Asif from the Balochistan High Court to the IHC.
The controversy centred around the alteration of the judges’ seniority list after these transfers as Justice Dogar was made the senior puisne judge, which paved the way for his appointment as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq’s elevation to the SC. Justice Dogar is now the IHC chief justice.
The five IHC judges had challenged the June 19 decision and filed an intra-court appeal.
The judges contended in the appeal that the June 19 order impermissibly read in “permanent” in Article 200(1) and (2) of the Constitution when no such language was contained in the provision.
The appeal pleaded that the constitutional bench had misunderstood the provisions of Article 200 by reading sub-article (1) in isolation from other provisions of the article by not holding that transfers envisioned in Article 200(1) were only for a temporary and time-specified period.
The order also failed to interpret articles 200 and 175A, without scuttling and undermining the powers of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan under Article 175A of the Constitution, the appeal argued, adding that independence of the judiciary did not allow bestowing onto the executive a much more expansive power than what the text of Article 200 and the foundational principles of constitutional law can bear.
For his part, Imran’s petition on the issue argued that the June 19 judgment had eroded the safeguards aimed at preserving judicial independence since it circumvented the constitutionally enshrined appointment process.
On Saturday, the five IHC judges also filed a miscellaneous petition, challenging the fixing of their appeal before the FCC.
In the petition, the judges asked the FCC to return the intra-court appeal to the SC, arguing that the matter constitutionally fell within the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
The petition stated that the appeal was shifted to the FCC under the 27th Constitutional Amendment, but contended that the amendment itself contradicted the Constitution.
In their application, the petitioners also argued that the Constitution clearly outlined the legislature, executive, and judiciary as the three essential pillars of the state and delineated limits and powers for each.
It was also fixed for hearing today. However, as the judge’s main appeal was dismissed, there was no occasion to take up the miscellaneous application.</p><small>2025-11-24 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635229-pakistan-saudi-arabia-ink-justice-sector-mou-as-tarar-attends-riyadh-global-conference' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Saudi Arabia ink justice-sector MoU as Tarar attends Riyadh global conference</strong></a><br><p>

According to provisional results, the PML-N won all six National Assembly (NA) seats and six of seven Punjab Assembly seats up for grabs. One provincial seat was won by the PPP, which fielded its candidates in only three of the 13 constituencies.
Most of these seats were vacated following the disqualification of PTI members due to their convictions in May 9 cases.
In separate but similar statements, PM Shehbaz congratulated the PML-N candidates for their victories in NA-18 (Haripur), NA-96 and NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan), PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), and Faisalabad’s PP-98, PP-116 and PP-115.
 






The statements issued by the PM’s Office said the premier congratulated the candidates for their “brilliant success”.
The statements quoted him as saying that the PML-N’s success in the by-polls was a result of party supremo Nawaz Sharif’s vision and “exemplary leadership”, as well as the hard work of party workers.
“The success in the by-elections reflects public trust in Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s hard work for the progress of people of the province,” he said, adding that the public had expressed confidence in the PML-N during the by-polls.
 






“The success in elections is a reflection of the public confidence in the government’s performance,” he reiterated.
Separately, he mentioned the PML-N’s win in NA-143 (Sahiwal), PP-203 (Sahiwal) and NA-129 (Lahore), saying that the people expressed confidence in the “PML-N’s objectives of development, stability, and public welfare” during the by-elections.
 






Here, too, he credited Nawaz’s leadership and Maryam’s hard work for these wins.
Nawaz himself also offered congratulations to the party’s winners.
 






PTI alleges polling discrepancies in Haripur
On Monday morning, the provisional results for NA-18 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur were also issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), according to which PML-N’s Babar Nawaz Khan secured victory with 163,996 votes.
The Form-47 for the constituency — the provisional consolidated statement of results for vote count of all polling stations prepared by the returning officer (RO) concerned — showed that PTI-backed independent candidate Shehrnaz Omar Ayub was the first runner-up with 120,220 votes.
Shehrnaz is the wife of PTI’s Omar Ayub, who was the NA opposition leader. The seat had fallen vacant following Ayub’s disqualification.
Shehrnaz had contested the polls against PML-N’s Nawaz and PPP’s Irum Fatima Turk with the “kettle” symbol. While Ayub and former MPA Momina Basit had been campaigning for her, Shehrnaz herself abstained from appearing in public meetings.
 
 

Speaking to reporters today, Ayub rejected the results and said he would challenge them before a court tribunal and launch a series of peaceful protests.
“The returning officer (RO) stole our election,” he alleged, asserting that his wife was ahead of her PML-N rival by over 27,000 votes from over 500 polling stations.
The PTI leader said that their candidate’s results were changed: “We have the Form-45s of all polling stations but the results compiled by the RO and displayed on screen were totally different.”
In an earlier video statement, Ayub had said that the RO was “refusing to accept the original Form-45s and saying he will only acknowledge the forms brought to him”.
“They have prepared duplicate Form-45s,” Ayub alleged.
 






Senior PTI leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser also “rejected” the by-election results in a statement and termed the voting process “fraudulent and ridden by rigging”.
He described the by-polls as a “flagrant violation of the constitutional rules for conducting the voting process in the country”.
Qaiser said the handling of the by-election reflected “open rigging and has once again exposed its dark face before the nation“.
In a separate post on X, Qaiser claimed that the Form-45s showed Shehrnaz was leading by a margin of 25,000 votes from 519 polling stations. However, the ECP staff was “uploading the wrong results on the official website”, he alleged, raising serious questions over the transparency and credibility of the electoral process.
 






Taking note of the low voter turnout in other constituencies, the PTI leader also claimed that the public heeded the party’s call to boycott those by-elections.
He said that reports indicated that voter turnout remained between 15 and 18 per cent, while “over 80pc of citizens rejected the polls, opting to stay home”.
Qaiser termed the elections unrepresentative and demanded that the “non-transparent” results be annulled immediately. He claimed that the present government and the ECP “failed to provide an environment” where citizens could freely choose their leadership.
The former speaker further said that practices of “abductions, arrests, intimidation, restrictions on campaigning, voter manipulation, and tampering with Form-47 are routine” for the ECP.
 






Yesterday, Ayub’s brother, Yusuf Ayub, accused the ECP of being biased against Shehrnaz, citing the “posting of presiding officers, other polling staff and changing our election symbol”.
Babar, who had earlier served as MNA during 2015-2018, has won the support of his party leaders, including CM Maryam’s husband, retired Captain Safdar Awan.
According to observers, Haripur’s political landscape remains dominated by patronage rather than ideology. Not a single woman in the district’s history could ever make it to the provincial or the National Assembly in a direct election.
Other by-election results
According to provisional results, PML-N candidates emerged victorious in NA-104 (Faisalabad-X), NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), NA-143 (Sahiwal-III), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-II), PP-73 (Sargodha-III), PP-87 (Mianwali-III), PP-115 (Faisalabad-XVIII), PP-116 (Faisalabad-XIX) and PP-203 (Sahiwal-VI).
The provisional results for NA-96 (Faisalabad-II) showed PML-N’s Bilal Badar Chaudhry, the brother of Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, won the race with 93,009 votes.
He was competing against 15 aspirants, among whom independent candidate Nawab Sher bagged 43,025 votes to come out as the first runner-up.
 






For PP-98 (Faisalabad-I), the Form-47 showed that PML-N’s Azad Ali Tabassum had secured victory, bagging 44,388 votes and beating independent candidate Muhammad Ajmal by a margin of 9,142 ballots.
The PPP, which had contested in Haripur’s NA-18, DG Khan’s NA-185 and Muzaffargarh’s PP-269, managed to emerge victorious on the Muzaffargarh provincial seat.
The ruling PML-N had not fielded any candidate against PPP’s Alamdar Qureshi in the constituency, which was among the by-elections boycotted by the PTI, paving the way for the PPP’s win.
 






Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency, said on social media platform X yesterday that if the PML-N managed to win five NA seats in these by-polls, it would “not need PPP votes for a simple majority in [the] NA in future”.
“In other words, PML-N can stay in power without PPP’s support!” the election expert added.

Karachi’s road networks have been in shambles with thoroughfares riddled with potholes, posing serious dangers to commuters across the city, particularly after the latest spell of rains.
According to a statement by CM Sindh’s spokesperson, Abdul Rashid Channa, a meeting on the reconstruction of Karachi’s roads and streets was chaired by CM Murad today. Minister for Local Government Nasir Shah, Mayor Karachi Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah, Principal Secretary Agha Wasif, Senior Member Board of Revenue Khalid Haider Shah, among others, also participated.
 






“After heavy rains, Karachi’s roads are in a state of disrepair,” CM Murad was quoted as saying. “Mega projects are underway, causing traffic problems. I want development work to be accelerated in the city so that people do not suffer further.”
Mayor Wahab stated that 315 internal streets of the city were in a state of disrepair. The CM ordered that all internal street schemes be approved and that work be done quickly.
He also instructed the authorities concerned to ensure a regular drainage system is made in the streets being constructed, along with one on the 60 important highways, as per the statement.
Mayor Wahab briefed that the cost of Karachi’s development work was estimated at Rs25 billion. “Funds are not the issue; I want immediate and quality work for the citizens,” the CM was quoted as saying.
CM Murad congratulated the mayor on the inauguration of reverse-osmosis RO plants in Keamari. “We have to ensure clean water, good roads and excellent law and order for the people,” he said, adding that traffic accidents in the city have decreased since the launch of the Sindh Safe City Project.
In March, Mayor Wahab had demanded that the federal government provide Rs25 bn to strengthen the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) so that the development of the megacity could be ensured.</p><small>2025-11-24 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/240720503935805.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957018/alarmed-by-weakness-of-audit-mechanism-imf-calls-for-independent-agp-office' target='_blank'><strong>Alarmed by weakness of audit mechanism, IMF calls for independent AGP office</strong></a><br><p>• Warns of fiduciary risks to Rs40tr in public funds
• Questions why auditor general’s office remains attached to federal secretariat
• Audit process bogged down by over 6,000 reports a year, minimal PAC follow-up
ISLAMABAD: The Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF) has expressed serious concern over the absence of an internal audit mechanism and weak constitutional and parliamentary audit supervision in Pakistan, warning that these gaps pose major fiduciary risks to public funds estimated at about Rs40 trillion at the federal level and even higher in the provinces.
It has called for a fully independent Office of the Auditor Gen­eral of Pakistan (AGP) to ensure better value for taxpayers’ money.
 
 

In a detailed section in its Governance & Corruption Diagnosis Assessment (GCDA), the IMF has identified a series of weaknesses in Pakistan’s internal financial controls, internal and external audit systems and practical subservience of the AGP to the executive despite its constitutional autonomy, besides insufficient capacity and role of the parliamentary oversight through the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
It is therefore unsurprising that cases of financial irregularities, embezzlement and corruption running into trillions of rupees continue to surface year after year.
The Fund said an effective internal control system was essential for creating an environment that ensured appropriate decision-making regarding the use of public resources, with clear accountability for such decisions, including via administrative structures, as well as external oversight by a supreme audit institution and the legislature.
“Both internal and external audits are vital in maintaining the integrity of an organisation’s operations and financial reporting, thereby reducing the risk of corruption,” the Fund observed and highlighted a series of weaknesses and vulnerabilities.
Saying that internal audit was weak in Pakistan, the report noted that the Public Finance Management (PFM) Act 2019 required the creation of a Chief Internal Auditor (CIA) in each division to work directly with principal accounting officers no later than 2020.
“Despite this provision, there has been no implementation and appointment of CIAs,” the IMF said.
It said that 25 chief finance and accounts officers (CFAOs) were working in ministries for financial management — a distinct role — but CIAs have not been posted in all ministries and divisions and CFAOs are also missing in 15 ministries and divisions. The full implementation of the PFM Act 2019 still remains a dream after six years.
“In addition, ministries and divisions with CFAOs lack consistency, interest, and follow-up on the findings of internal audit reports,” it said. The Fund also questioned why the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) was still operating as an attached institution of the Federal Secretariat, which resulted in a lack of full independence.
According to Article 171 of the Constitution and Article 7 of the Pakistan Audit Ordinance, 2001, the AGP has to attest the Appropriation accounts and financial statements of federal, provincial and local governments’ entities and the certified accounts and financial statements of the federal and provincial/local governments are submitted to the president and the governors of provinces, respectively.
“Due to its status as an attached institution, the Auditor General does not report directly to the parliament but instead through the Federal Secretariat, the prime minister, and the president. This indirect reporting structure can potentially compromise the independence and objectivity of the audit process,” it said.
In addition, as an attached institution, the OAG has to obtain approval from the federal Public Service Commission to hire auditors. The OAG complained to the IMF that they faced a significant staffing shortage — a deficit of 1,500 staff members — mainly due to fiscal constraints preventing necessary government approvals for hiring.
Despite the fact that the budget of the Auditor General is classified as charged expenditure, which means it is not subject to a parliamentary vote, the OAG still needs to adhere to budget execution rules. Consequently, they are subject to budget releases by the Finance Division, subject to cash availability.
“This dependency on the Federal Secretariat for budget releases further limits the OAG’s operational independence”, critically important for Supreme Audit Institutions to perform their tasks as needed and required, it said.
As if that was not enough, the effectiveness of the audit process was further being undermined by the excessively long reports that contain repetitive recommendations and the lack of timely review by the PAC.
The Office of the Auditor General produced over 6,000 reports each year, but there was minimal or no follow-up from the Public Account Committee and the ministries and divisions. “As a result, 75 per cent of the 34,000 recommendations made by the Supreme Audit Institution are still pending discussion in the PAC.
Moreover, it pointed out that the audit reports were often too lengthy, with some reaching up to thousands of pages that included repetitive recommendations for years since these irregularities identified in the reports are not addressed by the executive agencies. For instance, the Federal Government Compliance Audit Report for FY2023-24 is 4,000 pages long.
On top of that, there are no systems in place for monitoring the response to or compliance with audit findings and recommendations, which further diminishes the impact and effectiveness of the audit process.
The IMF demanded the development of a system that could make executive authority responsible and accountable in case of non-compliance with audit recommendations as well as PAC directions.
For this, the lender suggested making appropriate amendments to the PAC regulations and AGP Act to empower these institutions to ensure compliance with their directives.
Going forward, the IMF also demanded streamlining audit reports by including concise recommendations for the most critical issues and organising findings by their impact and urgency, using visual tools like traffic light systems to indicate the severity of issues.
In addition, the Fund also demanded strengthening of the parliamentary oversight by mandating the PAC to review audit reports promptly, supported by a tracking system on implementation progress through a centralised secretariat for monitoring and improved transparency and accountability.

On Friday, India’s Tejas fighter jet crashed in a ball of fire in front of horrified spectators during an aerial display at the Dubai Airshow.
The Indian Air Force has said it is setting up a court of inquiry to investigate the cause.
 
 

State-owned Hindustan Aeronautics manufactures the aircraft, which is powered by General Electric engines. Both companies have said they will support the investigation.
Tejas, which means brilliance in Sanskrit, is seen as crucial for India’s efforts to modernise its air force fleet of mainly Russian and ex-Soviet fighters.
The crash, which killed the pilot, dampens New Delhi’s hopes of exporting the home-built jet and leaves it reliant on Indian military orders to sustain its role as a showcase of domestic defence technology.
Such a public loss could overshadow India’s efforts to establish the jet abroad after a painstaking development over four decades, experts have said.
Hindustan Aeronautics said on Monday that the crash will not affect its business operations, financials or future deliveries.

Prime Minister Mark Carney met with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a bilateral discussion on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa.
“The leaders agreed to begin negotiations on a high-ambition Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), aimed at doubling bilateral trade to USD 50 billion by 2030,” the statement from India’s Prime Minister’s Office said.
“PM Modi and I met at the G20 summit today, and launched negotiations for a trade deal that could more than double our trade to more than C$70 billion,” Carney said in a post on social media platform X.
“India is the world’s fifth largest economy, and that means big new opportunities for Canadian workers and businesses.”
 






Both sides reaffirmed their longstanding civil nuclear cooperation and noted the ongoing discussions on expanding collaboration, including through long-term uranium supply arrangements, it added.
The restart of talks highlights thawing relations between the two countries as Carney pushes to expand trade ties beyond the United States, its biggest trading partner.
Carney has vowed to double Canada’s non-US exports over the next decade.
Canada paused negotiations for a broad trade pact in 2023 after relations soured when Ottawa accused the Indian government of involvement in the killing of a Canadian Sikh separatist. New Delhi has denied involvement.
Despite the diplomatic row, trade between Canada and India has grown but trade experts say it is quite small relative to the size of India’s economy.
Two-way goods and services trade touched about C$31bn ($21.98bn) in 2024, largely in Canada’s favour due to its C$16bn in services exports. In contrast, Canada’s total bilateral trade with China was almost four times bigger in 2024.
Relations between Canada and India began to improve following Modi’s meeting with Carney on the sidelines of the G7 summit in June.
Earlier on Sunday, Carney said he considers India a reliable trading partner, although he acknowledged there could be some “source of friction”.
He said Canada and India have a strong commercial relationship and he would be keen to scale that up.
“What we’re looking to do is to put that (commercial relationship) on a sound footing through a potential trade agreement between the two countries, which gives protections to our businesses, protections to Indian businesses, a clear set of rules, dispute mechanisms, and others, and build on those opportunities.”
Carney also met with Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva at the G20 summit and the leaders agreed to intensify negotiations on a Canada-Mercosur free trade agreement.

Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said on Sunday that the government was reviewing mechanisms used in Australia and other nations to impose age restrictions, citing the need to shield youths from cyberbullying, financial scams and child sexual abuse.
“We hope by next year that social media platforms will comply with the government’s decision to bar those under the age of 16 from opening user accounts,” he told reporters, according to a video of his remarks posted online by local daily The Star.
 


The effects of social media on children’s health and safety have emerged as a global concern, with firms such as TikTok, Snapchat, Google and Meta Platforms — the operator of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — facing lawsuits in the United States over their alleged role in fuelling a mental-health crisis.
Australia is set to deactivate accounts registered to users under 16 next month, in a sweeping ban for teenagers that is being closely monitored by regulators worldwide. France, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Greece are also jointly testing a template for an age-verification app.
 
 

Neighbouring Indonesia announced in January that it planned to set a minimum age for social media users, but later opted for a less stringent regulation requiring tech platforms to filter negative content and enforce stronger age-verification measures.
Malaysia has tightened scrutiny of social media companies in recent years in response to what it says is a rise in harmful content, including online gambling and posts related to race, religion and royalty.
Platforms and messaging services with more than 8 million users in the country are now required to obtain a licence under a regulation that came into effect in January.</p><small>2025-11-24 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24112846765ac7d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957047/washington-kyiv-say-peace-deal-must-fully-uphold-ukraines-sovereignty' target='_blank'><strong>Washington, Kyiv say peace deal must ‘fully uphold’ Ukraine’s sovereignty</strong></a><br><p>Washington and Kyiv said that any eventual deal to halt the war with Russia must fully uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty, after “constructive” talks between US, Ukrainian and European officials in Geneva.
After a day of meetings that kicked off based on a United States’ proposal that was criticised as being in Russia’s favour, negotiators have drafted “an updated and refined peace framework”, a US-Ukraine joint statement said on Sunday.
US President Donald Trump had given Ukraine until November 27 to approve his plan to end the nearly four-year conflict, which began after Russia launched a full-scale invasion.
But Kyiv was seeking changes to the draft that accepted a range of Russia’s hardline demands, with the 28-point plan requiring the invaded country to cede territory, cut its army and pledge never to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato).
 
 

“The talks were constructive, focused, and respectful, underscoring the shared commitment to achieving a just and lasting peace,” the joint statement said.
“They reaffirmed that any future agreement must fully uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty and deliver a sustainable and just peace,” it said, noting “meaningful progress”.
Both sides pledged to keep working on joint proposals “in the coming days”.
But even as the White House said in a separate statement that the talks marked a “significant step forward”, a Russian drone strike on the major Ukrainian city of Kharkiv killed four people, its mayor said.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke of “tremendous” progress after a day of meetings, while the head of Ukraine’s delegation Andriy Yermak also told reporters the sides had made “very good progress”.
The Ukrainian delegation referred to a new version of the US draft plan, which has yet to be published, saying it “already reflects most of Ukraine’s key priorities”.

Rubio, whose delegation included Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and diplomatic envoy Steve Witkoff, told reporters that the work to narrow the areas of disagreement had advanced “in a very substantial way”.
“I can tell you that the items that remain open are not insurmountable,” he said, adding: “I honestly believe we’ll get there.”
Rubio stressed that any final agreement would “have to be agreed upon by the presidents, and there are a couple [of] issues that we need to continue to work on” before trying to bring on board the Kremlin, which welcomed the original proposal.
“Obviously, the Russians get a vote.”
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he would speak with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Monday. Turkey has hosted three rounds of talks on ending the war.
‘Zero gratitude’ claim
His comments came after Trump earlier lashed out at Ukraine.
“Ukraine ‘leadership’ has expressed zero gratitude for our efforts,” Trump wrote in uppercase on his Truth Social platform, also accusing European countries of not doing enough to stop the war, but offering no direct condemnation of Moscow.
 






Not long after, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on X that his country was “grateful to the United States… and personally to President Trump” for the assistance that has been “saving Ukrainian lives”.
 






Announcing a deadly Russian drone strike, Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram yesterday it was “truly horrible” that despite the negotiations, “Russian troops are attacking civilian objects, civilian infrastructure, residential buildings”.
At the end of the day, Rubio said he thought Trump was “quite pleased at the reports we’ve given him about the amount of progress that’s been made”.
Asked about whether he believed a deal could be reached by Thursday, he said the “deadline is we want to get this done as soon as possible”.
“I think we made a tremendous amount of progress. I feel very optimistic that we’re going to get there in a very reasonable period of time, very soon.”
 


European ‘centrality’
The US plan was drafted without input from Ukraine’s European allies, who were scrambling on Sunday to make their voices heard and boost Kyiv’s position.
EU countries plan to discuss the Ukraine situation on the sidelines of a meeting with African leaders in Angola today.
“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny,” EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement, stressing that the “centrality” of the European Union’s role must be “fully reflected” in any peace plan.
 






A number of leaders called Trump on Sunday, with Downing Street saying United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer and the US president had agreed “that we all must work together at this critical moment to bring about a just and lasting peace”.</p><small>2025-11-24 06:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/231935139179514.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956889/economic-impact-or-concentration-of-wealth-panellists-explore-ais-promise-perils-at-adab-festival' target='_blank'><strong>Economic impact or concentration of wealth? Panellists explore AI’s promise, perils at Adab Festival</strong></a><br><p>As artificial intelligence continues to reshape daily life, speakers at Karachi’s Adab Festival gathered at Habitt City on Sunday to discuss how the technology has evolved, what it offers, as well as the blind spots and ethical risks it now poses for the future.
The session, titled Designing Tomorrow with Artificial Intelligence, featured Dr Salman Khatani and Sadaf Bhatti, with Ahsan Siddiqui moderating. Entrepreneur Jehan Ara was scheduled to attend but was unable to do so.
Siddiqui began by noting how quickly technological trends shift, recalling earlier waves, from AutoCAD to digital marketing and e-commerce, before today’s AI boom. He pointed out that while people eagerly use tools like ChatGPT or Gemini for tasks such as grammar fixes or image edits, far fewer understand how such systems can be used to create new tools themselves. 
“Change is the only constant,” he said, while raising a broader question about the technology’s origins.
Bhatti traced AI’s emergence to 1956 and the study of neurons; historically, that year is known for John McCarthy coining the term ‘artificial intelligence’ at the first AI conference at Dartmouth College. 
According to Dr Khatani, large language models (LLMs) enable students to access advanced knowledge in local languages, a feature that, for example, allowed him to teach a seven-year-old the concept of relativity in a regional language (something previously unheard of without an LLM). 
“These tools empower the next generation to access knowledge in their native languages and transform their families’ lives,” he said. 
Citing Collins Dictionary’s designation of ‘vibe coding’ as word of the year, he said young people can now design applications and games without knowledge of machine learning or deep learning. “Now humans must return to creativity, diversity and empathy, while machines handle logic and engineering,” he said. 
Vibe coding can be understood as the practice of prompting AI tools to generate code rather than writing code manually. Despite tradeoffs, fewer barriers to entry make it easier for non-specialists to build projects with relative ease. 
Dr Khatani brought up how Nvidia recently became the world’s first $5 trillion company with just 36,000 employees and cited Cursor as an example of how AI enables small teams to achieve massive results. The discussion, however, raised questions about the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few. 
As audience member Syed Khawar Mehdi put it: “Unlike the Industrial Revolution, which created jobs on a large scale, in AI’s first phase, we see a concentration of wealth. A very limited number of people are commanding huge resources and fiscal empowerment.”
He also mentioned its misuse in academia and the generation of historically inaccurate content on social media, which Dr Khatani acknowledged as genuine, along with deepfakes, intellectual property issues, and cybersecurity fraud.
Mehdi, who has authored the book ‘Honour-bound to Pakistan in Duty, Destiny and Death’, told Dawn that while he himself uses AI and sees it as extremely beneficial, it is still “a tool in evolution”. 
“We are so excited with the humongous universe that’s unfolding in front of us; we haven’t been able to see its negative side. People are using it rampantly to cheat in colleges and schools. And history is being distorted, which is very alarming,” he said, referring to AI-generated videos on social media that inaccurately depict historical figures from contradicting timelines. 
“People who define society in terms of morals and values, they have to put a foot down in front of science. [AI is] excellent in diagnostics, engineering, teaching, health, administration, water management, space technology. But when it comes to morals, values and societal norms and what defines a society, a civilisation, we as a people have to draw a line. Humans can never be replaced.”</p><small>2025-11-24 05:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635106-federal-constabulary-hq-comes-under-attack-in-peshawar-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three terrorists killed as suicide attack on FC HQ in Peshawar foiled: police</strong></a><br><p>

The first tranche of deals will include projects in Pakistan, Egypt and Europe, the organisation’s chair John Jovanovic told the Financial Times in an interview on Sunday. He added that the West was over-reliant on supplies that “are no longer fair”.
 
 

“We can’t do anything else that we’re trying to do without these underlying critical raw material supply chains being secure, stable and functioning,” Jovanovic was quoted saying.
Jovanovic told FT that the bank has $100bn left to deploy of the $135bn autho­rised by Congress. He said the bank’s early deals would also include a credit insurance guarantee for $4bn of natural gas being delivered to Egypt by New York-based commodities group Hartree Partners.
The Exim Bank did not respond to a request for comment.

The ongoing tug-of-war over who gets control of the Constitution Ave­nue premises is increasingly starting to resemble a joint family squeezed into an old ancestral home, where every member complains about inadequate space and competing needs.
Last week, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) demanded that the FCC be moved out of its temporary location within the IHC building, asserting that the new court must eventually operate from the FSC premises.
The bar leadership also warned that any attempt to relocate the IHC itself would be met with determined legal and democratic resistance.

Islamabad judiciary wary as newly formed Federal Constitutional Court could potentially usurp its coveted Constitution Avenue location

The establishment of the FCC has exposed what many observers describe as a lack of planning on the part of policymakers. The FCC — initially part of the 26th Constitutional Amendment package, but removed shortly before its passage — was reintroduced in the 27th Amendment.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had reportedly finalised the FSC building for the FCC days before the amendment was tabled in parliament.
However, the decision to convert the FSC building into the FCC’s permanent home was taken unilaterally, without consulting Shariat Court judges. Under the plan, four FSC judges and a backlog of only 56 pending petitions were to be shifted to the IHC’s third floor, where the Capital Development Authority (CDA) was instructed to urgently prepare four new courtrooms.
 
 

Simultaneously, the CDA was tasked with renovating FSC courtrooms for FCC judges. But when CDA teams arrived to take possession of the Shariat Court premises, the administration strongly resisted, even preventing their entry.
FSC Chief Justice Iqbal Hameedur Rehman, along with other judges, subsequently met Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi and conveyed their reservations over what they termed a unilateral and abrupt order, requiring them to vacate their purpose-built premises within a week.
A senior lawyer remarked that the situation was ironic: “A tenant is normally granted at least a month to vacate a rented property, yet the FSC judges were expected to leave within a week from a building acquired specifically for the Shariat Court”.
Cramped space
After the 27th Amendment was passed and received presidential assent, the oath-taking ceremony of the FCC Chief Justice was held at the Presidency, attended by the top civil, military and legal leadership.
But with the FSC building still not handed over to the FCC, the oath-taking for the judges had to be held at the Islamabad High Court.
The initial oath ceremony for three judges took place on November 14 at an open space at the IHC, where IHCBA office-bearers and senior lawyers warmly greeted the newly-appointed judges.
The following day, Justice K.K. Agha was administered the oath in a cramped conference room, which could accommodate barely 25-30 people. On November 17, the oaths of Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah were also conducted in the same congested room.
The IHC administration arranged seven courtrooms to enable the FCC to function temporarily until its permanent premises were finalised. But once senior staff of the FCC — many of them brought in from the Supreme Court — assumed their roles, the shortage of space became even more pronounced.
The allocation of courtrooms also caused unease. The FCC chief justice was assigned Courtroom No. 2, previously used by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani for his own judicial work.
Senior officials within the high court expressed the apprehension that since the FCC is the highest constitutional forum, its chief justice could potentially assume control of the IHC building if he so desired.
Bar divided
At Friday’s press conference, IHCBA President Wajid Ali Gilani emphasised that the FCC’s use of IHC premises must remain temporary.
“The FCC must first be moved to the Supreme Court building, and permanently to the FSC, where the caseload is lower and infrastructure already exists,” he said. “No institution will be allowed to impose itself on the site of the high court.”
“Any administrative decision taken without consultation with the legal community is unacceptable and will be vigorously resisted,” he warned.
Mr Gilani recalled that Islamabad’s judicial framework had evolved from a single court functioning in Melody Market in 1960, to a full-fledged system with more than a hundred judges.
He said buildings constructed through public funds must operate according to constitutional norms rather than administrative convenience.
IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja said rumours of the IHC’s relocation stemmed from a private TV report with “no legal or administrative standing”. He warned: “If anyone tries to wall off the High Court, there will be a strong protest. This community will not allow the judiciary’s independence to be compromised.” In stark contrast to the high court bar’s position, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) — commonly known as the District Bar — welcomed the proposal to shift the high court back to its old premises in Sector G-10.
After a cabinet meeting on Friday, IBA President Chaudhry Naeem Ali Gujjar said the proposal would alleviate difficulties faced by lawyers and litigants. “Shifting the high court back to G-10 is a practical and long-awaited step. It will facilitate the legal community and improve access to justice,” he said.
