Originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza after Israel’s two-year war on the Palestinian enclave, the board’s charter envisions a wider role in resolving international conflicts.
A group of leaders and senior officials from 19 countries — including Pakistan — gathered on stage with Trump at a signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland to put their names to the founding charter of the body.
Trump — who is the chairman of the Board of Peace — said they were “in most cases very popular leaders, some cases not so popular”.
“That’s the way it goes in life,” he said.
“Congratulations, President Trump. The charter is now in full force, and the Board of Peace is now an official international organisation,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

 


“Every one of them are friends of mine. I like every single one of them,” Trump said about the signatories.
“Just about every country wants to be a part of it. We sent out the letters a couple of days ago and countries that are here just happened to be in Davos,” he said.
The US president declared, “Everybody in this room is a star […] There’s a reason that you’re here. When you use that inspired genius for peace, the opposite of peace has no chance.”
Referring to the signatories at the outset of his speech, Trump said, “Each and every one of you, we are truly honoured by your presence today. Leaders of countries, in most cases, very popular leaders; in some cases, not so popular.”
Among those seated in the audience was PM Shehbaz. Pakistan on Wednesday had accepted Trump’s invitation to join the Board of Peace.
After Trump’s address, the heads of various countries took turns to sign the board’s charter. Permanent members must also pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a “pay to play” version of the UN Security Council.
While Trump’s plan had sparked concerns that he wants the board to rival the United Nations (UN), the US president said the body will work “in conjunction” with the UN.
Officials from Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan also signed the document with Trump.
Apart from the US, no other permanent member of the UNSC — the five nations with the most say over international law and diplomacy since the end of World War Two — has so far committed to join.
France has declined to join. Britain said on Thursday it was not joining at present. China has not yet said whether it will do so.
However, the Board of Peace’s potential membership has been controversial, with Trump inviting Israel’s PM Benjamin Netanyahu, who faces an International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant for alleged war crimes in Gaza.
Netanyahu has said Israel will join the board, but he was not at the ceremony.
Trump had also invited Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Ukraine four years ago. While the US president said Putin had agreed to join, the Russian leader said he was still studying the invitation.
Reuters could not immediately spot any representatives from governments of top global powers or from Israel or the Palestinian Authority (PA) at the signing ceremony.
‘End’ of Hamas if it doesn’t disarm: Trump
During his speech, the US president also said that Hamas must disarm under the Gaza ceasefire deal or it will be the “end” of the Palestinian movement.
“They have to give up their weapons, and if they don’t do that, it’s going to be the end of them,” Trump said.
“We’re committed to ensuring Gaza is demilitarised, properly governed and beautifully rebuilt,” he affirmed, adding that “we can spread out to other things as we succeed with Gaza”.
“Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do, and we’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,” the US president said, adding that the combination of the Board of Peace and the UN could be “very, very unique for the world”.

 

Trump recalled that under Phase 1 of the ceasefire plan, “we have painstakingly […] maintained the Gaza ceasefire, delivered record levels of humanitarian aid”.
“We’ve given aid, you know, you used to hear that all the people were starving and it was terrible. You don’t hear that anymore,” he insisted, highlighting the release of 20 Israeli captives and the bodies of most of the deceased ones.
The US president asserted: “The first steps toward a brighter day for the Middle East and a much safer future for the world are unfolding before your very eyes.
“Together we are in a position to have an incredible chance — I don’t even call it a chance, it’s gonna happen — to end decades of suffering, stop generations of hatred and bloodshed and forge a beautiful, everlasting and glorious peace for that region, and for the whole region of the world, because I’m calling the world a region.”
Trump also claimed that Iran wants to hold talks with the US, and that Washington was willing to do so. “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.”
He also recalled the US strikes on Iran’s uranium enrichment sites in June 2025.“Can’t let that happen,” he said, referring to the US’s stance that Tehran plans to build nuclear weapons.



Focus right now on Gaza: Rubio
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner also spoke on the occasion.
In his speech, Rubio highlighted that Trump was “willing to talk to or engage with anyone in the interest of peace”.
He stressed, “Now we have this Board of Peace … [its] possibilities are endless. Obviously, with a focus first and foremost on making sure this peace deal in Gaza becomes enduring.
“I know this president has it as his highest priority and will give everything that he has to make sure that this is successful.”
The US secretary of state asserted: “This is not just a Board of Peace but a board of action, just like President Trump is a president of action.”
Rubio emphasised that the “focus is right now on Gaza and making sure that the […] vision for the future of Gaza […] of the region, is not just possible and promising, but it is our destiny”.
He further said it would serve as an example of “what’s possible for other places and other conflicts that seem impossible to solve right now”.
“Many others who are going to join … are not in town today or they have to go through some procedure internally in their own country because of constitutional limitations, but others will join,” Rubio added.

Meanwhile, Kushner said the next phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal would address funding for reconstruction in the territory, which lies mostly in ruins, as well as disarmament by Hamas, one of the most intractable unresolved issues.
“If Hamas doesn’t demilitarise, that would be what holds this plan back,” Kushner said.
“The next 100 days, we’re going to continue to just be heads down and focused on making sure this is implemented. We continue to be focused on humanitarian aid, humanitarian shelter, but then creating the conditions to move forward.”
Rafah crossing to open ‘in both directions’: Palestinian official
The Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip will reopen in both directions next week, said Ali Shaath, the newly-appointed administrator of the Palestinian territory under the US-backed plan.
The reopening of the crossing is part of the Gaza truce plan announced by Trump in October, but it has remained closed so far.
“I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions,” Shaath, a former PA deputy minister, said at the Board of Peace launch ceremony.

 

“For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate; it is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity. Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and the world,” Shaath said.
As part of the truce plan, Shaath was named to head a committee of 15 Palestinian technocrats to oversee the day-to-day administration of Gaza.
Trump to meet Zelensky
The inclusion of Putin has caused particular concern among US allies, but especially in Ukraine, as it seeks an end to Moscow’s nearly four-year-old invasion.
Trump was set to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos after the Board of Peace ceremony to discuss a ceasefire in Ukraine — the major peace deal that continues to elude him.
Witkoff, who is due to travel to Moscow to meet Putin later on Thursday, said in Davos that talks to end the war had made a “lot of progress” and were down to one issue.
“I think we’ve got it down to one issue, and we have discussed iterations of that issue, and that means it’s solvable,” said Witkoff, without saying what the issue was.
Witkoff added that he and Kushner would not stay in Moscow overnight but fly straight to Abu Dhabi for “military to military” talks.
Zelensky has voiced fears that Trump’s push to seize Greenland — which has dominated Davos so far and threatened to unravel the transatlantic alliance — could divert focus away from Russia’s invasion of his country.

The journalist’s arrest came after a first information report (FIR) was registered against him under Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 324 (attempted murder) and 337A(i) (causing a head injury) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The complainant, who operates a “cable network”, alleged that he and his friends had met for tea at a restaurant on Wednesday night, when Salman and three others drew a pistol and started firing, resulting in a bullet injury to his thigh.
He further alleged that the suspect was spreading fake news against him on social media for “blackmailing purposes”.
Subsequently, the Sindh home minister took notice of the arrest and sought details from the Korangi senior superintendent of police, according to a statement.
“Merit, transparency and impartiality should be given focus,” Lanjar said in the statement, adding that all media organisations should be taken into confidence and that a thorough inquiry be conducted.
“I assure my journalist brethren that merit and transparency will be ensured during police investigation,” he added.
Meanwhile, the journalist’s wife filed an application with the Model Colony police alleging that certain elements wanted to occupy the land of a bus terminal in Model Colony. She said her husband had exposed the land grabbing “while performing his professional duties”, leading the complainant to “threaten him”.
“Suspects riding four motorcycles on Wednesday night arrived at the restaurant and threatened my husband,” she alleged in her application. “He (Salman) took out a licensed pistol and resorted to firing in self-defence,” she said.
She further stated that they had sought protection from the police, which was not provided and accused the suspects of “being supported by political elements”. She further alleged that the suspects beat her husband while he was in police custody.
Meanwhile, separate statements issued by the Karachi Press Club (KPC) and Karachi Union of Journalists (KUJ) condemned the arrest.
“Arresting a person who opened fire in self-defence instead of the attacker is worrying,” the KUJ’s president and secretary said in a joint statement.
It added that some elements had been threatening Salman for reporting the news over several days and that after opening fire in self-defence, Salman himself had approached the police for help but was refused.
“Not only did they file a case against him, aiding the criminals, but they refused to accept his wife’s application,” the statement added.
“High-ranking police officials should take notice of this matter and bring justice to the journalist [and] the authorities should ensure a transparent investigation,” the statement said.
The KPC also demanded that Salman be released immediately and that an impartial investigation be conducted into the incident.
“KPC President Fazil Jamili, Secretary Aslam Khan and the executive council have expressed deep concern over the attempted attack on Salman, a senior member of the press club, and his subsequent arrest,” the statement said.
It noted that Salman was a “responsible and professional journalist” and that if he were threatened or attacked, law enforcement agencies’ first responsibility should be to provide protection to him and take action against the real suspects.
“Arresting a senior journalist on the basis of self-defence is upsetting and concerning, while the impression that the victim should be blamed instead of the complainant is also extremely dangerous,” the statement added.
The KPC, alongside demanding Salman’s release and a transparent probe, demanded the assurance that journalists would not face harassment or retaliation while carrying out their duties.</p><small>2026-01-22 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22163731fa21035.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413/bangladesh-firm-on-not-playing-t20-world-cup-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh firm on not playing T20 World Cup in India</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh will not travel to India to play in next month’s T20 World Cup, its cricket board said on Thursday, effectively ruling the country out of the tournament.
According to ESPN Cricinfo, the decision was announced after a meeting in Dhaka between Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam Bulbul, CEO Nizamuddin, Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul and several national team players.
“Our only demand is to play the World Cup – but not in India,” the BCB president told reporters.
The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that it would not be making any changes to the World Cup schedule or groups, days after Bangladesh requested that its matches be moved to Sri Lanka after refusing to play in India.
“We will go back to the ICC with our plan to play in Sri Lanka,” the BCB president said.
“They did give us a 24-hour ultimatum but a global body can’t really do that. ICC will miss out on 200 million people watching the World Cup (if Bangladesh is axed). It will be their loss…”
“Bangladesh is a cricket-loving nation. If a country of nearly 200 million people misses the World Cup, the ICC will lose a huge audience,” the BCB’s Bulbul said.
“Cricket is entering the Olympics in 2028, Brisbane in 2032, India is bidding for 2036. Excluding a major cricket-loving country like Bangladesh would be a failure,” he said.
Meanwhile, Nazrul said, “There is no scope for changing our decision.”
He said Bangladesh’s security concerns “did not arise from speculation or theoretical analysis”.
“They arose from a real incident – where one of our country’s top players was forced to bow to extremists, and the Indian cricket board asked him to leave India,” he said.
“We are hopeful that ICC will give us the opportunity to play in Sri Lanka,” Nazrul said.
Following yesterday’s decision by the ICC, Islam had said Bangladesh players were keen to play in the World Cup and that he was “hoping for a miracle from the ICC.
“Who doesn’t want to play in the World Cup?” Islam said on Wednesday.
“Bangladesh players want to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh government wants Bangladesh to play the World Cup. But we don’t think India is safe for our players,” Islam had said.
Bangladesh announced on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh had “formally requested” the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.
The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 with Bangladesh in England’s Group C. The team is scheduled to play all of their group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.</p><small>2026-01-22 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22164200ed87d8f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968435/nestle-announces-60m-additional-investment-in-pakistan-to-expand-operations-in-country' target='_blank'><strong>Nestle announces $60m additional investment in Pakistan, to expand operations in country</strong></a><br><p>Nestle on Thursday announced that it would invest an additional $60 million in Pakistan and would also “undertake a robust expansion of its operations in the country”.
The development came as Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb met Remy Ejel, the executive vice president and chief executive officer for Asia, Oceania, and Africa at Nestle, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, according to a statement issued by the finance ministry.







The ministry said Aurangzeb chaired a high-level business roundtable on the sidelines of the WEF, bringing together chief executive officers and senior leaders of leading global corporations to discuss Pakistan’s reform trajectory, investment climate, and long-term growth potential.
“The roundtable formed part of the government of Pakistan’s ongoing engagement with multinational investors to promote policy predictability, economic formalisation, and sustainable, export-oriented growth,” it said.
“A major highlight of the discussion was the announcement by Ejel … of an additional investment of $60 million in Pakistan. Ejel stated that Nestle will undertake a robust expansion of its operations in the country, reaffirming its long-term commitment to Pakistan,” the statement said.
“He further announced that Nestle intends to use Pakistan as a regional manufacturing and export hub, exporting products to 26 countries from Pakistan. Expressing strong confidence in Pakistan’s economic outlook, Ejel foresaw robust growth in Nestle’s business in Pakistan in the coming years,” the statement said.
According to the finance ministry, the announcement builds on the company’s recent engagement with the minister in Islamabad, where the company had “outlined its strategy centered on localisation, advanced manufacturing, sustainability, and agricultural transformation”.
The statement further said that Ejal noted that Pakistan’s demographic profile, growing nutrition needs, and underpenetrated value-added food segments closely mirrored successful growth trajectories seen in Southeast Asia.
Meanwhile, Aurangzeb welcomed the announcement and described it as a “strong vote of confidence in Pakistan’s economic reforms and formalisation drive”.
“He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to strengthening the tax ecosystem, ensuring policy consistency, and facilitating responsible long-term investment through continued engagement with the private sector, including via the Tax Policy Office established within the Finance Division,” the statement said.
The minister also emphasised that Pakistan offered compelling opportunities in affordable nutrition, climate-resilient dairy, localised sourcing, and export-oriented manufacturing, and reiterated the government’s resolve to position Pakistan as a competitive base for regional production and global value chains.
Azerbaijan’s Socar signals investment in Pakistan’s oil and gas sector
A separate handout by the ministry said that following the high-level business roundtable chaired by Aurangzeb, the State Oil Company of the Republic of Azerbaijan (Socar) announced that it was set to finalise its investment in Pakistan’s oil and gas sector in February.







The announcement was made by Socar’s president, Rovshan Najaf, during the roundtable, the statement said.
Socar viewed Pakistan as a natural long-term energy partner, pointing to the country’s market depth, rising energy demand, and reform momentum in the oil and gas sector, the statement quoted him as saying.
He added that Socar’s planned investment would build on its existing commercial footprint in Pakistan and expand cooperation across the energy value chain, it said.
He noted that the company was already in a commercial engagement in Pakistan through Socar Trading, providing Pakistan with flexible liquefied natural gas arrangements.
Najaf also noted Socar’s engagement with Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and expressed interest in expanding cooperation across the broader oil and gas value chain as Pakistan continues to implement energy-sector reforms. He emphasised Socar’s experience as a peer national energy company from an emerging economy, positioning it as a credible long-term partner for Pakistan’s energy sector.
Meanwhile, the finance minister reiterated the government’s commitment to attracting strategic and commercially viable investment in the oil and gas and mining sectors, describing these areas as central to Pakistan’s energy security and industrial growth.
“He noted that ongoing reforms are focused on improving pricing transparency, contractual clarity, and risk-sharing mechanisms to support sustained private-sector participation,” the statement said.</p><small>2026-01-22 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646598-pm-shehbaz-other-global-leaders-sign-trump-led-board-of-peace-charter' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, other global leaders sign Trump-led Board of Peace charter</strong></a><br><p>

Last year, the Sindh government had decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. The system was officially inaugurated in October and drew a mix of praise and criticism from the public.
According to a press release issued from the office of Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Javed Akhtar Odho, in a meeting held at the Central Police Office Karachi today, the newly appointed IG reviewed the performance of the new traffic system.
During the meeting, the deputy inspector general of traffic police briefed Odho that “so far, over 288,000 e-tickets have been generated under TRACS,” out of which 52 per cent of the tickets had been delivered, while 48pc were still under process.
The IGP was informed that the “reason for the delay in delivery was due to refusal to accept tickets, change of address or incomplete address,” and that redelivery was underway.
The IGP was further briefed that 71 percent of the tickets issued had been paid by citizens, while a significant percentage were waived as they were first-time offences.
“So far, 7,681 complaints have been registered against the e-challan system, out of which 81pc have been resolved and another 19pc are under review,” according to the briefing.
It further emerged that 12,000 vehicles have been blacklisted under the ticketing system since October 27.
The IGP was briefed that under the new system, vehicles associated with “non-transfer of ownership rights, fake number plates, incomplete number plates, theft, mischief,” and other illegal activities have been blacklisted.
IGP Odho also “directed traffic police to work in collaboration with district police to take action against the blacklisted vehicles,” the press release said.
He also issued instructions that the data of blacklisted vehicles should be provided to Safe City cameras, Emergency Response Vehicles and the Anti-Vehicle Lifting Cell.
“Additional IG Karachi, prepare a comprehensive plan for action against blacklisted vehicles,” IGP Odho said.
The statement added that he also directed traffic police to issue e-tickets through smartphones on an experimental basis.
He termed the use of technology essential to modern policing, adding that the “extraordinary steps need to be taken to make policing simpler”.
During the meeting, it was also decided to impose a Rs100,000 fine on heavy vehicles without trackers.
IGP Odho also issued instructions to the traffic police to ban transfers in the department.</p><small>2026-01-22 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/221206434a7aab4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968409/search-operation-continues-at-karachis-gul-plaza-after-deadly-inferno' target='_blank'><strong>Search operation continues at Karachi’s Gul Plaza after deadly inferno</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The search operation at Karachi’s Gul Plaza continued on Thursday in the wake of a devastating inferno, which has claimed over 60 lives so far.
The fire had erupted at the Gul Plaza on Saturday night. While the fire at the mall located on MA Jinnah Road was said to have been doused after more than 24 hours on Sunday, firefighting efforts had to resume on Monday as flames reignited from the smouldering debris.
The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
Rescue 1122’s urban search and rescue teams continued to comb through the debris overnight, using specialised tools and cutters, including thermal imaging cameras.
Relatives of those still missing have criticised the slow operation at the three-storey plaza, where rescuers are scouring the wreckage for human remains. Some families also staged a protest outside Gul Plaza today.
Meanwhile, the Edhi Foundation said in a statement that three more bodies, which were kept in its morgue after they were pulled from the rubble, had been identified through DNA tests.
One of the three identified deceased men ran a gift shop in Gul Plaza while the other two were employed at different shops in the shopping mall, the statement said.
It added that the bodies had been handed over to the heirs.
Yesterday, Police surgeon Sumaiya Syed told journalists that more than 50 families had given DNA samples for the identification of bodies.
“We will hand over the bodies (remains) to the family once DNA samples are matched,” she said outside the Civil Hospital Karachi mortuary.
Faraz Ali, whose father and 26-year-old brother were inside the mall, told AFP he wants “the bodies to be recovered and handed over to their rightful families”.
“That is all so that the families may receive something, some comfort, some peace. At least let us see them one last time, in whatever condition they are, so that we may say our final goodbye,” the 28-year-old said.
On Wednesday, in a harrowing development, at least 30 bodies were recovered from a gutted shop of the ill-fated plaza.
Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the remains of 30 humans had been recovered from a shop called “Dubai Crockery” located on the mezzanine floor.
He said that earlier in the day, rescue workers had recovered three more bodies, which had taken the toll from 28 to 31. He added that with the discovery of the bodies from the gutted shop, the death toll was estimated to have risen to 61.
SBCA begins fire safety assessments
The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), meanwhile, said it had initiated fire safety assessments in Karachi on the directives of Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah.
A statement issued by SBCA Director General (DG) Muzammil Halepoto’s office said fire safety arrangements in 35 of the city’s buildings, including both residential and commercial ones, had been carried out.
It quoted Halepoto as saying that the “functionality of firefighting and emergency systems” was being assessed in the exercise and notices for corrective measures would be issued to the owners of buildings with faulty fire safety systems.
Halepoto further stated that fire safety notices had been issued for 266 buildings in Karachi, which also included those covered in a Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) survey. He recalled that the KMC had also issued directives to builders, building owners and unions in January 2024 to ensure fire safety.
The official warned that buildings lacking firefighting tools and safety measures within the given time would be sealed.
The SBCA DG asserted that fire safety assessments would continue in the city to ensure emergency preparedness.
Inquiry committee visits gutted plaza
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, the convener of an inquiry committee formed by the Sindh government to probe the circumstances of the fire, visited the gutted plaza yesterday. Karachi Additional Inspector General Azad Khan, who is also a member of the committee, accompanied the commissioner.
Speaking to the media, the Karachi commissioner said the inquiry had just begun. He highlighted the building’s condition, saying the Rimpa Plaza, located adjacent to the plaza, had also been affected. However, he said that Rimpa Plaza had not yet been declared dangerous.
Naqvi lamented that the fire safety measures inside the buildings did not adhere to international standards.
The additional Karachi IG, meanwhile, said that no evidence of sabotage had emerged so far.
“We are investigating the incident thoroughly,” he said. He refuted media reports that two dumper trucks transporting debris from the plaza to KMC ground had disappeared.
KMC’s Zafar Khan also spoke to the media, saying the firefighting team was still working on the plaza despite the presence of “extreme heat” while cooling work was also ongoing on two spots.
He said one portion of the building had been cleared, while two other portions were in the process of being cleared.
“We will try to retrieve the bodies buried under the debris,” he vowed, adding that firemen were being sent to the spots where the building’s structure was still stable.
He also refuted claims alleging that the fire brigade had a delayed response to the fire. He said three fire tenders were sent as soon as information was received about the fire on Saturday night.
Khan further added that shopkeepers had created a chaotic situation and were allegedly snatching pipes from firefighters to extinguish the flames at their own shops.
He said that the door leading to the building’s roof was locked, therefore, people were unable to access it. He said that the market was meant to be closing when the fire erupted, which was why all the exits were closed.

Additional input from AFP</p><small>2026-01-22 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/221306495ac7420.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968422/mqm-p-demands-karachi-be-made-federal-territory-be-declared-financial-capital' target='_blank'><strong>MQM-P demands Karachi be made ‘federal territory’, be declared ‘financial capital’</strong></a><br><p>Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Mustafa Kamal on Thursday called on the federal government to declare Karachi a federal territory by making it the country’s “financial capital”.
The remarks come against the backdrop of the Gul Plaza inferno in the metropolis, which has resulted in lawmakers stressing the need for reforms in the city’s administration, particularly in local governments (LGs).
Kamal, addressing a press conference today, called on the federal government to “invoke Article 148 and 149 of the Constitution, and declare Karachi as the financial capital of the country”.
Article 148 of the Constitution pertains to the obligation of provinces and the federation, while Article 149 allows the federal government to issue directives to provinces in certain cases.
Article 149 enables the federal government to direct provincial governments regarding the “manner in which the executive authority thereof is to be exercised for the purpose of preventing any grave menace to the peace or tranquillity or economic life”.
Kamal stressed that given the potential of the metropolis, “it can not be given to such a provincial administration”, referring to the ruling PPP in Sindh.
“We have an administrative capital, but Karachi should be made a financial capital,” he reiterated, adding that the demand for provinces can be addressed later.
“A city that runs the entire country cannot remain under an administration engaging in democratic terrorism,” the MQM-P leader claimed.
Kamal insisted that the current city administration was “turning people against the state” by “disenfranchising them”, and cautioned that Pakistan’s enemies stood to gain from such a situation.
‘PPP taking unfair advantage of 18th Amendment’
The MQM-P leader further claimed that the PPP was taking “unfair advantage of the 18th Amendment”, alleging that it was being “used against us (Karachi citizens)”.
“End this 18th Amendment drama now,” Kamal said.
He also reiterated the party’s demand for strengthening the LG system.
Recalling the discussions ahead of the 27th Constitutional Amendment passed in November last year, he said that “even the prime minister agreed to the local government reforms”.
“The cabinet, including Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Tanveer and Rana Sanaullah, supported it unequivocally. However, the PPP was the sole party which refused to comply,” the MQM-P leader said.
“They threatened to pull out from voting for the other clauses in the Amendment, so we had to retreat,” Kamal added, echoing his stance of the PPP creating a “deadlock”.
The MQM-P has been calling for empowering LGs for a long time, even tying its support for the 26th and 27th Amendments to the inclusion of related provisions in Article 140A.
However, after both amendments did not address the matter, the party claimed that its suggested constitutional tweaks would now be advanced as the 28th constitutional amendment.
On Tuesday, the National Assembly session also echoed with calls for empowering LGs as lawmakers voiced their concerns over the deadly Gul Plaza tragedy.
MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar called for the “creation of more administrative units”, and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif also favoured strengthening LGs for better city management.
Memon assails MQM-P for ‘politicising’ Gul Plaza fire
On the other hand, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon lashed out at the MQM-P for “politicising” the Gul Plaza incident.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, he regretted that “certain parties” were attempting to politicise the Gul Plaza fire incident, and asserted that the Sindh government was displaying “great patience”.
“You call yourself the entire city’s party, so you have the full right to criticise, but they start making other sorts of statements in the guise of criticism,” Memon said, indirectly mentioning Kamal’s press conference from a while before.
“Will ending the 18th Amendment and handing over Karachi to the Centre prevent such incidents?” the PPP minister asked.



“We are not evading our responsibility,” he asserted, acknowledging that the protection of the public’s life and property.
He quipped, “This (Gul Plaza fire) was an incident. […] But those who have carried out such incidents in this city with their hands are making such remarks.
“Those parties are talking that have even burned people alive for extortion,” he alleged.
Memon said he was “forced to respond” as “serious allegations” were being made against his party.
“The Baldia factory was set on fire, innocent people were deprived of their lives, and the human hunting game was played on May 12, 2007, […] such statements from your mouth do not suit you.”
The PPP leader then played some old video clips of Kamal, wherein he could be heard making allegations against his current party leader Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and coalition ally PML-N, as well as hurling abuses in public.
Memon said he had responses for each statement made by Kamal, but he would “not fall in that trap”.
The PPP leader questioned why Kamal, being the federal health minister, had not paid a visit to Gul Plaza or asked if his help was needed in any matter.
“When your quaid (Altaf Hussain) used to give a strike call, when your workers used to count a score of 100 and kill people on the roads, and when bodies in sacks were found daily, did you not remember humanity then?”
Responding to a query, Memon said he was unable to “comprehend the objective” of the recent statements made by Kamal and PML-N’s Khawaja Asif.
Speaking on the Gul Plaza incident, Memon affirmed that the Sindh government was working on the “one-point agenda” of returning the remains of the victims to their loved ones.

 

“Neither can there be a price for a valuable life, nor can there be any substitute,” the minister said, reiterating that the government stood with the survivors during this “difficult time”.
Of the 1,200 shops in Gul Plaza that suffered damage, he said: “We will not argue about how many of these were legal and how many were built afterwards. Whoever has suffered damages and however much, the Sindh government has said that it stands with them and considers it its responsibility to get them back on their feet.”
Memon added that the government was also planning on giving interest-free loans to shop owners of Gul Plaza to help them.
According to Memon, Sindh’s Rescue 1122 received 1,094 reports of fire incidents across Karachi in 2025, while 84 such incidents were reported this month so far.
“It will come forward how this incident happened, how rescue efforts were carried out — if there is any shortcoming anywhere, the government will take action against it,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-22 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22124521ab0e6e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968420/us-set-to-quit-world-health-organisation' target='_blank'><strong>US set to quit World Health Organisation</strong></a><br><p>The US is due to officially exit the World Health Organisation on Thursday, in the face of warnings it will hit both US health and global health and also in violation of a US law that requires Washington to pay the UN health agency $260 million in fees that it owes.
President Donald Trump gave notice that the US would quit the organisation on the first day of his presidency in 2025, via an executive order. Under US law, it has to give one-year notice and pay all outstanding fees before departure.
On Thursday, a US State Department spokesperson said the WHO’s failure to contain, manage and share information had cost the US trillions of dollars and the president had exercised his authority to pause the future transfer of any US government funds, support, or resources to the WHO.
“The American people have paid more than enough to this organisation and this economic hit is beyond a down payment on any financial obligations to the organisation,” the spokesperson said by email.
Quick return unlikely
Over the last year, many global health experts have urged a rethink, including most recently WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“I hope the US will reconsider and rejoin WHO”, he told reporters at a press conference earlier this month. “Withdrawing from the WHO is a lose for the United States, and its a lose for the rest of the world.”
The WHO also said that the US has not yet paid the fees it owes for 2024 and 2025. Member states are set to discuss the US departure and how it will be handled at the WHOs executive board in February, a WHO spokesperson told Reuters by email.
“This is a clear violation of US law,” said Lawrence Gostin, founding director of the ONeill Institute for Global Health Law at Georgetown University in Washington, a close observer of the WHO. “But Trump is highly likely to get away with it.”
Speaking to Reuters at Davos, Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation, a major funder of global health initiatives and some of the WHOs work said he did not expect the US to reconsider in the short-term.
“I dont think the US will be coming back to WHO in the near future,” he said, adding that when he had an opportunity to advocate for it, he would. “The world needs the World Health Organisation.”
What the departure means
For the WHO, the departure of the US has sparked a budgetary crisis that has seen it cut its management team in half and scale back work, cutting budgets across the agency.
Washington has traditionally been by far the UN health agency’s biggest financial backer, contributing around 18% of its overall funding.
The WHO will also shed around a quarter of its staff by the middle of this year.
The agency said it has been working with the US and sharing information in the last year.
It was unclear how the collaboration will work going forward.
Global health experts said this posed risks for the US, the WHO and the world.
“The US withdrawal from WHO could weaken the systems and collaborations the world relies on to detect, prevent, and respond to health threats,” said Kelly Henning, public health program lead at Bloomberg Philanthropies, a US-based non-profit.</p><small>2026-01-22 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646558-winter-showers-lash-parts-of-karachi-amid-strong-winds' target='_blank'><strong>Winter showers lash parts of Karachi amid strong winds</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement issued on Thursday by the president’s secretariat, the approval was given in accordance with the recommendations of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
For the Sindh High Court (SHC), the statement said the president had approved the confirmation of all 10 additional judges recommended by the JCP: Justices Miran Muhammad Shah, Tasneem Sultana, Riazat Ali Sahar, Muhammad Hasan, Abdul Hamid Bhurgi, Jan Ali Junejo, Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro, Ali Haider ‘Ada’, Muhammad Osman Ali Hadi and Muhammad Jaffer Raza.
President Zardari also approved a six-month extension in the tenures of Justices Khalid Hussain Shahani and Syed Faizul Hassan Shah of the SHC, the statement added.
For the Lahore High Court (LHC), President Zardari confirmed all 11 additional judges recommended by the JCP as permanent judges, namely Justices Hassan Nawaz Makhdoom, Malik Waqar Haider Awan, Sardar Akbar Ali, Syed Ahsan Raza Kazmi, Malik Javed Iqbal Wains, Muhammad Jawad Zafar, Khalid Ishaq, Malik Muhammad Awais Khalid, Chaudhry Sultan Mahmood, Tanveer Ahmad Sheikh and Abher Gul Khan.
The president further approved a six-month extension in the tenure of Justice Tariq Mahmood Bajwa as an additional LHC judge, according to the statement.
Finally, for the Peshawar High Court (PHC), he approved the confirmation of the following six additional judges: Justices Muhammad Tariq Afridi, Abdul Fayaz, Salahuddin, Sadiq Ali, Syed Mudasser Ameer and Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah.
He also approved a six-month extension in the tenure of Justices Farah Jamshed, Inamullah Khan, Sabitullah Khan and Aurangzeb as PHC’s additional judges.
“The approvals have been made on the advice of the prime minister,” the statement added.
Last week, over multiple days of meetings presided over by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the JCP had recommended making additional judges of multiple high courts permanent. It had approved three of the Islamabad High Court, 10 of the SHC, 11 of the LHC, six of the PHC and one of the Balochistan High Court.
By a majority of its total membership, the JCP had recommended the confirmations after due consideration of the relevant data forms, antecedents and evaluation of material placed before it.
Subsequently, the federal government had notified the appointment of IHC’s Justices Muhammad Azam Khan, Muhammad Asif and Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas as permanent judges, with them taking oath on Monday.</p><small>2026-01-22 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22122529a6e00af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417/bangladesh-launches-campaigns-for-first-post-hasina-elections' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh launches campaigns for first post-Hasina elections</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh began official campaigning on Thursday for the hugely anticipated general elections next month, the first since the 2024 uprising ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters of key frontrunner Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) crowded the streets of the northern city of Sylhet, chanting his name.
“Do we have a leader? Yes, we do,” BNP loyalists shouted, carrying placards of the prime ministerial hopeful Rahman, who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile.
Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami will begin its campaign in the capital Dhaka later in the day.
The South Asian nation of 170 million votes on February 12 to elect 350 lawmakers.
The polls are expected to usher in new leadership after prolonged turmoil following the ouster of Hasina’s government, reshaping domestic politics and regional dynamics.
It comes against the backdrop of insecurity — including the murder last month of a student leader of the anti-Hasina protests — as well as warnings of a “flood” of online disinformation.
European Union election observers say the vote will be the “biggest democratic process of 2026”.
‘Never fulfilled’
Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP following the death of his mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.
“He will carry forward the legacy of his parents,” said Harun Ur Rashid, a 40-year-old die-hard BNP supporter, referring to Zia and her husband, former president Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981.
Bangladesh, home to one of the world’s largest Muslim-majority populations, has a significant Sufi following, and parties have traditionally launched campaigns in Sylhet, home to the centuries-old shrine of Shah Jalal.
Supporters lined the streets on Wednesday night as Rahman prayed at the shrine, cheering as his election bus passed by.
Jamaat-i-Islami, which opposes Sufi mystical interpretations, begins its campaign in the capital Dhaka, in the constituency of its leader Shafiqur Rahman.
Ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-i-Islami is seeking a return to formal politics after years of bans and crackdowns.
Since Hasina fled to India, key Jamaat leaders have been released from prison, and groups have grown increasingly assertive.
The National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising, and who have formed an alliance with Jamaat, will also launch their rally in Dhaka.

 

Engineer Raqibul Hasan Shawon, 26, watched the BNP rally from the sidelines.
“I haven’t decided whom to vote for yet,” he said. “We have heard commitments before, but they were never fulfilled.”
‘New Bangladesh’
Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who returned from exile in August 2024 at the behest of protesters to lead a caretaker government as “chief adviser”, will step down after the polls.
Yunus said he inherited a “completely broken” political system, and championed a reform charter he argues is vital to prevent a return to authoritarian rule, with a referendum on the changes to be held on the same day as polling.
“If you cast the ‘yes’ vote, the door to building the new Bangladesh will open,” Yunus said on January 19, in a broadcast to the nation urging support for the referendum.

 

Earlier this month, he warned he was “concerned about the impact” a surge of disinformation could have.
“They have flooded social media with fake news, rumours and speculation,” Yunus said, blaming both “foreign media and local sources”.
Relations with neighbouring India have soured, after Hasina escaped to her old ally New Delhi as protesters stormed her palace.
Hasina, 78, sentenced to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power, remains in hiding in India.</p><small>2026-01-22 07:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22113838279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968414/pta-wrote-to-x-three-times-seeking-closure-of-imran-khans-x-account-over-the-past-35-years' target='_blank'><strong>PTA wrote to X three times seeking closure of Imran Khan’s X account over the past 3.5 years</strong></a><br><p>Over the past 3.5 years, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has written to X three times seeking closure of an account in PTI founder Imran Khan’s name, but received no response, it emerged on Thursday.
The information came to light in a PTA report, seen by Dawn and submitted to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) today in relation to a petition against the incarcerated former premier regarding “inflammatory posts” made from an X account operated in his name.
The report stated that the first request was sent on August 21, 2022, to X, and the body received no response from the social media platform.
On April 18, 2024, PTA submitted another request for the blocking of Imran’s account via email.
The report said that the email included “citation of relevant court orders against Imran and details of his conviction and sentence to 14, 10, and seven years in Toshakhana, cypher, and unlawful marriage cases”.
However, it added that once again, no response was received from X.
The report added that on November 27, 2025, PTA wrote to the platform seeking the blocking of 47 tweets from Imran’s X account.
However, out of the 47, X only blocked one tweet.
PTA, in its report, also noted that the over-the-top (OTT) services operating in Pakistan were not regulated as they were registered in their country of origin.
It added that the companies “are not necessarily bound by the region/country in which the user is accessing their content”.
It also took note of the fact that “content management, social media operators do provide an official channel to the users as well as the regulators to lodge their complaints”.
The authority said that the “other option remains to block the internet traffic flowing to these operations, however, since they utilise secure channels, selective blocking on their content cannot be enabled.”
“But complete access to their services can be revoked on a best effort basis,” it added.
The authority added that in October 2021, PTA had requested social media companies to comply with Section 7 (6) of the Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and Safeguards) Rules and register themselves with PTA and “appoint a local compliance grievance officer”.
“However, no affirmative response has been received to date,” it added.
On Wednesday, the IHC took up the petition regarding the X account and questioned how proceedings in the case could continue if authorities were denying his counsel access to him.
The former premier’s family and party leaders have recently faced increased restrictions in meeting him.
During yesterday’s proceedings, the court told the PTA counsel that the authority’s response to the petition was “unsatisfactory”.
In September last year, a petition was filed in the IHC challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment.
A written reply submitted to the court by Adiala jail authorities last year denied that the X account was being operated from within the jail premises.
Superintendent of the Adiala jail stated the PTI founder was under strict surveillance and had no access to any prohibited device, “particularly mobile phones”.</p><small>2026-01-22 07:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646529-when-principle-meets-realpolitik-pakistan-and-the-peace-board' target='_blank'><strong>When principle meets realpolitik: Pakistan and the peace board</strong></a><br><p>

The 79-year-old Republican has been clamoring for the United States to acquire Greenland, a large island territory of Denmark, citing what he called security threats from Russia and China in the Arctic Circle.
On Wednesday he announced a “framework” for a future deal on Greenland and the cancellation of planned tariffs on European countries that had opposed his moves to control the island — but not before ruffling Nato allies and straining transatlantic relations.
“I’m helping Nato, and until the last few days, when I told them about Iceland, they loved me,” Trump said during his remarks to the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.
“They’re not there for us on Iceland — that I can tell you. I mean, our stock market took the first dip yesterday because of Iceland. So Iceland’s already cost us a lot of money.”

 


It seemed obvious he was referring to Greenland and not the smaller neighbouring Iceland, an island in the North Atlantic famous for its breathtaking volcanic landscapes.
After the speech, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt pushed back against a post on X by a journalist, Libbey Dean, who wrote that “President Trump appeared to mix up Greenland and Iceland around three times.”
“No he didn’t, Libby. His written remarks referred to Greenland as a ‘piece of ice’ because that’s what it is. You’re the only one mixing anything up here,” Leavitt fired back on X, misspelling the journalist’s name.







During his speech at Davos, Trump, as he often does, frequently strayed from the written script scrolling on the teleprompters.
Asked about the events in Davos, Gavin Newsom, California’s Democratic governor and a leading opposition figure in the United States who is considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028, seized on the moment.
“None of this is normal,” Newsom said. “There’s a normalisation, a deviancy of consciousness.”
Sensitive subject
The issue of mental acuity is a sensitive one for Trump.
During the 2024 presidential campaign, he attacked incumbent Joe Biden, claiming the Democrat suffered from dementia.
In recent days, some Democratic lawmakers have called for invoking the US Constitution’s 25th Amendment, which allows for removing a president who no longer has the physical or intellectual capacity to carry out the duties of office.
The politicians justified their calls by citing a message that Trump had sent to Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.
In the message, made public on Monday, Trump expressed his displeasure with not being awarded last year’s Nobel Peace Prize.
Trump also reiterated his desire for the US to take control of Greenland.
“Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace,” Trump wrote.

The delayed action has triggered backlash from builders, developers and civil society, who say that the building regulator has been sitting on a KMC fire safety audit report for over two years despite being formally notified.
They termed the SBCA’s sudden directives to building owners “too little, too late”, accusing the authority of criminal negligence and questioning how many lives could have been saved if the warnings had been acted upon earlier.

 

“Since the SBCA will not be able to achieve the desired objectives without the cooperation of your members in this matter, you are therefore requested to direct your members to immediately comply with the fire safety deficiencies highlighted in the audit reports within three days, as this is an urgent matter requiring immediate compliance,” said a SBCA letter to the Association of Builders and Developers (ABAD) chairman.

Building regulator accused of ‘sitting on’ a KMC fire audit report for over two years; critics term move ‘too little, too late’

The KMC in January 2024 compiled a report on fire safety in hundreds of buildings across Karachi, following a deadly blaze at RJ Mall on Rashid Minhas Road in 2023.
The report identified at least 265 buildings lacking fire safety systems, emergency exits or a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the fire brigade. It warned that these structures could face disastrous consequences in case of a fire.
However, the SBCA moved to implement the report’s recommendations only after the Gul Plaza tragedy and that too more than two years later.
Muhammad Hassan Bakhshi, the ABAD chairman, — who has been asked by the SBCA to “cooperate” in implementing the fire compliance rules “within three days” — said he was hearing about the report for the “first time”.
He said the SBCA had never approached him earlier in this connection, adding that now it appeared that the authority was “trying to complete years of inaction in a matter of days”.
“These surveys and their implementation will only open another door to corruption,” Mr Bakhshi warned.
He stressed the need to digitise regulatory processes, arguing that reducing human-to-human contact was essential to prevent further corruption.
Saad Abdul Wahab, a fire and structural safety expert and CEO of Grow Safe, criticised the SBCA’s sudden push for fire safety compliance, warning that the move appears to be a temporary correction.
“A proper corrective action requires identifying root causes, assessing hazards, and implementing suitable and sufficient control measures,” he said.
He questioned the seriousness of the regulator and asked which legal framework or safety standard the authority was using as a benchmark for compliance, pointing out that multiple national and international codes exist.
The expert warned that enforcing fire safety installations without ensuring structural integrity could be dangerous.
He said there was no clarity on whether buildings were structurally capable of bearing additional loads from fire-fighting systems.
Meanwhile, a review by Dawn of the fire safety report compiled by the KMC two years ago showed that it included many residential and commercial buildings.
An official from the management of a commercial building on Sharea Faisal told Dawn that the SBCA had never warned them or provided any information regarding fire safety compliance.
“More than two years ago, a team of KMC fire department visited us and conducted a survey. But after that, we were never approached by the SBCA.”

In a statement issued from its regional office in Hong Kong, the agency said the rating actions reflect the application of Fitch’s new Sovereign Rating Criteria, effective September 2025, and the inclusion of recovery assumptions into sovereign debt ratings for the first time.
The recovery rating RR4 denotes ‘average’ recovery expectation from default in a scale of six categories, starting from RR1 for outstanding, RR2 for superior, RR3 for good and RR4 for average. This is followed by RR5 for below average and RR6 for poor.
The senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Pakistan and The Pakistan Global Sukuk Programme Company Ltd are equalised with Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR), reflecting Fitch’s expectation of average recovery prospects in a default scenario, given Pakistan’s high levels of general government debt and interest payments as a percentage of revenue, and the absence of any other clearly identifiable criteria factors that would cause us to notch the debt ratings up or down from the IDR.
On April 15, 2025, Fitch upgraded Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR to ‘B-’ with a stable outlook, from ‘CCC+’. In terms of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) key rating drivers for the Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR and, in turn, the debt ratings, Pakistan has an ESG Relevance Score of ‘5’ for political stability and rights and for the rule of law, institutional and regulatory quality and control of corruption, as is the case for all sovereigns.
These scores reflect the high weight that World Bank Governance Indicators (WBGI) have for sovereign rating model. Pakistan has a WBGI ranking at the 22nd percentile. The bond and sukuk ratings are sensitive to any changes in Pakistan’s Long-Term Foreign-Currency IDR, which could change with sensitivities.
It notes that factors that could individually or collectively lead to a negative rating for downgrade include failure to keep government debt and debt-servicing metrics on a firm downward path, renewed deterioration in external liquidity conditions, for example, from delays in IMF programme reviews or insufficiently tight economic policy settings.
On the other hand, factors that could rating upgrade include significant declines in government debt and debt-servicing burdens, for example due to the implementation of fiscal consolidation plans in line with IMF programme commitments, leading to structural improvements in tax revenue generation and further significant easing of external financing risks, including evidence of greater ability to source external funding and a sustained recovery in foreign-currency reserves beyond Fitch’s forecasts.

An IHC division bench, comprising Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhsas, gave this ruling on Tuesday while dismissing a large number of intra-court appeals and upholding a single bench verdict which had declared that the directions issued by a Special Committee of the National Assembly for the reinstatement and regularisation of sacked employees had no legal effect and were void.
In its detailed judgement, the bench held that while the proceedings of the special committee, to the extent of examining matters and submitting a report to the House, were within the constitutional framework, the directions issued by it to executive authorities relating to reinstatement, regularisation, seniority, pay fixation and the initiation of coercive measures were without lawful authority.
“The recommendations of the Special Committee, insofar as they purported to bind the executive or override statutory provisions and judicial pronouncements, do not enjoy protection under Article 69(1) of the Constitution and were rightly declared void,” the court ruled.

DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had reached a framework for a deal over Greenland following a meeting with Nato chief Mark Rutte, and that he would therefore waive tariffs scheduled to hit European allies.
In a speech on Wednesday at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump for the first time ruled out using force, but demanded “immediate negotiations” to acquire the island from Denmark.
“We have formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic region,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
Meanwhile, the European Parliament decided to suspend its work on a trade deal between the 27-member bloc and the United States, a parliament member said, following President Trump’s repeated threats to take control over Greenland.
The US president did not provide any details on the framework, but added that his threatened tariffs against European countries which were resisting his quest to acquire Greenland was now off the table.
“Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st,” Trump wrote.







In a speech that veered from topic to topic, Trump also expressed hope of ending the Ukraine war soon.
Trump’s quest to take the strategic Arctic island of Greenland from Nato ally Denmark has deeply shaken the global order and markets.
“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said.
“I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force. All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.”
Wall Street stocks opened higher after his speech, and jumped further following his post.
Trump insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and Nato security against Russia and China.
But Trump appeared to take the threat of military action off the table, in a dramatic turnaround from his previous threats that the US could use force to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island.
“We probably won’t get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force where we would be, frankly, unstoppable — but I won’t do that,” Trump said. “I don’t have to use force. I don’t want to use force. I won’t use force.
All the United States is asking for is a place called Greenland.” Wall Street stocks opened higher on Wednesday after Trump’s comments.
Denmark said it was a “positive” sign that Trump had said he wanted to avoid military force — but stressed that the US president had not backed away from his push to acquire Greenland.
“What is quite clear after this speech is that the president’s ambition remains intact,” Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said.
Greenland’s government meanwhile unveiled a new brochure on Wednesday offering advice to the population in the event of a “crisis” in the territory, saying it was an “insurance policy”.
‘Immediate negotiations’
Trump repeatedly pushed his claims to Greenland — which he mistakenly called Iceland several times — during lengthy remarks on the deepest crisis in transatlantic relations for decades.
He said he was “seeking immediate negotiations to once again discuss the acquisition of Greenland by the United States” and added that Washington would “remember” if Denmark said no. Trump says Greenland is under threat from Russia and China.







The US president also lambasted Europe on a number of fronts from security to tariffs and the economy, saying it was “not heading in the right direction”.
Trump flew into Davos by helicopter, stepping onto a red carpet laid in the snow — but he flew into a growing international storm over Greenland.
He arrived some two hours behind schedule, after an electrical issue earlier forced Air Force One to turn back to Washington and the president to switch planes.
Europe and Canada had earlier closed ranks against what they view as a threat to the US-led global order from Trump’s territorial ambitions.
French President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile said Europe would not be bullied. But Trump, who was due to meet a number of leaders in Davos, renewed his attacks on the two leaders, mocking Macron in particular for wearing sunglasses at Davos, which the French president said was because of an eye condition.
‘Thoughtful diplomacy’
Trump also repeatedly expressed doubts on Nato during his speech, saying Washington was treated “so unfairly” and questioning whether the alliance would defend the United States if asked.
Nato chief Mark Rutte, whom Trump was due to meet in Davos, said that “thoughtful diplomacy” was needed to resolve the crisis. The Greenland row has also soured relations with the European Union, which has threatened countermeasures after Trump vowed tariffs of up to 25pc on eight European countries for backing Denmark.
UN chief warns
UN chief Antonio Guterres warned on Wednesday of world leaders upending international order in a statement made as President Donald Trump said the United States needs to acquire Greenland in a hardline speech at Davos.
“When leaders run roughshod over international law, picking & choosing which rules to follow — they are undermining global order & setting a perilous precedent,” Guterres said on X.
“When a handful of individuals can bend global narratives, sway elections, or dictate the terms of public debate, we are facing inequality and the corruption of institutions.”

The record-high rate has added to the burden on gold jewellery buyers during the ongoing peak wedding season, while investors appear upbeat over the sharp rally triggered by geopolitical tensions, ongoing tariff wars and US President Donald Trump’s efforts to control Greenland.
According to rates issued by the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), based on interbank exchange rates, the domestic 10-gram gold rate rose to Rs434,123, up by Rs10,888 from Tuesday.
On Jan 1, the 10-gram and one-tola gold rates stood at Rs234,568 and Rs273,600, respectively, based on the global gold rate of $2,624 per ounce. To date, prices of 10-gram and one-tola gold have surged by Rs199,555 and Rs232,762, respectively, while the international price has climbed by $2,216 per ounce.
Gold currently leads in terms of returns among select asset classes, with stocks in second place.
It has been observed that local gold prices have shown wide disparities in the past between the official rates announced by the association and open market rates prevailing at jewellery shops. However, on Wednesday, jewellers were offering gold at Rs503,000-505,500 per tola, lower than the association’s rate of Rs506,362.
“The price difference between the association and market rates depends on demand and supply,” APSGJA President Qasim Shikarpuri said, adding that investors were currently driving the gold market rather than jewellery buyers.
“Investors all over the world and in Pakistan are selling dollars to buy gold,” he said, adding that central banks in various countries were also making large purchases of the yellow metal.
He said there was no shortage of gold in the market despite heavy investor interest, claiming that the per-tola gold rate in Pakistan was selling under cost by Rs25,000 compared to rates in Dubai.
Silver
In contrast, investors are also active in purchasing silver, which is currently in short supply due to high demand and is available at a hefty premium.
The one-tola silver (24 karat) rate rose to Rs9,933, up by Rs64 per ounce, while the 10-gram rate climbed to Rs8,515, up by Rs54 per ounce, in line with a slight increase in the world silver price to $94.58 per ounce, up by $0.64.
“Silver is available at Rs14,500 instead of Rs9,933 per tola due to huge demand coupled with its shortage in the market, not only in Pakistan but also in Dubai,” Mr Shikarpuri said, adding that speculation was underway in the silver market.
Meanwhile, All Karachi Jewellers and Manufacturers Association President Mohammad Haseen Qureishi recalled that silver was not available at Rs15,000 per tola on Tuesday, while on Wednesday its price was hovering between Rs13,500 and Rs14,000, depending on availability.

ISLAMABAD: The National Asse­mbly on Wednesday passed a bill seeking secrecy of lawmakers’ assets, a move that had been opposed by the PML-N and PTI in August last year. Interestingly, the bill, moved by PPP’s Shazia Marri, had faced opposition from both parties during a committee meeting in August, but this time the PTI was the only party to oppose it.
The bill was taken up for immediate consideration soon after National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs Chairman Rana Iradat Sharif Khan presented the committee’s report.
Under Section 137 of the Elections Act, all members of parliament and provincial assemblies are required to submit to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), on or before Dec 31 each year, a statement of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouses and dependent children. Section 138 of the Act requires the ECP to publish these declarations in the official gazette.
The proposed amendment to Section 138 seeks to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the Speaker of the concerned Assembly or, as the case may be, the chairman of the Senate may, on an application made by a member and for reasons to be recorded in writing, by a ruling delivered in the chamber, determine that the statement of assets and liabilities of that member shall not be published publicly by the Commission if such publication would pose a serious threat to the life or safety of the member or, as the case may be, his family, for a period not exceeding one year at a time and subject to the condition that a complete and true statement of assets and liabilities shall be submitted confidentially to the Election Commission.”
According to the statement of objects and reasons, the amendment aims to strike a balance between transparency and protection of individual rights. It states that while the publication of asset declarations promotes accountability, public trust and good governance, unrestricted disclosure could compromise the personal security and privacy of parliamentarians and their families.
Speaking in the House, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar explained that although members would still be required to submit their financial statements to the ECP, these may not necessarily be made public. He said the bill empowered legislative bodies to exercise greater control over the transparency of financial disclosures.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan of the PTI strongly opposed the amendment, arguing that the proposed cha­n­ges would transfer election-related matters from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to a constitutional court, thereby undermining the judiciary’s authority in electoral issues.
The House also passed the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) bill, making it mandatory for large companies with significant profits to spend one per cent of their profits on CSR activities. The statement of objects and reasons of the bill, moved by Dr Nafisa Shah and introduced through a supplementary agenda, stated that the corporate sector must contribute to the social and economic wellbeing of the poor and needy and help create a better environment for all.
‘Imran in good health’
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry told the House that all facilities were being provided to PTI founder Imran Khan in accordance with the jail manual and that he was in good health. He said meetings were allowed as per the rules and shared statistics showing that 850 people, including family members and doctors, had met the former prime minister.
Responding to points raised by PTI lawmaker Shahid Khatak regarding an alleged ban on meetings and claims of solitary confinement, the minister said that such a large number of meetings had not been allowed for prisoners in the past three decades. He also criticised PTI leaders for repeatedly questioning whether Imran Khan was alive.
Tallal Chaudhry further said the government would proceed with a military operation in certain parts of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, including erstwhile Fata. He said implementation of the National Action Plan was ongoing in consultation with provincial governments and insisted that the KP government was fully on board.
“There will be no sympathy for terrorists, and action will be taken at all costs,” he said while blaming the PTI-led provincial government for unrest in KP due to its failure to establish the Counter Terrorism Dep­artment despite ongoing militant activity.
18th Amendment controversy
Another highlight of the proceedings was renewed controversy over the 18th Amendment after comments by ministers sparked a heated debate on provincial autonomy. The issue res­urfaced after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s remarks and was further fuelled when Minister for Food Security Rana Tanvir Hussain questioned whether “everything was fine after the 18th Amendment”, referring to a recent fire incident in Karachi.
PPP MNA Naveed Qamar reacted sharply, saying Khawaja Asif’s comments should be seen as a government policy statement. He warned that any attempt to transfer municipal services to the Centre would undermine the federal structure. He criticised the defence minister for calling the 18th Amendment a “charade” and accused the government of weakening provincial autonomy.
He urged the government to focus on constitutional issues and public welfare instead of destabilising political moves.
PPP lawmaker Sehar Kamran asked Khawaja Asif to explain how the 18th Amendment was a drama, remarking that issuing an ordinance without the president’s consent and signature was the real “drama”. Senator Aliya Kamran of the JUI-F also termed criticism of the amendment inappropriate, recalling that it had been passed with the consent of the PML-N.
MQM’s Hafeezuddin said there was no harm in discussing the 18th Amendment.
Law Minister Tarar clarified that such remarks should be vie­wed as personal opinions rather than official government policy.
Earlier, during question hour, the House was informed that unauthorised possession of railway land by government departments was being regularised through leases under the railway land policy. Parliamentary Secr­etary for Railways Usman Awaisi said an anti-encroachment drive had been launched to retrieve valuable land, adding that 781.84 acres of Pakistan Railways land had been recovered between July 2024 and June 2025.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitu­tio­nal Court (FCC) on Wednesday reserved its ruling on the federal government’s challenge to a set of directions issued by the Lahore High Court (LHC) concerning the prohibition on imports from India.
Headed by Justice Aamer Farooq, a three-judge FCC bench, also comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi and Justice Rozi Khan Barrech, took up an appeal filed by the commerce ministry against the Jan 26, 2024 LHC judgement.
The petition was earlier filed before the Supreme Court but after the passage of the 27th Amendment, the case was transferred to the FCC for hearing.
Issued by the federal government under its constitutional and statutory authority, the import ban was imposed through statutory regulatory orders (SROs) Nos 927 and 928(I)/2019, reflecting considerations of foreign policy, national security and sovereign discretion.
Through these SROs, imports from and exports to India were banned for all kinds of goods, including books and journals.
The controversy arose when the SROs were challenged before the LHC with the contention that these regulatory orders, to the extent of banning the import of books from India, were ultra vires the Constitution.
Validity of SROs upheld
Although the LHC upheld the va­­lidity of the SROs by declaring them intra vires the Constitution and the relevant statutory framework, it nonetheless issued certain directions to the federal government.
The LHC directed the federal government to appoint an officer to consider a review or revision of the policy. It also ordered the federal government to ensure that it considered and decided the officer’s recommendations.
One of the directions suggested that the officer should be appointed within the next two months by the commerce ministry and that the appointment should be posted on its website. The petitioners, if so advised, were to file their reviews thereafter.
These directions, despite affirming the legality of the policy, were challenged before the FCC as being beyond the permissible scope of judicial review.
In its petition, the federal government pleaded before the FCC that it was competent to ban one or all go­­ods, or a class of goods, from any one country or from worldwide sources.
It also argued that India was neither an authority in any field of knowledge nor enjoyed a monopoly over wisdom.
It added that as such, banning imports from India, including books or journals, did not infringe any fundamental rights of the respondents.
The petition also stated that the suspension of trade with India was taken in the context of Pakistan’s national interest and its longstanding stance on Kashmir.
‘Judicial overreach’
Appearing on behalf of the revenue division secretary, Advocate Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar argued that the Jan 26, 2024 LHC judgement was legally unsustainable to the extent that it issued directions after upholding the validity of the SROs.
He contended that once the policy decision embodied in the SROs had been affirmed, any further directions amounted to judicial overreach and encroachment upon the executive domain.
The counsel argued that matters relating to trade restrictions, import prohibitions and regulation of commerce with hostile or adversarial foreign states fell squarely within the exclusive domain of the executive under the constitutional scheme.
He emphasised that issues touching upon foreign policy and external relations were traditionally regarded as non-justiciable, and that courts were required to exercise judicial restraint unless a clear violation of the Constitution or fundamental rights was established.
The counsel further contended that constitutional courts were mandated to adjudicate legality and constitutionality, not to issue directions requiring the federal government to revisit, reconsider or reformulate policy decisions.
Such directions, he argued, violated the doctrine of separation of powers enshrined in the Constitution and blurred the constitutionally demarcated boundaries between the judiciary and the executive.
Additionally, Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Aamir Rehman, appearing on behalf of the federation, submitted that the impugned judgement was not legally sustainable. He stated that the LHC had gone beyond its jurisdiction by interfering in policy matters, which courts were constitutionally barred from doing so.
He added that allowing such directions would amount to judicial encroachment into the executive domain, rendering the judgement legally unsustainable.
After hearing arguments from both sides, the FCC reserved its judgement.

According to the Pak­istan Meteorological Dep­a­r­tment (PMD), rain and heavy snowfall will affect all provinces as well as the northern regions during the forecast period, as the National Disaster Manage­ment Authority asked citizens to take precautions.
Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Ko­h­­i­s­tan, Mansehra, Abb­ottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Gal­iyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli, and Rawalakot will experience heavy rain and snowfall.

In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Qatar welcomed the invitation “extended to their leaders” by Trump.
“The ministers announce their countries’ shared decision to join the Board of Peace. Each country will sign the joining documents according to its respective relevant legal and other necessary procedures, including Egypt, Pakistan, and the UAE, that have already announced to join,” the joint statement said.
It should be noted that all eight countries had worked with Trump in October last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza. The UAE had announced its decision to join the board on Tuesday while Pakistan and Egypt had separately announced it on Wednesday.







“The ministers reiterate their countries’ support for the peace efforts led by President Trump, and reaffirm their countries’ commitment to supporting the implementation of the mission of the Board of Peace as a transitional administration, as set out in the Comprehensive Plan to end the Gaza Conflict and endorsed by United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803, aimed at consolidating a permanent ceasefire, supporting the reconstruction of Gaza, and advancing a just and lasting peace grounded in the Palestinian right to self-determination and statehood in accordance with international law, thereby paving the way for security and stability for all countries and peoples of the region,” the statement said.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working with regional partners for peace in Gaza.
“Pakistan has been and will continue to work with our brotherly Arab- Islamic countries for lasting peace in Gaza and for ensuring the right to self-determination of our Palestinian brothers and sisters,” he said on X.







The development came hours after a separate announcement by the Foreign Office (FO) said Pakistan had accepted US President Donald Trump’s invitation to join the so-called “Board of Peace” with the view to “achieving lasting peace in Gaza”. The invitation for Pakistan to join the Board of Peace was extended last week.
“In response to the invitation extended to Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif by President of the United States Donald J. Trump, Pakistan would like to announce its decision to join the Board of Peace as part of its ongoing efforts to support the implementation of the Gaza peace plan under the framework of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803,” the FO said in a statement.







The statement added that Pakistan was hopeful that with the creation of this framework, “concrete steps will be taken towards the implementation of a permanent ceasefire, further scaling up of humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, as well as reconstruction of Gaza”.
“Pakistan also hopes that these efforts will lead to the realisation of the right to self-determination of the people of Palestine, through a credible, time-bound political process, consistent with international legitimacy and relevant UN resolutions, resulting in the establishment of an independent, sovereign, and contiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital,” the statement read.
The FO concluded the statement, saying: “Pakistan looks forward to continuing to play a constructive role as part of the Board of Peace for the achievement of these goals as well as to end the suffering of our Palestinian brothers and sisters.”
Trump had originally proposed establishing the board when he announced his plan last September to end the conflict in Gaza. But an invitation sent to world leaders last week outlined a broad role for the body in ending conflicts globally.
A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the US administration calls for members to contribute $1 billion in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.
The inclusion of a ‘charter’ in the invitation letter triggered concerns among some European governments that it could undermine the work of the United Nations, which Trump has accused of not supporting his efforts to end conflicts around the world.
Meanwhile, Financial Times has reported that the Trump administration plans to expand its Board of Peace into a permanent global entity to rival the UN.

 

According to the charter sent to prospective members, the board is designed to be a “more nimble and effective international peace-building body” chaired by Donald Trump himself.
The board would start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts, according to the charter’s copy seen by Reuters.
The draft charter grants broad executive authority to Trump and allows him to serve as chairman indefinitely, subject only to voluntary resignation or removal due to incapacity confirmed by a unanimous board vote.
The document gives the chairman the authority to appoint and remove member states — decisions that would require a two-thirds majority vote to overturn. According to the text, Trump would hold effective veto power over board decisions. The charter states rulings will be “made by a majority of the member states present and voting, subject to the approval of the chairman”.
It also grants him the “exclusive authority to create, modify, or dissolve subsidiary entities” to fulfill the board’s mission.
The charter critiques current international structures and advocates for pragmatic judgement, common sense, and courage to abandon often ineffective methods and institutions for lasting peace.
Only a few, including Hungary, Israel and the United Arab Emirates have so far accepted the invitation to join the board without reservations.
