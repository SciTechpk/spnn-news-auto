A press release by the Finance Division said that the finance minister had a “busy first day” of his official visit to the United States, attending high-level meetings on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank (WB) in Washington, DC.
“The finance minister and his delegation had a key meeting with Azour. Both sides exchanged views on Pakistan’s reform agenda and reaffirmed their shared commitment to sustaining the current momentum of reforms,” the press release said.
 






It added that the meeting also reviewed progress under the
second review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and acknowledged the “importance of maintaining macroeconomic discipline”.
In a separate meeting, Aurangzeb had “extensive engagement” with the WB Senior Managing Director Axel van Trotsenburg, where he appreciated the Bank’s continued commitment to Pakistan’s national development agenda.
“The minister reiterated that the climate crisis remains an existential challenge for Pakistan, referencing the devastation caused by recent floods and their severe impact on the agriculture sector and GDP growth,” the statement said.
“He emphasised the need for enhanced investment in climate adaptation and mitigation measures and agreed on the importance of mobilising additional resources to manage future natural calamities,” it said.
 






The minister is visiting the US capital for the IMF and WB plenary meetings from October 13 to 18. The meetings bring together global finance ministers, central bankers and development leaders, offering Pakistan a crucial platform to secure the next IMF tranche, advance economic reforms, and engage international partners on growth, investment, and resilience.
Aurangzeb’s visit comes after a IMF mission concluded talks with Pakistani authorities on reviews of two lending programmes totalling $8.4 billion without announcing a staff-level agreement (SLA).
Before leaving for the US, the finance minister had expressed optimism that the SLA with the IMF would be finalised during his visit to Washington.
More meetings in Washington
According to the press release issued by the Finance Division, Aurangzeb also attended the Commonwealth Finance Ministers’ Meeting and underscored the importance of “prioritising concrete actions to advance a resilient and prosperous Commonwealth”.
He voiced support for the operationalisation of the Commonwealth Infrastructure and Financial Resilience Hub, as well as the Technical Assistance Fund for peer review and capacity building.
He reiterated the central importance of climate financing for developing countries like Pakistan and emphasised the urgent need to operationalise mechanisms such as the Loss and Damage Fund, the statement said.
Aurangzeb was also hosted by the leadership and members of the US-Pakistan Business Council (USPBC). He briefed participants on the positive trajectory of Pakistan’s macroeconomic indicators, calling private sector growth “vital to sustaining economic momentum”.
According to the press release, he reaffirmed the government’s commitment to addressing business challenges and providing maximum relief, highlighting the recent trade deal with the US authorities and “expressing optimism for enhanced government-to-government and business-to-business engagements in key sectors, including mining, agriculture, information technology, and pharmaceuticals”.
The statement added that earlier, Aurangzeb also met with Robert Kaproth, US assistant treasury secretary for international finance, and Counselor Jonathan Greenstein. During the discussion, he highlighted the “strong economic fundamentals” of Pakistan, underpinned by the ongoing IMF programme.
He welcomed the successful conclusion of negotiations with the US administration leading to a tariff deal and apprised the officials about Pakistan’s recent legislation to regulate virtual assets. He further invited US companies to explore investment opportunities in Pakistan’s oil and gas, mineral, agriculture, and information technology sectors, the release said.
The finance minister also met with Riccardo Puliti, Regional Vice President of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) for the Middle East, Central Asia, Türkiye, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; as well as the Islamic Development Bank’s (IsDB) President Muhammad Sulaiman Al-Jasser.
Aurangzeb also met with representatives of Citi Bank, where he “acknowledged Citi’s longstanding partnership with Pakistan and appreciated its continued engagement”.
“The minister shared an overview of Pakistan’s stabilising macroeconomic outlook, driven by ongoing structural reforms and validated by international credit rating agencies. He also highlighted Pakistan’s growing role as a regional hub for digital innovation and financial services, assuring that the government would give due consideration to Citi’s proposals,” the statement said.
The statement added that the minister also interacted with US and international media, including interviews with the Associated Press and Reuters, and attended a dinner in the honour of the Pakistan delegation by Pakistan’s US ambassador, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.
“The finance minister’s engagements in Washington, DC reflect the government’s resolve to deepen economic cooperation, strengthen partnerships with international financial institutions, and accelerate Pakistan’s transition from stabilisation to sustainable, inclusive growth,” the statement said.
“The visit aims to further strengthen Pakistan’s engagement with key international financial institutions, development partners, and private sector stakeholders,” it added.</p><small>2025-10-14 06:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/141052341898de6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948843/make-the-country-better-nepals-gen-z-rush-to-register-to-vote-after-uprising' target='_blank'><strong>‘Make the country better’: Nepal’s Gen Z rush to register to vote after uprising</strong></a><br><p>In Nepal’s capital, young would-be voters line up enthusiastically to register for the first elections since deadly anti-corruption protests toppled the government, the worst unrest in decades.
For many, it will be their first time participating in an election, and they see it as a chance to shape the future of their country of 30 million people, burdened by deep economic woes.
At least 73 people were killed in the September 8-9 protests that left parliament, courts and government buildings in flames.
The unrest was triggered by a brief ban on social media but was fuelled by long-standing frustration over economic hardship and corruption.
 
 

Within days of the government’s collapse, 73-year-old former chief justice Sushila Karki was appointed interim prime minister to steer the Himalayan nation until elections on March 5, 2026.
“The pillar of this new government is built on the dead bodies of students,” said student Niranjan Bhandari, 21, as he waited to provide biometric data to complete his registration.
“That’s why, in the upcoming election, we want to uproot the old faces who have been clinging to power for too long,” he added.
“I’m here to register for my new voter identity card for that very reason.”
‘Growth to decline’
Nepal’s political future hangs in the balance.
The challenges ahead to ensure elections pass off smoothly are huge — including deep public distrust in Nepal’s established parties.
It remains unclear whether protesters and youth will try to form their own party, or if old politicians will seek to return.
The government has imposed a travel ban on KP Sharma Oli, the 73-year-old Marxist who served as prime minister four times before he was forced from power, as a commission investigates the unrest.
 
 

But Oli remains outspoken, calling for the reinstatement of the parliament “that was unconstitutionally dissolved”, in an address to supporters earlier this month.
The unrest also battered Nepal’s already fragile economy, where the World Bank estimates a “staggering” 82 per cent of the workforce is in informal employment, with GDP per capita at just $1,447 in 2024.
The bank this month updated its economic assessment for Nepal, warning that “recent unrest and heightened political and economic uncertainty are expected to cause growth to decline” to 2.1pc.
But at a district Election Commission office in Kathmandu, the excitement among the younger generation is clear.
“I’m really excited,” 20-year-old student Sambriddhi Gautam told AFP. “This will be my first time participating in an election.”
Gautam, who is studying to be a chartered accountant in neighbouring India, said she had returned to register to make sure she can take part.

‘Good of the nation’
Samiksha Adhikari, aged 32, a business consultant, waited to apply for her voter identity card.
“We need to bring in new faces who can stop corruption and make the country better,” she said.
“That’s why I’m here. I want to cast my vote for those who truly work for the good of the nation.”
In Nepal’s last general elections in 2022, nearly 18m people were registered to vote.
All Nepalis aged 18 and above are eligible to vote, with the deadline to register ending in November.
 
 

Sirjana Rayamajhi, 38, spokesperson at the district election office in Kathmandu, said she had not seen such enthusiasm before.
In her office, an average of nearly 400 people had been registering every day — four times higher than in past elections. “The turnout is very high,” she said.
“Gen Z have come here to register their names with a lot of excitement. They want a new generation to bring change to the country. These days, the queue is only them.“</p><small>2025-10-14 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628501-phc-orders-aag-to-confirm-governors-availability-for-oath-taking-of-kp-cm-elect' target='_blank'><strong>PHC orders AAG to confirm governor's availability for oath-taking of KP CM-elect</strong></a><br><p>

At a summit hosted at the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh and attended by more than two dozen world leaders, Trump and the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye signed the declaration as guarantors to the ceasefire deal. The deal came days after the world marked the two-year anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in the Palestinian enclave which has claimed more than 67,000 lives.
At the opening of the summit, Trump signed a document with Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye’s leaders welcoming the agreements on Gaza and pledging to “work collectively to implement and sustain this legacy”.
Here are five noteworthy moments from the press conference held after the signing of the peace declaration.
Display of Pak-US camaraderie and the ‘favourite’
In his remarks, the US president especially mentioned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
Thanking several world leaders, Trump also did the same for Pakistan, saying: “Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan, and also I have to say my favourite Field Marshal from Pakistan, who is not here, but the prime minister is here and you are gonna give him his regards.
“Where are you?” he asked as he turned around to look at the world leaders gathered in the back. Noticing PM Shehbaz in the back, Trump then called him forward and asked him to say a few words.
Trump, Egypt President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and PM Shehbaz were the only three leaders who spoke at the presser. For his part, the premier took the opportunity to again nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

“I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East,” he said as the US president loomed over his shoulder.
Retaking the podium, Trump quipped: “Wow! I didn’t expect that. Let’s go home, there’s nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered, thank you very much.”
Later, the US president also talked about India, saying it was a “great country with a very good friend of mine at the top”.
“He’s just done a fantastic job and I think Pakistan and India are going to live very nicely together. Right?” he asked, turning around to look at PM Shehbaz, who then proceeded to laugh with the US president.
‘Beautiful’ Italian PM Meloni
The Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal he helped broker had put Trump in a notably good mood, as he joked with presidents and prime ministers in his usual close-to-the-bone style.
“They have very little crime,” he said admiringly as he met co-host President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt, whose country is regularly criticised for its rights record.
“A lot of cash. Unlimited cash,” Trump said with a smile as he met United Arab Emirates Vice President and Manchester City football club owner Sheikh Mansour.
“Tough cookie,” he added of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has cracked down on critics.
 






But during the the press conference, he was even more forthright.
“She’s beautiful,“ he said about Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The three-times-married 79-year-old admitted that he risked being accused of sexism with the comments about hard-right leader Meloni, who was standing behind him on the podium during the press conference.
“I’m not allowed to say it because usually it’s the end of your political career if you say it — she’s a beautiful young woman,” Trump said in the middle of a speech about his peace efforts for the Middle East.
“If you use the word ‘beautiful’ in the United States about a woman, that’s the end of your political career, but I’ll take my chances.”
Turning round to address the 48-year-old, Trump said: “You don’t mind being called beautiful, right? Because you are.”
 






Meloni’s immediate reaction could not be seen, as Trump’s back was between her and the cameras. Trump went on to call Meloni, an ideological ally when it comes to immigration and cultural issues, “incredible”.
“And they really respect her in Italy. She’s a very successful politician,” he added. Meloni was the only woman among around 30 leaders gathered on the stage behind Trump for the summit.
Apparent awkwardness with UK’s Starmer
Running down a list of countries he wanted to thank during the press conference, Trump also talked about the United Kingdom.
“United Kingdom. Where’s the United Kingdom?” he asked, turning around to look at the leaders gathered behind him. Britain Prime Minister Keir Starmer then raised his hand, to which Trump told him to “come here”.
“Is everything going good?” Trump asked Starmer, who had stepped forward to shake his hand. But the US president did not ask Starmer to speak, like he had asked PM Shehbaz, and turned back to the podium to continue his remarks while Starmer shuffled back into line.
 






Israel PM Netanyahu’s absence
The summit itself was attended by more than two dozen world leaders, including Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and representatives of Hamas were absent.
But there appears to be some controversy surrounding the absence of Israel’s leader. Netanyahu’s office had stated he would not attend the summit after Cairo had earlier announced he would take part, a prospect that could have been awkward for some confirmed guests.
In a statement, Netanyahu’s office said he had been invited by Trump to participate but declined “due to the timing’s proximity to the beginning of (a Jewish) holiday”.
“The prime minister thanked President Trump for his invitation and for his efforts to expand the circle of peace peace through strength,” the statement said.
A Turkish official told Reuters that Turkiye President Tayyip Erdogan, with the support of some other unspecified leaders, pushed back diplomatically against the idea of Netanyahu attending. Netanyahu’s office did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the issue.
FIFA’s presence
Meanwhile, in a strange turn of events, it emerged that FIFA President Gianni Infantino was also a part of the summit in Egypt and was standing alongside world leaders during the press conference held after the signing of the document.
 






Trump also mentioned Infantino in his remarks. While thanking Norway and looking for its leader behind him, Trump spotted Infantino standing at the far end and said: “Well we have Gianni. We’re going to the World Cup, I can tell you that.”
Inside FIFA, the official site of the international governing body, reported that Infantino stressed the significance of the day in remarks after the document was signed.
“Well, when you speak about a historic day, this definitely was and is a historic day,” Infantino was quoted as saying.
“A historic day for the Middle East, a historic day for the world, a historic day for peace. A new beginning, as President Trump said, a new dawn for the whole region, for the entire world. It’s something that is really important for FIFA to be here to support, to help, to assist, to put ourselves at disposal for whatever we can do to make sure that this peace process comes to fruition and to the best possible end,“ he said.

The slow-cooked but warm reception accorded to the Afghan foreign minister in New Delhi — which officially still doesn’t recognise the Taliban government — and the ensuing unsubtle statements from both sides set off an angry reaction from Islamabad. It was followed by military action on the Afghan border that’s said to have been linked to the events in Delhi.
The pact, however, also coincided with an auspicious event for the Hindu right, the celebration of the hundredth year of the Hindu revivalist RSS in 2025. Marxists used a phrase that has since gone out of fashion, for the meeting of minds like that of the Taliban and the RSS. They called it unity in obscurantism.
In hindsight, there’s nothing terribly remarkable about this rapport. Possibly the warmest ties India ever had with Pakistan flourished when Gen Ziaul Haq was leading his country into a dark abyss masked in controversial laws and ordinances. And the man to sanctify Zia’s murder of democracy in Pakistan was an RSS veteran dressed as India’s foreign minister.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, visiting Pakistan in 1978 after evicting Indira Gandhi from power over her brief suspension of democracy, lauded Zia’s ties with the Janata Party government, in which the RSS for the first time was a key player. Vajpayee studiously avoided petitioning Zia during the visit to spare Z.A. Bhutto’s life that world leaders were doing and Indira Gandhi had pleaded for despite her being out of power after a resounding defeat in the 1977 elections. In the event, Vajpayee’s prime minister in the 26-month long government, Morarji Desai, was honoured by the military dictator with Pakistan’s highest civilian award. No Indian government has equalled the bonhomie.
In another time zone, in his decade-old cultivation of leaders abroad, one such encounter was missed for its irony: Prime Minister Modi’s happy mingling with leaders of Uzbekistan. As it turned out, Uzbekistan is where historical characters like Zaheeruddin Babar and Taimur are celebrated as national heroes, even as they are reviled as villains by Hindu nationalists in India. In India, the preferred invective RSS followers carry for Indian Muslims is to call them ‘Babar ki aulaad’, progeny of the first Mughal emperor. (There, too, the RSS and Pakhtun leaders readily make common cause given their collective animus towards the Mughal rulers, particularly Babar.)

Much has been said about women journalists not being invited to the Afghan press conference by the Taliban foreign minister.

Yet, the leaders in Tashkent, on their part, could scarcely be distracted by the sectarian events the memory of one of their heroes had spawned in India. In a similarly contrarian context, the RSS, rightly or wrongly, accuses Indian Muslims of greater loyalty to Makkah and Madinah than to their own country. However, the crown princes, emirs and sheikhs from that part of the Arab world never seem to tire of visiting India or receiving Modi in their bear hugs. Another facet of ‘unity in obscurantism’ needs to be seen from a historical lens. It was not a coincidence that India’s Hindu and Muslim revivalist groups were both in jail during Indira Gandhi’s 1975-77 emergency.
Their bonhomie continued outside the prisons, across the borders. When Modi stopped over for an unannounced eyebrows-raising visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore, he was interestingly returning from Kabul. However, when another fellow RSS leader went soft on Pakistan, appreciating the liberalism and secularism he saw in Jinnah, and when L.K. Advani scribed a kindly message at the Quaid’s mausoleum in Karachi, all hell broke loose at the RSS headquarters. Advani was denounced and denied his bid to become prime minister. For the RSS, it was the case of Zia good, Jinnah bad.
Much has been said about women journalists not being invited to the Afghan press conference by Amir Khan Muttaqi, the Taliban foreign minister. Muttaqi changed the stance quickly, and there were reportedly more women than male journalists in his next press conference. What was overlooked in the bargain was a more curious fact, that the current prime minister of the world’s most populous democracy had neither invited a woman nor a man or any other to a press conference he hasn’t ever held. This is not to make light of the barbaric treatment the Taliban regime reserves for its women, however.
Kabul used to be a fashion hub in South Asia, materially and spiritually in harmony with itself. When middle-class women in northern India or Pakistan were struggling with dress codes, and movie heroines danced around trees to song sequences draped in dupattas, women in Kabul were going to the university dressed in smart skirts they often brought from the latest collections of Parisian stylists. India’s classical music wizard Vilayat Khan would play the sitar at the court of King Zahir Shah. Likewise, Afghanistan’s Mohammed Sarhang was feted in India as a masterly singer of Persian poetry and Indian ragas.
Be that as it may, the treatment of women in India by religious puritans is not something the Taliban would frown on. The madressahs of Deoband that inspire the Taliban worldview could exchange notes with Hindutva groups come Valentine’s Day or some such. Their shared disapproval of women carrying cellphones, wearing jeans or mixing with men to celebrate an event targeted them equally.
Consider how Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, regarded as the most consequential head of the RSS, believed women were misled by modernity. The Caravan magazine carried an in-depth report on the RSS to assess Modi’s three years in power in 2017. Citing a couplet that states that “a virtuous lady covers her body”, Golwalkar, according to Caravan, lamented that “‘modern’ women think that ‘modernism’ lies in exposing their body more and more to the public gaze. What a fall!” Take your pick.

Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2025</p><small>2025-10-14 04:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68edb362576eb.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948786/rough-ride-ahead' target='_blank'><strong>Rough ride ahead?</strong></a><br><p>THE political crisis in KP doesn’t seem to be headed for a quick resolution. And perhaps, Imran Khan is aware of this as is the ‘other side’. The decision to change the chief minister did not come out of the blue. It had been evident for some time that the PTI and Khan were growing disillusioned with Ali Amin Gandapur. And the reasons were many — his ‘failure’ to get any concessions for Khan; allegations of corruption and misgovernance; and unhappiness of the party (leadership as well as workers) with him. The rumours about what he was getting wrong kept growing.
 
 

That Khan was aware of this was obvious. More than once he had sent messages for Gandapur to visit him, to discuss governance matters, such as the budget or increasing terrorism within the province. But for some time now, the chief minister had been a no-show at Adiala. He wasn’t getting the permission was the reply from Peshawar.
But it seems that matters came to a head at the recent jalsa in Peshawar. It was a lacklustre affair by some accounts, lending credence to reports of the growing unpopularity of the party in the province and the disillusionment of the workers with the provincial government. Social media footage of participants expressing their anger when Gandapur took to the stage was widely shared. The incident rattled Gandapur who hot-footed it to Adiala, where the doors opened smoothly for him. That he left as abruptly as he had turned up confirmed the rumours that his visit had not gone well. Gandapur left it to Barrister Saif to tell the press how he was still Khan’s blue-eyed boy, though his blistering attack on Aleema Khan later told a different story.
 


When the announcement came from Adiala about the change of guard, however, the focus was on the growing militancy and the chief minister’s inability to separate his government from the centre’s policy. That this may not be the entire story is also possible. The trial in jail of Khan in the case called Toshakhana 2 continues at breakneck speed and there are few doubts which way it is headed. There are very little chances of relief from the higher courts. It is assumed that after all the convictions have been secured, access to him will become even more limited. In these circumstances, there is little incentive for Khan to let KP cooperate with the centre, especially as the PTI’s rank and file is also unhappy. It could be a case of using one arrow for two targets.

If the new CM chooses the path of resistance it will further complicate KP’s security situation.

But more than Gandapur’s ‘sacking’, it was the nomination of his successor that upped the temperatures. The party in KP welcomed Sohail Afridi but the rest of the political system reacted differently. The information minister at the centre did a press talk condemning the decision, adding that it would not be allowed. Others from the ruling party gave similar statements, as hushed whispers of governor’s rule or a splintering of the PTI in KP did the rounds. Overnight, the nominee was accused of being an associate of Murad Saeed (one of the few PTI stalwarts still on the run), a Taliban sympathiser, involved in smuggling or worse. The least of his sins and perhaps the only relevant one was his lack of experience. But the criticism against him grew more ludicrous.
The governor continued to throw up legal herrings from not having received the resignation to expressing fears about the authenticity of Gandapur’s signatures. For good measure, he also went and met Maulana Fazl; that they probably did a high five over their local rival’s exit is an image one can only conjure up mentally. The official images were serious and without any outcome.
All of this was also seen in conjunction with the press conference by the DG ISPR in Peshawar. While the talk was about the security situation, politics crept in. It seemed to some that it was aimed at the PTI and its governance in the province and how that was linked to the deteriorating security situation. In this environment, it’s hard to raise questions about the need for such press conferences so let’s just move on to politics.
By Monday morning, the election for the new chief minister went ahead far more smoothly than expected. The opposition boycotted the exercise; the number of votes cast for the new chief minister showed the PTI remained intact in the provincial assembly. But none of this indicates a smooth ride from hereon.
As mentioned, Khan, and by extension the PTI, has little incentive to allow smooth cooperation with the centre; this provides no relief to the PTI people behind bars and neither does it help with the growing discontent among KP residents vis-à-vis militancy and military operations.
On the other hand, the establishment is also in a bind. It has not been able to dent Khan’s popularity, especially in KP. But more importantly, it seems for the second time, it has toyed with and abandoned the idea of installing a non-PTI chief minister (for now). This is not simply because of the numbers game; it is more due to the concern over the reaction there.
Unlike Balochistan, the powers that be still worry about the people’s sentiment in KP. While the former can be given a completely puppet government with no legitimate voice, there is less willingness to be this indifferent to public sentiment in KP. This was probably at play in 2024 and might just have been at play in recent days.
But if the new chief minister follows a path of resistance, as he is expected to, it will make the security situation in KP complicated. And if he goes the way of Gandapur, the PTI and Khan will be under pressure again to stir things up. Indeed, short of rapprochement between Khan and the centre, the multiple crises in KP will not witness any change for the better. The province, and by extension the rest of the country, is in for a rough ride.

At least for now, it has succeeded in having its man installed in the office of the provincial chief executive in KP.
There had been warnings aplenty following Sohail Afridi’s nomination. Almost as soon as his name was announced, a stream of regime-aligned personalities from both politics and the media had levelled a series of allegations against him, ranging from corruption to outright facilitation of terrorists. Some had gone so far as to claim he would never be elected.
This level of confidence appeared at odds with the fact that the PTI enjoys an overwhelming majority in the KP Assembly, even with its lawmakers technically rendered ‘independents’ by the Election Commission. There were also questions why a politician considered dangerous had been operating unchallenged by the state so far and why his alleged misdoings came to light only after Mr Afridi was named as a replacement for the chief minister preceding him. In other words, why did the centre appear keen on preventing him from taking office?
Even now, though some 90 members of the KP Assembly have voted him in, Mr Afridi’s future hangs in the balance. The PPP-appointed governor of the province, Faisal Karim Kundi, had ‘returned’ the resignation of the erstwhile chief minister, Ali Amin Gandapur, seeking confirmation from him in person on Wednesday evening. This was criticised as an undemocratic attempt to block the KP legislature from appointing a new chief executive. And though the voting went ahead anyway, Mr Kundi is still required to administer the oath to Mr Afridi. As they say, there is many a slip ’twixt the cup and the lip.
Regardless of how the KP Assembly has voted, there are some important people who seem to feel differently about Mr Afridi. In fact, the pattern has been seen in other instances as well: laws, rules and procedures can be set aside very swiftly once a decision has been made. On its part, the PTI could have shown greater maturity by not rushing the matter.
Mr Afridi is known for his confrontational rhetoric against what he sees as state excesses. The party seems to have been sending a deliberate message by installing him in the most important office that it controls. The message has been received. One wonders how it will be responded to.

The controversy this time around is about who is actually at the helm of the province?
The saga began with the resignation of Ali Amin Gandapur as the chief minister, which is yet to be ‘formally accepted’ by Governor Faisal Karim Kundi. Despite this unresolved status, the provincial assembly went ahead to pick his replacement, a young lawmaker from Khyber, Sohail Afridi.
So, are there currently two chief ministers in the province, or not even one? Disparate legal opinions and the politics surrounding the CM’s election compound the matter, especially as the province is reeling from a significant rise in terrorist activities.
At the heart of the crisis is Governor Kundi, who has refused to consider Mr Gandapur’s two resignation letters delivered to him on October 8 and 11. Having sat on the letters for days, Mr Kundi has now summoned Mr Gandapur for a personal hearing to ascertain the “authenticity of alleged resignation” on October 15.

Some legal experts say Gandapur still chief executive, others insist province ‘has no chief minister’

As Mr Kundi was in Karachi, Ali Amin Gandapur responded to him on the assembly’s floor on Monday and reiterated his resignation. Subsequently, KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati ruled that the governor was not the appointing authority, nor did he have the authority to force an unwilling chief minister to remain in office.
“I rule that pursuant to the resignation by Mr Gandapur, and election for the post of KP chief minister is being lawfully conducted on this day, October 13, 2025 in accordance with the Constitution and rules of the KP Assembly,” Mr Swati stated. This followed the election of Mr Afridi as the new chief executive of the province.
 
 

It is likely that Mr Kundi will not administer the oath to the new CM, evident by his decision to ‘approve’ the resignation tendered by Mr Gandapur. And without the oath, Mr Afridi remains a CM-elect and out of office. However, the PTI has already approached the PHC chief justice to appoint someone to administer the oath to the CM-elect under Article 255 of the Constitution. This move is similar to the one by the opposition in KP when it had sought the PHC intervention for the oath to its lawmakers on reserved seats.
Speaking to Dawn, Shumail Ahmed Butt, a lawyer and former KP advocate general, told Dawn that there was no chief minister in KP at present. He said Mr Gandapur has resigned while his successor has not taken oath, adding that the constitutional posts cannot be assumed without taking oath.
Mr Butt said that Mr Afridi’s election was legitimate. Besides, the assembly proceedings cannot be challenged in court, he said. However, according to Mr Butt, the governor does have the power to verify the resignation. He said the PTI could approach the PHC if the governor refused to administer the oath.
Ali Gohar Durrani, a PHC lawyer, however, disagreed with his colleague. He said Mr Gandapur was still the KP CM. “As long as Mr Afridi does not take the oath of his office, Mr Gandapur will remain the chief minister,” he said. He said the CM’s election was legal and valid, as the governor did not have the power to decline the CM’s resignation. “Mr Kundi’s actions are illegal and in violation of the Constitution,” he said.
About the PTI’s move to approach the PHC, he said the ruling party had jumped the gun. “Unless the governor declines to administer the oath, the PTI cannot approach the PHC,” he said.
Amir Javed, ex-advocate general of KP, claimed that Mr Afridi’s election was illegal. “When the province has a sitting CM and his cabinet, then how can another person be elected as the CM?” Mr Javed questioned.
Zainab Shahid, however, said there was no legal provision to seek the governor’s assent for the resignation.
The lawyer told Dawn.com: “There is no legal or constitutional provision requiring the governor of KP’s assent for the former CM resignation to become effective.”  “As per Article 130(8), the only requirement is that the CM resigns ‘by writing under his hand addressed to the governor’. The former CM has done so twice,” she added.

The discussions focused on accelerating the IFC’s investment plans, including the Reko Diq project, expediting IsDB-funded initiatives such as the M-6 Motorway, and advancing a new framework to deepen economic collaboration with both institutions.
During his meeting with Riccardo Puliti, the minister highlighted Pakistan’s improving macroeconomic indicators and the importance of strengthening IFC’s partnership with the country. “We value IFC’s role in scaling up private sector investment, particularly through multi-billion-dollar commitments under the 10-year Country Partnership Framework.”
Both sides agreed to work toward early financial closure of IFC’s flagship Reko Diq project, and the minister welcomed IFC’s new regional set-up, including a regional office in Islamabad, describing it as a “significant step to deepen collaboration and support sustainable investment in Pakistan.”
In his meeting with Dr Muhammad Sulaiman Al-Jasser, the finance minister thanked IsDB for its long-standing support to Pakistan and reviewed the current project portfolio. He emphasised the need for faster implementation of ongoing initiatives and welcomed the IsDB Board’s approval of financing for two sections of the M-6 Motorway.
Mr Aurangzeb also discussed continued cooperation in Pakistan’s polio eradication efforts and the oil financing facility, noting that both sides had agreed to develop a new Country Engagement Framework to guide future collaboration.

The decision aims to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure transparency in the post-merger landscape.
The CCP’s detailed order, posted on its website, outlines strict conditions separating the new merged entity — comprising Ufone and Telenor Pakistan (MergeCo) — from PTCL and its other businesses. PTCL has committed in writing to comply with the order.
The merged entity is expected to become the second-largest cellular mobile operator (CMO) after Jazz, surpassing Zong. Currently, Ufone is the only loss-making CMO among the four, while the rest are profitable. As part of the conditions, the MergeCo must demonstrate profitability, and a third-party evaluator will be required to submit biannual performance reports to the CCP.
To enforce operational independence, the CCP has directed PTCL and MergeCo to maintain separate financial accounts for all service segments. They must also operate with entirely separate boards and management teams. Currently, some individuals hold overlapping roles in both PTCL and Ufone, including the CEO.
“No individual may simultaneously serve on the board or hold senior management roles in both PTCL and MergeCo,” the order states. Former board members or executives are prohibited from joining the other entity for at least three years after leaving their post.
Palwasha Khan, Chairperson of the Senate Standing Committee on IT and Telecom, welcomed the CCP’s decision. “As PTCL is a state-owned entity, it is our duty to safeguard public interest. The committee will seek quarterly accounts of MergeCo to ensure it remains profitable,” she said. The order also bars the exchange of commercially sensitive information between PTCL and MergeCo. Any reduction in interconnection circuits allocated to other telecom operators, including local loop, long-distance international, and cellular licensees, must be approved in advance by the PTA. Interconnect pricing or capacity must not be used to limit other operators’ access to MergeCo customers.
A senior CCP official stated that non-compliance could result in severe measures, including the possible divestment of PTCL’s telecom infrastructure or parts of its business, as permitted under Clause 13.19 of the order. Analysts believe the separation will improve transparency, limit cross-subsidisation, and support competitive offerings in the telecom sector.

The PTI said the gover­n­­ment could not carry out a transparent probe into the massacre, hence independent observers and hu­­man rights organisations must be included to ensu­­re a fair investigation.
In a statement, PTI Central Information Sec­r­etary Sheikh Waqqas Akram condemned the alleged killings of TLP marchers and demanded that all those responsible for the carnage be held accountable and brought to justice without delay.
Had the perpetrators of the Model Town massacre been punished, he said, the Muridke tragedy would never have occurred.
Where is the prime minister of the country, the chief minister of Punjab, and the information minister who, under normal circumstances, holds press conferences every few hours against opponents, he asked, saying that they had now gone completely silent. He lamented that the TLP leadership repeatedly sought dialogue until the very last moment.
“Had meaningful dialogue been initiated before the protests began, a peaceful solution could certainly have been found.”
Mr Akram called for immediate medical assistance for the injured, along with compensation for the families of those who lost their lives. He also called for an independent, tra­nsparent, and judicial inquiry into the incident to en­­sure that all those responsible are identified and face exemplary punishment.
He demanded that the State cannot do transparent probe into the massacre, hence independent observers and human rights organisations must be included in the investigation process to ensure fair investigation of the incident.

The police produced Falak before the court and sought her physical remand for investigation. The investigating officer told the court that they needed to interrogate the accused, and therefore sought physical remand.
Falak Javed’s counsel opposed the remand request, saying that the police had previously informed the Lahore High Court that his client was not required in any case. He said the arrest of the activist in the case showed mala fide of the police.
The lawyer asked the court to discharge the activist from the case.
After hearing arguments from both sides, ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill allowed a 14-day physical remand of the suspect to the police. The judge also directed the police to submit an investigation report at the next hearing on Oct 27.
A judicial magistrate last week sent Falak on judicial remand in two separate cases of alleged misuse of social media platforms against state institutions and a woman provincial minister. The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had arrested her from Islamabad.

Blair met Hussein al-Sheikh, the deputy president of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, in the Jordanian capital on Sunday.
Hamas, which has said it will not have a future role in the government of Gaza, has opposed Blair’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as foreign guardian for Palestine state.
In a statement, al-Sheikh said: “Today, I met Mr Tony Blair to discuss the day after the war and making President Trump’s efforts, which aim at stopping the war and establishing lasting peace in the region, a success. We have confirmed our readiness to work with President Trump, Mr Blair and the partners to consolidate the ceasefire, the entry of aid, the release of hostages and prisoners, and then start with the recovery and reconstruction.”

Hamas has opposed ex-UK PM’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as guardian for Palestinian state

“We stressed the importance of stopping the undermining of the PA, and especially the return of withheld Palestinian revenues, and preventing the undermining of the two-state solution in preparation for a comprehensive and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy,” he was quoted as saying by The Guardian.
The PA is keen that tax revenues withheld by the Israeli government are released, since this is preventing salary payments and undermining its liquidity, in violation of the Oslo accords.
Israel has also threatened not to renew next month the annual waiver of terrorist financing laws, which allows Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks.
Sharhabeel al-Zaeem, the PA’s justice minister, last week criticised Blair’s involvement, saying: “Is this the independent Palest­in­ian state we are aiming for? All these struggles for all these years in order to have Mr Blair, who failed in London, who failed in Bri­tain, who failed in Iraq, come and — with all due respect at a personal level to Mr Blair — be our guardian as if we were minors?”
Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he travelled to Israel on Monday, Trump questioned whether Blair would be popular enough with other leaders to serve on the board that the US president envisages overseeing the governance of Gaza.

Trump reignited his trade war with China on Friday, accusing Beijing of imposing “extraordinarily aggressive” new export curbs relating to rare earths. He announced extra levies — plus export controls on “critical software” — due to take effect from Nov 1, and threatened to cancel a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump claims US wants to help China, not hurt it

On Sunday, China’s Ministry of Commerce called Trump’s tariff threat a “typical example of ‘double standards’”. The ministry said Washington had ratcheted up economic measures against Beijing since September.
“Threatening high tariffs at every turn is not the right approach to engaging with China,” it said in an online statement.
 
 

Chinese goods currently face US tariffs of 30pc under levies that Trump brought in while accusing Beijing of aiding in the fentanyl trade, and over alleged unfair practices.
China’s retaliatory tariffs are currently at 10pc.
China dominates global production and processing of these materials, and on Thursday announced new controls on the export of technologies used for the mining and processing of critical minerals.
 
 

Rare earths have been a major sticking point in recent trade negotiations between the two superpowers. They are critical to manufacturing everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to military hardware and renewable energy technology.
Later, in his post on Truth Social, President Trump said, “The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”, adding that President Xi Jinping “… doesn’t want Depression for his country”.

It is the first time scientists have declared that Earth has likely reached a so-called  “tipping point” — a shift that could trigger massive and often permanent changes in the natural world.
“Sadly, we’re now almost certain that we crossed one of those tipping points for warm water or tropical coral reefs,” report lead Tim Lenton, a climate and Earth system scientist at the University of Exeter, said.
This conclusion was supported by real-world observations of  “unprecedented” coral death across tropical reefs since the first comprehensive assessment of tipping points science was published in 2023, the authors said.
In the intervening years, ocean temperatures have soared to historic highs, and the biggest and most intense coral bleaching episode ever witnessed has spread to more than 80 per cent of the world’s reefs.
Understanding of tipping points has improved since the last report, its authors said, allowing for greater confidence in estimating when one might spark a domino effect of catastrophic and often irreversible disasters.
Scientists now believe that even at lower levels of global warming than previously thought, the Amazon rainforest could tip into an unrecognisable state, and ice sheets from Greenland to West Antarctica could collapse.
‘Unprecedented dieback’
For coral reefs, profound and lasting changes are already in motion.
“Already at 1.4°C of global warming, warm water coral reefs are crossing their thermal tipping point and experiencing unprecedented dieback,” said the report by 160 scientists from dozens of global research institutions.
The global scientific consensus is that most coral reefs would perish at warming of 1.5°C above preindustrial levels—a threshold just years away.
When stressed in hotter ocean waters, corals expel the microscopic algae that provide their distinct colour and food source.
Unless ocean temperatures retu­­rn to more tolerable levels, bleached corals simply cannot recover and eventually die of starvation.
Since 2023, marine scientists have reported coral mortality on a scale never seen before, with reefs turning ghostly white across the Pacific, Indian and Atlantic oceans.
“I am afraid their response confirms that we can no longer talk about tipping points as a future risk,” Lenton said.
Rather than disappear completely, scientists say reefs will evolve into less diverse ecosystems as they are overtaken by algae, sponges, and other simpler organisms better able to withstand hotter oceans.
These species would come to dominate this new underwater world, and over time, the dead coral skeletons beneath would erode into rubble.
Such a shift would be disastrous for the hundreds of millions of people whose livelihoods are tied to coral reefs, and the estimated one million species that depend on them.
‘Danger zone’
Some heat-resistant strains of coral may endure longer than others, the authors said, but ultimately the only response is to stop adding more planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
Exceeding 1.5°C “puts the world in a greater danger zone of escalating risk of further damaging tipping points”, Lenton said, including the collapse of vital ocean currents that could have  “catastrophic” knock-on impacts.
Scientists also warned that tipping points in the Amazon were closer than previously thought, and  “widespread dieback” and large-scale forest degradation were a risk even below 2°C of global warming.
That finding will be keenly felt by Brazil, which on Monday is hosting climate ministers in Brasilia ahead of next month’s UN COP30 conference in Belem on the edge of the Amazon.
In good news — the exponential uptake of solar power and electric vehicles were two examples of  “positive” tipping points where momentum can accelerate for the better, said Lenton.
“It gives us agency back, policymakers included, to make some tangible difference, where sometimes the output from our actions is sometimes disproportionately good,” he said.

• UN terms Afghan restrictions on women ‘gender apartheid’
• India’s Ministry of External Affairs denies any role in Friday’s press interaction at Afghan embassy
A PICTURE is worth a thousand words — and the image splashed across Indian newspapers on Monday, showing female journalists seated prominently in the front row at the Taliban foreign minister’s press conference in Delhi, perfectly embodies that sentiment.
The conference — Amir Khan Muttaqi’s second press event at the Afghan embassy within 48 hours — was convened following widespread outrage over the exclusion of female journalists from his initial briefing on Friday, BBC News reported.
Mr Muttaqi said at Sunday’s conference that the exclusion was unintentional and not “deliberate”.
“With regard to the [Friday’s] press conference, it was on short notice and a short list of journalists was decided, and the participation list that was presented was very specific.
“It was more a technical issue… Our colleagues had decided to send an invitation to a specific list of journalists and there was no other intention apart from this,” he added.
The UN has described the situation in Afghanistan as a form of “gender apartheid,” where women and girls are barred from secondary and higher education, prohibited from visiting parks and gyms, and face growing restrictions on employment. The Taliban government also enforces strict dress codes and limits their freedom of movement.
The Taliban, who regained power in 2021, maintain that they uphold women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law. However, Western diplomats say the severe restrictions on women have hindered the group’s efforts to gain international recognition. The curbs on women’s freedoms are widely regarded as the harshest in the world.
 
 

Mr Muttaqi had arrived in India on Thursday for a week of high-level talks with the government from Russia, the only country so far to fully recognise their government.
New Delhi has not officially recognised Afghanistan’s de facto rulers but, like several other countries, continues to maintain limited diplomatic engagement — operating a small mission in Kabul and providing humanitarian assistance to the country.
The visit is viewed as a significant step in strengthening ties between the two sides — offering the Taliban a boost in their pursuit of international recognition, while allowing India to advance its strategic and security objectives.
On Friday, Mr Muttaqi met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would reopen its embassy in Kabul which was shut after the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
The press event later in the day was attended by around 16 male reporters while female journalists were turned away from the embassy gates.
India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) clarified that it “had no role” in organising the press interaction, noting that it took place at the Afghan embassy.
However, the exclusion of female journalists on Indian soil sparked strong criticism from politicians and media circles, who faulted the government for allowing it.  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that by permitting the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “sending a message to every woman in India that she is too weak to be defended.”

• Police say inspector martyred; around 50 cops badly injured in violent clashes
• Conflicting reports emerge about fate of TLP chief; IGP says Saad Rizvi ‘not in custody’
• Second-tier leaders call on TLP supporters to converge on Lahore for protest on 17th
LAHORE: The fate of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi remained shrouded in mystery after law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the religious party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests.
The operation, which began around 3:30am, quickly spiralled into one of the most serious confrontations between police and TLP in recent months, continuing for nearly six hours.
According to officials, some 1,500 police personnel in full anti-riot gear, supported by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons, surrounded the protest camp along the GT Road.
By morning, authorities said they had detained hundreds of demonstrators, though exact figures remained unclear.
There was, however, a significant discrepancy in casualty reports, with local media reporting a few deaths and dozens of injuries, while social media was rife with exaggerated claims.
Nevertheless, Punjab Police confirmed the death of Inspector Shehzad Nawaz, who they said was shot during the operation. Local media reports said that at least four people, including the police officer, had been killed and 56 others injured.
Unverified social media posts, however, claimed the toll among TLP supporters was far higher, with some alleging “dozens if not hundreds” of deaths — claims dismissed by Punjab’s police chief, Dr Usman Anwar, as “baseless rumours” and “a conspiracy to evoke public sympathy”.
Adding to the uncertainty were unverified reports about the fate of Saad Rizvi, which spread rapidly across social media and WhatsApp groups on Monday. Several posts alleged that Mr Rizvi had been shot and was in critical condition, while other accounts claimed that he had been taken into custody.
Interestingly, despite its active online presence, the TLP’s official accounts and spokespersons remained conspicuously silent on the matter, neither confirming nor denying rumours about their leader’s condition or whereabouts.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that TLP chief Saad Rizvi had not been arrested, nor injured in Monday morning’s clashes.
Ripples across the country
By mid-morning, the unrest had spread to several other parts of the country. In Lahore, hundreds of TLP supporters took to the streets, blocking key intersections and damaging vehicles in protest at what they called a “brutal crackdown”.
In Burewala, five police officers, including a deputy superintendent, were injured when TLP activists clashed with local law enforcers.
In Faisalabad, demonstrators blocked the Chenab Chowk for nearly two hours, forcing the Government College University Faisalabad to postpone its scheduled examinations.
 
 

Further south, dozens of protesters obstructed the national highway at Mian Channu for half an hour, while in Bahawalnagar, TLP members blocked the Bahawalnagar–Head Sulemanki Road near Minchinabad, prompting another round of arrests and the registration of criminal cases under multiple charges.
In Karachi, similar scenes played out as TLP activists organised protests in North Karachi and New Karachi to denounce the police action in Punjab. Fear and uncertainty gripped the city as demonstrators blocked major thoroughfares and clashed with police.
West Zone deputy inspector general Irfan Ali Baloch said protesters had set up sit-ins at 4-K Chowrangi and Sindhi Hotel, where they blocked roads and attacked police with stones, injuring two constables.
“The police responded with tear gas and arrested five of them,” he told Dawn. “The situation was brought under control and traffic resumed.”
Late on Monday night, Mufti Wazeer Ahmad Rizvi, a member of the TLP’s Majlis-e-Shura (executive committee), released a video message urging party supporters to end their agitation, clear all roads, and await further instructions. “We will announce our next strategy soon,” he said.
Wazir Ahmad Rizvi, the group’s Balochistan emir, also called on protesters to disperse and converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar shrine on Oct 17.
Stalled negotiations
Explaining why an operation was launched against TLP workers, senior police officials said the crackdown had initially been halted after reports of renewed negotiations between the government and the TLP leadership. However, the talks quickly broke down.
“The TLP’s demands were completely unreasonable,” said a senior Punjab police officer involved in the operation. “They wanted security forces withdrawn from the entire route to Islamabad and insisted that all arrested workers be released unconditionally.”
According to the official, two rounds of talks were held between the early hours of Tuesday and Saturday night, but no progress was made.
When the protesters began to march towards Islamabad despite repeated warnings, police deployed anti-riot units to block their advance. The situation escalated when “armed men among the protesters opened fire on police”, critically injuring Inspector Nawaz.
‘State brutality’
Following the heavy-handed government response, JUI-F’s leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman condemned the government’s use of force against Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists.
Describing the operation as “state brutality”, Maulana asserted that the right to peaceful protest is fundamental for every citizen, criticising the government’s violent crackdown on TLP demonstrators as unacceptable. Maulana suggested that the government could have resolved the issue through dialogue rather than resorting to force.
However, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif expressed a different perspective on the events, calling the protests “an insult to religion”.
“Forming armed groups in the name of religion, blocking roads and holding the public hostage is an insult to religion. For two years, tyranny and a festival of blood were played out in Gaza, yet no one remembers any protests. When the ceasefire happened there, the protests began. The time has come to stop holding our society hostage… through violence in the name of religion,” he wrote on X.

• FO tells Kabul to ‘mind own business’ after Mujahid’s comment on TLP protests
• Cross-border trade, travel remain suspended
ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Pakistan’s defence minister termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism.
On Monday, troops stood on high alert, with border crossings closed for trade and travel after deadly clashes over the weekend.
 
 

Fighting between the two sides erupted after Pakistan supposedly undertook an operation against militant hideouts along the  Afghan border.
Speaking on Geo News, Defence Min­ister Khawaja Asif said that as of today, there are ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”.
The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.”
Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained.
At least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side late on Saturday night.
Mediation offers
For his part, US President Donald Trump appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, saying he was ‘good at making peace’.
“I hear there’s a war now going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel.
“I said, I’ll have to wait till I get back. You know, I’m doing another one, because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace,” he said.
China, which shares borders with both Pakistan and Afghanistan, also expressed willingness to play a constructive role in improving relations between the two neighbours.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Monday voiced deep concern over the latest clashes, and similar sentiments were also shared by Russia.
The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday called on Kabul and Islamabad to exercise restraint. “According to the incoming information, the situation is stabilising. We welcome this process,” it stated.
‘Mind your own business’
On the other hand, Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who is on a visit to New Delhi, said Afghanistan did not wish to fight with anyone and all its other neighbours were happy with Kabul.
“War is not a solution to problems. There is a need for dialogue. This has been our policy,” Muttaqi told reporters in the Indian capital.
But in an uncharacteristic comment about domestic politics, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid criticised Pakistan’s use of force against Tehreek-i-Labbaik protesters.
Reacting sharply, the Foreign Office asked the Afghan spokesperson “to prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside [your] jurisdiction”.
“The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters.”
While the exchange of fire between the two countries ceased on Monday, all entry points have been “closed since Saturday following the unprovoked attacks by the Afghan Taliban forces,” a senior Pakistani security official told Reuters.
Another official said there were a few incidents of exchange of small arms fire on Sunday night, but the overall situation was calm. This view was echoed by Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayat­ullah Khowarazmi, who said the “current situation” on the border was normal.
However, cross-border trade remained suspended on Monday.
Loaded vehicles, including containers and trucks, are stuck on both sides of the border. Besides fresh fruit and vegetables, they are carrying imports and exports and transit trade goods and causing millions of rupees of losses to the two countries as well as traders,” said Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, senior vice president of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry.—Agencies / with input from Baqir Sajjad Syed

• Phenomenon likely to disrupt Kharif crop harvesting, raise Glof risk
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is likely to face one of its coldest winter this year in decades due to the La Nina climate pattern.
According to the latest situation report on Pakistan’s monsoon floods, compiled by the Intersector Coordination Group in collaboration with other partners, this could lead to colder-than-usual winter conditions, further stretching coping  mechanisms of households affected by the floods, particularly in the mountainous regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit Baltistan.
A La Nina occurs when sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean cool abnormally, triggering extreme weather shifts worldwide.
 
 

In its forecast for October, the report published by UN-OCHA says that the continued marginally negative phases of both the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole will drive rainfall across Pakistan.
Northern Punjab, KP, AJK, and GB are likely to witness below-normal rainfall, while southern areas like Sindh, Balochistan, and southern Punjab may receive near-normal precipitation, it noted.
According to the report, the expected impacts of this phenomenon include possible disruptions to Kharif crop harvesting due to isolated storms, increased risk of dengue outbreaks in stagnant water conditions, higher chances of glacial lake outburst floods in upper areas, reduced river inflows affecting irrigation, elevated smog and air pollution in plains, and adverse effects on livestock health and fodder availability due to above-normal temperatures.
The report also takes stock of the deteriorating post-flood situation, especially in the context of “a diminishing response capacity both by government and humanitarian partners”.
“Despite robust response by local and international actors at the onset of the crisis, three months since, the presence of humanitarian partners and response capacity on the ground decreased.  Pre-positioned stocks and initial emergency funds were used, with humanitarian partners now seeking additional funding for sustained interventions to ensure provision of basic services during the transition period from a humanitarian response to that of early recovery,” the OCHA report says.
Of particular concern is the long-term damage to livelihoods, which threatens recovery and self-sustainability. Crop fields were flooded, devastating harvests, livestock and fodder were swept away, and farm machinery and agricultural tools were damaged or destroyed, wreaking havoc on livelihoods and chances of restarting income generating activities in the near future.
 
 

According to a recent geo-spatial impact assessment conducted by FAO in flood affected areas, flood waters inundated around 1.2 million hectares in Punjab, the country’s food basket, damaging major rice, cotton, and sugarcane fields. The disaster coincided with the critical window for Rabi crop planting, further threatening food security and livelihoods and the ability to bounce back.
Remaining stagnant water in some flood-affected areas is also of concern as it causes significant health risks, including outbreaks of waterborne diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and typhoid, as well as vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, which thrive in these conditions.
 
 

With over 229,760 damaged or destroyed homes, many families continue to sleep outside, with little protection from the elements or vector-borne diseases carried by mosquitoes.
Schools and health facilities have lost essential supplies and damaged or covered in thick mud preventing the resumption of classes or provision of health services. Food and fodder stocks were either washed away or now lay waterlogged and rotten, increasing food insecurity and reliance on humanitarian food rations.

The FO was responding to a statement by Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid slamming the police crackdown on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
The TLP, which began its protest march in Lahore on Friday, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. On Monday, police and law enforcement agencies launched an early-morning operation to disperse the protesters, who were encamped in Muridke. The clashes left a police officer and four civilians dead, including three TLP workers.
Mujahid issued a statement earlier today in which Kabul expressed its condolences and said it was “profoundly saddened” by the violence and deaths and noted that the demonstrations were carried out “in accordance with the country’s legal framework”.
“We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and to the entire nation of Pakistan, and we wish a swift recovery to those who have been wounded,” Mujahid’s statement read.
“We urge the Pakistani government and its ruling authorities to cease any further acts of violence against their people and to pursue resolution through dialogue and mutual understanding.”
 






In response, the FO took to X and acknowledged the statement, urging Kabul to “prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside their jurisdiction”.
“The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters,” the FO wrote.
It also urged Kabul to abide by its obligations to the international community under the Doha Process and to “not allow its land to be used for terrorism against other countries”.
“Besides, the regime should focus on [the] formation of an inclusive and truly representative government, instead of engaging in baseless propaganda,” the FO concluded.

The unnamed depression came toward the end of the rainy season, battering land and bursting rivers that had already been soaked by months of rains, while forecasters were focused on tropical storms and two hurricanes on the Pacific coast.
“This intense rain was not expected to be of such magnitude,” President Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters.
Admiral Raymundo Morales, Mexico’s Navy secretary, said the flooding was the result of the coming together of warm and cold air fronts over rivers that were already filled to the brink and mountains weakened by months of rain.
Around 100,000 homes were affected, Sheinbaum said. She is set to meet with the finance ministry later in the day to discuss rebuilding efforts, and visit some hard-hit states.
Laura Velazquez, national coordinator of civil protection, said Hidalgo and Veracruz were the states worst affected, with 29 deaths and 18 missing reported in Veracruz, and 21 deaths and 43 missing in Hidalgo.
The rain also destroyed infrastructure such as bridges and left streets filled with mud. Videos and images from last week showed emergency responders wading through deep waters to find stranded residents and get supplies to affected communities.
Authorities have deployed thousands of personnel to help evacuate, clean up and monitor the places that were hardest hit.
Electricity, which had been knocked out in towns across five states, has largely been restored. Authorities said they will also focus on containing the spread of viruses such as dengue, carried by mosquitoes that breed in stagnant water.</p><small>2025-10-13 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/13223430863f006.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948608/trump-thanks-pm-shehbaz-and-my-favourite-field-marshal-asim-munir-for-gaza-peace-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Trump thanks PM Shehbaz and ‘my favourite’ Field Marshal Asim Munir for Gaza peace efforts</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump especially thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and “my favourite” Field Marshal Asim Munir on Monday for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza, among many other world leaders.
Trump was addressing a ceremony following the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas at the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit in Egypt. He also invited PM Shehbaz to deliver a special address at the ceremony.
Taking the podium, PM Shehbaz thanked Trump and the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for their efforts in securing the peace deal.
“Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace [and] who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity.”
’’I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team. And today again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East.“
PM Shehbaz said he wanted to salute Trump for his “exemplary [and] visionary leadership”.

“You are the man this world needed the most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything [and] went out of the way to stop seven and today eight wars,” he added.
The premier also thanked the Qatari emir for his efforts in securing peace in Gaza and the wider region, along with the efforts of the Turkish, Saudi and Emirati leadership.
 


“Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, had he not intervened with his wonderful team during those four days, the war could’ve escalated to a level and who would’ve lived to tell what happened.”
“Similarly, here in this part of the world in the Middle East, Mr president, your valuable contribution along with President Sisi, I think history will remember in golden words.”
Retaking the podium, Trump quipped: “Wow! I didn’t expect that. Let’s go home, there’s nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered, thank you very much.”
PM meets other leaders
PM Shehbaz earlier reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for peace in the region and solidarity with the people of Palestine as he met world leaders in Egypt.
Two years of Israeli bombardment in the Palestinian enclave have claimed more than 67,000 lives, with the continuing to rise as more bodies are recovered. Last month, US President Trump had mediated a truce with the help of eight Muslim nations between Hamas and Israel and paved the way for the end of genocide in Gaza through a 20-point plan.
Last week, Hamas and Israel had signed an agreement to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of Trump’s initiative to end the conflict. Yesterday, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said that the summit was the result of the diplomatic efforts that began on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th Session in New York last month.
PM Shehbaz arrived in Egypt earlier today to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. The premier arrived at the Congress Centre to participate in the summit and was received upon arrival by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.
 






The prime minister met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in Gaza. The meeting marked a rare moment of convergence between the two Caucasus nations and underscored the broader international commitment to de-escalation in the Middle East.
 






The prime minister also held bilateral discussions with prominent global leaders, including King Abdullah II of Jordan, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres, President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.
The premier also met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who thanked Pakistan for its “unwavering political and diplomatic support’’.
Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the Gaza ceasefire, and PM Shehbaz lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Palestinian people.
 






During these meetings, PM Shehbaz emphasised the urgent need for coordinated international efforts to restore peace in the region. He highlighted Pakistans consistent stance on the Palestinian issue, reaffirming Islamabads unwavering diplomatic and moral support for the Palestinian people.
“Our position is rooted in justice and humanity,” he said.
“Pakistan will continue to stand by the Palestinian cause and support all peaceful initiatives aimed at ending violence and ensuring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.”
The meetings also included discussions on broader regional stability, strengthening multilateral cooperation, and promoting dialogue to resolve long-standing conflicts.
He later met Trump, who also arrived in Egypt to attend the signing ceremony and met world leaders as he welcomed them.

Earlier, PM Shehbaz hailed the peace plan a “crucial step towards lasting peace in the Middle East”.
“Grateful to our co-hosts, President El Sisi and President Trump. We would not have seen this moment without President Trump’s outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment,” PM Shehbaz said on X.
“It took his single-minded pursuit of peace to end the needless killing and destruction,” he said.
 






PM Shehbaz added that the ceremony marked the “closing of a genocidal chapter, one that the international community must ensure is never repeated anywhere again”.
He said the “brave and resilient” Palestinian people deserve to live in a free Palestine, “with pre 1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as their capital city”.
Trump, along with Sisi, will chair the summit set to be attended by world leaders, including the head of the United Nations.
The gathering in the Red Sea resort town will bring together “leaders from more than 20 countries”, Sisi’s office had said. It will seek “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and Pedro Sanchez of Spain will also attend the summit. French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, according to their offices.
The European Council will be represented by its president, Antonio Costa, a spokesperson said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II is also expected to attend, according to state media.
Israel and Hamas, however, will not attend the summit.
“No Israeli official will attend,” Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told AFP yesterday.
Similarly, Hamas confirmed it will not participate directly. Hossam Badran, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told AFP that the Palestinian group “will not be involved.” He noted that Hamas “acted principally through … Qatari and Egyptian mediators” during previous negotiations.</p><small>2025-10-13 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/132300192007120.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948698/de-klerk-steers-south-africa-to-last-over-win-against-bangladesh-at-womens-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>De Klerk steers South Africa to last over win against Bangladesh at Women’s World Cup</strong></a><br><p>South Africa’s lower order once again came to the rescue after a top order collapse, edging out Bangladesh by three wickets in a nail-biting finish in the Women’s World Cup in Visakhapatnam on Monday.
Chasing 233, the Proteas were on the ropes at 78-5, but their tail refused to throw in the towel, showing the same grit that saw them turn the tables on India in their previous outing.
A gutsy 85-run stand for the sixth wicket between Marizanne Kapp, who made 56, and Chloe Tryon, 62, steadied the ship and gave the chase a fresh lease of life.
Both batters brought up their half-centuries, but their dismissals reopened the door for Bangladesh, who sniffed an upset.
Then, Nadine de Klerk, South Africa’s player for a crisis, walked in and saw her side over the line.
Her unbeaten 37 off 29 deliveries guided her side home with three balls to spare.
“I am lost for words, actually. It was a bit nerve-wracking, but I’m happy we pulled this off,” said Tryon, who was named player-of-the-match.
“We just wanted to stay calm and wait for the bad balls. We knew we could chase 80 in the last 10 overs.”
When Tryon was run out by a direct hit from Ritu Moni, South Africa still needed 35 off 31 balls with three wickets in hand. De Klerk survived a few anxious moments, including a dropped chance on 26 and made Bangladesh pay dearly.
With eight needed off the last over, she slashed the first ball from Nahida Akter through the covers for four, then sealed the deal in style, pulling the third ball for a six.
The Proteas, who began the campaign in tatters after being bundled out for 69 in a 10 wicket drubbing by England, have now stitched together three wins on the trot to climb to third in the points table and suddenly, a semi-final berth looks well within reach.
For Bangladesh, it was a tale of missed chances. A sharper fielding effort could well have tilted the scales their way.
After a sluggish start which saw them reach 73-2 at the halfway stage, Bangladesh did well to post 232-6 in their 50 overs, thanks in main to a sparkling 51 not out from Shorna Akter.
Coming off just 35 deliveries, it was the fastest fifty of the tournament so far and included three fours and three sixes.</p><small>2025-10-13 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628432-pm-shehbaz-praises-trump-as-man-of-peace-for-role-in-gaza-ceasefire-deal' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz praises 'man of peace' Trump for securing historic Gaza ceasefire deal</strong></a><br><p>

KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, who pushed ahead with the election despite the opposition walkout, announced that the three opposition candidates — Maulana Lutfur Rehman of JUI-F, Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP — all received zero votes.
 
 

Noting that three members of the assembly were out of the country, he announced that Afridi had won the election after securing 90 votes, prompting chants in favour of the PTI leader to ring out in the assembly hall.
Afridi had needed to secure at least 73 votes in the 145-strong KP Assembly to win the election. Out of a total of 53 opposition members, 51 walked out of the assembly on the call of the opposition leader; the remaining two were not present for the session.
Meanwhile, leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah said they did not accept Afridi as the new chief minister.
“The PTI is interpreting the law as per their understanding, we are doing it according to our understanding. There are grey areas and now the court has to decide,” he told Dawn.com, adding that the opposition would knock on the doors of the courts.
He further contended that there were now “two chief ministers” in the province as Gandapur’s resignation had not been accepted.
It should be mentioned that while Gandapur has submitted two separate resignations to Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, both have been returned over “disparate signatures”. Kundi has summoned Gandapur on October 15 (Wednesday) to settle the matter.
Speaker sends summary to governor
Separately, Speaker Swati posted on X that he had “formally sent the summary to the KP governor for [the] oath-taking”.
 






Have no greed for the seat, will vacate it if directed to do so: Afridi
Before announcing the results, KP Assembly Speaker Swati, in a message to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, said that “KP still holds the forces dear because soldiers are out there defending the province and continue to make sacrifices”.
Despite that, institutions can not be allowed to run parliament, he said. “The parliament is the representative jirga of the province’s people,” he added.
Afridi then proceeded to deliver an emphatic speech in which he expressed his admiration of and loyalty to party founder Imran Khan.
Speaking in the assembly, Afridi said that he was grateful to Imran for choosing someone who was a mere worker, belonged to a middle-class family and did not have familial links to politics.
“And neither Bhutto, Zardari nor Sharif are attached to my name,” he thundered. He further said that he belonged to the tribal districts and was proud of his background.
He said that a particular mindset had prevailed about tribal districts and its people over the past 78 years. “This mindset dictates that the people of tribal areas are only there to die, that tribal areas should always be far behind.”
He further said that Imran was aware of the deprivation faced by the tribal districts.
“However many times I thank [Imran], it is not enough,” he said. He further said that the tribal districts were ecstatic over the decision to field him as the new chief minister, and were thanking Imran and the party.
“As is the vision of my leader Imran, one does not become a leader by writing Sharif or Bhutto or Zardari with their name,” he said.
Afridi also extended his gratitude to Gandapur, saying that no one in the party had ever hesitated when it came to making sacrifices. “Ali bhai, the grace with which you tendered your resignation … I laud you for that.”
Calling himself a “champion of politics of protest”, he said that he had nothing to lose. “No cars, no bungalows, no riches and no greed for the seat. The day my leader tells me to vacate the seat, I will kick it to the side.”
He also said that there were reports that Imran, who is currently incarcerated, was being shifted without consultation with his family and the party. “I make this announcement, that if he is shifted without consultation, we will jam the whole country.”
During his speech, Afridi also stated that military operations were not the “solution to terrorism” and called on the federal government to engage in dialogue, and involve the people of the province and the government in devising a solution.
He recalled that he and his fellow party members had been raising alarm over terrorism for a long time, but “no one paid us any attention”.
“In fact, we were accused of lying,” he added. “And today, they are conducting operations,” he said.
Questioning the efficacy of military operations, Afridi asked, “Despite 14,000 intelligence-based operations, why has there been no decrease in terrorism?
“My people are still internally-displaced persons (IDPs), their homes have been uprooted and they are dying,” he said, noting that “it is clear that military operations are not the solution”.
He stressed that any policy concerning counter terror measures and Afghanistan had to take the people of the province into account.
“They are kicking out our Afghan brothers and sisters — people who have been here for 40-50 years,” he said while referring to the repatriation of Afghan refugees.
He also vowed to speak to the Centre about the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), stating, “I will ask why people who are merely asking for their rights have been treated in such a way.”
PTI congratulates Afridi
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan congratulated Afridi on winning the election.
“I hope the next step of taking oath takes place and the transition is completed smoothly. I pay strong tribute to the outgoing CM Ali Amin Gandapur. And I congratulate Afridi for his election,” he said.
 






PTI leader Omar Ayub also congratulated Afridi, saying: “Our struggle for ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ shall continue as per the vision and instructions of PM Imran Khan. Gratitude to former CM Ali Amin Khan Gandapur sahib for his unflinching support and efforts to make the transfer of power smooth,” he said.
 






PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser also extended his “heartfelt congratulations” to Afridi.
“Today marks an important milestone in the political history of Pakistan. It is a testament to the fact that Imran Khan has provided an opportunity for hardworking, talented and ideological workers from the youth and middle class to reach positions of leadership,” Qaiser said.
“Afridi started his political struggle with student politics and with continuous hard work, perseverance and the spirit of serving the people … His election undoubtedly reflects the vision of Imran Khan, who is keen to bring forward a new, courageous and people-oriented leadership,” he said, adding that he was confident new avenues of progress, prosperity and transparent governance would open under the leadership of Afridi.
 






PTI MNA Junaid Akbar expressed gratitude that all members of the provincial assembly were “standing with Imran Khan” and were united.
“Only one member is outside the country,” Akbar said. “I pay tribute to all the members of the provincial assembly who have kept Imran Khan, the workers and themselves in their hearts and have not succumbed to any pressure or greed,” he said.
 






Opposition decries ‘unconstitutional procedure’; speaker pushes ahead
Prior to the election, Leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah had spoken in the assembly and termed the election as “unconstitutional”.
During his speech, he held up a copy of the Constitution and said: “According to this Constitution, the procedure is that first your resignation is accepted. Then the administration denotifies the cabinet.”
He said the cabinet had not been denotified and Gandapur’s resignation had not been accepted by the governor.
“In the presence of an existing chief minister, the election of a new chief minister is unconstitutional. So we will not become a part of this unconstitutional procedure,“ he asserted.
He also questioned the need for making the issue controversial. “If you already have the numbers, then why not wait a few days and have it be done constitutionally?”
He reiterated that the process was “unconstitutional” and said that the opposition was staging a walkout as “it did not want to be a part of this”.
Following the walkout, KP Assembly Speaker Swati said that Gandapur had sent his resignation to the governor twice and also announced the same in his speech in the assembly.
Swati said that while some people wished for Afridi to not become the new chief minister, the Constitution did not function according to people’s wishes.
“The chief minister of a province is a constitutional office holder in terms of Article 130. Clause eight of this article provides for tendering of a resignation by the chief minister under his hand … I rule that an election for the post of chief minister of KP is being lawfully conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the rules of the assembly,” he said.
Speaking in an interview on Geo News show ‘Capital Talk’, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah addressed the controversy and said: “Our stance is, and we think it to be absolutely correct, that the speaker should not have called the provincial assembly session until the resignation was accepted.”
He also criticised Afridi for his speech, saying it did not befit a chief minister or a provincial assembly.
Criticising Afridi’s view on military operations, he said the PTI should act as a political party if it wanted the state and institutions to engage with it democratically and politically.
Sanaullah questioned how could a provincial government function if it did not cooperate or work together with the federal government, saying Afridi’s speech was akin to “mutiny”. He added that the Centre would try to prevent the situation from deteriorating but if Afridi’s conduct “remains as per his speech, then I don’t think he can conduct himself as the head of a provincial government in accordance with the Constitution and law”.
Gandapur gives ‘advance congratulations’ to Afridi
At the outset of the session, Gandapur gave his “advance congratulations” to Afridi as the treasury benches thumped their desks.
He assured them that the PTI’s fight for justice would continue under the leadership of party founder Imran Khan. He expressed pride at the fact that he had submitted his resignation on October 8 on the directives of Imran.
He also called for allowing the democratic process to continue and to refrain from putting any obstacles in this regard. He further said that everything he had done as the provincial chief executive was a part of record and could be examined.
“A government can only succeed, a province can only succeed if it is self sustainable. Unfortunately, when our government came into power, we only had enough money for salaries for 18 months. But I am proudly saying right now that we have Rs280 million in the treasury,” he said.
He further said that his government provided more than what it allocated under the Annual Development Programme. He stated that under Imran’s vision, he had provided funds to all constituencies.
“In the end, I would like to say that we have a movement, a struggle and that struggle is not limited to Imran Khan. The sacrifice that he is making right now, he is doing it for the good of the nation. We stand with him and will continue to do so,” he said.
He also called for addressing the challenges the province was facing, saying that the law and order situation was more important than engaging in a war of words.
“We have to move forward  and focus on these challenges,” he said.
KP governor returns Gandapur’s resignation over ‘disparate’ signature
Separately, the controversy around Gandapur’s resignation took another turn on Sunday night after Governor Kundi returned two separate letters submitted by the former over “disparate signatures” and summoned him on October 15 (Wednesday) to settle the matter.
In a post on social media platform X, Kundi said that the chief minister’s resignation had been “returned with observation”.
He also shared a letter addressed to Gandapur, wherein he stated that two resignation letters had been received by the Governor House on October 8 and October 11, both of which had “disparate and unalike signatures”.
 






“Since I am out of city, and intend to return to Peshawar on the ever of October 15, therefore, you are advised to visit Governor House on October 15 at 3pm so that the authenticity of the alleged resignations could be verified and the matter is settled as per the mandate of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he said.
Meanwhile, Gandapur responded to Kundi’s post on X and said: “Finally, the resignation submitted on October 8, previously denied by the Governor Office, also acknowledged.”
He further stated that both resignations submitted by him bore his “authentic signatures”.
 






On October 8, Gandapur said he had resigned from his role as the provincial chief executive, while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that party founder Imran Khan directed Sohail Afridi to assume the CM’s role.
The letter, shared by Gandapur on X, was typed on his official letterhead and signed at the bottom. However, this initial resignation letter had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s House denying having ever received it.
On October 11, Kundi had stated that the Governor House had received a handwritten resignation letter from Gandapur. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he had added.
A day earlier, a parliamentary delegation of PTI had met Kundi at his residence in Islamabad. The delegation included Asad Qaiser, Atif Khan, Junaid Akbar and others.
PTI representatives had sought support from the PPP to ensure democratic values during the election for the chief minister. They said the PPP had always claimed that it gave value to the democratic norms.
Kundi had stated that Gandapur’s resignation would be accepted as per constitutional requirements. He had also stressed the need for joint efforts to ensure peace and the public services in the province.</p><small>2025-10-13 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628426-pakistan-army-wins-gold-at-uks-exercise-cambrian-patrol-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Army wins gold at UK's Exercise Cambrian Patrol 2025</strong></a><br><p>

PHC Chief Justice S. M. Attique Shah asked AAG Sanaullah to confirm whether the KP governor has received the summary related to the oath from the assembly secretariat and has instructed him to submit a reply by Wednesday.
“We will look at the matter tomorrow again. Get a response from the governor and let us know,” the judge added.
The development comes after PTI’s Sohail Afridi won the election held in the KP Assembly for the chief minister role. KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, announced that the three opposition candidates — Maulana Lutfur Rehman of JUI-F, Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP — all received zero votes.
KP’s Leader of the Opposition Dr Ibadullah Khan decried Afridi’s election as “unconstitutional”, and opposition lawmakers staged a walkout from the assembly.
 
 

Subsequently, in a pre-emptive move, the PTI approached the provincial high court to request that KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati be nominated to administer Afridi’s oath.
An application filed by the PTI, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, contended that the KP Governor had “made himself unavailable for the purpose of taking oath of office from” CM-elect Afridi.
“The government of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cannot be allowed to come to a standstill,” it asserted, terming the administering of the CM-elect’s oath as a “matter of great urgency”.

“In view of the foregoing, it is respectfully prayed that the Speaker Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly or any other person considered appropriate may kindly be nominated as the person before whom Sohail Khan Afridi may make oath of the office of chief minister.”
The application was filed under Article 255 (oath of office) of the Constitution by Swati, MPA Shah Abu Turah and MPA Sher Ali Afridi.
PHC Chief Justice Shah took up the application in the late afternoon. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja appeared as the counsel for his party.
Separately, addressing the media in Peshawar, PTI’s Barrister Raja said the PHC gave them and Kundi time until tomorrow to “explain his reasons why he does not want to administer the oath to Sohail Khan Afridi or clarify if he would administer the oath”.
If the governor refuses, Raja added, then it will be the “legal and constitutional obligation” of the PHC chief justice to direct another person to hold the oath-taking so that Afridi can officially initiate performing his duties.
 






Following Afridi’s election, Naeem Haider Panjutha, a member of PTI founder Imran Khan’s legal team, posted on X that party members had reached the PHC with the application.
Article 129 of the Constitution states that before assuming office, a chief minister is to be administered the oath by a governor, who is Kundi in this case.
But, Panjutha said the Constitution also authorised the PHC chief justice to administer the oath if the governor refuses. “In any case, the oath-taking will take place today,” Panjutha asserted.
 






Separately, Speaker Swati posted on X that he had “formally sent the summary to the KP governor for [the] oath-taking”.

In a post on X, PTCL said that maintenance work on the submarine cable will be carried out to repair a faulty repeater.
“The activity will start on October 14 … around 11am PST, which can last for up to 18 hours,” the telecom giant said. “During this period, customers will face Internet service degradation. We regret the inconvenience, please.”
 






Meanwhile, internet monitoring service Downdetector showed users reporting issues accessing social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram in Pakistan.

Last month, PTCL warned that cuts to submarine internet cables in Saudi waters would likely impact internet services in the country during peak hours.
This is not the first time that damage to undersea internet cables has affected services in Pakistan.
Internet users across Pakistan complained of slow internet and hindered access to services throughout 2024.
On January 3 this year, PTCL said teams were “diligently” working to resolve the matter of disruptions faced by users after a fault in the AAE-1 subsea internet cable connecting Pakistan slowed down the network speed in the country.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the exercise retained its demanding professional standards, where patrols from militaries across the globe move tactically across 60 kilometres of inhospitable terrain within 48 hours, completing specialised tasks.
“This year, 137 teams from 36 Countries participated in the exercise and out of all these teams, [the] Pakistan Army’s team, led by Captain Muhammad Saad, showed exceptional performance in the exercise and [was] awarded with the gold medal,” the ISPR said.
“It is indeed a proud moment for the whole nation and [the] Pakistan Army, which is known for its professionalism and highest standards of training,” the statement added.
“Pakistan Army has always held [the] country’s flag high and will keep endeavouring in future as well.”

“And after so many years of unceasing war and endless danger, today the skies are calm, the guns are silent, the sirens are still, and the sun rises on a holy land that is finally at peace, a land and a region that will live, God willing, in peace for all eternity,” he said.
“This is not only the end of a war … This is the historic dawn of a new Middle East.“
 
 

Trump’s lightning visit to Israel came ahead of a summit in the Egyptian resort town of Sharm El-Sheikh co-chaired by the American president, who has declared the conflict in Gaza “over”. Under the ceasefire deal, Israel is due to release nearly 2,000 Palestinians held in its jails.
Addressing the Israeli parliament, Trump called the agreement that brought about a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the captives held by Hamas a triumph as he thanked mediators from the Arab and Muslim world.
“Let me also convey my tremendous appreciation for all of the nations of the Arab and Muslim world that came together to press Hamas to set the hostages free and to send them home,” Trump said in remarks before the Israeli parliament.
“We had a lot of help, we had a lot of help from a lot of people that you wouldn’t suspect, and I want to thank them very much for that. It’s an incredible triumph for Israel and the world to have all of these nations working together as partners in peace.“
 


The address to the Israeli parliament was briefly interrupted as two Israeli lawmakers were expelled.
Ayman Odeh held a sign that read “Recognise Palestine”, while Ofer Cassif also attempted to raise a sign, leading to their removal, Times of Israel reported.
“That was very efficient,” Trump quipped as the MPs were quickly taken out. The US president had paused as a Knesset staff member audibly ordered the expulsion of Cassif after an apparent protest.
 






Trump hailed an end to a “painful nightmare” after two years of fighting in Gaza during his address.
“From October 7 until this week, Israel has been a nation at war, enduring burdens that only a proud and faithful people could withstand,” he said.
“For so many families across this land, it has been years since you’ve known a single day of true peace … The long and painful nightmare is finally over,” the US president added.
“The forces of chaos that have plagued the region are totally defeated,” he said.
Trump also said he wanted a peace deal with Iran, after the US joined Israel in striking the Islamic republic’s nuclear sites during a brief war earlier this year.
“They got it from one side, from the other, and you know it would be great if we could make a peace deal with them,” Trump said of Iran. “Would you be happy with that? Wouldn’t it be nice, I think. Because I think they want to. “
Trump ‘greatest friend’ Israel has had in White House: Netanyahu
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel could pursue new “peace treaties” with Arab and Muslim countries in the Middle East and beyond.
“Under your leadership, we can forge new peace treaties with Arab countries in the region and Muslim countries beyond the region,” Netanyahu said, adding that “no one wants peace more than the people of Israel”.
He described Trump as the “greatest friend” Israel has ever had in the White House.
“Donald Trump is the greatest friend that the state of Israel has ever had in the White House. No American president has ever done more for Israel,” Netanyahu said in parliament before Trump’s address to lawmakers.
 


Israel has said it does not expect all of the dead hostages to be returned today.
Under the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is also due to return the bodies of the 27 captives who died or were killed in detention, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in 2014 during a previous Gaza conflict.
Among those Israel was due to release in exchange are 250 security detainees, while about 1,700 were detained by the Israeli army in Gaza during the conflict.
‘Nothing looks the same’ in flattened Gaza
In Gaza, too, the ceasefire has brought relief, but with much of the territory flattened by fighting, the road to recovery remains long.
“I returned to Sheikh Radwan with my heart trembling,” 38-year-old Fatima Salem told AFP after she returned to her neighbourhood in Gaza City.
“My eyes kept searching for landmarks I had lost — nothing looked the same, even the neighbours’ houses were gone.
“Despite the exhaustion and fear, I felt like I was coming back to my safe place. I missed the smell of my home, even if it’s now just rubble. We will pitch a tent next to it and wait for reconstruction.”
 


Trump’s visit to the Middle East aims to celebrate his role in brokering last week’s ceasefire and hostage release deal — but comes at a precarious time as Israel and Hamas negotiate what comes next.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One at the start of the “very special” visit, Trump brushed off concerns about whether the ceasefire would endure.
“I think it’s going to hold. I think people are tired of it. It’s been centuries,” he said of the fighting.
“The war is over. Okay? You understand that?” the US president added.
Final details
Trump announced in late September a 20-point plan for Gaza, which helped bring about the ceasefire.
Negotiators were still wrangling late on Sunday over the final arrangements for the exchanges, with two Hamas sources telling AFP the group was insisting that Israel include seven senior Palestinian leaders on the list of those to be released.
Israel has previously rejected at least one of those names.
After visiting Israel, Trump will head to Egypt, where he and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will co-host a summit of world leaders to back his plan to end the Gaza conflict and promote Middle East peace.
While Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas is due at the summit, Netanyahu’s office said the Israeli premier will not attend due to the start of a religious holiday.
In Egypt, Trump will be looking to resolve some of the huge uncertainty around the next phases of the peace plan, including Hamas’s refusal to disarm and Israel’s failure to pledge a full withdrawal from the devastated territory.
Trump insisted he had “guarantees” from both sides and other key regional players about the initial phase of the deal, and the future stages.
A new governing body for devastated Gaza — which Trump himself would head under his own plan — would be established “very quickly”, he added.
Under the plan, as Israel conducts a partial withdrawal from Gaza, it will be replaced by a multi-national force coordinated by a US-led command centre in Israel.
Hamas urged Trump and the mediators of the Gaza deal today to ensure Israel does not resume operations in Gaza.
“We call on all mediators and international parties to continue monitoring Israel’s conduct and to ensure it does not resume its aggression against our people in Gaza,” Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said.
Israel’s campaign in Gaza has killed at least 67,869 people. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands buried under the rubble.</p><small>2025-10-13 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628400-oath-taking-of-kp-cm-elect-should-not-be-delayed-beyond-tomorrow-warns-pti' target='_blank'><strong>Oath-taking of KP CM-elect should not be delayed beyond today, warns PTI</strong></a><br><p>

Spinners dominated on a turning Gaddafi Stadium pitch as all the day’s 11 wickets went to slow bowlers, with South African left-armer Senuran Muthusamy taking a career-best 6-117 to dismiss Pakistan for 378.
Zorzi was holding the fort at the close with 81 not out and Muthusamy on six as South Africa trail by 162 runs in the first innings.
Zorzi batted with guts, knocking nine boundaries and a six, combating Noman, who claimed 4-85.
 


South Africa started off well with 45-0 on the board when Noman removed touring skipper Aiden Markram for 20 and Wiaan Mulder for 17 — both caught behind by wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan.
Ryan Rickelton, who scored a punishing 71 with two sixes and nine boundaries, and Zorzi added 94 for the third wicket, taking on the spinners with some aggressive shots.
It was part-timer Salman Agha who broke the stand by forcing an edge from Rickelton with Babar Azam taking a smart low catch in the slips.
Noman returned for his third spell to get Tristan Stubbs caught behind for eight and Kyle Verreynne leg-before for two while Sajid Khan removed Dewald Brevis for a golden duck.
“We need to get them out as early as possible, and a 120-run lead would help us win this Test,” said Noman.
“This pitch will further help spinners in the coming days, so it’s good for us.”
Earlier, it was Noman’s like-for-like left-armer Muthusamy who destroyed Pakistan after they resumed on 313-5, losing their last five wickets for just 16 runs.
Muthusamy, who bettered his previous Test best of 4-45 against Bangladesh in Chattogram last year, said: “It was really nice to add value to the team by getting wickets.
 
 

“It was not ideal to have lost a wicket close to stumps, but we will fight back tomorrow.”
Agha hit five fours and three sixes in his 93 and was last man out, caught in the deep off spinner Prenelan Subrayen, who took 2-78.
Agha added 49 with Rizwan to take their sixth-wicket stand to 163 before Muthusamy ripped out the middle order with three wickets in the 12th over of the day.
Rizwan was the first to go, for 75, when he edged a sharply turning ball to wicketkeeper Verreynne after a knock containing two fours and two sixes.
Two balls later, Noman went without scoring, bowled when he played down the wrong line, and then Sajid Khan followed first ball, caught in the slips.
It became 378-9 when Muthusamy bowled Shaheen Shah Afridi, on seven, for his sixth wicket.</p><small>2025-10-13 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/13175418635b063.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948667/trio-win-nobel-economics-prize-for-work-on-innovation-growth-and-creative-destruction' target='_blank'><strong>Trio win Nobel economics prize for work on innovation, growth and ‘creative destruction’</strong></a><br><p>Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt won the 2025 Nobel economics prize on Monday for their work on how innovation and the forces of “creative destruction” can drive economic growth and lift living standards across the globe.
Their research explains how technology gives rise to new products and production methods which replace old ones, resulting in a better standard of living, health and quality of life.
“Over the last two centuries, for the first time in history, the world has seen sustained economic growth. This has lifted vast numbers of people out of poverty and laid the foundation of our prosperity,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prize, said in a statement.
Economic growth not guaranteed
The laureates have also shown that such progress cannot be taken for granted, the Academy said, while two of the prize winners highlighted that US President Donald Trump’s trade policies would impinge on growth.
“Economic stagnation, not growth, has been the norm for most of human history. Their work shows that we must be aware of, and counteract, threats to continued growth,” the Academy said.
While most economists view economic growth as a driver of prosperity, there are some who do not see it as an unalloyed good.
The 2024 Economics prize was won by Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson for work on inequality and Johnson in particular has pointed to how the benefits of technological innovation can be skewed toward powerful elites.
There is also a fierce debate about what level of growth is sustainable in light of man-made climate change and environmental degradation.
The prestigious award, formally known as the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, is the final prize to be given out this year and is worth 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2m).
Mokyr, a professor at Northwestern University in the United States, was awarded half the prize.
Aghion, a professor at the College de France and INSEAD in Paris and at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and Howitt, a professor at Brown University in the United States, shared the other half.

Aghion says tariffs are obstacles to growth
The award comes at a potential inflexion point for the global economy with many expecting artificial intelligence to spark a new growth spurt.
It also highlights the strategic risks for Europe of falling further behind the United States and China on technologies of the future as well as the potential costs of barriers to global trade.
Speaking by phone at the press conference, Aghion said de-globalisation and tariff barriers were “obstacles to growth” adding that the bigger the market the more possibilities to exchange ideas, transfer technologies and for healthy competition.
“Anything that gets in the way of openness is an obstacle to growth. So I see there kind of dark clouds currently accumulating, pushing for barriers to trade and openness,” he said.
Aghion called on Europe to learn from the US and China, which he said have found ways to reconcile competition and industrial policy.
“In Europe, in the name of competition policy, we became very anti any form of industrial policy. I think we need to evolve on that and find ways to reconcile industrial policy in areas like defense, climate, AI, biotech,” he said.

Howitt questions returning manufacturing jobs to US
Howitt, who said he had been “absolutely stunned” by the award, was also critical of President Trump’s trade policies.
“It’s pretty clear that these are going to discourage innovation by reducing what we call the scale effect, he told Reuters. “Starting a tariff war just reduces the size of the market for everybody.”
He said that trying to bring manufacturing jobs back to the US could perhaps make some political sense but was not good economic policy.
“We’re good at designing running shoes, but it’s best for us to leave others to make them,” he said.

Previous winners include Krugman and Friedman
The awards for medicine, physics, chemistry, peace and literature were announced last week.
Those prizes were established in the will of Swedish dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel and have been handed out since 1901, with a few interruptions mostly due to the world wars.
The Economics prize was established much later, being given out first in 1969 when it was won by Norway’s Ragnar Frisch and Jan Tinbergen from the Netherlands for work in dynamic economic modelling.
Tinbergen’s brother Nikolaas also won a prize, taking home Medicine in 1973.
While few economists are household names, relatively well-known winners include former US Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, and Paul Krugman and Milton Friedman.</p><small>2025-10-13 13:18</small></div><hr>
