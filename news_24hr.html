Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu this month.
Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com: “A terrorist group was attempting to plant an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Nurar area.”
Upon receiving timely information, police and security forces took immediate action and surrounded the area, he added.
During the action, the police targeted the terrorists through drones and thwarted their plans.
“According to initial reports, the terrorists were killed while attempting to plant the IED,” the police official added.
“Bannu police are fully alert and ready to deal with any kind of threat, and all resources are being utilised to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the public,” DPO Kulachi said.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel and security forces. In response, the state has also intensified its counterterrorism operations.
Last week, in a series of assaults in KP, a police official was martyred in Karak district while police thwarted a separate late-night terrorist assault on a police station in the Basyakhel area of Bannu, officials said.
Also last week, a Frontier Corps constable was killed and two others were injured when terrorists attacked their vehicle in the Daryoba area of Bannu district, according to the police.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616165-india-launches-op-mahadev-to-mask-failures-in-recent-conflict-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>India launches 'Op Mahadev' to mask failures in recent conflict with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and the Kyrgyz Republic share longstanding relations, founded on deep-rooted cultural, historical and spiritual affinities. However, the bilateral trade volume has declined significantly, from $11.2m in 2022-23 to $5.18m in 2024-25.
Addressing the fifth session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade-Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation, Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari said: “We acknowledge the pressing need to revitalise our trade engagement and reaffirm our shared aspiration to elevate bilateral trade up to $100m.”
He added that Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan’s trade and economic relations would continue to serve as a foundation of their bilateral partnership.
Kyrgyzstan’s Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Edil Baisalov was present at the session, along with delegates from the Kyrgyz Republic and Pakistan.
Leghari extended appreciation to the Kyrgyz delegates for their continued engagement and commitment to a “prosperous and interconnected future for the two nations”, noting the progress made across various sectors since the formalisation of their economic relationship in 1994.
“This session marks yet another important milestone in our collective journey of strengthening and institutionalising our bilateral partnership,” he said.
 
 

“Under the framework of this commission, our cooperation has steadily expanded across a broad spectrum — ranging from trade and investment to tourism, agriculture, energy, science and technology and education.
“It is heartening to witness the growing momentum, despite the challenges that continue to affect global and regional economic landscapes,” the minister added.
He highlighted the need for consistent and collaborative efforts between the two countries across multiple sectors to achieve their goals.
“The revival of the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Joint Business Council, sustained business-to-business (B2B) interactions, and the early finalisation of a key Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on electronic data interchange between customs authorities, are essential steps forward,” he said.
Leghari took positive note of the inaugural meeting of the Joint Working Group on Trade and Investment, saying that the two parties were now looking ahead to expediting progress on the Pakistan-Kyrgyz Transit Trade Agreement, a key initiative aimed at “enhancing regional connectivity and facilitating seamless cross-border trade”.
He added that the signing of an MoU and cooperation in halal trade were a step towards achieving shared goals.
Leghari stated that investment remained a key area of priority and potential for both countries, drawing attention to the signing of the MoU between the National Investments Agency of Kyrgyzstan and the Board of Investment of Pakistan.
He said that the agreement provided a “solid foundation for targeted engagement” in high-potential sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, minerals, tourism, and information technology.
He appreciated Kyrgyzstan’s offer of access to the At-Bashi Logistics Centre for Pakistan’s National Logistics Corporation (NLC), saying that it stood “as a commendable example of enterprise-level cooperation, and one that we also hope to replicate across other domains”.
To foster broader private sector participation, he encouraged both sides to enhance the online visibility of investment opportunities by providing comprehensive and up-to-date information on Special Economic Zones, tax incentives, and priority sectors.
Leghari said that tourism and cultural exchange served as “powerful conduits” for deepening people-to-people connectivity.
“Both Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan, endowed with stunning natural landscapes and rich cultural heritage, stand to gain significantly from closer collaboration in this domain,” he said.
“We look forward to finalising the MoU on tourism, hospitality, and investment, and to expanding the exchange of tour operators and tourism-related information, including active participation in international exhibitions.”
He called the signing of an MoU on cooperation in the field of agriculture a “pivotal step” towards promoting trade in Kyrgyz legumes and the export of Pakistan’s basmati rice, among other value-added food products.
“Enhanced collaboration on veterinary and phytosanitary controls will further facilitate safe and efficient food trade,” he added.
 
 

The minister noted both Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan shared a vision of green and sustainable development, adding that they were aligned on exploring Pakistan’s participation in the proposed 500-kilovolt Torugart–XUAR–Gilgit-Baltistan transmission line, which would establish a strategic Kyrgyzstan–China–Pakistan electricity grid.
He also welcomed Kyrgyz interest in investing in Pakistan’s mining sector, particularly in copper and gold exploration.
The minister stressed that strengthening transport and communication infrastructure remained “critical for the realisation of our economic potential”.
“We anticipate progress on the postal cooperation agreement, operationalisation of cargo under the 1995 International Motor Transportation Agreement, and improvements in e-commerce connectivity,” he said, adding that he was encouraged by discussions on expanding air and rail links, including flight frequency increases.
He called attention to the financial sector, saying that it served as a vital engine for economic growth.
“We appreciate the mutual interest in enhancing inter-bank and financial cooperation, particularly in Islamic banking and financial innovation,” he said.
He also praised the recent agreement between the State Bank of Pakistan and the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic for joint training programmes, calling it “a constructive step toward deepening institutional collaboration”.
He added that the health sector also offered significant and strategic opportunities for advancing bilateral cooperation, saying, “We remain optimistic about the early finalisation of the MoU on higher medical education.”
The minister commended Kyrgyzpharmacia for its engagement with Pakistani pharmaceutical firms, particularly in exploring the supply of Pakistani pharmaceutical products to the Kyrgyz Republic and potential joint ventures in vaccine production in collaboration with the National Institute of Health.
He further underscored the importance of regulatory alignment and the need to streamline the registration process for Pakistani medicines in Kyrgyzstan, saying that they would help ensure timely access and promote greater commercial collaboration in the health sector.
“The cultural sector serves as a vital bridge, fostering mutual understanding and enriching the shared heritage between our nations. It is essential that we translate these affinities into formal institutional mechanisms.”
Leghari asserted that the finalisation of the Agreement on Culture and the organisation of joint cultural events would “significantly deepen” connections.
He also highlighted youth engagement as a “dynamic platform for cultivating future leaders and strengthening the bonds of friendship” between the countries, saying that younger generations could be empowered to advance the partnership via conferences, seminars on youth policy issues, and “the exchange of experiences”.
“Education forms the cornerstone of our partnership, serving as a catalyst for knowledge exchange and capacity building to advance sustainable development,” the minister said. “Our efforts remain focused on collaboration in STEM training, academic exchanges, and joint research initiatives.”
Leghari reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Kyrgyz students through the Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme (PTAP), encouraging the strengthening of institutional partnerships between the two countries’ universities.
The minister said in his concluding remarks that the commission’s fifth session offered a renewed opportunity to “transform (the countries’) shared vision into enduring outcomes”.
“Let us reaffirm our commitment to fostering a stronger, integrated, and resilient partnership, anchored in mutual respect, cooperation, and regional peace,” he said.
Alongside bilateral relations, Pakistan and Kyrgyzstan are both members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisa­tion, a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose other members include China, Russia, India, and Iran.
Over the past week, Pakistan has made efforts to expand defence cooperation with other nations. Saudi Arabia’s naval chief met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza in Rawalpindi last Thursday, while Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir met with Chinese senior political and military leadership in Beijing on Friday.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/28135856a0c340d.jpg?r=140050' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927139/babusar-highway-partially-reopened-as-search-operations-continue-in-gb' target='_blank'><strong>Babusar Highway partially reopened as search operations continue in GB</strong></a><br><p>The Babusar Highway was partially reopened on Monday as the search for missing people continued after heavy rains last week prompted flash floods in Gilgit-Baltistan.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
On July 21, floods swept across GB, causing landslides and leaving many stranded, and damaging more than 500 houses, roads and other infrastructure. At least 10 people died and four were injured as a result.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said: “The Babusar-Naran Highway has been reopened for one-way traffic.”
He noted that heavy machinery was used to reopen it, while work for complete restoration was underway. He also advised passengers to be cautious and avoid unnecessary travel.
Faraq further said, “Several families, including five members of a TV anchor’s family, have contacted the government about the missing people and appealed for help in the search.”
The wallet of the TV anchor Shabana Liaquat was found among the flood debris, which also included her and her child’s student cards, he added.
“The provincial government has enlisted the help of Pakistan Army sniffer dogs to search for those buried under the rubble,” the spokesperson said.
Separately, the National Highway Authority (NHA) initiated swift road restoration operations in northern areas after orders by Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan, APP reported.
 
 

Aleem said that key highways, including the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad (N-15) and Skardu-Jaglot Road, were blocked due to landslides and cloudburst. “NHA teams have cleared multiple obstruction points, ensuring partial restoration of traffic and improved accessibility for travellers,” he said.
The minister described the 242-kilometre-long N-15 as a “critical route for tourism and regional connectivity”, which was blocked at various locations.
According to officials, landslides along the route were successfully cleared, while restoration work from Naran to Babusar Top and Chilas was ongoing, he added.
Communication Secretary Ali Sher Mehsud and NHA chairman were present on-site to oversee the restoration activities, the report said.
“We are committed to restoring all major highways at the earliest,” Mehsud said, adding that travel towards Kaghan and Naran had resumed.
NHA managed to clear 20 out of 25 landslide-affected points on the Skardu-Jaglot Road.
“To maintain pace, NHA has placed all field officers on 24-hour alert, cancelled staff leave and activated its emergency response plan across Gilgit-Baltistan. Heavy machinery remains operational across the region to tackle any further disruptions,” the report added.
NDMA issues alert for rains
Separately, the National Disaster Management Authority issued an alert for the northern areas of the country, predicting rainfall from July 28 to 31 and warning about risks of urban flooding, glacial surges and landslides, APP reported.
It advised citizens to avoid travelling to vulnerable areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.
 


According to the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC), rain was expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar areas of GB, as well as in Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh in Azad Jammu and Kashmir during the forecast period.
“These rains may lead to flooding, while heavy showers in hilly regions may also trigger landslides,” it stated.
In Chitral Valley, Buni and Reshun areas, rainfall combined with melting glaciers may raise the water flow of River Chitral, according to NEOC. “Urban flooding is also likely in Muzaffarabad and Bagh due to heavy downpours,” it added.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/281506239baacf9.png?r=151027' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927149/kp-govt-says-cm-in-contact-with-administration-over-tirah-shooting' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt says CM ‘in contact’ with administration over Tirah shooting</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Monday said Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur was “in contact” with the relevant administration over the incident of protesters being shot in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley.
Seven people were shot on Sunday after a demonstration outside the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz against the death of a minor girl in a mortar strike in Tirah’s Zakhakhel.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to sources and protesters, security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.
Besides the seven killed, at least 16 others also received bullet injuries, sources said. There has been no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or Sunday’s killings.
“The chief minister is in constant contact with the relevant administration,” CM Gandapur’s public relations adviser, Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, said in a statement today.
He said the KP chief minister was “monitoring” the Tirah incident himself. “The KP government is extremely saddened over the incident,” Saif added.
“The provincial government is standing side by side with the affected families in this moment of sorrow and grief,” the official asserted.
 






Saif also again slammed the KP opposition parties for not attending a multi-party conference (MPC) held last week over the security situation in the province, stressing that the moot had been organised “to prevent such incidents”.
The statement recalled that the provincial government will be holding a series of jirgas with tribal elders next week, including one in Peshawar. This is also based on the MPC’s decision to convene a jirga comprising elders, parliamentarians and stakeholders from each district.
According to CM Gandapur, a grand jirga, whose members will be nominated by the first jirga, would be organised 15 days after that to devise a strategy to implement the MPC’s declaration.
Protest and shooting
On Sunday, hundreds of tribesmen had brought the body of a girl, who they claimed was killed in a mortar strike in the Darbar locality of Peer Mela in Zakhakhel a day earlier, to the Brigade Headquarters.
 
 

Sources and eye-witnesses said the situation turned violent when an angry mob, comprising mostly young men, ignored calls by local elders to remain calm.
They first torched an excavator parked outside Brigade Headquarters, then tried to force open its main gate, following which security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly opened fire to control the crowd, according to sources.
However, in a statement from his office, PM Shehbaz said TTP terrorists were behind the incident as he expressed his grief over the “martyrdom of innocent and peaceful civilians”. The statement, carried by state-run Radio Pakistan and APP, did not mention any protest.
He directed the authorities to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured.
“The nefarious designs of terrorists cannot shake our resolve,” the premier asserted, reaffirming the government’s commitment to eliminate terrorists and terrorism.
 






Videos circulating on social media showed an excavator on fire. Some protesters were also seen pelting stones at the Brigade Headquarters while trying to forcibly open the main gate. In the footage, protesters could be seen running for cover as gunshots rang out.
The injured were transported to the Frontier Corps Hospital in Shah Kas Jamrud, Dogra Hospital in Bara and Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar. One of the injured is said to be in critical condition.
Following the incident, security officials met with a delegation of Tirah elders at Brigade Headquarters and announced compensation for the victims on their demand. The KP government has also announced separate Rs10 million for the deceased and Rs2.5m for the injured.
Security officials said the local sector commander met with the Tirah elders and assured them of his full support in meeting their legitimate demands.
PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi from NA-27 Khyber and MPA Abdul Ghani, while backing the protesters’ stance, have demanded a transparent judicial enquiry into the incident. The lawmakers and their supporters also held a protest at Bab-i-Khyber in Jamrud yesterday against the shooting incident.
 






Residents in Peer Mela have claimed that mortar shelling by security forces has so far killed at least three persons over the last 10 days. They claimed that mortars were being fired as security forces conducted operations against armed militant groups in Zakhakhel, Shalobar, Adakhel and Malakdin Khel localities.
While a report on the mortar strike that was being protested could not be found, similar incidents in the Zakhakhel area took place in April this year and December 2024, killing a child in each.
Recently, two children were killed on July 22 in a mortar shell blast in Raghzai village of the Tank district, Rescue 1122 said.
 
 

Tribal elders in Tirah and some other KP districts have long opposed any military operation, citing concerns over displacement.
Earlier this month, a massive rally of peace campaigners from Tirah Valley and Bara tehsil of the Khyber tribal district opposed an imminent military operation in Tirah. Tribal elders have also ardently criticised terrorist groups, recently deciding not to pay them any ushr (tax).</p><small>2025-07-28 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2814471205dc4e1.jpg?r=144719' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927147/unidentified-bodies-of-man-woman-recovered-from-karachis-china-port-police' target='_blank'><strong>Unidentified bodies of man, woman recovered from Karachi’s China Port: police</strong></a><br><p>The unidentified bodies of a man and a woman were recovered from Karachi’s China Port area on Monday, police said.
The deceased remain unidentified, but their age was estimated to be between 25 and 30 years old, according to South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza.
“There are bullet marks on the body,” he said, adding that two 9mm shells were also recovered from the site of the incident.
“Evidence is being collected from the crime scene,” the DIG said. “The identification of the deceased and further investigation are underway.”
Situated near Clifton beach, China Port, also known as Oyster Rocks or the South Asia Pakistan Terminal (SAPT) breakwater, is a man-made structure built by China to protect the port from waves. It’s a popular spot for locals, offering views of the port, cargo ships, and cranes.
Last month, a partially decomposed body of a young man was found in a desolate area in Karachi’s Scheme 33.
Sachal Station House Officer Aurangzeb Khattak had said the body of the man, who appeared to be in his mid-20s, was recovered from bushes outside the wall of Karachi University’s Teachers Society near the Superhighway.
The body bore marks of torture, he said, adding that the victim had sustained head injuries. The officer hinted at the possibility that the body might have been thrown there by suspects travelling in a car. The corpse was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital but his identity could not be ascertained immediately.
In February, the body of a trader, who was allegedly kidnapped, was found at Seaview.
Last year, the bodies of a man and a woman were recovered from a pond inside the sprawling Bagh Ibne Qasim in Clifton on the second day of Eidul Azha. According to the police, the victims were aged between 28 and 30, and it appeared that they had drowned around two days prior.</p><small>2025-07-28 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616150-bullet-ridden-bodies-of-man-woman-found-near-karachis-china-port' target='_blank'><strong>Bullet-ridden bodies of man, woman found near Karachi's China Port</strong></a><br><p>

The fatalities include the gunman who took his own life, Charin Gopatta, Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Bureau, told Reuters.
“Police are investigating the identity of the person and the motive for the incident,” Thai police said in a statement. The five people killed by the gunman were security guards at the market, it said.
No tourists were killed or injured in the shooting incident, said Sanong Saengmani, a police official in Bangkok’s Bang Sue district, where the market that mainly sells agricultural produce is located.
Tourism is a key economic driver in Thailand, Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, where growth has been sluggish and such incidents can potentially dampen sentiment.
In video footage shared by police, a suspect in a white hat and a backpack slung on his chest is seen walking through a parking lot at the market.
Gun violence and gun ownership are not uncommon in Thailand. In October 2023, a 14-year-old suspect used a modified handgun to kill two people and injure five others at a luxury mall in central Bangkok.
In 2022, a former police officer killed 36 people, including 22 children, in a gun-and-knife attack at a nursery in eastern Thailand.</p><small>2025-07-28 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616151-body-of-rawalpindi-honour-killing-victim-exhumed-post-mortem-completed' target='_blank'><strong>Body of Rawalpindi 'honour killing' victim exhumed, post-mortem completed</strong></a><br><p>

The ADB is a key lender for Pakistan, with vital financing programmes underway, along with assisting in digital overhaul and climate policy plans.
As director general, Gutierrez will deliver ADB’s strategic agenda in the Central and West Asia region, which includes Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkiye, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
Her appointment takes effect today, read a statement by ADB.
“I am honoured to serve in this position and will continue to engage with developing member countries and stakeholders to promote inclusive growth, regional cooperation, and sustainable development across the region,” Gutierrez was quoted as saying.
 






Gutierrez has over four decades of professional experience, including 25 years at ADB, the statement noted.
“Prior to her appointment, Gutierrez was the director general for ADB’s Sectors Department 3, where she managed operations for finance, human and social development, and public sector management and governance.
“She is also a former director general of the Pacific Department. She has held senior positions in ADB’s Strategy, Policy, and Partnerships Department; Southeast Asia Department; and Office of the Secretary,” the statement said.
Last October, the ADB appointed Xiaoqin Fan as the new country director.
In June, Pakistan signed $1 billion financing for a five-year multi-tranche facility with the ADB. The same month, the bank approved an $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan.</p><small>2025-07-28 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/281246373bf9832.jpg?r=124651' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913435/water-scarcity-in-pakistan-a-geopolitical-ticking-time-bomb' target='_blank'><strong>Water scarcity in Pakistan — a geopolitical ticking time bomb</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is currently grappling with severe urban flooding triggered by erratic and intensified rainfall events — a clear manifestation of climate change. In 2024 and 2025, the country’s major cities have been lashed by record-breaking downpours, overwhelming fragile drainage systems and displacing thousands. The latest wave of flooding in 2025 has already claimed the lives of at least 242 people, with more fatalities feared as fresh storms loom.
These floods, while destructive, highlight a squandered opportunity — the inability to store excess water. Limited dam storage and poor urban watershed management result in the loss of floodwaters as runoff, rather than their storage for dry spells.
Climate scientists have repeatedly warned about extreme weather volatility, with floods and droughts alternating as the new normal for South Asia. Without resilient water storage infrastructure and rainwater harvesting, both urban and rural areas in Pakistan will remain trapped in a cycle of water excess followed by water scarcity.
A strategic and economic threat
By various measures of water availability, from the Falkenmark index — an indicator used to measure water scarcity — to the water poverty index, Pakistan currently stands as the 15th most water-stressed nation in the world.
 
 

Per the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Pakistan is predicted to slip into absolute water scarcity by 2035 — a frightening prospect for the world’s fifth most populous country. According to the World Wildlife Fund-Pakistan (WWF-P), the country’s annual per capita water availability has plummeted from about 5,600 cubic meters in 1947 to just 930 cubic meters in 2023 — dangerously below the level conventionally defined as water scarcity. According to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, Pakistan’s water stress is among the highest globally, underscoring that securing the resource is now a matter of national survival.
Put simply: we are hurtling toward an inevitable crisis of catastrophic proportions.
Water woes and climate change go hand in hand
Adding to Pakistan’s water crisis is the relentless pressure of climate change. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, although Pakistan contributes only a fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, it ranks among the top 10 countries most impacted by climate change. The country has faced unprecedented heatwaves in recent years — extreme temperatures that have caused water reservoirs and dams to lose up to 20 per cent of their capacity through evaporation.
Meanwhile, global warming has accelerated the melting of glaciers in the Hindu Kush–Himalayan region, which supplies over 75pc of the Indus River’s flow. These trends threaten to destabilise the timing and volume of river waters that Pakistan has relied upon for millennia. Looking ahead, the World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal (CCKP) stated that Pakistan’s average temperature is projected to rise by 4.9°C by 2090, foretelling even greater hydrological volatility. Erratic monsoon rains and a vicious cycle of drought followed by flood have already become the new normal.
The human and economic toll of this volatility is mounting. Rainfall patterns across the country have grown increasingly unpredictable, And when it rains, it often unleashes devastating downpours. The catastrophic floods of 2022 are a case in point: nearly one-third of the country was submerged, causing almost $30 billion in economic losses and 1,765 fatalities.
Such climate-exacerbated disasters devastate infrastructure, displace millions, and directly undermine water infrastructure by silting up dams and contaminating freshwater supplies. In essence, climate change is amplifying Pakistan’s water stress, making dry seasons drier and wet seasons wetter — a recipe for sustained crisis.
Indus Waters Treaty under strain
Water scarcity in Pakistan is not just a domestic issue but a regional geopolitical flashpoint. The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, a model of water sharing between Pakistan and India, is now facing a severe threat.
 
 

The treaty gave Pakistan exclusive rights to the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers (the western rivers of the Indus basin), which together provide over 80pc of Pakistan’s irrigation water and around one-third of its electricity generation capacity. For decades, this arrangement maintained a fragile peace over water. However, today a combination of factors — ranging from climbing demand and geopolitical tensions to climate-induced flow variability — are testing the limits of the treaty.
A study in 2021 stated that there are signs of declining flows in the western rivers, a trend some attribute to changing weather patterns and upstream diversions. Pakistan has repeatedly raised concerns over India’s construction of large upstream hydropower projects like Kishanganga and Ratle, fearing they could eventually diminish downstream flows. These concerns have even been taken to the World Bank indicating how contentious the issue has become.
Tensions spiked further in early 2025, when India announced to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam in Indian occupied Kashmir. India, without presenting evidence or conducting a thorough investigation, hastily placed blame on Pakistan — following its repeated pattern of blame and making this a poor pretext to suspend the treaty. This unprecedented declaration sent shockwaves through Pakistan.
The New York Times reported that if India were to unilaterally withhold or redirect waters, Pakistan’s farming heartlands in Punjab and Sindh could face up to a 35pc reduction in water availability in critical growing seasons. Such a scenario is nothing short of a nightmare for a country whose economy and food supply are so deeply tied to these rivers.
Fortunately, immediate disruption is constrained by geography and infrastructure — during the summer monsoon, the Indus system carries huge flows that India currently lacks the capacity to fully capture or store. Nevertheless, the risk is very real in drier months: India could manipulate flows, potentially causing drought-like conditions or conversely releasing water without warning to create flash floods downstream.
Pakistan’s vulnerability is compounded by its own limited storage capacity. The country can only store about 30 days’ worth of water, far below the 120-day international benchmark for water security. With this limited capacity, Pakistan cannot effectively bank surplus rainwater or glacial melt for lean times. This precarious situation makes Pakistan highly exposed to any upstream disruptions and to any extreme weather event.
Food security under threat
With a heavily water-dependent agricultural sector, the implications of dwindling water supplies for food production are both immediate and severe.
A study reported that approximately three-quarters of the freshwater is consumed by just four crops: wheat, sugarcane, cotton, and rice. The policies favoring these corps over the decades, have made farmers gradually shifting away from traditional, more drought-tolerant crops like millet and barley to these cash crops. This unsustainable cropping pattern is further straining groundwater and river systems. These cash crops are already experiencing the impact. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) stated in a report that in recent years, cotton production plummeted by about 41pc, largely due to flood damage and waterlogging, which in turn dealt a blow to the textile industry and rural employment.
 
 

Wheat yields have increased slightly, but its growth rate (under 2.5pc per year) lags behind the global average, partly because water shortages and erratic weather have hampered productivity. The 2022 floods alone destroyed 2.4 million hectares of cropland, wiping out food stocks and farmers’ livelihoods overnight.
In light of these challenges, the SBP recorded a slowdown in agricultural growth, attributing it to climate stress and water scarcity undermining the output of key crops. With agriculture still employing a large share of Pakistan’s workforce and feeding its population, such water-driven shocks propagate a broader economic crisis. The sustained water stress could ignite a vicious cycle: poor harvests, rising food prices, rural unemployment, and ultimately threats to economic and social stability.
Policy gaps and the way forward
Given the gravity of the situation, one would expect a swift and robust policy response. Unfortunately, meaningful actions have been hindered by slow policy response and poor execution. The National Water Policy of 2018 and infrastructure projects like the Diamer-Bhasha dam were deemed as long-term solutions to Pakistan’s water stress. While these initiatives were steps in the right direction, progress on them has been painfully slow.
The key challenges in addressing are funding issues, bureaucratic red tape, and inter-provincial mistrust over water sharing. In addition to that, politically tough but crucial measures — such as installing water meters to curb waste, regulating groundwater extraction, and incentivising crop diversification — remain largely sidelined.
Breaking out of this paralysis requires both institutional reform and international diplomacy. On the diplomatic front, Pakistan must take a proactive role in engaging India — and, where necessary, involve mediators like the World Bank or other international partners — to adapt and reinforce the Indus Waters Treaty.
Multilateral forums could help update the treaty’s frameworks, incorporating climate adaptation (such as data sharing on glacial melt and monsoon forecasts) so that the spirit of equitable water sharing endures despite new pressures.
Moreover, the government urgently needs to enforce water-use regulations — for instance, by rigorously metering large consumers and clamping down on illegal wells — to prevent wasteful usage. Investing in modern irrigation techniques is equally important: moving from traditional flood irrigation to drip irrigation and other water-saving technologies can dramatically reduce agricultural water consumption.
 
 

Likewise, incentivising rainwater harvesting and watershed rehabilitation would help capture rainfall and recharge aquifers rather than letting precious water simply flow out to sea. Expanding the country’s water storage capacity (through both large dams and small local reservoirs) is crucial to buffer against seasonal variability; Pakistan cannot afford to remain a country that runs on a month’s worth of water.
Finally, farmers should be encouraged to diversify crops and adopt climate-smart agriculture — for example, by shifting incentives and support toward less water-intensive grains and developing varieties that can withstand droughts or floods. These adaptations in farming practices will be key to aligning the country’s agricultural demands with its water reality.
Pakistan’s water scarcity truly is a ticking time bomb, but it is not one without a defuse mechanism. What is needed is the political will to act before it’s too late. Delaying the policy action narrows the options and multiplies the economic and environmental costs. Adopting multi-faced solutions through the combination of institutional reforms at home and effective diplomacy abroad, we can begin to secure our water future. The challenge is immense, but the cost of inaction would be far greater.
Ensuring water security is not just about avoiding droughts or floods; it is about safeguarding Pakistan’s very viability as a stable and prosperous nation.

Over 50 live donkeys were also confiscated during a raid on the premises and a foreign national was taken into custody on the spot.
According to a spokesperson for the Islamabad district administration, an FIR has been registered against the foreign national following the recovery.
Authorities believe the meat was being prepared for supply to foreign restaurants and individuals.
“We are investigating where the donkey meat was being delivered. Local accomplices involved in the supply chain are also being traced. The case is being pursued from multiple angles,” the spokesperson said.

Islamabad Food Authority orders cases against all suspects to dismantle network

The raid was carried out by a team led by IFA Deputy Director Dr Tahira Siddique. The arrested individual was handed over to police for further investigation.
Dr Siddique directed the police to register cases against all parties involved and to dismantle the entire network.
She also ordered the confiscated meat to be destroyed, adding investigators were working to identify the end recipients of the supply.
Sources within the food authority, however, said that initial findings had suggested the meat was intended for foreigners. They noted that the packaging found on-site was sophisticated, indicating it may have been prepared for export or high-end distribution.
The sophisticated packaging shows that it was intended to be exported or supplied to some foreigners in the federal capital. As there were over 50 alive donkeys so it is out of question that they were selling the meat of donkeys who occasionally die, they said.
They said that, according to initial investigation, the business was being run by a foreigner living in the area for a long time. However, they said the farmhouse was not registered for such an activity.
Meat sellers hail action
In response to the incident, the Jamiatul Quresh Meat Welfare Association praised the swift action by the IFA and renewed its longstanding demand for the establishment of a regulated slaughterhouse in the capital.
During a meeting held in Aabpara Market, chaired by Association President Khursheed Ahmed Qureshi and attended by other members, including Javed Qureshi, Sardar Zaheer Ahmed, Zahid Masood Khan, and Iqbal Qureshi, the group said the absence of a government-managed slaughterhouse had allowed such illegal operations to thrive.
They urged President Asif Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to take immediate notice of the matter and ensure preventive measures are in place.
The association called for the immediate establishment of a slaughterhouse in I-11/4, emphasising that doing so would help stop the sale of unregulated and unhygienic meat. They also demanded strict legal action against all individuals involved in illegal meat trade.

ROUGHLY 44,000-45,000 used cars were imported in FY25, according to a Japanese car assembler and a brokerage house. However, importers and dealers of vehicles offer a different view.
According to Top Line Securities, the management of Honda Atlas Cars Limited (HACL) informed in a corporate briefing held in mid-July that around 45,000 “used cars” have been imported over the last 12 months, with the majority being 1,000cc or below.
Honda management believes that “tariff rationalisation and rising used car imports are unlikely to impact the company as these primarily benefit vehicles below 1,000cc, which make up 90pc of total imports.”
HACL said that further clarity on the implementation of the new used car import policy is expected from the government by September 2025, particularly regarding the duty structure, vehicle safety and emissions standards, and the phased relaxation of age limits.
Myesha Sohail of Top Line Securities, prior to HACL’s corporate briefing, had disclosed imports of 44,000 units in FY25, up by two per cent than FY24. She expects imports to increase by over 40pc in FY26 to 62,000 units, following the government’s opening of commercial imports from September 2025.
As in the past, these used car imports will be largely concentrated in small-end vehicles, affecting the product lineup of Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL) significantly. Sedan car imports may become feasible once the additional duty is reduced to 20pc in FY28 from the current 40pc.

High demand for local cars pushed up imports of semi- and completely knocked-down kits to $1.1bn in FY25, compared to $779m in FY24, a 41.5pc increase

However, she said that importers claim that allowing commercial imports would not affect any lineup, as the process has become very stringent with higher additional duties.
 
 

According to data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the import of completely built-up units (CBU) comprising old and new cars inched up 3.44% in FY25 to $278 million from $269m in FY24. The auto segment remained robust as sales of locally assembled cars, pickups, vans, and SUVs swelled to 148,023 units, up 43pc year-over-year (YoY).
The overall sale of used cars and locally assembled cars, SUVs, pickups and vans crossed 200,000 units in FY25, thus nullifying the impression that used cars have been hitting hard the sales of local assemblers.
High demand for cars also pushed up the arrival of semi and completely knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits by the local car assemblers to $1.1 billion in FY25 compared to $779m in FY24, up by 41.5pc, which also signals brisk demand for cars in the coming months.
Patron-in-Chief, All Pakistan Car Dealers and Importers Association (APDA), Mian Shoaib Ahmed, while quoting customs figures, said that 38,761 units of used vehicles were imported during FY25 under transfer of residence, gift scheme and personal baggage as compared to 36,458 in FY24.
He said demand for both used and new cars has been showing a positive trend, thanks to the downward trend in interest rates, the introduction of new and facelift variants, easing inflation, and improving consumer sentiment. Soaring prices of locally assembled vehicles will continue to shift more buyers towards used cars, he said.
To review a roadmap for used car imports after the Budget FY26, the association held a meeting with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal Khan, and discussed their policy recommendations for the upcoming framework on the regulated import of used vehicles, set to take effect from September 2025.
 
 

He said the association supports the government’s initiative to allow the commercial import of used vehicles, bringing healthy competition to the automobile market and benefiting the end user. The delegation presented proposals focusing on environmental and road safety compliance, including pre-shipment inspections to ensure emissions and structural standards, as well as transparent valuation mechanisms for imported vehicles.
Recommendations were also shared on foreign exchange arrangements and revisions to the existing depreciation framework to align with market realities. During the discussion, it was highlighted that taxes and tariffs for the coming year would require careful consideration.
To ensure that all used vehicle imports meet appropriate safety, environmental, and consumer protection benchmarks, a clear and enforceable regulatory framework must be established without delay.
Mr Ahmed said mandatory pre-shipment inspection (PSI) must verify the minimum emissions standard of Euro 3 or equivalent roadworthiness. At the same time, vehicles must be certified to remain roadworthy for a minimum of 10 years. Odometer Integrity must be verified and untampered, while battery health must be 70pc or higher.
 
 

There is a need to confirm that the vehicle is not stolen or under any encumbrance. The inspection agency must independently verify and certify the actual manufacturing date of the vehicle, not just its first registration date. The inspection agency must maintain offices both in the country of export and in Pakistan, enabling cross-verification.
It is important that the policy framework includes a clear and flexible foreign exchange mechanism to ensure smooth and practical implementation, he said.

This gap enables exploitation, misalignment of skills and jobs, and declining productivity.
A closer look at Pakistan’s employment scene reveals some stark patterns. About 72 per cent of the workforce (85.18 million) is engaged in the informal economy — underpaid, insecure, and vulnerable to exploitation with little legal protection or bargaining power in a labour-surplus market.
These workers are often the first to face layoffs and salary cuts during cost-cutting. Even among registered firms, there is reluctance to disclose wage bill data. Estimates suggest that wages account for less than 10pc of total operational costs of enterprises in Pakistan, roughly half of the global average, highlighting a structural undervaluation of workers.
Data from multiple sources, corroborated by senior officials, indicates that about 9pc of Pakistan’s workforce is employed in the public sector — federal and provincial governments, including civil servants, office staff, teachers, doctors, and staff in state-owned enterprises.
 
 

A similar percentage (around 9pc) works in top-tier formal private companies such as multinationals, tech companies, banks, and export-orientated businesses. Another 10pc are employed by structured but lower-paying firms in the formal sector; the remaining 72pc work in the informal sector, typically in low-paid, insecure jobs with no benefits or legal protection.
This suggests that only about 18pc of the workforce, or roughly 15.3m people, employed in the public sector or elite companies receive decent compensation. The remaining 70m employees are likely underpaid and struggling in harsh and hostile conditions.
The fast-growing, innovation- and competition-driven gig economy now leads all sectors in performance-based earnings. It is followed by elite companies, including banks, top exporters, and multinationals, which offer structured compensation linked to output and results.

The compensation landscape is evolving steadily, but progress is constrained by fragmented data collection, limited digital infrastructure, and weak regulatory enforcement

In contrast, lower-tier public sector employees (Grade 1-16), who make up over 75pc of government staff, enjoy better pay, job security, and post-retirement benefits than their private sector counterparts, despite no correlation with performance.
This advantage disappears at the top. In executive roles, private sector leaders earn significantly more than senior civil servants (Grade 20-22), with generous salaries, bonuses, and perks. Although promotions to top government grades are theoretically performance-based, the system is widely viewed as compromised by nepotism and weak accountability, undermining meritocracy.
When informed about the troubling state of Pakistan’s employment landscape, Federal Labour Minister Chaudhry Salik Hussain, currently on an official visit abroad, responded promptly, expressing concern.
“Pakistan’s compensation landscape is evolving steadily, shaped by inflationary pressures, labour rights advocacy, and global employment trends,” he stated. “However, progress is constrained by fragmented data collection across provinces, limited digital infrastructure, and weak regulatory enforcement, challenges that hinder systematic analysis and policy reform.”
Mr Hussain further emphasised that provincial directorates of labour play a key role in ensuring compliance with labour standards, including wage payments, working hours, overtime, and bonuses, leave entitlements, and occupational safety. “Expanding universal coverage through the Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution for pensioner benefits and provincial social security systems for medical coverage could significantly accelerate reform and build a fairer, more equitable compensation framework,” he remarked.
A young labour expert in Islamabad, working for a private company, anonymously shared his insight. He noted that while the formal sector, mainly multinationals and large companies, is gradually adopting performance-based and globally aligned pay structures, the vast informal sector continues to suffer from low, irregular, and undocumented wages.
Although the minimum wage is revised annually, enforcement remains weak. Sharp disparities exist across industries and public and private sectors. High taxation and global competition often lead to cost-cutting at workers’ expense, with minimal focus on well-being, safety, or social protections.
 
 

He attributed the lack of salary data to a deep trust deficit among businesses, noting that employers fear regulatory harassment if they share payroll details. “Most workers aren’t on official payrolls, making documentation harder,” he said. Other hurdles include weak enforcement by labour departments, limited inspection capacity, poor digital infrastructure, and employer reluctance driven by fear of compliance burdens.
He noted that in Pakistan, as in many developing countries, vague or complex laws often expand the officials’ discretionary power, increasing opportunities for corruption. Weak implementation, lack of transparency, and manual enforcement create space for rent-seeking. With corruption normalised, many see bribes as a routine shortcut to bypass bureaucratic hurdles.
Majyd Aziz, former president of the Employers Federation of Pakistan, criticised the private sector’s lax attitude towards labour laws. “For most employers, meeting the minimum wage is the only benchmark. While minimum wage boards exist in all provinces, political interference often leads finance ministers to announce wage hikes unilaterally,” he said.
He noted that only about 65pc of formal sector enterprises and less than 10pc in the informal sector actually pay minimum wage. However, export-orientated firms comply due to pressure for international labour and environmental standards from foreign trade partners.
Mr Aziz pointed out that neither the overseas Pakistanis and human resource development ministry nor provincial labour departments have made any serious efforts to collect transparent wage data, even from registered firms. Institutions like the Employers Federation of Pakistan, Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and other labour organisations also lack up-to-date statistics; instead of rigorous inspection, labour departments rely on alternate, less effective measures, resulting in a lack of real-time data.
In Pakistan, labour market reforms are primarily the responsibility of provincial governments following the 18th Amendment in 2010. The federal government retains a limited role, mainly in international labour standards and trade agreements, while provinces lead policy and lawmaking within their domains.

At the heart of the crisis lie structural inefficiencies, elite capture, and institutional failure. Urgent reforms are needed to protect farmers, consumers, and the economy.
Pakistan is once again in the grip of a familiar affliction: the annual sugar crisis. In 2025, retail sugar prices have surged past Rs200 per kg in many urban and peri-urban markets, despite official statements insisting on sufficient stocks.
In the 2024-25 season, Pakistan’s sugar production is estimated to be 6.8 million tonnes, while consumption is expected to be 6.6m tonnes, leaving a very little surplus and minimal opportunity for market swings.
Rather than a problem of genuine scarcity, this crisis appears to be largely manufactured, fuelled by a toxic combination of speculative hoarding, market manipulation, weak governance, and poor regulatory oversight. The result is that consumers are burdened, farmers are shortchanged, and trust in public institutions continues to erode.

Without transparent and inclusive reforms, Pakistan will remain trapped in a cycle of sugar surpluses on paper and shortages in reality

At the core of this issue lies the unchecked power of a small group of politically connected sugar mill owners. These influential players have repeatedly benefited from preferential treatment in export policies, subsidies, and lax enforcement. The lack of transparency in how sugar production and stocks are monitored has created space for cartels to manipulate supply chains, control prices, and reap windfall profits.
 
 

The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has raised red flags about cartelisation in the sugar sector, but implementation remains weak. Previous enquiries and reports have led to few structural changes. Meanwhile, millers are accused of delaying payments to farmers or paying below the officially mandated support price and exploiting their economic vulnerability.
While mill owners profit, sugarcane farmers suffer. Poor yields, rising input costs, and inconsistent procurement practices have discouraged investment in sugarcane cultivation. Climate change — particularly erratic monsoon patterns and water scarcity — has further hit productivity. In provinces like Sindh and Punjab, growers have been vocal about millers refusing timely procurement or manipulating weighbridge measurements to reduce payments.
It was investigated that a critical situation in the sugar industry, where a major decline in sugarcane recovery and cultivated acreage has resulted in a supply crisis. Sugarcane recovery has dropped up to 12 per cent, while the area cultivated under sugarcane has been reduced 20pc. The combination of decreased yield and limited production area is placing pressure on the sugar supply.
 
 

In 2024, many farmers had cut back sugarcane acreage, anticipating delayed payments and uncertain profits. That reduction, now weaponised by market manipulators, has contributed to the artificial scarcity seen today.
The government’s inconsistent sugar export policy has contributed to the current crisis. In 2023 and early 2024, Pakistan allowed substantial sugar exports despite projections of domestic shortfall. Exporters cashed in on international markets, leaving local markets exposed to price volatility.
During 2024-25, Pakistan exported around 757,597 metric tonnes of sugar. The government’s loosening of export regulations contributed to the boom in exports, which increased by 1,832pc year on year. Specifically, 750,000 metric tonnes of sugar have been allowed for export between June and October 2024.
There has also been a lack of coordination between federal and provincial institutions, especially in price regulation, monitoring, and the establishment of buffer stocks. Price control mechanisms have proved ineffective in the absence of reliable market intelligence and on-the-ground enforcement.
Sugar is not just a commodity — it’s a daily essential. With prices hitting record highs, low- and middle-income households face another blow to their already strained budgets. Inflationary pressures on food staples are contributing to widening food insecurity, especially in urban slums and rural households.
 
 

Moreover, the credibility of the government’s ability to manage the economy is again under scrutiny. The repetition of this crisis year after year points to systemic dysfunction, not seasonal misfortune.
It may be concluded that the sugar crisis in the country is a man-made economic damage caused by over-export, political capture, mafia activity, and failure of regulatory authorities rather than just a scarcity of supply. The elites continue to profit in a growing market as prices veer closer to Rs200 per kg, leaving households to experience the sour aftertaste of manipulation. These crisis cycles will inevitably recur in the absence of clear reforms, efficient regulation, and improved governance.
Based on current analysis, certain steps must be prioritised, such as introducing a real-time sugar production and stock monitoring dashboard, accessible to both policymakers and the public. Empowering the CCP and provincial authorities is also crucial so they can act decisively against hoarding, underpayment to farmers, and price manipulation. On that note, farmers must also receive timely payments at government-set rates and streamline digital payment tracking to avoid exploitation.
Moreover, future sugar exports must be based on a verified surplus, with clear benchmarks and public reporting, while research in high-yield sugarcane varieties must be encouraged, as should improved access to irrigation and farming technology. Finally, activate price monitoring committees at district levels, which must be set up to play an active watchdog role.
The sugar crisis of 2025 is not merely an economic inconvenience; it is a symptom of deeper governance and policy rot. It underscores how elite capture and institutional inertia can repeatedly harm public interest.
Unless bold, transparent, and inclusive reforms are implemented, Pakistan will continue to oscillate between abundance on paper and scarcity in practice.

On November 5 last year, two Chinese nationals were shot at and wounded by a private security guard in a textile mill in Karachi’s SITE area. At that time, investigators had suspected that it was a targeted attack.
Following the incident, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement that the attack was being probed, adding that Pakistan was committed to the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects, and institutions in the country. A first information report (FIR) was registered two days later against the security guard who had fled after the incident.
“A terrorist who masterminded an attack on Chinese engineers in November last year has been killed during an operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area,” Additional Inspector-General of Police, Counter-Terrorism Department Azad Khan told Dawn.com.
Khan said the slain terrorist was identified as Zafran, while two of his accomplices were also killed in the operation.
Senior CTD official Raja Umer Khattab said that the operation was jointly carried out by the CTD and personnel of intelligence agencies. “The teams raided a house in the Manghopir area and killed the terrorists during an operation,” he said. “They belonged to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).”
At the time of the incident, Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG-South) Syed Asad Raza told journalists that the incident had occurred as a result of a verbal altercation between the engineers and the guard, but a further probe was underway to ascertain the exact reason.
He had said that a supervisor and three guards of the private security company had been detained for questioning, while efforts were underway to arrest the guard involved in the shooting.  The DIG had added that the suspect’s residence had been traced, and investigators were collecting information about him from his neighbours.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist activities, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Attacks have predominantly targeted the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. However, Chinese nationals have also been targeted inside Pakistan over the last couple of years.
According to a report by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) published in 2024, 20 Chinese citizens have been killed and 34 injured in terrorist attacks in the country since 2021.
In October 2024, a suicide attack near Karachi airport, claimed by the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), left two Chinese citizens dead and injured ten others.
In March 2024, Chinese workers were targeted in KP’s Besham, reportedly carried out by affiliates of either the TTP or Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), resulting in five Chinese fatalities.
At least four people, including three Chinese nationals, were killed while four others were injured in a suicide attack outside the University of Karachi’s (KU) Confucius Institute in 2022.
The escalation in violence against Chinese nationals had amplified Beijing’s security concerns, especially over progress on China-Pakistan Econo­mic Corridor (CPEC) projects.  Speaking at the event in late October last year, the Chinese Ambassador Jiang Zaidong had expressed frustration over the attacks, stating it was “unacceptable” and urging Islamabad to strengthen security measures for Chinese nationals and crack down on anti-China elements.
Former Foreign Office spokes­person Mumtaz Zahra Baloch had called the statement “perplexing” and a stark departure from the longstanding diplomatic norms between the two nations.</p><small>2025-07-28 06:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/281101000d5f8fb.jpg?r=110208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926995/leopard-mauls-teenage-boy-a-day-after-killing-girl-in-ajks-jhelum-valley' target='_blank'><strong>Leopard mauls teenage boy a day after killing girl in AJK’s Jhelum Valley</strong></a><br><p>MUZAFFARABAD: A teenage boy narrowly escaped death on Sunday afternoon when a leopard attacked him in Nalai Dabra’n, a border village in Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) Jhelum Valley district — less than 24 hours after the same predator had mauled an eight-year-old girl to death in the same locality.
The boy, identified as Mudassir Ali Awan, a student of 10thgrade, was returning home after attending the funeral prayers of the deceased girl when the big cat pounced on him. In a desperate attempt to save his life, he cried for help and tried to fight off the predator. His shouts alerted nearby villagers who rushed to the scene, making loud noises and attacking the leopard with sticks and stones, eventually forcing it to flee back into the forest.
Although the teenager sustained only minor injuries and scratches, his clothes were torn in the terrifying encounter, which has sent shockwaves through the small mountainous community.
“It’s a miracle that he survived. Had the villagers not been nearby, the consequences could have been catastrophic,” Naseer Awan, a resident of Nalai Dabra’n, who was present on the occasion, told Dawn by telephone.
A day earlier, the same leopard had snatched a minor girl from her home’s courtyard and dragged her into the nearby forest, where her mutilated body was found hours later.
The tragic death of the young girl has sparked anger and fear among the villagers, who said the authorities had failed to respond adequately despite repeated incidents involving wild animals in human settlements.
“The Wildlife Department and the district administration did not take any action even after a child was killed,” lamented Mr Awan. “We are now living in constant fear. The government must either catch or relocate this leopard before more lives are lost.”
On July 24, local journalists had also sounded the alarm on social media, warning of the leopard’s increasing presence in human-populated areas and calling for urgent intervention — but to no avail.
Former AJK Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider also expressed grave concern over the incident, warning that the unchecked rise in the leopard population posed a growing threat to human life in the region.
“Yesterday’s incident reflects an extremely alarming situation,” he said. “While the preservation of wildlife is important, it cannot come at the cost of human lives. There is nothing more precious than a human life.”
Mr Haider urged the Wildlife Department to consider relocating or exporting the increasing number of leopards from populated areas. “If people begin killing them in self-defence, they cannot be blamed,” he remarked.
He also offered condolences to the bereaved family and urged the government to offer them compensation. “Special preventive measures must be taken immediately in this and other vulnerable regions to protect children and ensure such tragedies are not repeated,” he added.
Efforts to reach officials from the Wildlife Department for comment remained unsuccessful.
The incidents underscore a growing pattern of human-wildlife conflict in AJK, particularly in forested and hilly areas where shrinking habitats have pushed wild animals closer to human settlements.
Wildlife experts and local communities have repeatedly called for a sustainable management plan to address the issue, but action on the ground remains limited and reactive — mainly due to scant fiscal and human resources allocated to the Wildlife Department.

The federal minister expressed these views in a meeting with Chinese ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong on Sunday.
The two sides discussed the progress of ongoing CPEC projects and preparations for the upcoming Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting, where key decisions are expected to further stre­n­gthen bilateral relations.
Mr Iqbal said after the successful completion of the first phase of China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC), the second phase focuses on industrial cooperation, agriculture, information technology, and social development.
He emphasised connecting CPEC to Central Asian states to boost regional economic stability and economic cooperation.
He said there exists vast potential for mineral exploration in and around Gwadar.
“With the development of modern infrastructure, its mineral resources can be fully capitalized,” he added.
The minister reiterated the government’s commitment to improving and ensuring the security of CPEC projects.
He also discussed continued collaboration with China in the agriculture sector and noted that agriculture graduates trained in China will play a vital role in helping Pakistan address impacts of climate change.
The minister also discussed establishment of Pakistan Space Centre and said China will play a pivotal role in ensuring the timely completion of this project of strategic importance.
Ambassador Jiang Zaidong reaffirmed China’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s development efforts. He assured that bilateral cooperation will continue to expand in the coming years.

A decision to this effect was taken last week by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet, which chose to keep secret the steep revision in charges, although it confirmed the rates had been revised.
According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), which tabled the proposal, the RBS spectrum and licence fees had remained unchanged since 2000 despite inflation rising by over 700pc in the same period.
Official record seen by Dawn suggests that a hike of about 361.3pc has been approved in RBS charges for 748 licensees of private radio networks to Rs350 million from Rs76m, an increase of Rs274m per licence.

PTA to collect Rs463m under revised fee structure

Likewise, a 300pc increase in RBS rates has been allowed for mobile stations used by a total of 144 licensees of aircraft and ships to Rs2.852m from Rs713,000, showing an increase of Rs2.139m per licence.
Similarly, the charges for licensees of 165 Amateur Radio, 17 Inmarsat and 19 Microwave DRS links have been doubled. The revised fee for Amateur Radio licences has increased from Rs160,000 to Rs320,000 per licence. Inmarsat licence charges have risen from Rs625,000 to Rs1.25m, while the fee for Microwave DRS links has been raised from Rs53.92m to Rs107.84m.
The PTA estimates that the increase in service charges would increase its revenue to about Rs463m from the existing Rs131.4m, an increase of 252pc or Rs331.44m.
The increase in RBS rates in terms of foreign exchange, on the other hand, has been estimated to actually drop by 18pc to $1.66m per year from the existing revenue of $2.021m.
Informed sources said the ECC expressed displeasure at the fact that relevant stakeholders, including PTA and the Ministry of IT and Telecom, had been sleeping over the issue for two and a half decades.
The ECC “directed the ministry to ensure periodic revision of RBS charges every three to five years, aligned with ongoing economic changes and technological advancements in the sector”, an official statement said.
The PTA is responsible for frequency allocation, licence issuance and fee adjustments for RBS services, including PRNs, Mobile Station Aircraft/Ship, Inmarsat, Amateur, and DRS/Microwave links.
The Ministry of IT and Telecom informed the ECC that the outdated fee structure had led to a significant mismatch between service charges and the costs incurred in managing licences and spectrum oversight.
It said the economic landscape had undergone a significant transformation since the implementation of the previous fee structure. Further, the monetary value and technological sophistication of services rendered through RBS licences and authorisations also increased substantially, driven by technological advancements and the evolving requirements of contemporary communication systems.
This significant evolution in both economic parameters and service delivery frameworks required an immediate and comprehensive revision of the RBS fee structure.
Under Sections 5(2a), 5(2c) and 43(5) of the Pakistan Tele-communication (Re-organisation) Act, 1996, the PTA is mandated to regulate the issuance and renewal of licences, the processing of frequency assignment requests and the charging of relevant fees.
Moreover, Clause 8.7.5 of the Telecommunication Policy 2015 mandated the PTA to propose to the federal government the methods of assigning and pricing frequency spectrum after consultation with stakeholders. Based on an industry consultation in August 2024, the PTA then proposed a revision in the RBS fee structure.

The satellite, developed by Suparco, is designed to provide early warnings for natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, and landslides, while also supporting crop assessment and urban planning.
“This marks a significant step in Pakistan’s space and scientific development,” Suparco said in a statement, adding that the satellite will “enhance our ability to respond to disasters and improve food security and environmental monitoring.”
The launch comes amid a deepening partnership between Islam­abad and Beijing in space science.
In May, Pakistan became the first foreign nation to join China’s space station training programme, sending two astronauts for training under a landmark agreement with the China Manned Space Agency.
One of the astronauts is expected to join a future mission aboard China’s Tiangong Space Station as a scientific payload specialist.
In January, Pakistan launched its first home-made observation satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northern China, Pakistan’s space agency said.
The PRSC-EO1 satellite aimed to boost Pakistan’s ability to monitor and manage natural resources, respond to disasters, and improve urban planning and agricultural development
In November last year, Suparco announced its rover will join China’s Chang’E 8 mission to the moon’s south pole in 2028—a move hailed as a “significant milestone” for the country.
Officials say these initiatives underscore Pakistan’s commitment to leveraging space technology for national development and disaster preparedness, as the country seeks to build resilience against climate change and natural disasters.

• Six more die of starvation; 10 injured by aid drops; trucks entering from north mobbed by desperate population
• World welcomes 10-hour daily ‘pause’ in Israeli military operations; urges Tel Aviv to do more
JERUSALEM: At least six more people succumbed to starvation on Sunday, as food supplies finally trickled into the Gaza Strip after Jordan and the United Arab Emirates parachuted 25 tonnes of aid into the besieged enclave, the first airdrop in months.
According to aid groups, mass hunger haunts Gaza’s 2.2 million people, with the UN’s World Food Programme (WFP) saying that a third of the population of Gaza has not eaten for days, and 470,000 people are “enduring famine-like conditions”.
Since Israel imposed a total blockade on aid entering Gaza on March 2, the situation inside the territory has deteriorated sharply. More than 100 NGOs warned last week of “mass starvation” in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.
Six deaths were reported over the past 24 hours due to malnutrition, bringing the total toll from hunger to 133, including 87 children. A Jordanian official told Reu­ters that airdrops were not a substitute for delivery by land to feed the starving populace which faced Israel-manufactured famine for weeks.
Palestinian health officials in Gaza City said at least 10 people were injured by falling aid boxes; however, most were happy about the prospects of finally getting a meal.
“People are happy that large amounts of food aid will come into Gaza,” said Tamer Al-Burai, a business owner. “We hope today marks a first step in ending this war that burned everything up.”.
Humeid, a 23-year-old from the Al-Karama neighbourhood of Gaza City, told AFP that dozens of people had gathered to rush towards the palettes of supplies parachuted onto the area.
“It felt like a war, everyone trying to grab whatever they could. Hunger is merciless. The quantities were extremely limited, not enough even for a few people, because hunger is everywhere. I only managed to get three cans of fava beans,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Egyptian Red Crescent said it was sending more than 100 trucks carrying over 1,200 metric tonnes of food to southern Gaza on Sunday. A Palestinian official source said on Sunday afternoon that the trucks were still being inspected at Kerem Shalom and had not yet entered Gaza.
The desperation for food was evident from the fact that seven to 10 trucks filled with flour, which were allowed into the northern part of the Gaza Strip, could not all make it to Gaza City.
Hungry crowds surrounded them, and people who were desperate for one bag of flour and other basic necessities mobbed them, Al Jazeera reported.
Meanwhile, Al Jazeera also reported that more than 53 people were killed by Israeli fire, including 32 who had been waiting to receive aid.
Military operations ‘paused’
The aid drops came amid an announcement by Israel that it would ‘pause’ its military operations in parts of Gaza for 10 hours a day, and allow new aid corridors.
The military said designated secure routes for convoys delivering food and medicine will also be in place between 6am and 11pm, starting from Sunday.
Military activity will stop from 10 am to 8 pm (0700-1700 GMT) until further notice in Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian area along the coast, in central Deir al-Balah and in Gaza City, to the north.
The Israeli military also said it had also begun airdropping food into the Palestinian territory – making one drop of seven palettes.
Hamas denounced the Israeli measures to allow more aid into Gaza, saying Israel was continuing its military offensive. “What is happening isn’t a humanitarian truce,” said Hamas official Ali Baraka in a statement on Sunday.
International concern
While Israel’s decision to pause military operations and allow aid into Gaza were welcomed, most actors agreed the actions fall short of what is needed to alleviate suffering in the besieged enclave.
Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that Israel’s announcement was “essential but long overdue”, and that access to aid must now be urgently accelerated over the coming hours and days.
UN emergency relief coordinator Tom Fletcher said their teams would “do all we can to reach as many starving people as we can in this window”.
UN rights chief Volker Turk said Israel, as the occupying power in Gaza, was obliged to ensure sufficient food was provided to the population.
“Children are starving and dying in front of our eyes. Gaza is a dystopian landscape of deadly attacks and total destruction,” he said in a statement.
“The starvation of people in Gaza must end now,” UN refugees chief Filippo Grandi said on X.
 






Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation warned on Sunday that malnutrition rates were reaching “alarming levels” in the Gaza Strip, marked by a spike in deaths in July.

Speaking to Arab News ahead of the conference, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said: “Pakistan has a clear foreign policy for decades that the two-state solution is the only answer to the Palestine problem.”
He welcomed the initiative by France and Saudi Arabia, describing it as “very appreciable”, and expressed hope that the summit would lead to concrete results.
“I hope that serious efforts are made during this event, first, to secure an immediate ceasefire, and second, to ensure the unhindered flow of food, humanitarian aid and medical assistance — alongside progress toward the recognition of Palestine as an independent state,” the deputy premier said.

France, S. Arabia-hosted UN conference on two-state solution kicks off today in New York

The three-day conference, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, is being held at the UN headquarters in New York and has drawn participation from 123 countries and international organisations. It aims to chart a concrete path towards the two-state solution through proposals developed by eight working groups, which have held extensive consultations with UN member states and civil society groups.
The conference is receiving global attention following French President Emmanuel Macron’s announcement this week that France will formally recognise the State of Palestine—making it the first G7 country to do so.
While Macron said the recognition will be formalised at the UN General Assembly in September, Washington strongly condemned France’s decision. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a post on X, called the move a “reckless decision,” claiming it “only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace”.
The US, under President Donald Trump, has announced that it will not attend the conference. Israel is also boycotting the event.
A diplomatic cable, reportedly shared with multiple capitals and seen by Reuters in Paris and Washington, revealed that the US had warned governments against participating in the conference, arguing that it could derail ongoing efforts to secure the release of Israeli prisoners and end the war in Gaza.
Despite the US objections, several European countries have signalled their intent to follow France’s lead. In May, fellow EU members Norway, Ireland, and Spain announced that they had begun the process of recognising a Palestinian state.
Currently, at least 142 of the 193 UN member states either recognise or have indicated plans to recognise Palestine. However, several influential Western countries—including the US, the UK, and Germany — have yet to do so.
Pakistan’s participation in the conference aligns with its longstanding support for the two-state solution. Islamabad had earlier voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution last year calling for an international summit on the issue in June 2025. That summit could not take place last month.
 
 

As president of the UN Security Council for July 2025, Pakistan chaired the July 24 open debate on the Palestine issue. “Pakistan’s position is absolutely clear — we are firmly on the right side of history and remain steadfast in our support,” Dar stated.
In the interview, Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to diplomacy: “The solution to conflicts does not lie in kinetic actions — wars and violence. The real path forward is through dialogue and diplomacy, and we are firm believers in this approach.”
France has said the goal of the New York meeting is to move beyond rhetoric and offer “concrete measures” to revive the stalled peace process. Organisers hope the momentum from this conference will lead to broader international consensus in favour of Palestinian statehood.

• Partial reopening of Babusar Road expected today
GILGIT: People displaced by flash floods across multiple areas of Gilgit-Baltistan have complained of severe shortages of clean drinking water, electricity, road access and communication services.
Survivors in the flood-stricken Babusar and Thore valleys of Diamer said they had been hit by one of the deadliest floods in recent memory, which left many homeless and swept away their belongings.
In the Gilgit region, thousands of residents in Danyor and Sultanabad areas remained without drinking water for three consecutive days after a flash flood from Danyor Nallah damaged the main supply pipeline and several irrigation channels.
Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res­tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.
They said that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again. No restoration work has been initiated, they lamented and gave a one-day ultimatum to the government for action or they would launch protests.
Meanwhile, residents of Kondus and Haldi in Ghanche district also complained about a lack of relief supplies, electricity, drinking water and road access.
 
 

A devastating landslide in Kondus swept away over 50 homes, leaving scores of families homeless and in urgent need of food, shelter, medical care and emergency services. Locals also lamented the unavailability of the internet, making it even harder to communicate or call for help.
In the Shigar district, flash floods hit the Tisar and Garchahma areas. Resident Sajid Ali said electricity had been out for the last three to four days and that many families had evacuated their homes in search of safer ground. Drinking water was also unavailable, he added.
 
 

People in Jutal and other flood-affected regions of Gilgit-Baltistan also complained about the lack of basic facilities and criticised the government for its slow response and failure to deliver timely relief.
‘15 tourists swept away’
Meanwhile, a private TV anchor, her husband and their four children are also among the tourists reported missing in Babusar Valley, it emerged on Sunday.
Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the family of an anchorperson for a Pashto-language TV channel had contacted authorities, reporting that she, her husband and their four children had gone missing during the recent flash floods.
Mr Faraq said they had recovered a wallet belonging to the anchorperson, adding that the body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the Indus River in Chilas’s Minar area. The woman is believed to be among the tourists who were swept away by flash floods on Babusar Highway.
He said that according to eyewitness accounts, between 10 and 15 tourists were swept away by floodwaters on the Babusar Highway. So far, seven bodies have been recovered.
“The search for the remaining missing persons is ongoing with the help of sniffer dogs and drones and personnel from Diamer Police, Rescue 1122, the Pakistan Army and GB Scouts are participating in the operation,” he said, adding that the effort would continue until all missing individuals are located.
He said additional rescue operations were also underway in Ghanche, Ghizer and Gilgit. Human remains were also recovered during a search operation in the Thak Bhasha area of Diamer, and DNA testing will be required for identification.
Federal Secretary for Commun­ications and Works Sher Alam Masood visited the Babusar Highway site in Chilas alongside local officials to assess the damage.
He told the media that restoration efforts using heavy machinery were ongoing, with the road blocked in 15 locations and partial clearance achi­eved at 13 of them. He hoped that the highway would be partially reopened for traffic by Monday (today).

The ADF, originally formed from former Ugandan rebels and which pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2019, raided a Catholic church in the town of Komanda where worshippers were gathered for prayer, complained residents of Bunia, the capital of Ituri province.
“Last night around 9pm, we heard gunfire near the parish church... so far we have seen 35 bodies,” Dieudonne Katanabo, an Umoja neighbourhood elder, said.
“We have at least 31 dead members of the Eucharistic Crusade movement, with six seriously injured... some young people were kidnapped, we have no news of them,” Father Aime Lokana Dhego, parish priest of the Blessed Anuarite parish of Komanda, said. The priest added that seven other bodies had been discovered in the town.
Likewise attributing the attack to “ADF rebels”, Christophe Munyanderu, coordinator of the local NGO Convention for the Respect of Human Rights, gave a provisional death toll of 38.
Army spokesman in Ituri, Lt Jules Ngongo, did not comment on the toll but confirmed the attack to AFP, stating that “the enemy is believed to have been identified among ADF” fighters. The bloodshed comes after months of calm in the region of Ituri, bordering Uganda.
The last major attack by the ADF was in February, leaving 23 dead in Mambasa territory.
The town of Komanda in Irumu territory is a commercial hub linking three other provinces —Tshopo, North Kivu, and Maniema.
The ADF has killed thousands of civilians and ramped up looting and killing in northeastern DRC despite the deployment both of the Ugandan army alongside Congolese armed forces in the area.

According to the event’s website, ‘TechNova’ is a premier tech and innovation event bringing together students, professionals, and enthusiasts from diverse backgrounds.
It is a unique blend of technical and non-technical modules. The event provides an engaging platform for participants to showcase their skills, compete in exciting challenges, and explore emerging technologies.
Speaking to Dawn.com, the event’s vice president, Muhammad Anas — a final year student at IoBM, said: “This was the first tech-centric event in the history of IoBM; it had multiple tech modules, including a final year project showcase, a startup launchpad, speed programming, prompt engineering, web and logo design, and maths mania.”
He added that winners were awarded with a cash prize of up to Rs50,000, and the competition was attended by students, teachers, technology experts and professionals from more than 25 universities across the country.
“Alhamdulillah, we had more people than expected. Around 500+ participants and visitors, excluding university students and staff who made up a footfall of around 2500 to 3000 people,” Anas added.
The event — organised under the College of Computer Science and Information Systems, aimed to provide an opportunity for youth to express their technology, creative thinking and practical skills, according to a press release by the competition.
The event, affiliated with the varsity’s Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ (IEEE) student branch, began with an opening session, which was attended by the leadership of the institute and personalities from the tech industry.
The event also included a special artificial intelligence symposium, in which experts discussed the future of artificial intelligence and its educational and industrial significance.
The speakers included Microsoft Pakistan Country Education Lead Jibran Jamshed, Telec Group Director Brigadier Musharraf Khan, Rector Professor Dr Tariq Rahim Soomro, and other notable speakers.
In the final year project competition, the students presented innovative ideas which were not only appreciated but some teams also received investment offers. Students demonstrated their creative skills in web and logo designing, while speed programming demonstrated their technical abilities through accurate coding within a set time. Academic competitions were held in ‘Maths Mania’ and ‘Prompt Engineering’, while the youth presented business ideas through ‘Launchpad’.
Speaking about their project, the winner of the startup launchpad competition, Ayaan Amir, a mechanical engineering student, said: “My project was a healthy food startup called GreenBite. We aim to provide oil-free meals that are not only healthy and delicious but also affordable.”
He added that there was a demand for a service for health-conscious individuals who want a reliable, daily meal solution without compromising on flavour or budget, and that the judges had encouraged his team to reach out to them to develop the idea further.
In May, Fatima Jinnah Women University (FJWU), Department of Law, organised a contest under the theme of ‘Legislative Drafting and Policy Competition on AI Governance’ in the university.
The event was organised in collaboration with Sehrish Saba Raja and Associates Legal Clinic and Research Centre, The Society 5.0 Initiative, Law Students’ Council Pakistan, and other distinguished partners.
It brought together 11 teams from leading universities and think tanks across the country to present innovative legislative and policy proposals on artificial intelligence governance.

“We have reached a deal. It’s a good deal for everybody,” Trump told reporters after talks with von der Leyen at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland. The EU chief also hailed it as a “good deal”.
Earlier, the US president told reporters he felt the two sides had a 50-50 chance of a deal with the European Union. The bloc faces an across-the-board US levy of 30 per cent unless it strikes a trade pact by August 1.
Washington warned on Sunday there would be “no extensions” and Trump confirmed “the deals all start on August 1”.
Von der Leyen’s European Commission, negotiating on behalf of EU countries, is pushing hard for a deal to salvage a trading relationship worth an annual $1.9 trillion in goods and services.
The EU chief said at the start of the talks at Trump’s luxury golf resort in southwestern Turnberry that if they reached a deal, “I think it would be the biggest deal each of us has ever” made.
 


According to an EU diplomat briefed ahead of the meeting, the contours of a deal are in place, but key issues still need settling.
“A political deal is on the table — but it needs the sign-off from Trump, who wants to negotiate this down to the very last moment,” the diplomat told AFP.
The proposal, they said, involves a baseline levy of around 15pc on EU exports to the United States — the level secured by Japan — with carve-outs for critical sectors including aircraft and spirits, though not for wine.
Any deal will also need to be approved by EU member states, whose ambassadors, on a visit to Greenland, were updated by the commission Sunday morning. They would meet again after any accord.
According to the EU diplomat, the 27 countries broadly endorsed the deal as envisaged — while recalling their negotiating red lines.
Baseline 15pc
The Trump-von der Leyen meeting was taking place in the president’s luxury golf resort in Turnberry on Scotland’s southwestern coast. The 79-year-old Trump said on Friday he hoped to strike “the biggest deal of them all” with the EU.
The EU is focused on getting a deal to avoid sweeping tariffs that would further harm its sluggish economy — while holding out retaliation as a last resort.
Under the proposal described to AFP, the EU would commit to ramping up purchases of US liquefied natural gas, along with other investment pledges.
Pharmaceuticals, a key export for Ireland, would also face a 15pc levy, as would semiconductors.
The EU also appears to have secured a compromise on steel that could allow a certain quota into the United States before tariffs would apply, the diplomat said.
But Trump said on Sunday that trade tariffs with the EU would not be lower than 15pc.
Auto sector
The EU has been hit by multiple waves of tariffs since Trump reclaimed the White House. It is currently subject to a 25pc levy on cars, 50pc on steel and aluminium, and an across-the-board tariff of 10pc, which Washington threatens to hike to 30pc in a no-deal scenario.
 
 

It was unclear how the proposed deal would impact tariff levels on the auto industry, crucial for France and Germany. Carmakers are already reeling from the levies imposed so far.
While 15pc would be much higher than pre-existing US tariffs on European goods, which average around 4.8pc, it would mirror the status quo, with companies currently facing an additional flat rate of 10pc.
Should talks fail, EU states have greenlit counter tariffs on $109 billion (€93bn) of US goods, including aircraft and cars, to take effect in stages from August 7.
Brussels is also drawing up a list of US services to potentially target.
Beyond that, countries including France say Brussels should not be afraid to deploy a so-called trade “bazooka” — EU legislation designed to counter coercion that can involve restricting access to its market and public contracts.
But such a step would mark a major escalation with Washington.
Ratings dropping
Trump has embarked on a campaign to reshape US trade with the world, and has vowed to hit dozens of countries with punitive tariffs if they do not reach a pact with Washington by August 1.
US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday the August 1 deadline was firm and there will be “no extensions, no more grace periods.”
Polls suggest, however, that the American public is unconvinced by the White House strategy, with a recent Gallup survey showing his approval rating at 37pc, down 10 points from January.
Having promised “90 deals in 90 days,” Trump’s administration has so far unveiled five, including with Britain, Japan and the Philippines.</p><small>2025-07-27 17:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/271619432c8ee97.jpg?r=162000' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926929/pakistani-pilgrims-barred-from-by-road-travel-to-iran-iraq-this-arbaeen-interior-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani pilgrims barred from by-road travel to Iran, Iraq this Arbaeen: interior minister</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani pilgrims will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Sunday.
Pilgrims visit Iraq to attend the chehlum commemoration — also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) — to mark the 40th day of mourning for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
“After extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [the] Balochistan Government, and security agencies, it has been decided that zaireen (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road for Arbaeen this year,” Naqvi said on X.
He added that the “difficult decision was taken in the interest of public safety and national security”.
However, the pilgrims will be able to travel by air, the minister noted.
 






Naqvi stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed authorities to “arrange maximum flights to facilitate their pilgrimage in the coming days”.
Naqvi’s statement came after he met with PM Shehbaz earlier today to brief him on the new policy for pilgrims, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
The premier also directed Aviation Minister Khawaja Asif to arrange “special flights” for the pilgrims, APP stated, citing a press release from the PM Office.
Iraq’s Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than 21 million devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.
Pakistan is set to introduce a new travel management system from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.
 
 

Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.
Earlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf retracted his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a “misunderstanding” of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.
PM tells Naqvi to start work on Gwadar Safe City project
During their meeting, PM Shehbaz and Naqvi also discussed the law and order situation in Balochistan, with the premier telling the minister to initiate work on the Gwadar Safe City project.
The project aims to provide a safer city for the residents of Gwadar, particularly at the identified strategic locations and also help law enforcement agencies in detecting and investigating crimes by collecting evidence.
 






The delay in the project had been highlighted by Senator Quratulain Marri in May as she chaired a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Special Initiatives.
Senator Marri had sought a report on a critical discrepancy — the Gwadar Development Authority officials blamed a lack of funds for the project delays, while the Finance Division said it had received no funding demand from the Balochistan government.
 
 

On July 11, a representative of the Balochistan government told a high-level government meeting that 30 per cent of the project was complete, with full completion expected by June 2026.
With the initial plan prepared in 2016, the first phase of the Gwadar Safe City project had been approved by the Central Development Working Party in February 2023 for Rs4.97bn.
PIA announces special flights for pilgrims
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced to operate special flights for billions of pilgrims. according to the airline’s spokesperson.
Four flights will depart from Karachi from August 8 to 11, the announcement said.
Flights for pilgrims returning from Najaf have been scheduled from August 18 to 21.
Ticket sales have started for all flights, the statement added.
“More flights will also be scheduled based on market demand,” the spokesperson said.</p><small>2025-07-27 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616036-visa-free-entry-to-uae-begins-for-pakistanis-with-diplomatic-official-passports' target='_blank'><strong>Visa-free entry to UAE begins for Pakistanis with diplomatic, official passports</strong></a><br><p>
