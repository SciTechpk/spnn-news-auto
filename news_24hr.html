He was 65.
His funeral was held at a local mosque, which was attended by his colleagues and relatives, after which he was laid to rest at the Mohammad Shah graveyard. The Soyem will be held at his residence in Saima Arabian Villas today (Monday).
Mr Jalal is survived by his widow and five children.
A key member of Dawn’s newsroom since 1992, Mr Jalal began his journalistic career from the daily Sindh Guardian in his native Hyderabad, his long-time colleague Mohammad Hussain Khan recalled. He moved to Karachi in the mid-1990s, where he joined Dawn as a sub-editor.
He then rose among the ranks to become a shift incharge, and was eventually designated as the deputy news editor in 2022.
Mr Jalal was extremely well-respected among media circles for his wealth of experience. His affable nature and professional conduct endeared him to his colleagues.
As one of the most senior members of the Dawn newsroom, Mr Jalal also mentored many budding journalists. He served as a bridge, helping new generation of editors navigate the ever-changing media landscape while relaying lessons learned from past editors.

Under the National Fina­nce Commis­sion (NFC) Awa­rd, Balochistan is set to receive Rs743 billion from federal revenues, distributed mainly through the divisible pool taxes and dir­ect transfers from natural resources, including gas.
Officials expect the pro­v­ince to receive an additional Rs70bn in federal funds.
Meanwhile, Balochistan’s own revenue, generated through provincial taxes and non-tax sou­rces, is estimated to surpass Rs150bn.
Non-development expe­n­d­iture for the upcoming year is projected to exceed Rs700bn, while more than Rs240bn may be earmarked from the province’s own resources for development spending. Substantial funds are likely to be allocated to key sectors, including education, law and order, health, infrastructure, and agriculture.
More than Rs160bn is expected to go to the education sector, over Rs100bn to law and order, and around Rs80bn to health services.
Salaries of government employees in Balochistan are also likely to be increased in line with federal government’s announcement. Provincial employees have been protesting in recent weeks to demand pay raise and other benefits.

According to an official statement, the clarification by FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial was given during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, which discussed the federal budget presented last week.
The committee approved the proposal to impose sales tax on e-commerce items.
The FBR chairman said online businesses already collect tax from consumers but don’t deposit it with the FBR.
 
 

He further elaborated that courier services will now be designated as collection agents, since they possess the seller’s invoice.
However, sales tax will not apply to services provided locally.
The government, in an attempt to tax digital businesses, has proposed mandatory registration of all digital vendors, including foreign e-commerce companies, if they sell goods to Pakistani customers.
The committee reviewed penalties for unregistered entities, with members expressing concerns about the impact on small and one-time online sellers.
The FBR chairman assured the members that housewives and those involved in one-time transactions will be protected and will not be required to register.
The meeting also discussed the powers granted to tax officials to arrest suspected tax evaders and the harsh penalties proposed for tax fraud.
In the Finance Bill, the government proposed 10 years imprisonment and fines for fraud exceeding Rs10 million.
The members also debated the scope of tax officers’ power under Section 37A of the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
The meeting was told that earlier, assistant commissioners were empowered to arrest suspected tax evaders.
Now, it has been revised to require prior inquiry and the commissioner’s approval for arrest.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani said the amendment was “a step towards protecting procedural integrity and reducing arbitrary arrests”.
However, committee members remained sceptical over the potential misuse of these powers.
In response to the objections, the FBR chairman assured the committee that a revised draft of the relevant provisions would be submitted today. The committee will continue the deliberation on the Finance Bill 2025-26 today (Monday), the press release said.

The visit, which sources described as “primarily bilateral in nature”, is not officially linked to the US Army’s 250th anniversary celebrations on June 14, despite its timing.
Field Marshal Munir did not attend the military parade, but some sources speculated that he spent the last two days at the US Central Command’s headquarters in Tampa, Florida. The Pakistani embassy in Washington, however, refused to confirm or deny this claim.
The sources said the army chief’s visit aims to reinforce military and strategic ties between Pakistan and the US, with meetings expected with senior US officials, including the Secretaries of Defence and State and senior US military commanders.

PTI supporters protest outside embassy ahead of army chief’s arrival

Meanwhile, several PTI supporters staged a protest outside the Pakistan embassy on Saturday afternoon, calling for the restoration of what they described as “unfettered democracy” in Pakistan.
The demonstration came ahead of the COAS’s arrival. “We believe the army chief is in Washi­ngton, and that’s why we’re here,” said one of the protest organisers, linking the demonstration to the COAS’ presence in the US.
 






The Pakistani embassy declined to confirm or deny the visit at the time of the protest.
The army chief’s trip comes at a particularly delicate time, following Israeli airstrikes in Iran.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst, said the visit is complicated by the regional tensions.
“Pakistan wants to cultivate US support but has condemned the Israeli strikes and is working to strengthen ties with Tehran,” Mr Kugelman noted. “For Gen Munir to be in the capital of Israel’s closest ally and Iran’s primary adversary at such a tense moment could lead to some uncomfortable conversations.”
 
 

He added that the unfolding Middle East crisis may also limit how fully US officials can engage with the visiting Pakistani delegation.
Mr Kugelman said counterterrorism cooperation will likely dominate the agenda, and Field Marshal Munir may try to build on recent improvements in bilateral ties following the India-Pakistan ceasefire. However, broader efforts to reframe the security partnership would remain a “hard sell”, he warned.
Shuja Nawaz, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council’s South Asia Centre, underscored the strategic imbalance in US regional priorities.
“Washington sees Pakistan in the China camp but as a useful counterterrorism base,” Mr Nawaz said.
“It sees greater trade and markets for its technology and defence materials in India. This makes an unequal situation.”

“A short while ago, the IDF identified missiles launched from Iran toward the territory of the State of Israel,” the army posted on Telegram, using the acronym for its official name.
It said its air defences were working to intercept the threat but advised people to “enter a protected space and remain there until further notice”.
An AFP journalist heard loud explosions in Jerusalem on early Monday, while footage showed Israeli air defences working over the city.
According to Reuters, British maritime security firm Ambrey said that fires were observed at the power plant in the vicinity of Israel’s Haifa port.
Ambrey said it observed video footage of the Israeli military intercepting the attack, followed by impacts from two hypersonic missiles.
Outside Haifa, an AFP journalist saw fires break out following the latest Iranian barrage.
Israel’s public broadcaster, Kan, reported that at least four areas were hit in the latest Iranian attacks on central Israel.
 


Twenty-nine people have been wounded and evacuated following Iran’s latest attacks, Al Jazeera reported, citing Israel’s ambulance and blood bank service.
Three of the wounded are in a moderate condition, and 26 have minor injuries, it added.
 
 

A senior US official said on Sunday that US President Donald Trump told Israel to back down from a plan to kill Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Reuters reported.
Israel has claimed strikes as far away as Mashhad in Iran’s far east, 2,300 kilometres (1,430 miles) from Israel. Iranian state television reported at least five people were killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Iran.
Colonel Reza Sayyad, a spokesman for Iran’s armed forces, threatened a “devastating response” to Israel’s attacks.
“Leave the occupied territories (Israel) because they will certainly no longer be habitable in the future,” he warned in a televised address, adding shelters will “not guarantee security”.
The death toll in Iran has risen to 224, including 70 women and children. The intelligence chief of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and two other generals were killed in Israeli attacks on Sunday, Al Jazeera reported.
According to AFP, residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slamming Iran on Sunday for allegedly targeting civilians.
“Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,” he said, during a visit to the site of a missile strike on a residential building in the coastal city of Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv.
His remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire killed at least 10 people, according to authorities, pushing the death toll in Israel up to 13 since Iran began its retaliatory strikes Friday.
Meanwhile, a likely Iranian drone killed a woman in Syria, a Britain-based war monitor said, in what would be the first death on Syrian soil since the current hostilities between Iran and Israel began, reported AFP.
The drone struck the woman’s home in western Tartus province, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The Israeli military said early on Monday that it was striking surface-to-surface missile sites in central Iran, adding it was “operating against this threat in our skies and in Iranian skies”.
‘I will not leave’
A heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots. Local media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in the city centre.
“We haven’t been able to sleep since Friday because of the terrible noise,” said a Tehran resident who gave her name as Farzaneh.
“Today, they hit a house in our alley, and we were very scared. So we decided to leave Tehran and head to the north of the country.”
Some, however, were determined to stay.
“It is natural that war has its own stress, but I will not leave my city,” Shokouh Razzazi, 31, told AFP.
AFP images from the Israeli city of Haifa, meanwhile, also showed a column of smoke rising on Sunday evening following an Iranian missile barrage.
The military said rescue teams “have been dispatched to several hit sites in Israel”, while the fire services reported rescuers heading to a building on the coast that sustained a “direct hit”.
Earlier in the day, in Bat Yam, first responders wearing helmets and headlamps picked through a bombed-out building.
“There was an explosion and I thought the whole house had collapsed,” said Bat Yam resident Shahar Ben Zion.
“It was a miracle we survived.”
‘Make a deal’
Trump said Washington “had nothing to do” with Israel’s bombing campaign but threatened to unleash “the full strength and might” of the US military if Iran attacked American interests.
On Sunday, he urged the two foes to “make a deal”, adding, however, that “sometimes they have to fight it out” first.
A senior US official told AFP that Trump had urged Israel to drop a plan to assassinate Khamenei.
“We found out that the Israelis had plans to hit Iran’s supreme leader. President Trump was against it, and we told the Israelis not to,” said the US official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Donald Trump told ABC News on Sunday that he would be “open” to his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, being a mediator.
“It’s possible we could get involved” in the ongoing battle in the Middle East, he said.
However, seemingly contradicting his ally, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu claimed that American pilots were shooting down drones headed towards Israel. In the same interview, he also said that he and Trump were “fully co-ordinated”.
Asked in an interview with Fox News whether regime change in Iran was one of the objectives of Israel’s strikes, Netanyahu said that “it certainly could be the result, because the Iran regime is very weak”.
Iran’s top diplomat Abbas Araghchi maintained Tehran had “solid proof” that US forces had supported Israel in its attacks.
He also told a meeting of foreign diplomats that Iran’s actions were a “response to aggression”.
“If the aggression stops, naturally our responses will also stop,” he added.
Iran scrapped planned nuclear talks with the United States, saying it was “meaningless” to negotiate while under fire.
Iranian media reported on Sunday that police had arrested two suspects over alleged links to Israel’s Mossad spy agency.
Israel, in turn, said it had taken two individuals into custody over alleged links to Iranian intelligence.</p><small>2025-06-16 03:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/684f6130a0c56.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917388/israel-kills-41-in-gaza-as-thousands-rally-in-europe' target='_blank'><strong>Israel kills 41 in Gaza as thousands rally in Europe</strong></a><br><p>• At least five shot dead near aid distribution site run by GHF
• Israeli soldier killed in south Gaza
• Massive protest in The Hague calls for ‘end to genocide’
CAIRO: Israeli fire and airstrikes killed at least 41 Palestinians across Gaza on Sunday, local health authorities said, at least five of them near two aid sites operated by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
An Israeli soldier was also killed in Gaza, the army confirmed on Sunday.
Medics at Al-Awda Hospital in the central Gaza Strip said at least three people were killed and dozens wounded by Israeli fire as they tried to approach a GHF site near the Netzarim corridor.
Two others were killed en route to another aid site in Rafah in the south.
An airstrike killed seven other people in Beit Lahiya town north of the enclave, medics said.
In Nuseirat camp in central Gaza Strip, medics said an Israeli airstrike killed at least 11 people in a house. The rest were killed in separate airstrikes in the southern Gaza Strip, they added.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
The GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May after Israel partially lifted a near three-month total blockade. Scores of Palestinians have been killed in near-daily mass shootings trying to reach the food.
The UN rejects the Israeli-backed new distribution system as inadequate, dangerous and a violation of humanitarian impartiality principles.
The Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday that at least 300 people have so far been killed, and more than 2,600 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza.
“These are not humanitarian aid, these are traps for the poor and the hungry under the watch of occupation planes,” said Munir Al-Bursh, Director-General of the health ministry.
Israeli soldier killed
The Israeli soldier killed in Gaza a day earlier was identified as Noam Shemesh, 21, from Jerusalem.
In a statement, the military said he “… fell during combat in the southern Gaza Strip”.
About 430 soldiers have been killed since Israel’s ground operation in Gaza began on October 27, 2023.
Protests in Europe
Tens of thousands of people dressed in red marched through the streets of The Hague on Sunday to demand more action from the Dutch government against what they termed a “genocide” in Gaza.
The protest followed similar pro-Palestine demonstrations across major European cities, including Brussels, Paris, Zurich and Madrid, throughout the week.
Rights groups such as Amnesty International and Oxfam organised the demonstration through the city to the International Court of Justice, creating a so-called “red line”.
With many waving Palestinian flags and some chanting “Stop the Genocide”, the demonstrators turned a central park in the city into a sea of red on a sunny afternoon.
One of the organising groups, Oxfam Novib, estimated 150,000 people participated in the march. Organisers urged the Dutch government — which collapsed on June 3 after a far-right party pulled out of a fragile coalition — to do more to rein in Israel for its military offensive on the Palestinian territory.
Demonstrators on Sunday called for the caretaker government to speak out against what they said were ongoing violations of international law by Israel.
“More than 150,000 people here dressed in red —and a clear majority of the Dutch population — just want concrete sanctions to stop the genocide in Gaza,” said Michiel Servaes, director of Oxfam Novib.
“We demand action now from our government.”
Dodo Van Der Sluis, a 67-year-old pensioner, told AFP: “It has to stop.
Enough is enough. I can’t take it anymore.“ “I’m here because I think it’s maybe the only thing you can do now as a Dutch citizen, but it’s something you have to do,” she added.
In response to the protests, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the goal is to end the war in Gaza as soon as possible.
“To all those people in The Hague I say: we see you and we hear you.” “In the end, our goal is the same: to end the suffering in Gaza as soon as possible,” he wrote in a post on X.

• Crisis deepens in Balochistan as supply from Iran disrupted
• ME conflict worries global markets
QUETTA/KARACHI: The federal government has jacked up the prices of both petrol and diesel, with their rates climbing by Rs4.80 and Rs7.95 per litre, respectively.
According to a Finance Division notification issued on late Sunday night, the new prices had been determined “based on the recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) and the relevant ministries”.
High-speed diesel (HSD), which previously cost Rs254.64 per litre, will now be sold for Rs262.59.
Similarly, petrol, which cost Rs253.63 per litre, will now be available for Rs258.43.
Previous estimates suggested that petrol and diesel prices would increase by about Re1 and Rs5 per litre, respectively, for the next fortnight, owing to higher international market prices.
Fuel crisis deepens in Balochistan
Meanwhile, the fuel crisis in Balochistan has taken a serious turn amid the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, as the supply of Iranian oil through the border has been badly affected, leading to the closure of a large number of petrol pumps.
The border districts of Balochistan with Iran, including Turbat, Gwadar, Panjgur, Chagai, Washuk, and Mashkail are worst-affected, as they were not only facing suspension of Iranian oil supply, but also a food shortage, as most eatable supplies also come from Iran.
Around 60 to 70 per cent petrol pumps have been closed due to suspension of supply of Iranian smuggled oil through Makran, Rakhshan and Chagai areas. The petrol pumps selling smuggled Iranian petrol and diesel were already closed by the district administration last week, which also added to citizens’ woes in Quetta and other districts.
 
 

Those involved in the Iranian petrol business had increased prices, selling petrol for Rs280 to 300 per litre in the black market, while the government had fixed the local petrol price at Rs254 per litre.
The petrol supply from Karachi was also affected due to the road blockade between Quetta and the port city at different points.
‘No fuel shortage’
However, the Balochistan government claimed that there was no fuel shortage in the province, as most petrol pumps were open in the provincial capital.
In a statement, provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind refuted the impression that the province was facing a fuel shortage.
He said that petrol stations selling Iranian oil are safety hazards, citing 28 fuel-related accidents across Quetta in the past month, including incidents on Airport Road and in Hazar Ganji area.
“These so-called shortages are being exaggerated by those who want to lift the ban on smuggled Iranian fuel,” Rind said, adding that strict action is being taken to ensure the supply of legal petrol through registered pumps. Petrol stations found involved in hoarding or refusing service will face immediate legal consequences, he warned.
Global oil price volatility
The escalating conflict between Israel and Iran has raised significant concerns in global markets, particularly in the energy sector, due to both countries’ strategic positions in the Middle East, a region critical to the global oil supply chain.
Investors were on edge ahead of markets reopening late on Sunday, gripped by anxiety over the escalating threat of a sweeping conflict in the Middle East and nationwide protests against President Donald Trump, according to Reuters.
Oil prices rose by 7pc on Friday, as Israel and Iran traded strikes, and investors will be watching closely to see how prices react when markets open today (Monday).
Israel’s strikes on Iran’s oil and gas industry lifted oil prices and prompted a rush into gold and the dollar, which resumed its role as a safe-haven asset for the first time in months.
Oil prices at close to six-month highs could pose a risk to the inflation outlook, as central banks around the world grapple with the impact on prices from Trump’s trade tariffs and the effect on economic growth.
Energy experts said if hostilities remain limited to tit-for-tat strikes without affecting shipping lanes or oil fields then oil prices may see short-term volatility, but stabilise quickly later.
In other case, if the conflict escalates, impacting the Strait of Hormuz or drags in other countries, the oil prices could surge above $100 per barrel, they feared.

Earlier, on Feb 11, Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said he had formally written to the government and the opposition, seeking nominations for the parliamentary panel.
“The parliamentary committee will be formed once the nominations are received,” he had said during a sitting of the National Assembly.
A spokesperson for the National Assembly said on Sunday that the speaker has so far not received any formal letter from the prime minister about the formation of the parliamentary committee for the appointment of the CEC and two members of the ECP.
“The process will commence only once the letter is officially received”, the spokesman added.
He further said that the premier had already initiated the required consultation with the Leader of the Opposition on May 16, 2025, in accordance with Clause 2A of Article 213 of the Constitution.
“This consultation is aimed at finalising three names each for the posts of Chief Election Commissi­oner and members of the Election Commission from Sindh and Balochistan.”
The spokesperson said that as soon as the consultation process is completed, the speaker will invite nominations from the respective parliamentary leaders in Parliament for the constitution of the said parliamentary committee, as per Clause 2B of Article 213 of the Constitution.
Meanwhile, a senior official of the National Assembly Secretariat respo­nded to a letter written by Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan, seeking the formation of a parliamentary panel on the appointment of a new CEC and two ECP members.
The letter, seen by Dawn, draws the attention of the opposition leader to clauses 2A and 2B of Article 213 read with Clause 2B of Article 218 of the Constitution.
Clause 2A of Article 213 reads, “The Prime Minister shall in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, forward three names for appointment of the Commissioner to a Parliamentary Committee for hearing and confirmation of any one person”.
Clause 2B reads, “The Parliame­ntary Committee to be constituted by the Speaker shall comprise fifty percent members from the Treasury Benches and fifty percent from the Opposition Parties, based on their strength in Majlis-e-Shoora (Parlia­ment), to be nominated by the respective Parliamentary Leaders.”
However, none of the two clauses appears to restrict formation of a parliamentary committee before the completion of the consultation process.
On June 4, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had written a letter to Mr Khan inviting him for consultation on appointment of CEC and two members of the Commission without specifying any date.
The five-year term of the chief election commissioner and two ECP members had expired on January 26 but under a controversial amendment they will continue to hold their offices till the appointment of their successors.

The ministry provided written details to the National Assembly in response to a question from lawmaker Shazia Marri, who had asked for the year-wise number of repatriated Pakistanis, particularly those held for minor or non-criminal offences. 
According to the ministry, the repatriated citizens had been imprisoned in 22 countries for offences including drug-related crimes, immigration violations, illegal entry and other mixed cases. 
“Our diplomatic missions provide extensive support services that encompass legal assistance, medical care, and financial aid to ensure that no Pakistani citizen faces these challenges alone,” the ministry said.  

Most prisoners brought back from from Malaysia, Oman, Iraq and Saudi Arabia

“Our missions’ consular services have successfully facilitated the repatriation of these people.”  
The report covered repatriations from 2022 to 2025. 
Of the 18,533 repatriated individuals, 5,908 were returned from Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia); 5,435 from Muscat (Oman); 3,570 from Baghdad (Iraq); 1,563 from Riyadh (Saudi Arabia); and 935 from Tripoli (Libya). 
Other repatriations included 530 from Athens (Greece); 245 from Astana (Kazakhstan); 110 from New York (United States); 56 from Colombo (Sri Lanka); 37 from Algiers (Algeria); 35 from Male (Maldives); 20 each from Rome (Italy) and Manila (Philippines); 16 from Bangkok (Thailand); 15 from Abuja (Nigeria); 10 from Chengdu (China); seven from Mashhad (Iran); and six each from Manchester (United Kingdom) and Beijing (China).  
Smaller numbers were also repatriated from cities including two from Kathmandu (Nepal), five from Beirut (Lebanon) and two Singapore. 
Additionally, the ministry reported that 8,559 prisoners were released from Saudi Arabia over five years, describing it as the single largest success. 
48 Pakistani prisoners were repatriated from Maldives during 2018-2024, while 69 prisoners were released from Qatar through Emiri Pardons — 23 in December 2023 and 46 during Ramadan 2024.  
In Iran, 46 cases were resolved, with 14 repatriated in 2020 and 32 granted amnesty and negotiations are ongoing for 60 additional cases. The ministry also noted that the Qatar distributed 50 riyals per prisoner to 200 individuals. 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reiterated its commitment to protecting and assisting Pakistani nationals abroad, particularly those in vulnerable situations within foreign judicial systems.

According to a notification seen by Dawn.com, the finance division stated that the new prices had been determined “based on the recommendations of Ogra (Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority) and the relevant ministries”.
From June 16, high-speed diesel (HSD), which previously cost Rs254.64 per litre, will now be sold for Rs262.59.
Similarly, petrol, which cost Rs253.63 per litre, will now be available for Rs258.43.
Previous estimates suggested that petrol and diesel prices would increase by ab­­­­out Re1 and Rs5 per lit­re, respectively, for the next fortnight, owing to higher international market prices.
Based on existing tax ra­­­­tes, informed sources said that the ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to go up by about Re1 per litre depending on final calculation on June 15, followed by a Rs5 per litre increase in HSD.
Earlier this week, under an iron-clad commitment with the International Monetary Fund, the government announced the imposition of Rs77 per litre petroleum levy and Rs5 per litre carbon levy on furnace oil and Rs2.5 per litre charge on petrol and diesel from July 1.</p><small>2025-06-15 20:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/152117347c3908a.jpg?r=214609' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917322/indus-river-remains-colonised-activists-call-out-extractive-state-policies' target='_blank'><strong>‘Indus River remains colonised’: Activists call out extractive state policies</strong></a><br><p>The Indus River remains colonised, declared activists, lawyers, and civil society members at a climate justice conference in Karachi on Sunday, calling for resistance against extractive policies and the erasure of indigenous knowledge.
Arranged by the Climate Action Centre, ‘The Indus Resistance Conference’, held for the first time, is a forum aiming to amplify the voices of “frontline defenders” against the exploitation of natural resources.
The first of its kind, the conference brought together women, the working class, lawyers, students and journalists committed to the cause of climate justice. Pakistan was ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022.
“The Indus River is on its deathbed,” said Yasir Darya, founder of the Climate Action Centre (CAC), as he initiated the one-day conference, addressing resource theft and climate injustice in Sindh.
He called for granting the river “personhood status” to ensure its preservation against what he termed “colonial policies, water theft, and capitalist interests”.
Advocate Abira Ashfaq of CAC’s Green Chamber, speaking to Dawn.com, explained what the status of personhood for the Indus River would mean: “If we can have people look at the rights of the river, perhaps that could be a roundabout way to get them to look at other ecological damage that is happening.”
She added, “If a corporation can have legal standing, then why can’t a body of nature?
“It would also be a way to bring in other ecological conversations into the fold — about poverty, about canals on the Indus, about villages, rural rights, the rights of women farmers,” Ashfaq said.
“We talk about how indigenous people have knowledge, which we often take as wisdom — but it is knowledge that is never taken into account.”
 
 

Calling out the state’s “hypocrisy” on water resources in Sindh, former Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) vice president Zubair Abro criticised the contrast between Pakistan’s domestic policies and its international stance.
“Pakistan justifies water allocation on the basis that it is a lower riparian country, but in the same breath, it denies that right to lower riparian areas within the country,” he said while speaking at a panel discussion at the event.
He also noted that the existing water distribution treaties — the Indus Water Treaty and the 1991 Water Apportionment Accord — do not include any provisions for climate or environmental preservation. Abro called for a revision of the agreements.
Challenging what she described as “imperialist extractive policies” enacted by the state on the river, Advocate Romisa Jami said that the Indus River has been made into a commodity.
“It was never meant to be a commodity,” she added.
She urged the audience to view the issue through the lens of “decolonisation”.
While the Indus River is an entire ecosystem for the people of Sindh, “to colonial masters, it offers an opportunity for extraction”, said Jami.
She attributed the loss of sustainable agricultural practices to the “building of irrigation projects by the British Empire”. Jami emphasised that people have come to “inherit our colonial past, which has always been profit-driven and never human-centric”. She recommended an overhaul of the existing system as the only way forward.
 
 

Speakers also raised alarm over recent canal construction and corporate farming initiatives introduced under the Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI), which sparked protests across Sindh, particularly in Baberloi, where demonstrations continued for days until the canal project was shelved. However, the corporate farming initiative remains in place.
Advocate Kazim Mahesar, activist Amar Haseeb Panhwar and Advocate Riaz Sabzoi — who were involved in the protests — spoke during a panel discussion on resource theft, warning that corporate farming was “just a guise for land theft”.
“We are told to go to court against these decisions, but with the 26th Amendment in place, the doors of justice have been closed for us,” said Panhwar.
Mahesar alleged that “Sindh’s land has been stolen under corporate farming”. He added, “It’s not that we are against development — we only stand against destruction.”
He further argued that such development projects “are only for the elite”, adding that “there is nothing in it for the common man.”
Historian Hafeez Baloch, also speaking on the panel, recalled that Malir — where he was born and raised — was among the first victims of land grabbing in Sindh.
“Malir was an agricultural land, but it was stolen and handed over to capitalists,” he said.
He also referred to the late scholar Gul Hassan Kalmati, who had warned that “what is happening in Malir will eventually happen to the rest of Sindh as well”.</p><small>2025-06-15 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609339-na-speaker-turns-down-omar-ayubs-demand-to-form-committee-on-ecp-appointments' target='_blank'><strong>NA speaker turns down Omar Ayub's demand to form committee on ECP appointments</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed that 450 Pakistani pilgrims were evacuated from Iran earlier today, with more to follow from the neighbouring country as well as from Iraq.
Israel launched an air offensive against Iran on Friday, killing commanders and scientists and bombing nuclear sites in a stated bid to stop Tehran building an atomic weapon, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.
According to statements issued by deputy commissioners (DC) across the province today, the Balochistan government has closed all Iranian borders adjacent to the Gwadar district and imposed a ban on travel corridors due to the deteriorating situation in the region.
A statement issued by the Gwadar DC’s office said, “In light of instructions from the Balochistan government, the Gwadar district administration has closed the corridor at the Gabd-Kalato 250 border until further notice.
“The public is requested to cooperate and contact the district administration for any information or guidance,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, the Panjgur district administration also closed all crossing points connected to Iran for an indefinite period, stating that this decision was taken as a precautionary measure due to the current regional security situation.
The announcement said that not only movement by foot through these routes been halted, but the delivery of fuel has also been completely banned.
The Panjgur DC maintained that these measures were taken due to “the possible uncertain situation in Iran and the security threats arising from international tensions”.
“The district administration has appealed to the public to fully cooperate with … in the current situation and avoid unnecessary movement in order to avoid any unexpected situation,” the statement read.
Meanwhile, in a post on X this afternoon, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the government was taking necessary measures for the welfare and safety of Pakistani nationals.
 






He noted that 450 Pakistani zaireen (pilgrims) had been evacuated from Iran yesterday. Arrangements have been made for the safe evacuation of Pakistani students currently residing in Iran, including 154 in the first batch.
“Our Embassy in Iraq is in contact with Pakistani zaireen who are stranded due to the closure of airspace,” Dar said on X. “Measures are underway to ensure their safe stay in Iraq and possible evacuation.”
He noted that the Crisis Management Unit at the Foreign Office is operational 247 and can be contacted at:
+92 51-9207887  and cmu1@mofa.gov.pk
“Our embassies in the region are closely coordinating all necessary efforts to support Pakistani nationals and zaireen,” Dar added.
Following Israel’s initial strikes, PM Shehbaz on Friday directed all relevant authorities to provide every possible assistance for the safe return and protection of Pakistani pilgrims currently in Iran.
The Foreign Office also advised all pilgrims from Pakistan to reconsider their travel plans to Iran and Iraq in view of the evolving security situation in the region.
Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran Mudasir Tipu is currently in his home country for official meetings, the FO said.
“The embassy under the instructions of the foreign minister along with Ministry of Foreign Affairs are working to extend all possible facilitation to Pakistanis in Iran,” it added.
Dar, Turkish FM express concern
Dar received a telephone call on Sunday from Foreign Minister of Turkiye Hakan Fidan as both leaders expressed “deep concern and anguish over the deteriorating regional situation due to Israel’s unjustified attacks on Iran”.
He also confirmed his participation in the forthcoming meeting of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM), and the Islamic Cooperation Youth Forum’s (ICYF) ceremony both scheduled to be held next week in Istanbul.
PM Shehbaz had earlier during a telephonic call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirmed Pakistan’s presence in the events.
PM Shehbaz said Dar would represent Pakistan at the upcoming OIC CFM meeting in Istanbul. He also congratulated President Erdogan for being honoured by the ICYF. The OIC CFM is scheduled to take place in Istanbul from 21-22 June.</p><small>2025-06-15 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609343-baseless-propaganda-pakistan-denies-supplying-ballistic-missiles-to-iran' target='_blank'><strong>'Baseless propaganda': Pakistan denies supplying ballistic missiles to Iran</strong></a><br><p>

According to the first information report (FIR) filed by the slain man’s brother, Mazhar Iqbal, 51-year-old Zafar Iqbal had returned from Faisalabad to Mardan after many years. Zafar was accompanied by his wife, Farzana alias Gul Bibi, aged 40.
Mazhar stated that the couple was at his house when the suspects forcibly entered and opened indiscriminate fire on his brother and sister-in-law, killing them on the spot. He added that he, along with his wife and children, narrowly escaped the attack.
He nominated suspects Sarbuland, Munir Khan, Asad Shah, and Imran — all residents of Jehangira — along with Wajid and Muhammad Hussain from Babenai.
The complainant urged the police to register a case against them for trespassing, attacking his family, causing bodily damage, and murdering his brother and sister-in-law, the FIR said.
Muhammad Faheem, spokesperson for the Mardan district police officer, told Dawn.com that the couple had married of their own free will about 17 years ago. He said the man had returned to his brother’s home in Mardan after several years from Faisalabad.
Faheem claimed that the woman’s family allegedly carried out the attack and fled the scene. However, efforts are underway to arrest the suspects, he added.
He said the bodies of the deceased were taken to the Type D Hospital in Katlang, Mardan, where Zafar’s brother recorded his statement with a team from the Jabr police station.
The FIR is lodged under the following sections of the Pakistan Penal Code; 302 (punishment of premeditated murder), 311 (punishment for premeditated murder after the right of qisas (retribution) has been waived), 324 (attempt to commit murder), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed), and 449 (house trespass in order to commit offence punishable with death).
‘Honour’ killings refer to the murder of individuals, predominantly women and girls, by family members who believe the victim has brought dishonour upon the family.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab.
From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country. The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.
In 2023, the country saw a total of 490 ‘honour’ killing incidents taking place, while in 2022, as many as 590 people lost their lives to ‘honour’ killings.</p><small>2025-06-15 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15193804644426f.jpg?r=194123' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917320/trump-administration-weighs-adding-36-countries-to-travel-ban-memo-says' target='_blank'><strong>Trump administration weighs adding 36 countries to travel ban, memo says</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s administration is considering significantly expanding its travel ban by potentially banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable seen by Reuters.
Earlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against “foreign terrorists” and other national security threats.
The directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from US universities and deport others.
In an internal diplomatic cable signed by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.
“The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days,” the cable sent out over the weekend said.
The cable was first reported by The Washington Post.
Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said. Another was “questionable security” of that country’s passport.
Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed. Some countries were overstaying the US visas their citizens were being granted.
Other reasons for concern were the nationals of the country were involved in acts of terrorism in the United States, or anti-Semitic and anti-American activity. The cable noted that not all of these concerns pertained to every country listed.
The countries that could face a full or a partial ban if they do not address these concerns within the next 60 days are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote D’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, Egypt, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
That would be a significant expansion of the ban that came into effect earlier this month. The countries affected were Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
The entry of people from seven other countries — Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela — has also been partially restricted.
During his first term in office, Trump announced a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.</p><small>2025-06-15 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15191133ec09ea0.jpg?r=192520' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917318/bitcoin-pioneer-michael-saylor-lauds-pakistans-crypto-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Bitcoin pioneer Michael Saylor lauds Pakistan’s crypto efforts</strong></a><br><p>American entrepreneur Michael Saylor on Sunday lauded Pakistan’s efforts to move towards cryptocurrency and digital assets, according to a press release from the office of the State Minister on Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib.
Pakistan is establishing itself as a key player in the global cryptocurrency economy and setting trends rather than following them in the digital currency space, said Saqib, who is also the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) Chief Executive Officer.
The PCC was officially launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
According to the press release, Saylor had a meeting with Saqib and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, where the discussion revolved around how Bitcoin can serve as a tool for sovereign reserves, monetary
resilience and driving long-term digital economic transformation.
Calling Saylor “one of the most influential voices in Bitcoin’s institutional adoption”, the statement outlined that his enterprise software company Strategy holds the largest corporate reserve of Bitcoin.
“His (Saylor’s) advocacy echoes the [US President Donald] Trump-era vision of economic sovereignty, decentralisation of financial power and investment in long-term national strength through hard digital assets,” the statement read.
“Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in the development and adoption of digital assets, setting a benchmark for innovation, regulation and inclusive growth in the digital economy,” Aurangzeb was quoted as saying.
Saqib was quoted as saying that Saylor’s work in the crypto field transformed Bitcoin into a “sovereign-grade asset”.
“In five years, Mr Saylor transformed a mid-sized software firm into a $100 billion company, purely through strategic vision, bold conviction and disciplined execution,” Saqib said. “If private individuals can build that in the US, why can’t Pakistan, as a nation, do the same? We have the talent, the story, and the energy.”
According to the statement, Saylor praised Pakistan’s efforts to take a “forward-looking, innovation-friendly stance in the global digital economy” and welcomed the opportunity to support ongoing developments and advise.
“Pakistan has many brilliant people. It also has commitment and clarity needed by businesses globally,” Saylor was quoted as saying.
“Bitcoin is the strongest asset for long-term national resilience,” he added. “Emerging markets like Pakistan have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to leapfrog into the future of finance.”
The statement hailed the dialogue as “another milestone in Pakistan’s effort to build a robust digital assets policy framework, attract global institutional interest and position itself as a Web3 and Bitcoin-ready emerging market”.
Earlier this month, the PCC agreed to form a technical committee to draft a framework for digital and virtual assets, the Ministry of Finance announced in a statement.
According to the ministry’s press release, the council’s launch marks a “significant step in the country’s efforts to regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets into its financial landscape”.
“The council is set to play a pivotal role in formulating policies, fostering innovation, and ensuring a secure and forward-thinking approach to crypto adoption in Pakistan,” the Finance Division said.</p><small>2025-06-15 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609330-war-only-option-if-india-blocks-pakistans-water-says-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>War only option if India blocks Pakistan's water, says Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

While Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney says his priorities are strengthening peace and security, building critical mineral supply chains and creating jobs, issues such as US tariffs and the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine are expected to feature heavily.
US ally Israel launched a barrage of strikes across Iran on Thursday, a blow to Trump’s diplomatic efforts to prevent such an attack.
The summit will take place in the mountain resort of Kananaskis, some 90 kilometres west of Calgary.
The last time Canada played host, in 2018, Trump left the summit before denouncing then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as “very dishonest and weak” and instructing the US delegation to withdraw its approval of the final communique.
“This will be a successful meeting if Donald Trump doesn’t have an eruption that disrupts the entire gathering. Anything above and beyond that is gravy,” said University of Ottawa international affairs professor Roland Paris, who was foreign policy adviser to Trudeau.

Trump has often mused about annexing Canada and arrives at a time when Carney is threatening reprisals if Washington does not lift tariffs on steel and aluminum.
“The best-case scenario … is that there’s no real blow-ups coming out of the back end,” said Josh Lipsky, the chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council think tank and a former White House and State Department official.
Carney’s office declined to comment on how the Israeli strikes would affect the summit.
No joint communique
Diplomats said Canada has ditched the idea of a traditional comprehensive joint communique and would issue chair summaries instead, in hopes of containing a disaster and maintaining engagement with the US.
A senior Canadian official told reporters Ottawa wanted to focus on actions the seven members — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States — could take together.
Canadian Senator Peter Boehm, a veteran former diplomat who acted as Trudeau’s personal representative to the 2018 summit, said he had been told the summit would last longer than usual to give time for bilateral meetings with the US president.
Expected guests for parts of the Sunday to Tuesday event include leaders from Ukraine, Mexico, India, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and Brazil, who all have reasons to want to talk to Trump.

“Many will want to talk to President Trump about their own particular interests and concerns,” Boehm said by phone.
A senior US official said on Friday working discussions would cover trade and the global economy, critical minerals, migrant and drug smuggling, wildfires, international security, artificial intelligence and energy security.
“The president is eager to pursue his goals in all of these areas including making Americas trade relationships fair and reciprocal,” the official said.
The visit of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to the Oval Office in February descended into acrimony and has served as a warning for other world leaders about the delicate dance they face in negotiating with Trump.
But diplomats say the frustration of dealing with the Trump administration has made some keener to assert themselves.
Canada has long been one of Ukraine’s most vocal supporters. Trump came to power promising to end the war with Russia within 24 hours but diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have stalled.
One Ukrainian official involved in preparations for the summit said hope had faded for a strong statement in support of Ukraine. Instead, success for Kyiv would merely constitute an amicable meeting between Trump and Zelensky.
A European official said the G7 summit and the Nato summit in The Hague later in June provided an opportunity to underscore to Trump the need to press ahead with a sanctions bill put together by US senators alongside a new European package to pressure Russia into a ceasefire and broader talks.
Early test
Trump’s first international summit will offer some early clues on whether Trump is interested in working with allies to solve common problems, said Max Bergmann, a director at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.
“The big overarching question here is, basically, is the United States still committed to formats like the G7? That is going to be the big test,” Bergmann said.
French President Emmanuel Macron has said he has a good, but frank relationship with Trump despite differences on subjects such as Ukraine or climate change.
Macron said on Friday that a United Nations conference co-hosted between France and Saudi Arabia scheduled after the G7 to work towards a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians has been postponed.
India’s Modi visits Cyprus to advance trade corridor plans
Modi arrived in Cyprus on Sunday in a visit focused on the potential role the island could play in linking India to Europe via a trade corridor, officials said.
The Indian PM, who was on his way to the G7 summit in Canada, and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides were scheduled to address business leaders on Sunday and hold formal talks on Monday.
India is pursuing the so-called India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) trade link by sea and rail, but the visit is being held in the shadow of a rapidly escalating crisis in the Middle East.

“One of the objectives of our discussions is the connection of India with Europe through the region of the wider Middle East, (and) its entry into Europe through the Republic of Cyprus,” Christodoulides told journalists earlier on Sunday.
The two-day visit is part of a broader diplomatic outreach to European nations. Cyprus assumes the rotating EU presidency for six months in early 2026. The two countries have close relations through their shared membership of the Commonwealth.</p><small>2025-06-15 13:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15165434b6556dd.jpg?r=165457' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917313/ukraine-says-received-another-1200-bodies-from-russia' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine says received another 1,200 bodies from Russia</strong></a><br><p>Ukraine on Sunday said it had received another transfer of 1,200 bodies from Russia as part of an exchange agreement struck in Istanbul talks earlier this month.
“Another 1,200 bodies which the Russian side claims belong to Ukrainian citizens, including military personnel, were returned to Ukraine,” Kyiv’s headquarters for the treatment of prisoners of war wrote on social media.
“In total, 4,812 bodies have been returned this week,” Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said on Facebook. “I am grateful to everyone involved in this humanitarian mission,” he said.
Ukraine has not said whether it has transferred any bodies to the Russian side.
The two sides agreed a large-scale exchange of prisoners and bodies of killed soldiers during their latest round of direct talks in Istanbul on June 2.
Both Russia and Ukraine typically do not disclose their military losses.
In a rare public estimate, President Volodymyr Zelensky told US news outlet NBC earlier this year that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and some 380,000 wounded.
Russia has not announced its military deaths since September 2022, when it said fewer than 6,000 soldiers had been killed — a figure believed to be vastly lower than reality.
Several independent investigations using open sources, such as the publication of death announcements by local officials and family members, have reported massive death tolls for Moscow’s army.
The Russian website Mediazona and the BBC’s Russian service said they had identified the names of some 111,000 killed Russian soldiers.</p><small>2025-06-15 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15160640c6c7414.jpg?r=161121' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917310/several-arrested-arms-recovered-in-bannu-joint-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Several arrested, arms recovered in Bannu joint operation</strong></a><br><p>Several suspects were arrested and a cache of heavy weapons seized during a joint search and strike operation carried out by the police, counter terrorism department, and the army in Bannu district of Khyber Pakthunkwa.
In a statement, Bannu police spokesperson, Khanzala Quraishi, said law enforcement agencies received a tip-off about the presence of suspicious individuals in Barganto and Kam Chashmi areas within the jurisdiction of Domel police station.
Acting on the information, a large-scale operation was swiftly launched on the instructions of Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and led by District Police Officer Saleem Abbas Kalachi, on the reported presence of terrorists.
Bannu Brigade Commander Brigadier Naveed Ahmed, SP CTD Fazal Wahid, SP Investigation Sajid Mumtaz, SP Rural Mahmood Nawaz, SDPOs, SHOs, CTD officials, Quick Response Force (QRF), Ladies Police, BDS, and Pakistan Army personnel participated in the operation.
During the operation, police deployed modern technology, including drone cameras, to monitor and search suspected houses and locations in the area, which had been flagged for the presence of “drug dealers, proclaimed offenders, and suspected terrorists”.
According to police, 40 suspects were taken into custody and shifted to an undisclosed location for interrogation. A large cache of weapons was also recovered from their possession.
In a statement, DPO Bannu Saleem Abbas Kalachi said, “The purpose of these coordinated operations is to rid the area of crime, drugs, and terrorism, ensuring that citizens feel safe and secure. Bannu Police will continue such effective operations in the future to maintain peace and order in the region.”
RPO Sajjad Khan, while congratulating all officers on the successful operation, said, Bannu police and CTD teams have “successfully carried out a major operation with professionalism, discipline, and courage”.
“Such operations not only dismantle criminal networks but also strengthen public trust in the police We are committed to maintaining peace and order across the region at all costs,” he added.
Police earlier on Friday claimed to have arrested a terrorist during a search and strike operation in the Miryan area of Bannu district.
An official said that the operation was launched on the directives of district police officer Saleem Abbas Kulachi.
He said that a police party jointly headed by Miryan SHO Anwar Khattak and additional SHO Zaman Shah Khan raided a suspected hideout in a rural area and arrested a terrorist, identified as Rafiullah.
“The terrorist had been wanted by the Miryan and Janikhel police in murder, attempted murder and terrorism related cases since 2009 as he had killed eight people and injured six others in different incidents,” the official said, adding that a case was registered against him under relevant sections of law.</p><small>2025-06-15 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609303-field-marshal-asim-munir-welcomed-in-us-with-times-square-appreciation-campaign' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Asim Munir welcomed in US with Times Square appreciation campaign</strong></a><br><p>

Along with the NTSB, officials from the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) were in Ahmedabad in western India’s Gujarat state surveying the crash site, said one source with direct knowledge.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board bound for Gatwick Airport south of London began losing height seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday, and erupted in a huge fireball as it hit buildings below.
 
 

All but one on board were declared dead in the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade. Around 30 people died on the ground.
Air India and the Indian government were looking at several aspects of the crash including issues linked to its engine thrust, flaps, and why the landing gear remained open as the plane took off and then came down.
The secretary of the US Department of Transport, Sean Duffy, said on Friday he was in the process of deploying a team from the FAA and the NTSB to India. Boeing and GE, whose engines were used in the plane, were also sending teams.
“We’ll take action should any recommendations come forward from the NTSBs investigation,” Duffy said.
The FAA and NSTB did not immediately respond to Reuters queries outside regular business hours.
The FAA has said India will lead the investigation, but the NTSB is the official US representative for providing assistance, while the FAA provides technical support.
Boeing officials will also look at various parameters in their inspections, including the angle of landing, as they investigate the matter, said the first source.
In all, around 10 officials were present at the site on Sunday, including from the NTSB, said the second source.
India’s aviation regulator has ordered all Boeing 787s being operated by local carriers to be inspected.
The crash brings a fresh challenge for both Air India which has for years being trying to revamp its fleet, and Boeing, which is trying to rebuild public trust following a series of safety and production crises.
In Ahmedabad, doctors were struggling to identify bodies that were charred in the incident, resorting to dental samples and DNA profiling.
DNA samples of 32 victims from the crash have been successfully matched, Rajnish Patel, additional superintendent at the city’s main hospital, said on Sunday.
“The bodies for which DNA samples have been matched are being handed over to the families with due respect,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-15 10:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15141114071d3b6.jpg?r=141702' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917299/3-brothers-drown-as-car-plunges-into-river-in-gb' target='_blank'><strong>3 brothers drown as car plunges into river in GB</strong></a><br><p>At least three members of a family died and three others went missing on Sunday after their car plunged into a river stream in the Shinbar area of district Nagar, Gilgit-Baltistan.
Rescue 1122 official Nizamuddin told Dawn.com that the family was returning from a marriage ceremony when their car plunged into a stream, resulting in the drowning of six people and injuries to one.
He said rescue divers had recovered three bodies, while a search operation was ongoing to locate the remaining three missing individuals.
Sajid Ali, spokesperson for the Nagar district police officer, also confirmed the incident and said the car was en route to Chalt Bala when it plunged into the river stream.
He added that the bodies were transported to the District Headquarters Hospital in Nagar, while the injured had been referred to a hospital in Gilgit for further treatment.
The spokesperson identified the deceased as Ghulam Abbas, Sher Baz Ali, and Zohaib Ahmad. Those reported missing are Sharafat Hussain, Muhammad Hussain, and Aleem, while Kashif Hussain received injuries.
He said the three victims, who were brothers, were returning from the Bardas area after attending a wedding ceremony when the incident took place.
Gilgit Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said the accident was “regrettable”. He said Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed sorrow over the incident and instructed all relevant departments, including the Home Secretary, to mobilise all available resources in the search for the missing individuals.
According to the spokesperson, the vehicle carrying seven passengers was returning from a wedding ceremony when it plunged into the river late last night.
Following the chief minister’s directives, rescue teams were dispatched to the site and efforts are underway to locate the remaining missing persons, he added.
Many accidents occur on Gilgit Baltistan’s roads due to its challenging and treacherous terrain, which becomes particularly dangerous during harsh weather conditions.
The lack of proper safety barriers, limited visibility, and inadequate maintenance further increase the risk of accidents, making it one of the more hazardous routes in the region.</p><small>2025-06-15 09:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15141646ea71a5f.jpg?r=141652' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917301/police-file-fir-over-rape-of-disabled-14-year-old-girl-in-punjabs-hafizabad' target='_blank'><strong>Police file FIR over rape of disabled 14-year-old girl in Punjab’s Hafizabad</strong></a><br><p>Police have registered a first information report (FIR) in the case of a 14-year-old girl with mental and physical disabilities being allegedly sexually assaulted in Punjab’s Hafizabad district.
Sahil’s Six Months Cruel Numbers data reveals that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country last year.
In the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported. 48 cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.
The victim was brought to the hospital due to her health condition, where, during a medical check-up, it was discovered that she was six months pregnant.
An application for action was filed by the victim’s family on Saturday at the City Hafizabad Police Station, on which case number 1152/25 was formally registered on Sunday under Section 376 (3) (Whoever commits rape of a minor or a person with mental or physical disability, shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life and fine) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Rana Sultan Mahmood has been named as the plaintiff in the FIR.
The victim is a child with congenital disabilities, unable to speak, hear or walk, and is also mentally immature and unconscious. Her parents stated in the FIR that they belonged to a poor and illiterate family and were unable to learn about the incident due to their daughter’s physical condition.
Investigation into the incident revealed that the suspect allegedly found the girl alone in the Hussainabad neighbourhood six months ago and sexually assaulted her. After the incident, he went into hiding.
Hafizabad District Police Officer (DPO) Atif Nazir Kadhar has taken immediate notice of the incident and ordered the DSP City Circle to submit a report. The DPO has also issued instructions for the immediate arrest of the suspect.
 
 

According to police officials, the accused will be arrested within the next 48 hours, while the victim’s family is being provided with full protection.
In May, police said they had arrested four suspects involved in an alleged gang rape of a mentally-challenged minor in Lahore earlier this month.
Also last month, A madrassah teacher in Muzaffargarh district of Punjab was arrested for allegedly raping an 11-year-old student at a seminary.</p><small>2025-06-15 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/15135127e2016dd.jpg?r=135353' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917303/pmd-says-chances-of-rain-thunderstorm-in-karachi-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>PMD says chances of rain, thunderstorm in Karachi tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Karachi is expected to receive rain on Monday, accompanied by a dust thunderstorm, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
The PMD has predicted that a “westerly wave is affecting upper parts of the country & moist currents also penetrating in eastern parts of the province”.
Cloudy weather with temperatures ranging from 36–38 degrees Celsius is expected to persist throughout the metropolis tomorrow. Humidity levels are expected to touch 70-80 per cent in the morning.
“Dust-thunderstorm /rain likely in Karachi division on tomorrow & isolated places at outskirts of Karachi division on Tuesday,” the weather advisory read.
Under the influence of this system, the following parts of Sindh are expected to receive rain accompanied by dust thunderstorm at isolated places today: Ghotki, Sukkur, Jacobabad, Qamber Shahdadkot, Shikarpur, Khairpur, Dadu, Nosheroferoz, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tharparker, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, T.M.Khan, T.A.Yar, Hyderabad, Mitiari, Thatta, Sujawal, Badin and Jamshoro districts.
The forecast predicts light to moderate rainfall accompanied by dust thunderstorms on 16th-17th June.
Every year, Karachi gets flooded by rains, causing widespread disruption to public life and their safety. Last year in August, Mayor Karachi declared a state of emergency ahead of the downpour to tackle management efforts. The five-day rain spell left a trail of destruction in its wake, washing away roads and crippling civic life.
Last month, at least 13 civilians died and 92 others were injured as heavy rains lashed several parts of Punjab.</p><small>2025-06-15 09:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/151341162452382.jpg?r=134533' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917286/trump-flexes-military-might-at-parade-as-protests-sweep-us' target='_blank'><strong>Trump flexes military might at parade as protests sweep US</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump hosted the largest US military parade in decades on his 79th birthday on Saturday, as protesters rallied across the country to accuse him of acting like a dictator.
Trump hailed the United States as the “hottest country in the world” after watching tanks, aircraft, and troops file past him in Washington to honour the 250th anniversary of the US army.
But it formed a stark split screen with turmoil at home and abroad, as police used teargas to disperse protesters in Los Angeles and US ally Israel traded missile fire with Iran in a rapidly escalating conflict in the Middle East.
Trump’s parade on an overcast night in Washington came after tens of thousands of “No Kings” demonstrators thronged the streets in cities including New York, Philadelphia, Houston and Atlanta.
Trump largely avoided his usual domestic political diatribes in an unusually brief speech, and instead focused on praising the US army, saying that they “fight, fight, fight, and they win, win, win”.

The display of military might comes as Trump asserts his power domestically and on the international stage.
In his address to the parade, Trump sent a warning to Washington’s adversaries of “total and complete” defeat, with the United States increasingly at risk of getting tangled up in Israel’s conflict with Iran.
“Time and again, America’s enemies have learned that if you threaten the American people, our soldiers are coming for you,” Trump said.
‘Happy Birthday’
Trump had openly dreamed since his first term as president of having a grand military parade, of the type more often seen in Moscow or Pyongyang than Washington.
The last such parade in the United States was at the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
When it came, Trump stood and saluted on a stage outside the White House as tanks rumbled past, aircraft roared overhead, and nearly 7,000 troops marched past.
Troops and military hardware from different eras of US history passed by, with an announcer reeling off victories in battles with Japanese, German, Chinese and Vietnamese forces in past wars.
The army said it cost up to $45 million.
But while the crowd sang “Happy Birthday” and there were occasional chants of “USA! USA!”, the atmosphere was less intense than one of the barnstorming rallies that swept Trump to power.
The White House said that “over 250,000 patriots showed up” for the event, without providing evidence. Communications Director Steven Cheung described the “No Kings” protests as a “complete and utter failure”.
“No Kings” organisers said protesters gathered in hundreds of cities, with AFP journalists seeing large crowds in several cities.

Organisers said they were protesting against Trump’s dictatorial overreach, and in particular what they described as the strongman symbolism of the parade.
“I think people are mad as hell,” Lindsay Ross, a 28-year-old musician, told AFP in New York, where tens of thousands of people rallied.
‘Display of authoritarianism’
Thousands turned out in Los Angeles to protest Trump’s deployment of troops in the country’s second-largest city following clashes sparked by immigration raids.
Police in Los Angeles used tear gas and mounted officers to clear protesters who had gathered in front of the federal building in downtown, the focus of demonstrations for the last week.
AFP reporters at the scene said there was no disorder, but it appeared local officers were moving people away from an area where National Guard troops and Marines are stationed.
Some protesters targeted Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida — while a small group even gathered in Paris.
“I think it’s disgusting,” protester Sarah Hargrave, 42, said in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, describing Trump’s parade as a “display of authoritarianism”.
The killing of a Democratic lawmaker and her husband Saturday in the northern state of Minnesota — in what the governor called a targeted attack — also cast a pall over the parade.
Trump was quick to condemn the attacks outside Minneapolis in which former state speaker Melissa Hortman was killed along with her husband, while another state lawmaker and his wife were hospitalised with gunshot wounds.</p><small>2025-06-15 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1511291179a3d82.jpg?r=113204' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917161/thar-villagers-stumble-upon-ancient-wooden-sculpture' target='_blank'><strong>Thar villagers stumble upon ‘ancient’ wooden sculpture</strong></a><br><p> 

THE ‘ancient’ sculpture.—Dawn

MITHI: An apparently centuries-old wooden sculpture of a robed, bearded man has been discovered in the hilly region of Karoonjhar, Nagarp­arkar, intriguing historians and archaeologists about its cultural origins.
Sources privy to the discovery said the artefact was recovered near a seasonal riverbed in the Karoonjhar hills by area residents and social activists.
The intricately carved wooden statue depicts a robed man with traditional features, and is believed to be of considerable antiquity. Preliminary observations suggest it may be linked to ancient eastern cultures, though its exact provenance remains unclear.
Researcher and writer Khalid Kumhar, who had extensively documented the historical geography of Tharparkar, remarked that the design and posture of the statue appeared to reflect influences of East Asian or Chinese culture.
“The statue does not match known relics of Buddhist or Jain iconography common to this region,” he noted.
The discovery drew the attention of the Sindh Department of Culture, Tourism and Antiquities and provincial minister Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah stated that measures would be taken to preserve the object.
“A team of heritage experts will conduct thorough research on the sculpture, and their findings will be shared with the public in due course,” said the minister.
The wooden statue has been temporarily secured by locals until it is formally examined by experts from the culture department.

The fatal accident comes as relatives mourn at least 279 people killed when a passenger plane slammed into a residential area in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Thursday.
The helicopter crash left the pilot and all six passengers dead when their chopper came down during the flight from Kedarnath temple, in Uttarakhand state, disaster response official Nandan Singh Rajwar told AFP.
The state’s chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, said rescue teams had been dispatched to the scene after the “very sad news”.
The crash was likely caused by bad weather, according to district tourism official Rahul Chaubey.
Pilgrims flock to Kedarnath temple during the summer when it is possible to access the site, which stands at an altitude of 3,584 metres.
A cottage industry of helicopter charter firms has developed to serve wealthy pilgrims who want to visit shrines in the Indian Himalayas, but who prefer to avoid arduous trekking.
Six people were killed last month in another helicopter crash en route to the shrine.</p><small>2025-06-15 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609257-will-respond-with-bullets-if-fired-upon-gandapur-warns-of-armed-march-on-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>'Will respond with bullets if fired upon',  Gandapur warns of armed march on Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>
