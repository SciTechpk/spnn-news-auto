Gupta, the ICC’s seventh CEO, succeeds Geoff Allardice, who resigned from the post in January after four years in office.
Gupta was broadcaster JioStar’s chief executive for sports and live experiences.
ICC chairman Jay Shah said Gupta “brings extensive experience in sports strategy and commercialisation, which will be invaluable for the ICC”.
The role attracted more than 2,500 applications from candidates across 25 countries, the ICC said.
“These are exciting times for the sport as marquee events grow in stature, commercial avenues widen and opportunities such as the women’s game scale in popularity,” Gupta said in a statement.
“Cricket’s inclusion in the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games and the rapid acceleration of technology deployment/adoption could act as force-multipliers for the cricket movement around the world,” he said.</p><small>2025-07-07 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0711061345b20d4.jpg?r=112733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922536/sabalenka-stands-tall-norrie-survives-to-reach-wimbledon-quarter-finals' target='_blank'><strong>Sabalenka stands tall, Norrie survives to reach Wimbledon quarter-finals</strong></a><br><p>Women’s top seed Aryna Sabalenka and men’s defending champion Carlos Alcaraz both survived tough tests to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals and Cameron Norrie kept alive British singles hopes after surviving a five-set thriller on Sunday.
Sabalenka ruined home favourite Emma Raducanu’s dream in the previous round but had the Centre Court crowd cheering her on as she beat Elise Mertens 6-4 7-6(4) in a high-quality duel.
Wimbledon’s new automated line-calling technology came under fire after an embarrassing malfunction robbed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of a point during her last-16 victory over Britain’s Sonay Kartal on Centre Court.
Spaniard Alcaraz came through a ferocious firefight against Russian 14th seed Andrey Rublev 6-7(5) 6-3 6-4 6-4 to stay on course for a third successive title.
“Andrey is one of the most powerful players we have on Tour and is so aggressive with the ball. He forces you to the limit on each point,” Alcaraz, bidding to become only the fourth man to win back-to-back French Open and Wimbledon titles multiple times, said on court.
The 22-year-old second seed extended his current winning streak to 22 matches and will take on Norrie for a place in the semi-finals after the unseeded Briton soaked up 46 aces from towering Chilean Nicolas Jarry to win a feisty Court One battle 6-3 7-6(4) 6-7(7) 6-7(5) 6-3.
While Alcaraz seeks a Wimbledon hat-trick, Sabalenka is eyeing her first title on the London lawns after missing last year’s tournament with injury and the 2022 edition due to the ban on Russian and Belarusian players, and the 27-year-old made a fast start against Mertens.

Sabalenka, who claimed doubles titles at the US Open and Australian Open partnering Mertens, was then put through the wringer before raising her level to prevail.
The victory improved her win-loss record against Belgian Mertens to 11-2 and she said the growing adoration of the crowd made a big difference after fans were on the other side of the fence when she met Raducanu on Friday.
“I definitely felt the support. It was so amazing playing and feeling the support. I didn’t have to pretend that they were cheering for me because they were really cheering for me,” said Sabalenka, who will face the 37-year-old German Laura Siegemund in the quarter-finals.
“What can be better than that? I really enjoyed it. I hope it can stay the same all the way, and they help me energy-wise to stay strong and to face all of the challenges.”

Heavy showers
Siegemund, the second-oldest player to start in the women’s draw this year, swatted aside plucky Argentine lucky loser Solana Sierra with a 6-3 6-2 victory in a Court Two match interrupted by the heavy showers that prompted organisers to shut the roofs for the day’s play on Centre Court and Court One.
While Sierra was the first lucky loser to reach the last 16 in the professional era, Siegemund created her own slice of history by becoming the oldest woman to reach her first Wimbledon quarter-final.
Explaining her run, Siegemund said it was simple. “It’s like you have an opponent. Either you find good solutions and you execute well, you go forward, or you don’t, and you don’t go forward. So it’s very simple,” she said.
Sierra’s fellow South American, Jarry, fought back brilliantly against Norrie after saving a match point in the third-set tiebreak but fell short in a needle match.
Jarry seemed irritated at times during the heat of battle and the players exchanged words at the end.
“Cameron played unbelievable. Not unbelievable, played great. He did his job. He plays like that,” said qualifier Jarry, whose total ace count reached a tournament-leading 111.
Asked what happened, Norrie said there had been no problem.
“I think he just said I was being a little bit too vocal,” he said. “Honestly, nothing but credit to Nico for his performance. I guess we both really wanted to win.”

Norrie, a 2022 semi-finalist, is the last British hope after the unseeded Kartal’s run ended with a 7-6(3) 6-4 defeat by experienced Russian Pavlyuchenkova.
The big talking point in that match was the malfunction of the Electronic Line Calling system, which left the Russian former French Open runner-up seething after being robbed of a game point at 4-4 in the opening set when there was no ‘out’ call despite a Kartal shot landing over the baseline.
Umpire Nico Helwerth sought advice from tournament organisers via telephone and then ruled that the point should be replayed, with Pavlyuchenkova going on to have her serve broken.
“We were waiting for a decision as the system was down, but I was expecting to hear if they said the ball was in or out,” she said. “I expected a different decision. I just thought also the chair umpire could take the initiative.
“That’s why he’s there sitting on the chair. He also saw it (was) out, he told me after the match. I thought he would do that, but he didn’t. I think it’s also difficult for him. He probably was scared to take such a big decision.”
Organisers said it had been caused by the system being ‘deactivated in error’.
American fifth seed Taylor Fritz marched on after his Australian opponent Jordan Thompson retired with a thigh injury at 6-1 3-0 down in their fourth-round meeting.
Up next for Fritz is a meeting with Russian 17th seed Karen Khachanov who thumped Poland’s Kamil Majchrzak 6-4 6-2 6-3.
Fritz is not the only American to reach the quarter-finals, after 13th seed Amanda Anisimova beat Linda Noskova 6-2 5-7 6-4 in the day’s final action.</p><small>2025-07-07 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07110652f00cb64.jpg?r=110840' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922439/pti-slams-hike-in-perks-of-punjab-assembly-speaker-ministers' target='_blank'><strong>PTI slams hike in perks of Punjab Assembly speaker, ministers</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: After the massive raise in salaries, the increase in privileges for the speaker and ministers of Punjab under the guise of leave allowance is absolutely ‘disgraceful’.
In a statement on Saturday, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Punjab, media cell chief Shayan Bashir stated that people were being crushed under inflation, unemployment, and skyrocketing electricity bills, to the point where many were driven to suicide. “Yet the indifferent elite continue to enjoy the luxuries of illegitimate power,” he lamented.
The PTI leader said this was the ugliest form of an exploitative system where power had become a means to suck the blood of the public.
 
 

He said the Punjab’s hospitals lack both medicines and basic facilities, where multiple patients were treated on a single bed, as if they were animals.
At such a critical time, for these ‘looters’ who seized power through the backdoor to increase their own perks, he said, “is the height of shamelessness”.
He said the PTI would oppose every bill passed for such luxuries that went against public interest and welfare. “Those looting the nation’s wealth will be exposed on every platform,” he said.

“At this time, we are no longer withholding access in India to your account,” X said in an email to the Reuters social media team, without elaborating.
Representatives for X, Reuters and the Indian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the restoration of the account.
Earlier on Sunday, a spokesperson for the Indian government’s Press Information Bureau told Reuters that no Indian government agency had required withholding the Reuters handle, adding that officials were working with X to resolve the problem.
A Reuters spokesperson had said the agency was working with X to resolve this matter and get the Reuters account reinstated in India as soon as possible.
Reuters World, another X account operated by the news agency, which was blocked in India, was also restored late on Sunday night.
The main Reuters account, which has more than 25 million followers globally, had been blocked in India since Saturday night. A notice told X users that “@Reuters has been withheld in IN (India) in response to a legal demand”.
 
 

In an email to the Reuters social media team on May 16, X said: “It is our policy to notify account holders if we receive a legal request from an authorised entity (such as law enforcement or a government agency) to remove content from their account.”
“In order to comply with X obligations under India’s local laws, we have withheld your X account in India under the country’s Information Technology Act, 2000; the content remains available elsewhere”.
Reuters could not ascertain if the May 16 email was linked to Saturday’s account suspension, nor could it determine what specific content the demand referred to, why its removal was sought or the entity that had lodged the complaint.
While the email did not specify which entity had made the request or what content they sought to remove, it said X had been advised that in such cases, a user could contact the secretary of India’s Information and Broadcasting Ministry.
The secretary, Sanjay Jaju, did not respond to requests seeking comment.
The 2000 law allows designated government officials to demand the takedown of content from social media platforms they deem to violate local laws, including on the grounds of national security or if a post threatens public order.
X has long been at odds with India’s government over content-removal requests. In March, the company sued the federal government over a new government website that the company says expands takedown powers to “countless” government officials.
The case is continuing. India has said X wrongly labelled an official website a “censorship portal”, as the website only allows tech companies to be notified about harmful online content.</p><small>2025-07-07 06:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/071052391931895.jpg?r=105648' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922443/lhc-refuses-dna-test-in-paternity-suit' target='_blank'><strong>LHC refuses DNA test in paternity suit</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has refused to order an immediate DNA test in a paternity suit, ruling that the welfare of the minor and the current evidentiary stage of the case outweigh the parents’ joint consent for genetic testing.
Justice Ahsan Raza Kazmi dismissed a civil revision petition filed by a man seeking a declaration that he is not the biological father of a minor girl.
The petitioner, Malik Hamid Raza, urged the court to overturn two lower court decisions — dated April 17 and May 21, 2025 — which had declined his application for DNA analysis.
Raza had approached a family court last year, contesting paternity and seeking a declaration of non-legitimacy.

Upholds lower courts decision

He requested a DNA test of the child, and the mother did not oppose the plea; in fact, she formally recorded her consent.
 
 

However, the trial judge termed the request “premature,” noting that no evidence had yet been recorded. The appellate court dismissed the subsequent appeal for the same reason.
The petitioner then invoked the High Court’s revisional jurisdiction, arguing that the two orders were illegal and contrary to natural justice.
In his detailed judgment, Justice Kazmi held that courts have a “proactive and protective role” when a minor is unable to consent. He noted that even parental agreement can be overridden if it risks emotional or psychological harm.
“Even where both parents consent, the court must still ask whether a DNA test is truly in the child’s best interest,” the judge wrote, describing such orders as serious judicial acts — not to be undertaken lightly or on mere request. He stated that the role of the courts is not only to resolve legal disputes but also to protect human dignity, particularly when the rights of a minor are involved.
Justice Kazmi explained that when scientific tools like DNA testing are used to resolve questions of paternity, the courts must act with caution.
He cited repeated Supreme Court rulings which emphasize that DNA testing in civil matters should not be ordered without necessity and a complete evidentiary context.
“Any deviation would conflict with established jurisprudence,” the judge noted.
He stressed that it is not the availability of technology or the consent of parties that justifies such testing, but whether the purpose truly serves the ends of justice. The judge observed that while DNA tests may be valuable, they must not come at the cost of a child’s mental and emotional well-being.
“Furthermore, it is now well-settled that DNA evidence is not conclusive; rather, it serves as corroborative evidence,” he added.
Justice Kazmi noted that a child born during wedlock is conclusively presumed legitimate unless strong rebuttal is provided. He held that the lower courts had applied the correct test by refusing to dislodge that presumption at this preliminary stage.
He concluded that the trial and appellate courts had exercised lawful discretion, and the High Court found “no perversity or illegality” warranting intervention.
Justice Kazmi held that the lower courts had not shut the door on the DNA test altogether, but had rightly deferred the question until the trial court is equipped with a complete evidentiary record.

Larry Leitha, sheriff of Kerr County in Texas Hill Country, said 68 people had died in flooding in his county, the epicentre of the flooding, among them 28 children.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott, speaking at a press conference on Sunday afternoon, said another 10 had died elsewhere in Texas and confirmed 41 were missing.
US President Donald Trump sent his condolences to the victims and said he would probably visit the area on Friday. His administration had been in touch with Abbott, he added.
“It’s a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible. So we say, God bless all of the people that have gone through so much, and God bless, God bless the state of Texas,” he told reporters as he left New Jersey.
Among the most devastating impacts of the flooding occurred at Camp Mystic summer camp, a nearly century-old Christian girls camp where 10 Camp Mystic campers and one counsellor were still missing, according to Leitha.
“It was nothing short of horrific to see what those young children went through,” said Abbott, who noted he toured the area on Saturday and pledged to continue efforts to locate the missing.
The flooding occurred after the nearby Guadalupe River broke its banks after torrential rain fell in the central Texas area on Friday, the US Independence Day holiday.

Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said the destruction killed three people in Burnet County, one in Tom Green County, five in Travis County and one in Williamson County.
“You will see the death toll rise today and tomorrow,” said Freeman Martin, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, also speaking on Sunday.
Officials said on Saturday that more than 850 people had been rescued, including some clinging to trees, after a sudden storm dumped up to 15 inches (38 cm) of rain across the region, about 140 kilometres northwest of San Antonio.
Kidd said he was receiving unconfirmed reports of “an additional wall of water” flowing down some of the creeks in the Guadalupe Rivershed, as rain continued to fall on soil in the region already saturated from Friday’s rains.
“We’re evacuating parts of the river right now because we are worried about another wall of river coming down in those areas,” he said, referencing volunteers from outside the area seeking to help locate victims.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency was activated on Sunday and is deploying resources to first responders in Texas after Trump issued a major disaster declaration, the Department of Homeland Security said. US Coast Guard helicopters and planes were aiding search and rescue efforts.
 


Scaling back federal disaster response
Trump has previously outlined plans to scale back the federal government’s role in responding to natural disasters, leaving states to shoulder more of the burden themselves.
Some experts questioned whether cuts to the federal workforce by the Trump administration, including to the agency that oversees the National Weather Service, led to a failure by officials to accurately predict the severity of the floods and issue appropriate warnings ahead of the storm.
Trump’s administration has overseen thousands of job cuts from the National Weather Service’s parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, leaving many weather offices understaffed, former NOAA director Rick Spinrad said.
Spinrad said he did not know if those staff cuts factored into the lack of advance warning for the extreme Texas flooding, but that they would inevitably degrade the agency’s ability to deliver accurate and timely forecasts.
Trump pushed back when asked on Sunday if federal government cuts hobbled the disaster response or left key job vacancies at the National Weather Service under Trump’s oversight.
“That water situation, that all is, and that was really the Biden setup,” he said, referencing his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. “But I wouldn’t blame Biden for it, either. I would just say this is 100-year catastrophe.”
He declined to answer a question about FEMA, saying only, “They’re busy working, so we’ll leave it at that,” Trump said.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA and NOAA, said a “moderate” flood watch issued on Thursday by the National Weather Service had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall and said the Trump administration was working to upgrade the system.
Joaquin Castro, a Democratic US congressman from Texas, told CNN’s “State of the Union” program that fewer personnel at the weather service could be dangerous.
“When you have flash flooding, there’s a risk that if you don’t have the personnel … to do that analysis, do the predictions in the best way, it could lead to tragedy,” Castro said.
‘Complete devastation’
Katharine Somerville, a counsellor on the Cypress Lake side of Camp Mystic, on higher ground than the Guadalupe River side, said her 13-year-old campers were scared as their cabins sustained damage and lost power in the middle of the night.
“Our cabins at the tippity top of hills were completely flooded with water. I mean, y’all have seen the complete devastation, we never even imagined that this could happen,” Somerville said in an interview on Fox News on Sunday.
 


Somerville said the campers in her care were put on military trucks and evacuated, and that all were safe.
The disaster unfolded rapidly on Friday morning as heavier-than-forecast rain drove river waters rapidly to as high as nine metres.
A day after the disaster struck, the summer camp, where 700 girls were in residence at the time of the flooding, was a scene of devastation. Inside one cabin, mud lines indicating how high the water had risen were at least six feet (1.83m) from the floor.
Bed frames, mattresses and personal belongings caked with mud were scattered inside. Some buildings had broken windows, and one had a missing wall.</p><small>2025-07-07 05:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07084103c50f0d9.jpg?r=104835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922519/brics-nations-slam-trump-tariffs-condemn-strikes-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Brics nations slam Trump tariffs, condemn strikes on Iran</strong></a><br><p>Brics leaders at a summit on Sunday took aim at US President Donald Trump’s “indiscriminate” import tariffs and recent Israeli-US strikes on Iran.
The 11 emerging nations — including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — account for about half the world’s population and 40 per cent of global economic output.
The bloc is divided about much, but found common cause when it comes to the mercurial US leader and his stop-start tariff wars — even if it avoided naming him directly.
 
 

Voicing “serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff” measures, Brics members said the tariffs risked hurting the global economy, according to a summit joint statement.
Trump fired back at the bloc directly on social media on Sunday night.
“Any country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of Brics will be charged an additional 10 per cent Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
 


Earlier, Brics also offered symbolic backing to fellow member Iran, condemning a series of military strikes on nuclear and other targets carried out by Israel and the United States.
In April, Trump threatened allies and rivals alike with a slew of punitive duties, before offering a months-long reprieve in the face of a fierce market sell-off.
Trump has warned he will impose unilateral levies on partners unless they reach “deals” by August 1.
In an apparent concession to US allies, such as Brazil, India, and Saudi Arabia, the summit declaration did not criticise the United States or its president by name at any point.
No show
Conceived two decades ago as a forum for fast-growing economies, the BRICS have come to be seen as a Chinese-driven counterbalance to US and Western European power.
But as the group has expanded to include Iran, Saudi Arabia and others, it has struggled to reach meaningful consensus on issues from the Gaza onslaught to challenging US global dominance.
Brics nations, for example, collectively called for a peaceful two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict — despite Tehran’s long-standing position that Israel should be destroyed.
An Iranian diplomatic source said his government’s “reservations” had been conveyed to Brazilian hosts. Still, Iran stopped short of rejecting the statement outright.
In perhaps a further sign of the diplomatic sensitivities, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister skipped Sunday’s discussions entirely, according to a Brazilian government source.
Saudi Arabia is among the world’s leading beneficiaries of high-tech US military exports and is a long-standing US partner.
 
 

The political punch of this year’s summit has been depleted by the absence of China’s Xi Jinping, who skipped the meeting for the first time in his 12 years as president.
The Chinese leader is not the only notable absentee. Russian President Vladimir Putin, charged with war crimes in Ukraine, also opted to stay away, participating via video link.
He told counterparts that Brics had become a key player in global governance.
The summit also called for regulation governing artificial intelligence and said the technology could not be the preserve of only rich nations.

Taiwan is regularly struck by typhoons but they generally land along the mountainous and sparsely populated east coast facing the Pacific.
Typhoon Danas, at one point listed by Taiwan’s weather authority at the second-strongest level, headed north towards the Taiwan Strait after making landfall along its southwestern coast late on Sunday.
 


It has greatly weakened since and was forecast to hit eastern China later this week.
“The typhoon track is rare… the whole of Taiwan will be affected by the wind and rain one after another,” President Lai Ching-te said in a post on Facebook, urging citizens to make preparations.
Power to more than half a million homes was cut and over 300 domestic and international flights were cancelled, government data showed. The north-south high-speed rail line scaled back services.
The National Fire Agency said one person was killed by a falling tree while driving and another died after their respirator malfunctioned due to a power cut.
Record winds of around 220 kilometres per hour were recorded in the southwestern county of Yunlin, while more than 700 trees and street signs were blown over across western cities and towns, government data showed.
There was no major report of damage in the Tainan Science Park that houses tech giants such as TSMC.
Maritime officials in eastern China’s Zhejiang province raised their emergency response to the second-highest level on Monday, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
As of 10 am (7am PKT), 121 passenger vessels and 64 ferry routes had been suspended across the province, CCTV reported. Authorities also halted 181 construction projects, including wind farms, as a precaution.
Danas is expected to gradually approach the coastal areas between Zhejiang’s city of Taizhou and Fuzhou city in neighbouring Fujian province, according to the China Meteorological Administration.
The typhoon is forecast to make landfall along the stretch late on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-07-07 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07094809bc46b48.jpg?r=101218' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922526/from-karachi-to-gaza-pakistani-startup-ships-prosthetics-to-child-war-survivors' target='_blank'><strong>From Karachi to Gaza: Pakistani startup ships prosthetics to child war survivors</strong></a><br><p>As soon as eight-year-old Sidra Al Bordeeni returned from the clinic with her prosthetic arm, she jumped on a bicycle in the Jordanian refugee camp where she lives, riding for the first time since a missile strike in Gaza took her arm a year ago.
Sidra was injured while sheltering at Nuseirat School, one of several Gaza schools converted into makeshift refuges from Israeli strikes. Her mother, Sabreen Al Bordeeni, said Gaza’s collapsed health services and the family’s inability to leave at the time made it impossible to save her hand.
“She’s out playing, and all her friends and siblings are fascinated by her arm,” Al Bordeeni said on the phone, repeatedly thanking God for this day. “I can’t express how grateful I am to see my daughter happy.”
The arm was built over 4,000 kilometres away in Karachi by Bioniks, a Pakistani company that uses a smartphone app to take pictures from different angles and create a 3D model for custom prosthetics.
CEO Anas Niaz said the social enterprise startup had fit more than 1,000 custom-designed arms inside Pakistan since 2021 — funded through a mix of patient payments, corporate sponsorship, and donations — but this was its first time providing prosthetics to those impacted in conflict.

Sidra and three-year-old Habebat Allah, who lost both her arms and a leg in Gaza, went through days of remote consultations and virtual fittings. Then Niaz flew from Karachi to Amman to meet the girls and make his company’s first overseas delivery.
Sidra’s device was funded by Mafaz Clinic in Amman, while donations from Pakistanis paid for Habebat’s. Mafaz CEO Entesar Asaker said the clinic partnered with Bioniks for its low costs, remote solutions and ability to troubleshoot virtually.
Niaz said each prosthetic arm costs about $2,500, significantly less than the $10,000 to $20,000 for alternatives made in the United States.
While Bioniks’ arms are less sophisticated than US versions, they provide a high level of functionality for children and their remote process makes them more accessible than options from other countries such as Turkiye and South Korea.
 






He was flanked on the stage by Western diplomats, Indian officials and a monk who’s expected to lead the search for his successor, as well as Hollywood star Richard Gere, who said the Dalai Lama belongs to the world.
“We plan on providing limbs for people in other conflict zones too, like Ukraine, and become a global company,” Niaz said.
Globally, most advanced prosthetics are designed for adults and rarely reach children in war zones, who need lighter limbs and replacements every 12–18 months as they grow.

Niaz said they were exploring funding options for Sidra and Habebat’s future replacements, adding the cost wouldn’t be too high.
“Only a few components would need to be changed,” he said, “the rest can be reused to help another child.”
Bioniks occasionally incorporates popular fictional characters into its children’s prosthetics such as Marvel’s Iron Man or Disney’s Elsa, a feature Niaz said helps with emotional acceptance and daily use.
‘Finally hug my father’
Gaza now has around 4,500 new amputees, on top of 2,000 existing cases from before the conflict, many of them children, making it one of the highest child-amputation crises per capita in recent history, the UN humanitarian agency OCHA said in March.
An April study by the Palestinian Bureau of Statistics found at least 7,000 children have been injured since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023. Local health authorities say more than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, nearly one-third of them children.

The World Health Organisation has said Gaza’s health system is “on its knees” with Israel’s border closures drying up critical supplies, meaning the wounded cannot access specialised care, especially amid waves of wounded patients.
“Where it’s nearly impossible for healthcare professionals and patients to meet, remote treatment bridges a critical gap, making assessments, fittings, and follow-up possible without travel or specialised centres,” said Asadullah Khan, Clinic Manager at ProActive Prosthetic in Leeds, UK, which provides artificial limbs and support for trauma patients.

Bioniks hopes to pioneer such solutions on a large scale but funding remains a roadblock and the company is still trying to form viable partnerships.

For much of the past year, when she wanted to make a heart, a simple gesture using both hands, she would ask someone else to complete it. This time, she formed the shape herself, snapped a photo, and sent it to her father, who is still trapped in Gaza.
“What I’m looking forward to most is using both my arms to finally hug my father when I see him,” she said.

Indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas began on Sunday evening in Doha, aiming to broker a ceasefire and reach an agreement on the release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
Trump said on Sunday that there was a “good chance” of reaching an agreement.
“We’ve gotten a lot of the hostages out, but pertaining to the remaining hostages, quite a few of them will be coming out,” he told journalists.
Netanyahu, speaking before boarding his flight to Washington on Sunday, said his meeting with Trump could “definitely help advance this” deal.
Netanyahu said he dispatched the team to Doha with “clear instructions” to reach an agreement “under the conditions that we have agreed to.”
 
 

He previously said Hamas’ response to a draft US-backed ceasefire proposal, conveyed through Qatari and Egyptian mediators, contained “unacceptable” demands.
‘Important mission’
Two Palestinian sources close to the discussions told AFP the proposal included a 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release 10 living hostages and several bodies in exchange for Palestinians detained by Israel.
However, they said, the group was also demanding certain conditions for Israel’s withdrawal, guarantees against a resumption of fighting during negotiations, and the return of the UN-led aid distribution system.
Netanyahu has an “important mission” in Washington, “advancing a deal to bring all our hostages home,” said Israeli President Isaac Herzog after meeting him on Sunday.
Trump is not scheduled to meet the Israeli premier until 6:30pm (3:30am PKT) on Monday, the White House said, without the usual presence of journalists.
Of the 251 hostages taken by Hamas during the 2023 attack, 49 are still being held in Gaza, including 27, the Israeli military says, are dead.
Since Hamas’s October 2023 attack sparked the massive Israeli offensive in Gaza, mediators have brokered two temporary halts in the fighting. They have seen hostages freed in exchange for some of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody.
 
 

Recent efforts to broker a new truce have repeatedly failed, with the primary point of contention being Israel’s rejection of Hamas’s demand for a lasting ceasefire.
‘Enough blood’
In Gaza, the territory’s civil defence agency reported 26 people killed by Israeli forces on Sunday, 10 of them in a strike in Gaza City’s Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood.
“We are losing young people, families and children every day, and this must stop now,” Sheikh Radwan resident Osama al-Hanawi told AFP.
“Enough blood has been shed.”
Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military said it could not comment on specific strikes without precise coordinates.
Hundreds killed seeking aid
The offensive has created dire humanitarian conditions for the more than two million people in the Gaza Strip.
A US- and Israel-backed group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), took the lead in food distribution in the territory in late May, when Israel partially lifted a more than two-month blockade on aid deliveries.
But its operations have had a chaotic rollout, with repeated reports of aid seekers killed near its facilities while awaiting rations.
UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the GHF over concerns that it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
 
 

The UN human rights office said last week that more than 500 people have been killed waiting to access food from GHF distribution points.
The Gaza health ministry on Sunday placed the toll even higher, at 751 killed. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed at least 57,418 people in Gaza.</p><small>2025-07-07 03:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/6869e0d756c24.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922430/songs-of-hate' target='_blank'><strong>Songs of hate</strong></a><br><p>I SAW the ‘disturbing’ music video of Jatt Mehkma, a Punjabi hip-hop song that caused Britain’s MP Manuela Perteghella so much anguish that she lodged a complaint with the government. The song by Indian rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh features Pakistani actress Mehwish Hayat; they are gangsters at a party in the video.
As they drive away, and are stopped by ‘bad guys’, young children emerge out of nowhere, surround Hayat and fire guns at their opponents. The MP was so disturbed by the violent content that she complained to the Home Office and called for a ban on the entry of Singh and Hayat. It is one of the silliest things I’ve read this past week. And a reminder of the gross hypocrisy we see on display every day.
I don’t condone violence but I’m surprised this video released in November has caused anyone this kind of umbrage.
I’m comparing it to Israel’s genocide of Palestinians being streamed on our screens 24/7 which doesn’t cause any concern. It’s almost expected that Palestinians deaths will be streamed live with no accountability.
I went looking for Ms Perteghella’s outrage about Zionist songs celebrating the death and destruction of Gaza but till the time of writing could not find anything on this specifically. Her politics aren’t all bad — she does support an immediate ceasefire, the UK restoring funds to UNRWA so they can get aid to Gaza and an arms embargo on Israel while it perpetuates war crimes to name a few.

The rappers spit on those calling for a Free Palestine and praise their erasure.

But, it seems she takes exception to brown folks acting like gangsters in a music video.
Violent images and music about Palestinians haven’t just surfaced following the Hamas attack in 2023. In 2015, Israeli settlers attacked two Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank and burned a baby alive. That gruesome act has been celebrated. Zei Squirrel’s account on X posted a video of an Israeli wedding in which they stab the photo of that burned baby as they dance to rock music, saying they will do it to other infants. It is beyond depraved.
This is how violence is normalised and, as a story in UnTold Mag last year said, creates a collective identity which “cultivates a shared mindset of hatred”.
It has gotten worse as evidenced on the hatred across social media platforms like TikTok where these “popular expressions carry not only hateful and violent messages but, in some instances, verge on the genocidal,” reported the magazine. And it’s not just settlers sharing this violent musical content.
There are videos showing Palestinian prisoners in Israeli camps listening to a child’s song Meni Mamtera for eight hours on end. People soon started playing it at Orthodox weddings and in one video on X, I saw guests mimicking the handcuffed prisoners listening to the song. Then there was the TikTok ‘challenge’ of kidnapping and blindfolding Palestinians.
“In these different videos, the prisoners have no face, no life stories, no voice, all that remains is an Israeli song, torturing anonymous bodies,” reports the magazine. “Taken outside of time, space and humanity, the prisoners are excluded from both human and political communities, treated as dispensable entities without rights or protections.”
The rap song Harbu Darbu (which means raining hell on the enemy) by Ness Ve Stilla, which has 35m views since its release last year, calls Palestinians rats. The rappers spit on those calling for a Free Palestine and praise their erasure. The song was number one for weeks in Israel. It was used also on TikTok as a way to show support for the war.
Israel has killed more than 56,000 people and uprooted ne­a­rly the entire pop­ulation of 2.3 million acc­ording to Al Jaze­era. It has also killed 1,000 Pales­­tinians in the West Bank, an oft-ignored story as the focus is on Gaza.
How were entire generations wiped out in the name of Israel’s right to ‘self defence’?
You can unde­­rstand my outrage then when one British MP chooses to take umbrage with a Punjabi video that uses children resorting to violence but seems to ignore Israeli children’s songs glorifying violence in Gaza?
I understand the music video may have flouted some UK laws including “the use of imitation firearms and exposing minors to harmful content” according to a report last week by Deadline. But does it merit Singh and Hayat not being allowed to enter the UK because they are “not conducive to the public good” under immigration rules?
Will the same rules be applied to everyone involved in the creation of Friendship Song 2023, where children sing “we will annihilate everyone in Gaza”? The video was taken down from YouTube but I watched it on Electronic Intifada’s X account and it made Singh’s video look amateur. Legislators should direct their concern at the impact Israel’s genocide is having on society.

Whether or not the Afghan-Soviet war reshaped the world order, it undoubtedly transformed this region, particularly Pakistan and Afghanistan. Politics, after all, follows its own calculus: understanding when a former foe becomes a strategic partner requires a dispassionate reading of interests and imperatives.
In that context, Russia’s formal recognition of the Afghan Taliban regime should not come as a surprise. But is this development not replete with contradictions? After all, these Taliban are the ideological descendants of the very mujahideen who took credit for defeating the Soviet Union. Pakistan, too, claimed that legacy — and has been bearing its consequences ever since, with compounding interest. The militant groups that now threaten Pakistan’s security are the heirs of that jihadist lineage, and the Taliban’s policies suggest they aim to reimagine Pakistan through the prism of Afghanistan’s turbulent past.
As for the US, the global exemplar of pragmatic diplomacy, it hardly warrants much elaboration. For Washington, victory and defeat are tactical manoeuvres, not moral absolutes. It negotiated with the Taliban before its military withdrawal, offering tacit recognition even before its final soldier had departed from Kabul.
Moscow’s signals of a shift in policy had become increasingly visible in recent years. However, the timing of Russia’s formal recognition, coming amid the fallout of the Israel-Iran conflict, reveals a more profound anxiety: Russia is increasingly becoming a marginal player in Southwest Asian geopolitics. In Syria, the Assad regime has been ousted. In Gaza, the humanitarian catastrophe is growing. Iran, Russia’s principal regional ally, remains under siege. Meanwhile, Moscow’s responses are limited to rhetorical posturing.

How much leverage does Russia truly have over the Taliban that it has formally recognised?

Even in Ukraine, Russia appears trapped. US President Donald Trump, who sees geopolitics as a transactional theatre and war as a branding exercise, has relegated Moscow to a footnote. His public desire for a Nobel Peace Prize, juxtaposed against global unrest, adds a tragicomic element to the situation. For the Palestinians in Gaza, it is yet another chapter in a long history of betrayal, as they continue to suffer while the world’s conscience remains dormant.
But back to the central question: what does Russia hope to achieve by recognising the Taliban regime?
The move is particularly puzzling when viewed through Iran’s lens. Tehran’s frustration with the Taliban has been growing. Some speculate that the Taliban’s muted response to Israel’s aggression, or perhaps their perceived alignment with the new Syrian leadership, especially interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who stunned observers by engaging with Trump and hinting at normalisation with Israel, has unsettled Tehran. The Taliban and Syria’s new rulers share certain traits: pragmatic diplomacy, ideological ambiguity, and a desire to reposition themselves within a shifting geopolitical landscape.
This alignment has ramifications. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which shares operational and ideological ties with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, has dismantled Tehran’s ally, the Assad regime, in Syria. Iran may also perceive these changes as weakening Hezbollah in Lebanon, hardening Israel’s aggressive posturing towards Tehran. Compounding Iran’s concerns is the presence of anti-Iran groups operating from Afghan soil, particularly the Jaish al-Adl, which maintains a presence along the Pak-Iran border.
For their part, the Taliban are becoming increasingly pragmatic, much like Syria’s new political elite. They are engaged with all major regional and global powers: China, Russia, the US and India. Of these, China has the deepest stakes. As Afghanistan’s immediate neighbour, Beijing is acutely aware that instability in Afghanistan could spill over into its own territory.
That is why China has intensified its efforts to establish confidence-building channels between Kabul and Islamabad, aiming to pre-empt conflict and contain terrorism. Yet, terrorism has been far from contained. The Afghan soil continues to serve as a launching pad for attacks that bleed Pakistan. Ironically, those once branded as ‘good Taliban’ or Pakistani proxies have now turned their guns on the state.
The recent suicide attack in Mir Ali, claimed by Aswad al-Harb, a group linked to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur network, is emblematic of this shift. An alliance of groups, including Lashkar-i-Islam, Tehreek-i-Inqilab-i-Islami, and Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan, has escalated attacks across North and South Waziristan, as well as urban areas like Lakki Marwat, Tank and Kulachi. Meanwhile, the TTP has adopted a strategy focused on the systematic targeting of police and government officials.
Despite the fact that both the HTS and the Afghan Taliban share characteristics in their diplomatic overtures and political pragmatism, they also diverge sharply. Unlike the HTS, the Taliban have not distanced themselves from the militant groups that once fought alongside them against the Nato forces. Instead, they appear to be managing these groups, using them selectively against Pakistan. Perhaps the Taliban leadership recognises the enduring utility of proxy tools that can pressure adversaries while maintaining plausible deniability.
Pakistan and Iran, more than any other actors, understand the perils of such arrangements. Proxies can only serve strategic objectives up to a point; beyond that, they develop their own agendas.
Some Afghan analysts argue that Pakistan’s growing assertiveness in regional politics and its increasing interest in Central Asia have made the Taliban uneasy. They want to shed the image of being anyone’s proxy, even while relying on proxies themselves to assert leverage.
Russia’s motivations for recognising the Taliban regime are clearer: a blend of realpolitik and strategic opportunism. The goal is to counter Western influence, secure its periphery and expand diplomatic engagement. Moscow also frames the recognition as a step towards economic cooperation in energy, transport and infrastructure.
But a critical question remains: how much leverage does Russia truly have over the Taliban on issues such as terrorism and the use of proxies against neighbours? This is a challenge that even China and Pakistan have been unable to resolve. The Taliban leadership, meanwhile, continues to play a careful game, balancing global expectations with local ambitions.

The platform became dysfunctional after New Delhi chose to boycott the Islamabad summit in 2016, and a few other countries followed suit.
But South Asia’s vast potential cannot be held hostage forever by India. This is perhaps why recent reports of Pakistan, China and Bangladesh possibly exploring a new regional bloc generated considerable excitement, including across our eastern border, with observers speculating that the three countries may be contemplating a grouping sans India.
Tempting as the possibility may have seemed to some, Islamabad has for now publicly reiterated its commitment to Saarc, signalling that it still believes in inclusive regionalism. Diplomatically, this puts the ball in India’s court: it is now up to New Delhi to recognise that reviving the forum, and not fragmenting the region with its rivalries, is the path to unlocking South Asia’s untapped potential. Saarc was a promising platform for economic and cultural integration, but it has decidedly failed to emulate Asean’s success, even though that is what it had originally aspired to do.
The platform’s charter makes it compulsory for all states to attend summits at the level of heads of government or state. India chose to exploit this when it led a boycott of the Islamabad summit in 2016. Pakistan, on the other hand, has consistently championed Saarc’s potential, even in strained times.
 
 

Perhaps New Delhi needs a reminder that there was a time in the 1990s when Pakistan was tempted to do what it did in 2016 but chose prudence instead. In 1995, with tensions between India and Pakistan at a high, then prime minister Benazir Bhutto did not wish to attend the Eighth Saarc Summit in New Delhi. The then president Farooq Leghari was nonetheless dispatched in her stead, reflecting Islamabad’s commitment to the platform and the process.
Today, Pakistan is reaffirming its dedication to Saarc. It is a vital mechanism to address shared challenges such as poverty, climate change and trade barriers. But if India continues to choose disengagement and obstruct progress, it should reconsider its stance without hesitation. With the global economy experiencing upheaval, and conflict over dwindling resources growing intense, there is strength to be found in numbers. With or without India, South Asia must forge ahead.

Yaum-i-Ashura is observed every year on Muharram 10 with solemnity to pay homage to Imam Husain — the grandson of Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) — and other martyrs of Karbala.
So far, processions in Karachi, Hyderabad and Punjab have culminated, according to statements from senior officials.
The Ashura procession in Karachi safely culminated at Hussainiya Iraniyan Imam Bargah, with a police update sharing that the head of the procession reached the imam bargah at 6:20pm.
Additional IG Karachi Javed Alam Odho praised the Karachi Police for excellent security arrangements during Muharram, according to a statement from his office.
“Majalis and processions were organised at several places in Karachi, including Nishtar Park,” he was quoted as saying, expressing appreciation for the Traffic Police for arranging alternative routes for the convenience of the general public during the main procession.
Additional IG Odho also thanked media representatives, procession organisers, mourners and other institutions for their cooperation, according to the statement.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed his satisfaction over the peaceful end of Ashura and thanked the interior minister, police and Rangers for “foolproof” security arrangements and the local government minister, Karachi mayor and relevant staff for providing facilities, according to a statement from his office.
“The peaceful conclusion of Ashura processions across Sindh is the government’s success,” Shah was quoted as saying. “Despite high security concerns, the Sindh Police did an excellent job, and the government made every effort to provide all facilities to the mourners.”

Shah praised the role of religious scholars in maintaining religious harmony, calling their role “commendable”.
“Sindh is the land of Sufis. We are advocates of peace,” Shah stated.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also congratulated Sindh Police for their excellent security strategy and performance during Ashura.
“During this important occasion, security measures taken by all units of the Sindh Police, including the Traffic Police and Special Branch Police at the provincial level from Muharram 1 to Ashura, are commendable at every level,” he was quoted as saying in a statement.
Lanjar also praised and appreciated the performance of Rangers Sindh and other security agencies on this occasion.
Meanwhile, the central Ashura procession in Hyderabad culminated peacefully at Karbala Dadan Shah.
Every year, the procession departs from Qadam Gah Maula Ali and is managed by Anjuma-i-Hyderi, which was founded in 1948.
The entire route was sealed since the early morning with barbed wire, while police and Rangers personnel were deployed.
The procession reached St Mary’s Convent School roundabout, where mourners performed zohrain prayers. Subsequently, a majlis was addressed a small distance from the roundabout by Syed Wasim Hyder Zaidi, according to an Anjuman-i-Hyderi spokesman.
A majlis was also addressed by Allama Irfan Ali Kazmi before the procession departed from Qadam Gah.
The procession was delayed by over an hour at St Mary’s Chowk and passed the area at 5.15pm instead of the usual time of 4pm. This area also connects the route of the tazia procession from the city.
Police arrangements for security were also weak. No strict checking was seen and everyone was allowed to reach the procession route, especially from Universal Book Depot point. Some policemen who were initially seen for security purpose disappeared subsequently.
Deputy Inspector General Tariq Dharejo, Senior Superintendent of Police Adeel Chandio and Deputy Commissioner Zain Ul Abidin monitored the proceedings in the control room set up in the City police station.
Meanwhile, a statement from the Punjab government stated that processions were culminating safely in multiple cities across the province. Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif congratulated her team, including Salman Rafique, ministers, institutions and others, for the “excellent arrangements”.
“For the first time, we had not only the best Muharram in terms of arrangements but also the most peaceful one,” Maryam was quoted as saying. “Along with cleaning the roads, the dirt of hatred was also wiped away.”
Senior Provincial Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, accompanied by other ministers, arrived at the bridge of the Metro Bus Station, leaving Nisar Haveli in Lahore. She also visited the control room established at the Punjab Home Department and reviewed arrangements for Yaum-i-Ashura across the province in detail.
A briefing delivered to Aurangzeb confirmed that the processions were being monitored in real-time through 7,500 cameras across Punjab and that 113,000 personnel were deployed.
Additionally, more than 1,600 “hate-spreading accounts” were reported by the Cyber ​​Patrol Cell of the Home Department and 170 people were arrested, according to the briefing.
Aurangzeb was also briefed on the provision of clean water and clean procession routes, where water was sprinkled to cool mourners amid the heat and the spraying of disinfectants was continuous. Mobile toilets were also provided and rescue personnel were on standby in case of emergency.
A coordinated plan was also prepared with the Water and Power Distribution Authority (Wapda) and other institutions for uninterrupted power supply during Yaum-i-Ashura.
Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a traffic plan for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.
Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), being observed today.

President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid rich tribute to the sacrifice of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and his companions, saying that Ashura gives us a message of sacrifice, truthfulness, sincere determination, and standing up for the truth.
In their separate messages on Yaum-i-Ashura, they urged the nation to uphold the values and principles of fortitude and courage demonstrated by the martyrs of Karbala and to exhibit perseverance in the face of trials, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
President Zardari said that Karbala is a symbol of an eternal struggle against falsehood. “This day is not only an unparalleled story of sacrifice, loyalty, and patience but also a bright lamp that shows the path of truth and righteousness in the darkness of every era.”
In his message, PM Shehbaz said: “Karbala teaches us that although the path of truth is difficult, it is the path that leads to the pleasure of Allah Almighty and the satisfaction of hearts and eternal prosperity.”
He said the message of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) is not limited to his time but is a universal message, which even today convinces us that a Muslim stands for the truth, supports the oppressed, and advocates justice in all circumstances.</p><small>2025-07-06 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0618170583cf3f3.jpg?r=181916' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922498/6-die-in-flash-floods-rains-in-kp-and-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>6 die in flash floods, rains in KP and Punjab</strong></a><br><p>Six people were killed while one person was injured on Sunday amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMA) in both provinces.
At least 22 people have been killed and 11 others have been injured in KP in accidents related to rain, strong winds, flash floods and landslides since June 25, according to PDMA reports. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province, while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water.
Additionally, PDMA warned on Friday that the risk of glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) — the sudden release of water and debris from a glacial lake — has increased in glacial areas of the province due to increasing temperatures, which in turn has raised the risk of additional flooding.
Today’s report from the PDMA outlined that four people were killed in KP while another was injured due to heavy rainfall and flash floods, according to the PDMA’s reporting officers in Malakand and Hazara divisions.
The PDMA said that three rooms in a house in the Buner district’s Teenolo Dheri village collapsed, killing a woman and injuring a man. Separately, in Buner, a temporary bridge pillar at Faizabad Khwar was swept away.
In Malakand, a flash flood caused by heavy rainfall swept through the Heero Shah union council, killing three people.
According to the PDMA report, one woman and two children were swept away. The woman and one of the children drowned.
“Rescue 1122 recovered [a] female body, while two children are still missing,” the report read, adding that a rescue operation was underway.
Rescue 1122 later issued an update stating that one of the children had been rescued.
Meanwhile, Dargai Assistant Commissioner (AC) Shahbaz Khan told Dawn.com that a woman and her grandson drowned in the Zor Mandi nullah as they were crossing it.
“Both bodies were recovered by Rescue 1122 and moved to Dargai hospital,” he stated.
Dargai Additional AC Waheedullah told Dawn.com that there was heavy rain in the mountains of Kot and the Hiro Shah Dargai area in the morning.
“Flash floods occurred in small, dry nullahs originating from the mountains and leading to small streams,” he said. “A nine-year-old boy was swept away by the flash flood in a small dry nullah. His grandmother, around 55-years-old, tried to save him but was also swept away.
The additional AC said that a rescue operation was launched immediately and that the boy’s body was recovered from the Pir Kalay Harichan Charsadda/Badragga Malakand boundary, while the body of the woman was recovered from the Zormandi Quaidabad area.
Additional AC Waheedullah further said that he was present in the field and people were discouraged from approaching or crossing the nullahs through announcements and the deployment of Levies personnel.
Additionally, three cows were rescued from flash floods in the Zormandi area.
“The bodies are being transported to Arang Bajaur and an ambulance from Rescue 1122 was arranged,” Waheedullah added.
In Mansehra, the PDMA stated in its report that an an 18-year-old resident of Rawalpindi had drowned in a flash flood in Putwar Halqa Jabba which was caused by heavy rain.
Amir Khadam, spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Mansehra, told Dawn.com that the young man drowned when he was crossing a nullah in the Mansehra district with his motorcycle on Sunday morning.
“The body of the deceased was recovered from floodwater in the Ghotar area and was turned over to his heirs,” Khadam said.
The PDMA added that due to the heavy rainfall, landslides were reported in Buner’s Pandriks union council and Torghar district’s Tharala area. Both events caused traffic blockages and heavy machinery was deployed to clear the roads.
Heavy rain continues to lash Punjab
Meanwhile, a PDMA report on monsoon rains in various districts of Punjab, including Lahore, was released today.
According to a PDMA spokesperson, dilapidated and decaying houses collapsed amid heavy rain, with two dead and six injured in various accidents.
“A woman and a child were killed due to the collapse of dilapidated and decaying buildings in Rawalpindi and Gujranwala,” said the spokesperson. “Two dilapidated and mud houses were affected due to monsoon rains.”
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said in a statement that he expected heavy rain to persist in Punjab until July 10.
“Heavy monsoon rains are expected in most parts of Punjab in the next 24 hours,” he said. “Stay in safe places during thunderstorms and do not shelter in mud houses or dilapidated buildings.
“During rain, slow down the speed of your vehicle and maintain a reasonable distance,” he urged.
He also instructed medical institutions to provide the best medical assistance to the injured.
“As per the instructions of the Punjab chief minister, citizens’ losses will be compensated,” Kathia instructed. “Assistance will also be provided to the relatives of the deceased as per government policy.”
According to the report, Lahore recorded the highest amount of rainfall in Paniwala Talab, at 74 millimetres (mm).
Similarly, 72mm fell in Lakshmi Chowk, 57mm on Jail Road, 52mm in Nishtar Town, 52mm in Farrukhabad, 51mm in Gulberg, 37mm at the airport, 33mm in Mughal Pura and 44mm at Qurtaba Chowk.
Elsewhere in Punjab, Jhelum recorded 102mm of rainfall, Mangla recorded 81mm and Rawalpindi recorded 43mm.
Rain was also recorded in Sialkot, Gujarat, Narowal, Kasur, Murree, Attock, Gujranwala, Bahawalnagar and Sahiwal.
Warnings issued
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued a warning today for widespread rain, wind, and thundershowers expected across several regions of the country from July 6-8 (Sunday to Tuesday), The Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The wet spell is likely to bring very heavy rainfall at various locations, with the risks of flash floods, urban flooding and landslides, particularly in the northern and hilly areas.
The PMD said that rain, wind and thundershowers are likely in KP, Punjab, northeast and southern Balochistan, southeast Sindh, Kashmir, and Islamabad. Additionally, isolated heavy downpours are expected in upper Punjab, the Potohar region, Islamabad, KP, Azad and Jammu Kashmir (AJK), and northern Balochistan.
The Met Office warned that heavy rainfall may generate flash floods in local streams and nullahs in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan, northeast Punjab, AJK, and parts of Balochistan.
It added that the risk of landslides and mudslides is high in vulnerable mountainous areas like KP, Murree, Galliyat and AJK, which may cause road closures and travel disruptions.</p><small>2025-07-06 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/06224021b574630.jpg?r=224242' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922506/deep-strikes-as-india-hammer-england-in-second-test' target='_blank'><strong>Deep strikes as India hammer England in second Test</strong></a><br><p>Akash Deep took 10 wickets in a Test match for the first time as India thrashed England by 336 runs at Edgbaston on Sunday for a series-levelling win.
Deep was playing in the second Test of the five-match series after India rested outstanding quick Jasprit Bumrah.
The 28-year-old took 6-99 as England, set a mammoth 608 runs to win, were dismissed for 271 on the fifth day.
Deep’s match figures of 10-147 were far and away the best of his eight-Test career.
Jamie Smith was the lone England batter to pass fifty in the second innings, with the wicketkeeper’s 88 following his brilliant 184 not out the first time around.
A crushing victory gave India their maiden Test win in nine matches at Edgbaston following seven defeats and a draw at the Birmingham ground.
This game was also a personal triumph for India captain Shubman Gill after he became the first batsman in Test cricket to post scores of 250 and 150 in the same match.
The 25-year-old’s majestic 269 in the first innings was followed by a dashing 161 off 162 balls in the second.
Gill has now scored three centuries in his first two Tests as captain following his 147 during India’s five-wicket loss in the series opener at Headingley.
History was against England when they resumed at 72-3 after rain delayed Sunday’s start by more than 90 minutes.
No Test side has made more in the fourth innings to win than the West Indies’ 418 against Australia at St John’s in 2003.
Early blow -
India, bidding for just a fourth series win in England, struck an early blow when Ollie Pope failed to add his overnight 24 by deflecting a Deep ball of extra bounce onto the stumps.
His exit brought in England captain Ben Stokes, on a king pair after his first golden duck in Tests in the first innings.
But Stokes, without a Test hundred in two years, avoided the embarrassment of two noughts in the same match with a legside flick.
England were soon 83-5, however, when Harry Brook was lbw for 23 to a Deep delivery that hit him on the back knee.
Brook, who made 158 in England’s first innings while sharing a stand of over 300 with Smith that kept the hosts afloat, optimistically reviewed.
But the confirmation of his dismissal was greeted by raucous cheers from the large number of India fans at Edgbaston.
Smith helped Stokes briefly keep India at bay during a sixth-wicket partnership of 70.
But in the last over before lunch Stokes was lbw for 33 to off-spinner Washington Sundar, the first India bowler other than Deep or Mohammed Siraj to take a wicket in the match.
England were 153-6 at the interval and after lunch Smith defiantly hit 17 off a Sundar over, including two soaring straight sixes.
But Chris Woakes fell tamely for seven when a miscued pull off Prasidh Krishna lobbed gently to midwicket.
Smith pulled Deep for two successive sixes to go to 88.
But it was a case of third time unlucky for the 24-year-old when trying to repeat the shot next ball, he holed out to Sundar at deep backward square leg off a well-disguised slower delivery to give Deep his fifth wicket of the innings.
At 226-8, the writing was on the wall for England.
Tailender Josh Tongue was brilliantly caught by a diving Siraj at midwicket before Brydon Carse holed out off Deep to cover where Gill, the player of the match, fittingly took the clinching catch.</p><small>2025-07-06 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/062207086e6899f.jpg?r=221128' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922505/tiktok-building-new-version-of-app-ahead-of-expected-us-sale-report' target='_blank'><strong>TikTok building new version of app ahead of expected US sale: report</strong></a><br><p>TikTok is building a new version of its app for users in the United States ahead the social media platform’s planned sale to a group of investors, The Information reported on Sunday, citing unnamed sources.
This comes as US President Donald Trump said on Friday he will start talking to China on Monday or Tuesday about a possible TikTok deal. He said the United States “pretty much” has a deal on the sale of the TikTok short-video app.
TikTok has developed a plan to launch the new app in US app stores on September 5, the report said.
Last month, Trump extended to September 17 a deadline for China-based ByteDance to divest the US assets of TikTok.
The report added that TikTok users will eventually have to download the new app to be able to continue using the service, although the existing app will work until March of next year, though the timeline could change.
TikTok did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.
A deal had been in the works earlier this year to spin off TikTok’s US operations into a new US-based firm, majority-owned and operated by American investors. That was put on hold after China indicated it would not approve it following Trump’s announcements of steep tariffs on Chinese goods.
Trump said the United States will probably have to get a deal approved by China.</p><small>2025-07-06 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/062116277193d0c.jpg?r=212011' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922502/mclarens-norris-wins-home-british-grand-prix' target='_blank'><strong>McLaren’s Norris wins home British Grand Prix</strong></a><br><p>Lando Norris won a treacherous rain-hit British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Sunday from his McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri.
Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg took third for the veteran German’s first-ever podium in 239 race starts.
Briton Norris returned to a rapturous reception from his home fans as he moved to within eight points of Piastri in the drivers’ standings.
“It’s beautiful, everything I ever dreamed of, this is everything I wanted to achieve, aside from winning the championship this is as good as it gets,” beamed Norris.
Piastri, who finished less than seven seconds behind Norris, threw away the win after the Australian was hit with a 10-second penalty for a safety car infringement.
As last week’s heatwave gave way to a more typical British summer’s day — spells of blue sky mixed with torrential showers — drivers had to keep their wits about them with puddles forming on the track.
Norris emerged from the chaos all smiles as he added to his wins already this season in Austria, Monaco and Australia.
Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton came in fourth ahead of polesitter Max Verstappen for Red Bull.
Piastri fell foul of the stewards when braking heavily before the safety car peeled off, a decision that left Piastri feeling robbed.
“I’m not going to say much, I don’t want to get myself in trouble,” he said in the post-race interview. “Apparently, you can’t brake behind the safety car anymore.”
For Hulkenberg, 37, this was a day to remember as he climbed the podium for the first time since joining the F1 grid way back in 2010.
“Podium — P3 baby!” said his ecstatic race engineer on the team radio after he crossed the line.
“I don’t think I can comprehend what we’ve just done,” replied the German.
Pierre Gasly’s Alpine took sixth, with Lance Stroll (Aston Martin), Alex Albon (Williams), Fernando Alonso in the other Aston and George Russell (Mercedes) rounding out the top 10.</p><small>2025-07-06 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612692-rescue-ends-in-lyari-after-60-hour-operation-27-lives-lost' target='_blank'><strong>Lyari building rescue operation ends after 60 hours with 27 confirmed dead</strong></a><br><p>

Rescue teams worked overnight on Friday to pull out more bodies from the rubble of the building situated in Lyari on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market.
“The rescue operation was completed on Sunday evening,” Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com. “No more human casualties have been found; thus, the total death toll stands at 27 people, whose bodies were earlier recovered and transported to Civil Hospital Karachi.”
The spokesperson added that acting Rescue 1122 Director General Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh remained on the ground for over 30 hours, directly commanding the rescue operation.
Khan said that the exact cause of the collapse would be determined later, but suggested it was “because the building was dilapidated”.
“A day before the collapse, residents felt a ‘shock’. It can be said now that it was not an earthquake, but the building’s structure being shaken or dislocated,” Khan said. “There were 12 families, though some families had already left the building after the tremors.”
Difficulties
The Rescue-1122 spokesperson said that there was a lack of coordination among different rescue organisations and that staffers from two private rescue organisations fought during the operation.
“They sustained injuries to the head during the scuffle,” Khan said. “It would have been more appropriate if one organisation had been given command, under which all rescue institutions could have worked.”
Another problem, according to Khan, was that relatives remained at the site as they were not willing to be moved to any government or private shelter. The rescue workers faced “immense pressure” from the relatives, he added.
Khan added that there was difficulty in moving heavy machinery like cranes due to the narrow streets.
“We used the same high-tech equipment that was used during the recent earthquake in Turkiye,” Khan told Dawn.com. “The use of such high-tech equipment, like life detectors helped rescue several people safely with some minor injuries. Without this equipment, the use of heavy machinery might have caused further injury.”
He said that over 100 personnel took part in the operation for three days, working in different shifts.
At around 1:30pm, Khan told Dawn.com, “it will take five to six more hours to complete the rescue operation”.
A total of 27 bodies were recovered, including nine women, 15 men, a 13-year-old child, a 10-year-old child, and a one-year-old infant. The bodies were transported to Civil Hospital Karachi by Edhi Ambulance.
Ten people who were injured have been discharged.
While speaking to the media today after leading the Ashura procession, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah provided details on the building collapse.
“Immediate rescue efforts were launched to save any survivors trapped under the rubble,” he said, adding that the bodies recovered had been handed over to the families.
He echoed Khan’s statement of rescue operations being expected to conclude today.
The chief minister assured that a detailed inquiry into the causes of the collapse would be conducted, with committees already formed to investigate the matter thoroughly.
He revealed that over 480 buildings in old city areas, mostly in District South, have been declared dangerous.
“The government plans to assist affected residents in finding alternative housing,” he said.
CM Murad added that the recently collapsed building was constructed only a few months ago, apparently without proper approval, and those responsible for unauthorised construction would face strict punishment.
He also urged the public to verify that any building they purchase has proper approval from the Building Control Authority.
He acknowledged that several people resist evacuation due to poverty and lack of alternatives, often buying or renting cheaper properties without checking safety approvals and later demanding government protection.
While empathising with these difficulties, he stressed that sometimes strict action is necessary to ensure public safety, as demonstrated by recent enforcement measures.</p><small>2025-07-06 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612652-hec-chief' target='_blank'><strong>'Governance is key to elevating Pakistan's universities globally'</strong></a><br><p>

The accounts for both Reuters and Reuters World were inaccessible in India; however, users were still able to access 30 other Reuters accounts, The Print added. The Reuters news website is also accessible.
X users in India have posted screenshots showing that they are unable to access the news agency’s accounts.
 






Reuters has yet to issue a statement, while the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) told India Today that no order was given to restrict the accounts.
“There is no requirement from the Government of India to withhold the Reuters handle. We are continuously working with X to resolve the problem,” an official spokesperson for the ministry told outlet India Today.
 
 

The Print reported that in previous instances of X restricting access to accounts in India due to legal requirements, the platform issued statements through its Global Government Affairs handle.
The account has yet to issue a statement on the restriction.
This is not the first time India has blocked accounts on the platform, formerly known as Twitter.
According to an Instagram post by The Hindustan Times, the accounts were withheld as per orders issued amid Operation Sindoor, when India launched missiles at sites in Pakistan in May.
“The centre (government) has reportedly responded to social media platform X blocking the account of news agency Reuters in India, saying that it is a mistake on the part of the Elon Musk-owned company,” the outlet wrote in the post’s caption.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

According to The Print, X issued a statement on May 8 saying it had “received executive orders from the Indian government” to “block over 8,000 accounts in India, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees”.
“In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India’s local laws. For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts,” X wrote.
Though X stated that it disagreed with New Delhi’s demands, the platform withheld access to the account solely within India.

Chopra, who won gold at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 and silver at the 2024 Paris Games, triumphed with a throw of 86.18 metres at the 12-athlete javelin Neeraj Chopra Classic event.
He finished ahead of former world champion Julius Yego (silver) and Sri Lanka’s Rumesh Pathirage (bronze).
“The biggest target of the competition was to uplift the Indian athletes alongside the international ones. We got the best javelin throwers to this competition,” Chopra told reporters after winning the competition.
The event drew more than 14,500 spectators — a figure that delighted Chopra, who has long championed greater public support for track and field events.
“We really wanted people to come and watch track and field,” said Chopra, who has single-handedly raised interest for athletics in India and has more than nine million Instagram followers.
“I always request people to come to the stadiums to cheer athletes as they work really hard.
“Track and field is one of the hardest sporting events. I request people to come and watch nationals as well… because our sport can only grow when people will come and watch us.”
The event featured three rounds with six attempts per participant, narrowing the field to eight after the initial round of three throws.
Among the five Indian competitors, three advanced to the second round, including Chopra, outperforming international athletes such as former Olympic champion Thomas Rohler and the Czech Republic’s Martin Konecny.
“We have been doing really well in the sport. They (Indian athletes) were quite happy to get a platform to play alongside the world champions,” the 27-year-old said.
“We also plan to add more events to this competition going forward, which will help the Indian athletes more.”
Among the Indian athletes, apart from Chopra, Asian Athletics Championships silver medallist Sachin Yadav performed well, recording his best throw of 82.33m in the third attempt.
“Sachin could have performed better, but he twisted his ankle in his opening throw. Overall, it was good. They will hopefully do well in the future.

Chanting of red-robed monks and nuns rang out from Himalayan hilltop forested temples in India, home to the Dalai Lama since he and thousands of other Tibetans fled Chinese troops who crushed an uprising in their capital Lhasa in 1959.
“I am just a simple Buddhist monk; I don’t normally engage in birthday celebrations,” the Dalai Lama said in a message, thanking those marking it with him for using the opportunity “to cultivate peace of mind and compassion”.
Dressed in traditional robes and a flowing yellow wrap, he walked with the aid of two monks while flashing his trademark beaming smile to thousands of followers.
 






Beijing condemns the Nobel Peace Prize winner — who has led a lifelong campaign for greater autonomy for Tibet, a vast high-altitude plateau — as a rebel and separatist.
Alongside the celebrations, however, is the worry for Tibetans in exile that China will name its successor to bolster control over the territory it poured troops into in 1950 and has ruled ever since.
That raises the likelihood of rival challengers to the post; one by self-declared atheist Beijing, the other by the Dalai Lama’s office based in neighbouring India, a regional rival of China.
‘Good heart’
The celebrations on Sunday are the culmination of days of long-life prayers for Tenzin Gyatso, who followers believe is the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, a man whose moral teachings and idiosyncratic humour have made him one of the world’s most popular religious leaders.
“While it is important to work for material development, it is vital to focus on achieving peace of mind through cultivating a good heart and by being compassionate, not just toward near and dear ones, but toward everyone,” he said in his birthday message.
“Through this, you will contribute to making the world a better place.”
 
 

The celebrations also included his key announcement that, after being inundated with messages of support from fellow Tibetans both inside and in exile, the spiritual institution would continue after his death.
He said he had received appeals from followers from across the Himalayan region, Mongolia and parts of Russia and China.
The seemingly esoteric matters of reincarnation have real-world political consequences, with Tibetans fearing his death will mark a major setback in his push for more autonomy for the Himalayan region.
The Dalai Lama said his India-based office alone would “exclusively” identify that successor — prompting a swift and sharp reply from China that the reincarnation “must be approved by the central government” in Beijing.
China said the succession would be carried out “by drawing lots from a golden urn”, foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters on Wednesday.
That urn is held by Beijing, and the Dalai Lama has warned that, when used dishonestly, it lacks “any spiritual quality”.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered effusive birthday greetings on Sunday, calling the Dalai Lama an “enduring symbol of love”.
 






India and China are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia, but have sought to repair ties after a 2020 border clash.
‘Freedom and dignity’
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said in a statement that Washington was “committed to promoting respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of Tibetans”.
Among the crowds attending the celebrations was Hollywood star Richard Gere, a longtime backer of the Tibetans in exile, who on Sunday said the Dalai Lama “totally embodies selflessness, complete love and compassion and wisdom”.
 
 

Messages of support were also given by former US presidents Bill Clinton and George W Bush, as well as Barack Obama, who said the Dalai Lama had shown what it means to “speak up for freedom and dignity”.
The ceremony ended with the Dalai Lama eating a slice of cake and thousands singing “happy birthday”.
No details have been released for the future succession.
All so far have been men or boys, often identified as toddlers and taking up the role only as teenagers.
The current Dalai Lama, himself identified in 1937, has said that if there is a successor it will come from the “free world” outside China’s control.
In a speech to followers on Sunday, the Dalai Lama said his practice of Buddhism meant he had dedicated his life towards seeking compassion.
“I’m now 90 and… when I reflect on my life, I see that I have not wasted my life at all”, he said, speaking in Tibetan.
“I would not have regrets at the time of my death; rather I would be able to die very peacefully.”</p><small>2025-07-06 07:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/06113501e019c75.jpg?r=113507' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922333/karachi-to-remain-cloudy-and-humid-met-office' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to remain cloudy and humid: Met Office</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The city is expected to continue with largely cloudy and humid weather conditions that may lead to drizzle during the night or morning over the next few days, the Met department stated on Saturday.
The department’s data showed that Karachi has the “most pleasant” weather in the province these days, with a temperature of 34 degrees Celsius recorded on Saturday. Relative humidity was recorded at 70 per cent.
Intense heat prevailed over northern and central areas, with Dadu seeing the highest temperature (44°C), followed by Khairpur (43°C), Sukkur, Mohenjo Daro and Rohri (42.5°C), Larkana (42°C), Shaheed Benazirabad (41°C), Sakrand (40°C), Mithi (36°C) and Hyderabad (38°C).
Thatta, with 39.5°C, saw a deviation of 5.1°C from its monthly average temperature for July.
“Right now, there is no possibility of significant heavy rains in Sindh over the next 10 days. However, during this period, light rain/drizzle may occur in Tharparkar, Umerkot, Badin, Sujawal, Thatta, Ghotki, Larkana, Shikarpur, Jamshoro districts and the Karachi division,” said Chief Meteorologist Ameer Hyder Laghari.
According to him, different weather conditions are currently prevailing across the country. “While the cities from Rahim Yar Khan to Lahore are seeing good rains these days, drought conditions prevail in the northern areas, resulting in fast-paced glacier melting.
 
 

“At least for the past two to three years, weather conditions in the northern areas have dramatically changed; snowfall has greatly reduced and the duration of warmer days has increased. This has seriously affected the farming sector in those areas.”
