• Inaugurates Pakistan’s first business facilitation centre
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Thursday reached out to leaders of mainstream political parties and assured them of the federal government’s cooperation and support in dealing with the aftermath of floods and monsoon rains.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the PM telephoned PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and expressed grief over the loss of lives caused by the torrential rains and urban flooding in southern Sindh, particularly Karachi.
He offered full support from the federal government to assist the Sindh government in addressing the emergency situation.
Prime Minister Shehbaz directed the National Disaster Management Autho­rity (NDMA) chairman to stay in close coordination with the Sindh government, provide all possible assistance to the Provincial Disaster Management Autho­rity (PDMA), and ensure the early warnings to the people about potential risks.
 
 

The prime minister also spoke with Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman and Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
During his conversation with the JI emir regarding the damage caused by recent rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and ongoing relief efforts, the PM appreciated the proactive role of the Al-Khidmat Foundation in rescue and relief operations.
He also discussed with Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui the recent rains and flood situation in Sindh, as well as potential risks from expected rainfall, assuring full cooperation from NDMA and other federal institutions to address any emergency situation.
Business Facilitation Centre
Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz inaugurated the country’s first-ever Business Facilitation Centre (BFC), aimed at promoting ease of doing business and attracting investment in Pakistan by providing a one-stop solution for investors and entrepreneurs.
Established by the Board of Investment (BoI), the BFC will facilitate the business community by providing a wide range of services, including guidance on regulatory requirements and facilitating business registration, licensing, and permits.
The centre will serve as a one-stop service, reducing hurdles and facilitating efficient interaction between businesses and government entities.
The prime minister was briefed on the centre’s operations, including investor gui­­dance, application processes for special economic zones, and streamlined procedures for licensing and payments with significantly reduced timelines.
He also unveiled the project plaque and exp­res­sed his intent to replicate the mo­­del acr­oss the country if it meets its objectives.
The prime minister urged all the relevant departments to efficiently run the centre to make it a success by facilitating and guiding the investors from other sectors, just like other countries.
“Otherwise, this will be nothing more than brick and mortar. That is not my vision… We should welcome customers with a smiling face combined with genuine support without any delay, not even for a second,” he advised.
The PM emphasised the need to promote the facilitation centre internationally and establish it as a model to be replicated in other parts of the country.
PM Shehbaz, who also visited different desks of the facilitation centre, was told that the investors would be able to submit their applications for setting up special economic zones or other projects at the centre, by answering different queries such as the nature of the business, loan and equity structure, target market, export potential, expected employment generation, and utility requirements.
The system will reflect all attached documents as well as an activity log, besides enabling the applicant to track their application, who will also be timely informed about any shortcomings on their part.
In his remarks, BoI Minister Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh described the centre’s establishment as a major breakthrough in investment facilitation. He noted that previously, investors had to visit multiple departments to complete the procedures for setting up businesses.

Things didn’t come easy for him as a player, he says. And he doesn’t expect them to be any better for him as coach. That’s what has brought the Peruvian former Newcastle United cult hero to football’s backwaters in Pakistan.
The sport in the country has seen little progress due to a decade-long institutional crisis in the Pakistan Football Federation. There have been some highs, notably Pakistan’s historic victory over Cambodia in 2023 — the first time the national team won a FIFA World Cup qualifier — but otherwise, it’s been a tale of woe compounded by a non-existent domestic structure.
Stephen Constantine, Solano’s predecessor who guided Pakistan to that famous victory over Cambodia, departed under a cloud; the newly-elected PFF leadership under president Mohsen Gilani having opted to look for other options. Enter the 50-year-old Solano, whose breathtaking skill on the wing made him a fan favourite at Newcastle but who still has a lot to prove as a coach.
None of his stints as head coach since leaving the job as Peru’s assistant coach, where he notably oversaw his nation qualify for their first World Cup in 36 years, has lasted more than a year. The Pakistan job offers him a chance to reset but he believes that any success will have a lot of contributing factors.
“My journey hasn’t been easy at any time,” Solano told Dawn in an exclusive interview just before he was unveiled to the media here at the PFF headquarters on Thursday. “And it won’t be easy here too.”
Solano recalled how he first broke into the consciousness of his first club side Sporting Cristal through a trial arranged by his father, who became a taxi driver after leaving the Peruvian army.
“I had to work very hard to impress at the trial,” said Solano. “In Peru, there is fierce competition for places … Everyone there loves football. Everyone there wants to be a footballer.”
Sparkling performances for Cristal saw Solano earn a move to Argentine giants Boca Juniors where he played with the legendary Diego Maradona. Only a year later, he had English Premier League clubs hovering over him and at a time when South American players preferred to go to Spain or Italy, he opted to take a path less trodden when he opted to sign for Newcastle in 1998.
“During that time, Spain or Italy was the easier option because there was no language barrier,” reflected Solano, who not only took upon himself to learn a new language and culture but also adjust to a different playing style with English football being more physical.
“The spell at Boca somewhat made it easier [to make the transition] because it is very similar,” said Solano. “But it was a test, and I wanted to test myself because [forward] Faustino Asprillia, who was Colombian, had a successful spell at Newcastle.”
He didn’t disappoint. Arriving after Asprilla had joined Parma, Solano became a first-team regular at Newcastle with not only his playing ability but also his personality making him a fan favourite.  But major silverware eluded both Newcastle and Solano, who also had spells at Aston Villa, West Ham United, Leicester City and Hull City in England before retiring.
Solano’s biggest regret, though, remains that he was unable to help Peru qualify for the World Cup as a player but some consolation came when he helped his country end that long drought in Russia 2018.
“It was a big achievement for the whole country as a whole to get to the World Cup after such a long time,” said Solano. “[Head coach] Ricardo Gareca did a wonderful job in unifying the team and we were able to do that. I think the lack of discipline was one of the reasons my generation was unable to qualify for the World Cup.”
Targets and expectations, though, are more modest with Pakistan.  But Solano is keen on not only bringing the South American flair but also grit and determination, and the fighting spirit, to the national and Under-23 teams. Many players, the local-based ones in particular, have had to do without any kind of domestic action. But in his first few training sessions, he has seen that the talent is promising.
“I’ve seen some really talented players who have had to make do without domestic football,” he said. “That [domestic football] is something  we need to collectively work on: me, the PFF and its leadership. But the big thing is that they’re willing to fight for a spot on the national team.
“It is something I’ve told the diaspora players I’ve spoken to since I took over. I’ve told them that they have to try and make their presence felt at the training camps because those who are here are willing to give everything to make the team.”
For a man who has fought so many battles himself, Solano is counting on that desire to lift Pakistan football.

Explaining the unexpected change in weather over the past two days, Focal Person of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) Anjum Niaz Zaigham said the current monsoon system has lost its intensity and its likely impact on Karachi is almost over.
“Though as we speak, the city is likely to see good showers within an hour or so (late evening) as rain bands are approaching Karachi after bringing about showers in Hyderabad, Sanghar, Tando Allah Yar and other parts of Sindh,” he said.
He said that Orangi Town saw 113mm rain on Wednesday.

Light to moderate showers continue for third day

According to him, the weather system released its maximum energy on August 19 and the circulation over Gujarat, India dissipated early than expected.
“We were thinking that the low pressure area and the circulation over Gujarat would combine together but that didn’t happen, fortunately. Even, then, we wanted to remain cautious as it’s difficult to predict the system’s behaviour with complete accuracy,” he said.
Karachi, he pointed out, is expected to have its next monsoon spell on Aug 27, though the ongoing system is likely to impact south-east parts of the province on Friday (today).
Meanwhile, the Met department in an advisory has forecast mostly cloudy weather with slight chances of light rain / drizzle over the next two days (Friday-Thursday) in Karachi with maximum temperature ranging between 32 and 34 degrees Celsius.
According to the PMD’s 24-hour rain data of Aug 20, the maximum rain was recorded in Orangi town 113mm followed by PAF Faisal Base 43mm, Korangi 36mm, Keamari 31mm, PAF Base Masroor and University Road 24mm each, DHA 21mm, Nizamabad 19mm, Saadi twon 16mm and North Karachi 9mm.
Man dies of electrocution
A young man died of electrocution in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Thursday, bringing the death toll to 15 in three days of rain.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the Sahir Qamar, 30, was brought dead from DHA to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre on Thursday. He died of an electric shock, she said.
Officials said that most deaths were caused by falling house structures and electrocution.
‘Situation fully under control’
While the city administration is struggling to drain rainwater accumulated in many underpasses and roads, Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi claimed that rainwater had been cleared from most markets in the city and adjoining roads had been reopened for traffic.
He stated in a statement that the drainage work at Nazimabad and Tariq Road underpasses had been completed and both reopened for vehicular traffic. Similarly, water accumulated at NIPA had been removed and the road restored for traffic flow. Work is continuing at Drigh Road, Sohrab Goth, and Gulbahar underpasses, where pumps have been installed and are operational. The Commissioner said these underpasses will be cleared soon, he added.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani also paid a visit to the city and told the media that the overall situation in Karachi remained fully under control.
He said that despite the continuing showers, municipal staff, civil administration, elected representatives and provincial ministers are all present on the ground to supervise relief efforts. He added that after clearing major roads, drainage work on link roads and residential streets has been expedited.
He appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary travel during the downpour to prevent any untoward incidents.

The report has prompted Pakistan to call on the international community to adopt a global counterterrorism strategy.
The UN report, presented to the Security Council on Wednesday, highlights the threat posed by ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K), which continues to represent one of the most serious challenges to Afghanistan and the greater South and Central Asian region, with approximately 2,000 fighters.
Speaking at the UNSC, Pakis­tan’s Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad described Afghanistan as “precarious” and underscored the serious threat ISIL-K poses to Pakistan’s security.

Pakistan calls on international community to adopt a global counterterrorism strategy

“Our principal adversary in the region is actively sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan. It bankrolls and supports terrorist proxies, and carries out extraterritorial assassinations,” he said.
 
 

Pakistan also warned of the dangers posed by collaboration among the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Majeed Brigade, noting that these groups “share terrorist training camps, target strategic infrastructure and economic projects, and most tragically — ordinary citizens”.
Ambassador Ahmad described the TTP as the largest UN-desig­nated terrorist group operating from Afghan soil, directly threatening Pakistan’s national security.
 
 

The UN report notes that nearly 3,000 fighters remain active in Syria, attempting to rebuild operational capacity and exploit local security gaps, and some of them may relocate to Afghanistan.
The report also raised concern over tens of thousands of individuals detained in camps in northeast Syria, many women and children with alleged ISIL links. Prolonged confinement in unsafe conditions risks radicalisation, prompting calls for the “safe, voluntary, and dignified repatriation” of these individuals, particularly children.
UN officials warned that Daesh is increasingly exploiting digital tools and artificial intelligence to raise funds, recruit youth, and spr­ead propaganda, creating a com­­plex, multi-dimensional threat.
Ambassador Ahmad emphasis­ed the need for a holistic approach to counter terrorism, ad­­dressing un­­d­erlying drivers such as state op­­pression and occupation. He conde­mned collective punishment, hu­­man rights violations, demographic changes, and the misuse of counterterrorism narratives in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kash­mir (IIOJK) and the Occupied Pal­estinian Territories. He stressed that terrorism must be differentiated from legitimate struggles of people against foreign occupation.
He also criticised bias in UN counterterrorism frameworks, noting that all listed individuals are Muslim while non-Muslim extremists often escape scrutiny. “It is not understandable, and indeed unacceptable, that every name on the Security Council’s terrorism lists is Muslim, while terrorists and violent extremists elsewhere escape scrutiny. This must change,” he said.

In another raid, the Balochistan FIA arrested a man in Quetta for allegedly obtaining identity cards using forged documents. The spokesperson said that the agency is carrying out a nationwide crackdown against groups involved in issuing CNICs through fraudulent means. On Thursday, suspect Bashir Ahmed was arrested from outside the Nadra office on Double Road.

However, unlike the PTI workers who are expected to be released from jail, Mr Khan’s detention is unlikely to end soon, as he is facing over 100 cases in the courts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
The court of Judicial Magistrate Mureed Abbas granted bail to the detained workers against surety bonds of Rs100,000 each.
 
 

The magistrate had reserved the verdict after hearing arguments from both sides and reviewing the case record, later announcing the decision in favour of the petitioners.

FIA court adjourns hearing of Bulgari jewellery set case until Aug 26

According to police, 40 PTI workers were arrested in a case registered at the Margalla Police Station, while 23 others were detained in a case registered at the Industrial Area Police Station. The cases were filed in connection with a protest held on August 15 under various legal provisions.
Meanwhile, the Special Court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) adjourned the hearing in the case related to a Bulgari jewellery set that Mr Khan allegedly received from the Toshakhana. Judge Shahrukh Arjumand conducted the brief proceeding at Federal Courts Complex instead of Adiala Jail and adjourned the hearing until August 26.
Mr Khan is currently serving a 14-year sentence in the £190 million corruption reference and is also in judicial custody in connection with multiple FIRs.
According to statistics provided by Isl­a­mabad Police, Mr Khan is facing 67 cas­es registered under the Pakis­tan Penal Code (PPC) and the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). These FIRs are related to PTI’s protests during the Azadi March and events on October 5 and November 26.
The former premier is also facing 43 cases in various courts of Rawalpindi. These FIRs were registered by Rawal­pindi and Attock Police. Additionally, Mr. Khan is facing 12 cases in the Anti-Terrorism Court of Rawalpindi related to the violent protests of May 9, 2023.

The Islamic Relief’s emergency response team is on the ground distributing food and water, and the team’s assessment found that 73 per cent of houses are destroyed or partially damaged; sixty per cent of people in Buner and 53 per cent in Swat are now unable to support their families; eighty per cent of agricultural land in Buner has been damaged; nearly 50 per cent of livestock animals have died and been washed away.
 
 

According to the assessment, 40 per cent of households are already reporting cases of diarrhea, with water-borne diseases spreading as the water supply is contaminated by bodies of victims and livestock and the destruction of sanitation facilities.
Acting country director of Islamic Relief Pakistan, Raza Narejo, said that “now the flood waters are receding, but the impact is enormous and it will affect people here for a long time. The poorest communities have seen their jobs and income wiped out in a flash, with 60 per cent of workers in Buner district now unable to sustain themselves following the floods.“

The restriction was initially imposed on April 24 this year amid ongoing tensions between the two countries. It was first extended on May 23, followed by further extensions up to July 23, and then until August 24.
Sources confirmed that the Pakistan Airport Aut­h­ority had previously exte­nded the airspace closure for Indian aircraft from July 18 to August 24. Now, ac­cording to the latest NOTAM, the Pakistani airspace will remain closed to Indian aircraft from Aug 25 until Sept 25.
The ban applies specifically to Indian-registered or leased aircraft, whether op­­erated, owned, or leased by Indian operators, including military fli­ghts, as per NOTAM A0472/25 issued by the authorities con­­cerned. However, Pak­is­tan’s airspace remains open to all other international flights, it said.

Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, flanked by PTI senior leaders Latif Khosa and Aamir Dogar, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that the day marked a “moment of relief and joy for the nation”, as the courts had finally delivered justice after a prolonged wait. He pointed out that only one case — the Al-Qadir Trust corruption case — remained pending. He hoped it would also be decided in PTI’s favour, paving the way for Mr Khan’s release from detention.
Highlighting the events of May 9, the PTI leader reiterated the party’s stance that the May 9 narrative was “fabricated”. He said that the latest decision was purely legal in nature, serving as “proof” of Imran Khan’s innocence. “When the entire May 9 account is built on falsehood and rests solely on the testimony of two police officials, what is there for us to apologise for?” he said.
Salman Akram Raja expressed confidence that party leaders Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, and Malik Ahmad Bhachar would soon return, affirming that the struggle of the PTI colleagues would continue with full determination.

Party leaders say court order ‘exposes fabricated narrative’; only one case remains against Imran

Recalling the negotiation process, he said PTI had clearly demanded a meeting with the party founder, but the authorities failed to arrange it. “We want to talk to those who hold the actual mandate and authority for negotiations,” he reiterated.
 
 

Referring to the cases against Imran Khan, Latif Khosa noted that the matter had already lost its relevance when bail was granted to Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and Hafiz Farhat, which led the apex court to extend similar relief to the PTI founder.
He highlighted that in the Zaman Park and Chakri incidents, only one individual had testified, while in five out of eight cases, Mr Khan was not even named. He termed the arrest unlawful, reminding that the law clearly stated that once bail was granted in one case, another of the same nature could not be initiated.
Referring to the Al-Qadir Trust case, he said the funds were deposited in the SC’s account and were originally meant for the Sindh government. However, he claimed that Shehbaz Sharif had diverted these funds towards the Danish School project.
“It is now for the Sindh government and the federal government to resolve this matter between themselves,” he said.
Separately, PTI Punjab leader Shayan Bashir said the verdict clearly demonstrated that all attempts to link Imran Khan to the May 9 violence were “baseless”, and the state machinery failed to substantiate such allegations.

The audit report also indicated there was significant public dissatisfaction with the performance of the NDMA in terms of its awareness campaigns, preparedness, and relief efforts.
This observation was made after the Directorate General Audit (Cli­mate Change and Environm­ent) conducted an audit of the NDMA Islamabad.
A public questionnaire was used to gather opinions on their effectiveness.
A significant portion of participants had limited, or to some extent, awareness about natural disasters (72 per cent combined), while the awareness of NDMA as an agency was also limited (72pc) had knowledge to some extent.

Auditors raise Rs28bn objections; authority accused of overpaying firms for Karachi drains project

Overall, 76pc disagreed or were neutral when asked if the NDMA prepared communities for potential disaster or not; only 36pc agreed.
A majority (76pc) was dissatisfied or neutral regarding the speed of relief efforts by the NDMA, with only 24pc expressing satisfaction. Satisfaction with overall performance ratings was also low, with 84pc dissatisfied or neutral. Only 16pc were satisfied.
The auditor general pointed out in the report that an unauthorised expenditure out of the National Di­­saster Management Fund (NDMF) was carried out in 2023-24.
The NDMA incurred an expenditure of Rs21.677 billion out of the National Disaster Management Fund Account on the procurement of relief items, civil works of the National Emergency Operation Center building, project employee salaries, and civil works on the the Karachi Transformation Plan (KTP), including the reconstruction and revamping of major nullahs in the port city during the financial year 2023-24.
“The audit held that expenditure out of the National Disaster Manag­ement Fund Account without ap­­pr­oved and notified national authority by the federal government stood unauthorised,” said the report.
Similarly, it pointed out overpayment on account of escalation to the National Logistics Cell (NLC) for Orangi Nullah worth Rs2.437 billion. During the audit for the financial year 2023-24, it was ob­­served that an amount of Rs3.267 billion was paid to the NLC on account of escalation for the Orangi Nullah work, leading to the overpayment of Rs2.437 billion.
The audit recommended that the recovery of the overpaid amount of Rs2.437 billion may be made from the NLC and be deposited into the public exchequer. It also recommended the recovery of the overpaid amount of Rs1.839 billion from the NLC.
Similarly, the audit report highlighted unauthorised expenditure out of the NDM Fund on event management services worth Rs23.254 million, overpriced award of contracts to the state-owned entities on account of Gujjar and Orangi nullah works, amounting to Rs5.674 billion, and the “mis-procurement of family tents on pre-qualification basis instead of open competitive bidding” causing a loss of Rs4.829 billion.
According to the audit report, the procurement of the tents without a technical evaluation also caused a further loss of Rs2.58 billion. The audit held that procurement of winterised and shelter tents from the suppliers was a violation of PPRA Rules. The audit recommended that the matter be inquired into and responsibility be fixed over the violation of the PPRA Rules.

If approved, the refund could amount to approximately Rs23 billion, which would be reflected in August bills.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has scheduled a public hearing on Aug 28 to review the petition. The fuel cost adjustment (FCA) refund will also apply to K-Electric consumers, in line with a recent decision by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet.
Nepra has also sought public feedback on whether the Power Division’s request to implement the ECC’s decision before formal cabinet ratification should be accepted. This will determine how the FCA is applied to K-Electric’s consumers and ensure uniformity across the country’s power tariffs.

Power consumption falls 5pc in first month of FY26

As per the ECC’s directive, Nepra is required to implement the same tariff rationalisation for K-Electric consumers as for those of the Discos. Any disparity between K-Electric’s FCA and the official rate will be adjusted through subsidies or cross-subsidies. The uniform FCA, applicable from June 2025, will be reflected in bills issued in August 2025. Nepra has already notified a negative fuel adjustment of 78 paise per unit, payable by consumers in the current billing cycle.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), which filed the petition for the July FCA, reported that power consumption in July was 5pc lower than the same month last year but 2.6pc higher than June 2025. The total electricity delivered to Discos was 13,666 gigawatt hours (GWh) in July, up from 13,310 GWh in June but down from 14,410 GWh in July 2024.
The CPPA revealed that the average fuel cost for electricity generation was Rs8.18 per unit in July, compared to Rs9.04 per unit in the same month last year. The reference fuel cost was initially set at Rs9.88 per unit.
According to the CPPA, 14,123 GWh of electricity was generated in July for Rs109.90 billion (Rs7.78 per unit). Of this, 13,666 GWh was delivered to Discos, with a total expenditure of Rs111.86 billion (Rs8.18 per unit).
Hydropower remained the dominant source of electricity, contributing 40pc of the total generation in July, up from 36pc in the same month last year. Other major contributors included RLNG (17.3pc), local coal (10.64pc), nuclear power (10pc), and imported coal (8pc). Domestic natural gas accounted for 7.74pc of the energy mix.
RLNG-based generation was the most expensive, with a cost of Rs22 per unit, followed by imported coal (Rs14.49 per unit) and local gas (Rs13.38 per unit). Local coal was cheaper, at Rs11.34 per unit, while furnace oil-based generation cost Rs31 per unit, but contributed less than 1pc to the grid.
Nuclear energy cost Rs2.42 per unit in July, up from Rs1.48 per unit last year. Renewable sources, including wind and solar, contributed 4.8pc to the grid, with no fuel cost. Electricity imports from Iran made up about 0.25pc of the total supply, costing Rs24.15 per unit, a slight increase from Rs22.5 per unit in June and Rs25 per unit in July 2024.
The FCA is reviewed monthly, and adj­ustments are passed on to consumers thr­ough their bills for the corresponding mon­­th. The mechanism allows for chan­ges in fuel costs to be automatically adj­us­ted in consumers’ bills, while quarte­r­ly tariff adjustments account for variations in power purchase prices, capacity char­ges, and transmission and distribution losses, all of which are factored into the base tariff by the federal government.

Shortly after the ‘abduction’ was reported, police officials had expressed ignorance of Shahrez’s whereabouts and said they could only look into the matter if an official complaint was lodged.
Earlier, PTI Lawyer Rana Mudassar Umar had told Dawn.com that Aleema’s son, Shahrez Khan, was “kidnapped” from his home in Lahore.
“People dressed in plain clothes entered the house and took Aleema Khan’s son with them,” he claimed. “No case has been registered against Shahrez, nor is he related to politics.”
Mudassar said that no information had been given about Shahrez’s whereabouts and that he would approach the Lahore High Court for his recovery.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram wrote on X: “During an attack, people dressed in plain clothes abducted the son of Aleema Khan, the sister of Mr Imran Khan, from her home.
“We strongly condemn this thuggery and oppression. We demand from the current government and the Chief Justice that her son be immediately recovered and safely returned to her,” he added.
 






A post from the PTI’s official X account said that Aleema’s home, from where Shahrez was taken, was “attacked by individuals in plain clothes”.
“Her son Shahrez has been abducted, family members were harassed and staff were beaten,” the post alleged, calling the incident “fascism” and adding that Shahrez must be recovered immediately.
 






A longer statement from the party’s central information department termed the incident “the height of thuggery and oppression”.
“Shahrez Khan was abducted from his bedroom after breaking the doors of the house, the servants were subjected to brutal violence and Shahrez Khan was tortured in front of his two innocent children after forcibly entering the room,” the party alleged in the statement.
The statement highlighted that Shahrez was stopped from travelling with his wife at Lahore Airport yesterday and “illegally offloaded”. The PTI branded this treatment a “blatant violation of basic human rights”.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur took to X to condemn the incident and demand Sharez’s immediate release.
“The abduction of Aleema Khan’s son Shahrez from her home by men in plain clothes is despicable,” he wrote.
 






Former opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan also condemned the incident.
“Plain clothes unknown people attacked the house, abducted her son Shahrez and beat the household staff,” he wrote on X. “Such cowardly acts prove that PM Imran Khan, his family members and PTI activists cannot be defeated.”
 






PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also highlighted that during the incident, household staff were allegedly attacked and the family was harassed.
 






Born in Lahore, Shahrez completed his schooling at Aitchison College before heading to Oxford University for his MBA. At present, he works as the regional head at Simba Global, a linen supplier based in Australia. He is also a triathlete.</p><small>2025-08-21 19:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22003510e225cac.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932949/all-55-million-us-visa-holders-under-scrutiny-for-deportable-violations-state-dept' target='_blank'><strong>‘All 55 million US visa holders under scrutiny for deportable violations’: State Dept</strong></a><br><p>A US State Department official on Thursday said that continuous vetting applies to “all of the more than 55 million foreigners who currently hold valid United States visas”, including those who have already been admitted to enter the country.
“The State Department revokes visas any time there are indications of a potential ineligibility, which includes things like any indicators of overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organisation,” the official said.
In a written comment to The Associated Press, the official said that if a visa holder presents these indications, their visa will be revoked and they will be subject to deportation if they are already in the US.
US President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a focus of his presidency, boosting resources to secure the border and arresting people in the country illegally.
Earlier this month, the US government announced that it could require bonds of up to $15,000 for some tourist and business visas under a pilot programme to crack down on visitors who overstay their visas.
The programme gives US consular officers the discretion to impose bonds on visitors from countries with high rates of visa overstays, according to a Federal Register notice, which adds that bonds could also be applied to people coming from countries where screening and vetting information is deemed insufficient.
In July, US broadcaster CNN reported that the US would soon require international visitors to pay a “visa integrity fee” of at least $250, a new addition to existing visa application costs, according to a provision in the Trump administration’s domestic policy bill.
The fee is to be paid at the time visas are issued. Although there will be no fee waivers for the payment, the provision states that travellers who comply with the terms of their visa can have the fee reimbursed after their trip.
In June, United States consulates in Karachi and Lahore requested that all applicants for F, M or J nonimmigrant visas make their social media accounts public for vetting.
US consular officers are now required to conduct a “comprehensive and thorough vetting” of all student and exchange visitor applicants to identify those who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles”, said a US diplomatic cable.</p><small>2025-08-21 19:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21142431f5ebd52.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932318/army-chief-did-not-seek-apology-over-may-9-culprits-should-be-held-accountable-dg-ispr-clarifies' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief did not seek apology over May 9, culprits should be held accountable, DG ISPR clarifies</strong></a><br><p>Military spokesperson Lieutenant-General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry clarified on Thursday that Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir did not seek an apology from anyone over the May 9, 2023 riots, saying the perpetrators should be “held accountable”, Geo News reported.
The remarks come days after it was reported that the army chief had sought a ‘sincere apology’ over the 2023 countrywide protests — apparently from the PTI, which the state holds responsible for the May 9 riots.
Suhail Warraich, a senior editor for the Daily Jang newspaper, wrote in a column on August 16 that COAS Munir had spoken to him in person recently in Belgium’s capital of Brussels, where the army chief had stopped over on his return from his visit to the United States.
“On a question about politics, he (the army chief) said that political reconciliation is possible only if there is a sincere apology,” the column read, without specifying who the army chief was referring to or who the question was about.
“Neither did the army chief make any political statement in Brussels, nor did he mention any apology,” Geo News quoted Lt-Gen Chaudhry as saying today.
Lt-Gen Chaudhry, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, was speaking to reporters after an event in Islamabad. State-run Radio Pakistan reported that the DG ISPR clarified that the army chief “did not give any interview”.
The DG ISPR was further reported as saying that the army chief “did not say anything about the PTI”.
Lt-Gen Chaudhry asserted: “May 9 is not only the military’s case but the nation’s case. It is clear that those who carried out the May 9 [riots], their enablers and planners should be held accountable as per the law.”
“There were hundreds of people present at the Brussels event. Those attending the event had their pictures taken with the field marshal,” the DG ISPR noted.
He also termed Pakistan a “country that changes the region’s destinies”, according to the report. “This is the reason why it is frequently attacked. The youth should understand the legacy and history of their ideological state,” he said.
When contacted for comment by Dawn, Warraich said he had “no comment” on the DG ISPR’s statement.
Following the report about the army chief’s Brussels talk, the PTI reiterated its demand for an empowered judicial commission to probe the May 9 riots, the November 26 protest incident, and the 2024 general elections.
 
 

The military considers the PTI the “planners and architects” of the May 9 riots and, in May 2024, demanded an apology from PTI founder Imran Khan, who in turn claimed that the army owes an apology to him since he was “abducted” by the Rangers on May 9.
However, days later, he offered to apologise on the condition that the involvement of PTI supporters in the violent protests was proved through CCTV evidence. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified.
Earlier this month, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce and Industries Rana Ihsaan Afzal said the government would be able to consider a pardon for Imran if he were to issue an apology for his “crimes”.
In June, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan claimed that the ex-premier had been asked several times to apologise for the May 9 violent protests.</p><small>2025-08-21 18:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21225142c0e4453.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932287/china-affirms-commitment-to-working-with-pakistan-on-regional-peace-and-stability' target='_blank'><strong>China affirms commitment to working with Pakistan on regional peace and stability</strong></a><br><p>China affirmed its commitment on Thursday to working with Pakistan on promoting regional peace, development and stability.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with ties ranging across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. The fifth round of Strategic Dialogue in May 2024 was co-chaired by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing. The Chinese foreign minister is currently on a visit to Pakistan.
Wang called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the Prime Minister’s House, according to a statement from the PM Office. The meeting was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and senior cabinet members.
“FM Wang Yi emphasised that China regarded Pakistan as an ironclad friend and all-weather strategic partner. He expressed China’s desire to elevate bilateral relations with Pakistan to new heights of cooperation and collaboration. Commending Pakistan’s resolute commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, he affirmed that China would continue working jointly with Pakistan to promote regional peace, development, and stability,” the statement said.
 






Welcoming the Chinese foreign minister, PM Shehbaz expressed “deep appreciation for the leadership, government and the people of China, for their steadfast support to Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national development.
“Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering support for China on its core issues, he reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further deepen its All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership with China, as envisioned by the leadership and aspired by the peoples of the two countries.”
The statement said the premier lauded President Xi Jinping’s “visionary leadership and his role in strengthening the ironclad friendship” between Pakistan and China.
Recalling his “most cordial and productive meeting” with President Xi during his visit to Beijing last year, PM Shehbaz stated that he was greatly looking forward to his upcoming visit to Tianjin and Beijing to participate in the Shan­ghai Cooperation Organi­sation Council of Heads of States (SCO-CHS) summit meeting, as well as the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People’s War of Resistance and the World Anti-Fascist War.
The prime minister said he looked forward to his meeting with President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang, as well as other senior Chinese leaders, during the forthcoming visit.
“The prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s desire to deepen bilateral cooperation with China in trade, investment, ICT, agriculture, industrialisation, mines and minerals and other key sectors. He also underscored the importance of CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) for Pakistan’s socio-economic development and its vital role in enhancing regional connectivity, while expressing satisfaction at the steady progress of CPEC Phase-II.”
Wang also met President Asif Ali Zardari at the President’s House with FM Dar, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and federal ministers present as well.
According to a statement from the PPP, President Zardari said that Pakistan and China were “iron brothers, time-tested friends and all-weather strategic partners”, adding that friendship with China was the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy, which enjoyed “unanimous public, political, and institutional support” in the country.
“The president thanked China for its consistent support for Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, national development, and its principled and just stance on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
“The president also conveyed his condolences on the loss of precious lives in the recent floods in Beijing and Gansu province of China,” the statement said.
He added that 2026 marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two nations, saying that Pakistan was planning to celebrate the milestone in a “befitting manner”.
“He said both the countries can use this opportunity to pass on the finest traditions of Pakistan China friendship to our younger generations.”
The president also regarded CPEC as having “immense strategic significance” for both Pakistan and China, adding that it was an important component to realise their joint vision of enhanced regional connectivity, economic integration and a peaceful neighborhood.
“Expressing his views, Mr Wang Yi said that friendship between China and Pakistan has lasted for generations and is based on good faith, credibility and strong all-weather strategic partnership.
“He said President Xi Jinping’s vision is that Pakistan and China have a shared future and work should be done to bring the two peoples closer to each other. He said China acknowledges Pakistan’s support to China at key junctures.”
Matters relating to bilateral cooperation and regional security also came under discussion.
 






In a meeting between FM Dar and Wang earlier, the two reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to the accelerated development of CPEC during the 6th Strategic Dialogue.
The two sides reviewed the entire gamut of Pakistan-China relations and discussed important regional and global issues. They also exchanged in-depth views on multiple facets of bilateral cooperation, including CPEC 2.0, trade and economic relations, multilateral cooperation, and people-to-people ties.
Underlining the “All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership between Pakistan and China”, both officials agreed that their friendship was significant for maintaining regional peace and stability and indispensable for their progress and prosperity. They also agreed to continue close coordination and communication,  both bilaterally and at multilateral forums.
 






Addressing a joint press conference after their meeting, FM Dar termed his talks as being “fruitful” as the two leaders discussed various matters of mutual interest.
“We held fruitful and substantive discussions today covering diverse areas of mutual interest,” Dar said.
He continued, “We took stock of progress achieved since the last round of Strategic Dialogue. We also exchanged views on the entire gamut of Pakistan-China relations, including CPEC, trade and investment, science and technology and people-to-people cooperation.”
“The important developments pertaining to our region and the world at large were also reviewed,” he said, adding that both sides enjoyed “complete unanimity of use and consensus on all important matters”.
 


Dar also mentioned the tri-lateral meeting with Afghan FM Amir Khan Muttaqi, stating, “Recently our two countries have worked together to establish tri-lateral partnerships with other countries in the region.
“These mechanisms signify our joint resolve to promote regional peace, stability and prosperity, and to share the dividends of Pak-China friendship with other countries in the region and beyond.”
He further said, “We also discussed preparations for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s forthcoming visit to China. The PM will attend the SCO-CHS summit and also meet top Chinese leadership, including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang.”
He announced that the Pak-China B2B Investment Conference will also be organised during the PM’s visit to China.
Wang described CPEC as the cornerstone of Pakistan and China’s strategic partnership, stating that the current priority was to advance development of the corridor.
He said that during the sixth strategic dialogue, both sides agreed to upgrade CPEC into “a growth corridor, livelihood-enhancing corridor, green corridor and open corridor”.
“We will work hard to deepen our industrial agriculture and mining cooperation to improve the Pakistani people’s welfare, accelerate Pakistan’s capability for self-sustained development and increase Pakistan’s economic resilience,” Wang said.
He added that China was also supporting the development and operation of Gwadar Port and promoting the Karakoram Highway realignment project.
Wang also welcomed third-party participation in the ML-1 (Main Line) railway project.
Additionally, China’s top diplomat said that Beijing would warmly welcome PM Shehbaz for the SCO-CHS summit in Tianjin at the end of this month.
“The two sides will jointly prepare and ensure the success of the series of activities for the 75th anniversary of China-Pakistan diplomatic relations next year,” he said.
Wang also extended his condolences for the lives lost in the recent floods, assuring that Beijing would “immediately provide emergency humanitarian assistance”.
The Chinese foreign minister also commended Pakistan’s role in combatting terrorism, stating that Islamabad was “effectively protecting the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions” in the country.
“China highly commends Pakistan’s tireless efforts in combatting terrorism, as it firmly believes that Pakistan’s counter-terrorism operation will secure victory,” Wang stated.
In response to a question about China’s relations with India, Wang stated that the partnership would “not affect any third party”.
Wang arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier today, to attend the sixth Strategic Dialogue between China and Pakistan, where he was received by FM Dar.
 






Wang had arrived in Islamabad last night, where he was received by Dar.
“Delighted to receive my dear friend, H.E. Wang Yi, Foreign Minister China, in Pakistan this evening,” Dar wrote on social media yesterday.
He added, “I look forward to productive discussions tomorrow at our dialogue, and with the leadership during his calls on President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.”
 






A day earlier, the Sixth Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue was held in Kabul between Dar, Wang and Afghan counterpart Muttaqi on the topics of political, economic and security cooperation.
“The three sides committed to strengthening joint efforts against terrorism,“ the Foreign Office said. “They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as extension of CPEC to Afghanistan.”
 






Last month, Pakistan and China agreed to launch joint training programmes in multiple fields, including construction engineering, artificial intelligence, agriculture and hospitality management, under the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC-II).
PM Shehbaz is expected to travel to Beijing at the end of this month to attend the SCO summit from August 31 to September 1. On the sidelines, he is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
Earlier this week, the government announced that this upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC-II, focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.

Police arrested the 17-year-old in January while he was carrying a military-style rucksack as he tried to gain entry to the building in Greenock, on the west coast of Scotland. Inside the bag, officers found a German-made Glock-type air pistol, ammunition, ball bearings, gas cartridges and aerosol cans, prosecutors said.
The teen had mapped out the building’s interior on his phone.
Investigators also found a list of individuals who had inspired his political beliefs, including Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik.
A search of his home found Hitler’s book Mein Kampf, knives and masks, as well as instructions and ingredients for the manufacturing of explosives.
The High Court in Glasgow sentenced him after he pleaded guilty to two charges of terrorism, Scotland’s Crown Office said.
The teenager — who cannot be named for legal reasons due to his age — will initially serve his sentence in youth custody before being moved to an adult jail. He will be supervised for eight years after his release.</p><small>2025-08-21 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/211750576fe6cc6.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932442/at-least-2-dead-33-injured-following-explosion-blaze-at-warehouse-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>At least 2 dead, 33 injured following explosion, blaze at warehouse in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>At least two people were killed and 33 were injured when a massive explosion took place inside a warehouse in a densely populated area near Karachi’s Taj Medical Complex on Thursday afternoon, according to police and hospital officials.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that 20 injured people were brought to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, including two with critical wounds, while 14 other men were brought to the trauma centre at Civil Hospital Karachi, with two in critical condition.
“The condition of other wounded persons is being evaluated,” she said. Later in the day, she said the police brought the body of a 16-year-old who was found dead at the last level of the warehouse. A statement from Rescue 1122 also confirmed the body’s retrieval.
In a subsequent update, she said: “One critical patient has unfortunately expired.”
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that there was a three-storey building near Taj Medical Complex in Saddar where families resided on upper floors, while the facility was situated in the basement.
“Raw material used for the preparation of firecrackers was stored [in this facility],” Khan said. “During the initial probe, it was suspected that a short circuit triggered a fire in the store and a huge explosion took place because of the presence of highly inflammable material.”
The spokesperson added that the building’s pillars and walls were damaged, while thick concrete blocks had fallen on parked vehicles nearby. Windows in nearby buildings were also smashed.

“Twelve fire tenders from KMC’s Fire Brigade and Rescue-1122 were engaged in firefighting,” he stated. “Due to the presence of explosive material, the fire reignited frequently. Firefighters were facing difficulties as there was dense smoke emanating from the basement.”
Khan said that the fire was 60-70 per cent under control and efforts were underway to control it.
However, Counter-Terrorism Department senior official Raja Umer Khattab told reporters at the scene that the facility contained explosive material, not raw material for fireworks.
“CTD had seized two tons of explosive material in this area in the recent past,” he said, noting that the raw material in fireworks could also be used in bombs.
“As per the relevant laws, up to 50 kilogrammes of firecracker material may be stored in a shop with certain conditions and SOPs (standard operating procedures) in place,” Khattab said.
“Facilities storing firecracker material should be kept away from petrol pumps and residential areas. The deputy commissioner and other authorities concerned may issue licenses to this effect.”
The CTD official said that firecrackers and fireworks were both imported and manufactured in Pakistan. In Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, only license holders could manufacture firecrackers or import them.
Khattab claimed that there was no “industry or factory for manufacturing firecrackers” in Sindh and estimated that more than 50kg of material might have been stored in the basement of the building. He termed the presence of such quantities of explosive material in residential areas “a highly dangerous thing”.
“People do not consider it dangerous as they just call it firecrackers,” lamented the CTD official. “This shop or godown was illegally established in a residential area, which caused substantial damage to human life and property.”
A statement issued by the Karachi Traffic Police said MA Jinnah Road has been closed to traffic due to the fire, with traffic coming from Numaish being diverted towards Society Signal and Ali Raza Imambargah.
The traffic police directed citizens to call the Traffic Police helpline at 1915 for alternate route options “to avoid inconvenience”.
 


Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and ordered authorities to ensure that the blaze is brought under control and that no lives are lost.
Per a statement, the CM ordered the Karachi commissioner to provide immediate medical assistance to the injured and submit a detailed report to his office once the fire is controlled.
“There is no permission to produce materials near cities or populated areas which can cause damage,” CM Murad was quoted as saying.
Meanwhile, the Sindh Home Department issued a statement today claiming that 20 people were injured in the blaze, while Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar directed police reinforcements to head to the scene.
“Police reinforcements should be sent to rescue the injured and transfer them quickly to the nearest hospital,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. “An investigation must be completed and a report submitted soon.”
The home minister also ordered that authorities include statements from the injured and evidence from the scene in their investigation.
“It should be checked immediately whether the firework factory has a licence or not,” Lanjar was quoted as saying.
 






Fires frequently erupt in buildings across Pakistan due to a mix of poor infrastructure, weak enforcement of safety regulations, and widespread negligence. Many structures lack proper fire exits, alarms, and emergency protocols, while faulty wiring and overloaded power systems increase the risk of electrical short circuits.
Earlier this month, a massive blaze at a factory in the Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi that injured eight people and damaged at least three other factories was brought under control after hours of efforts.
In June, a fire erupted in Karachi’s Millennium Mall, ostensibly due to an electrical short circuit, and destroyed several hundred shops, causing substantial financial losses. It was brought under control after hectic efforts lasting several hours.</p><small>2025-08-21 17:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21205835264d1cc.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932716/at-least-one-dead-on-3rd-day-as-ndma-issues-rain-emergency-alert-for-karachi-hyderabad' target='_blank'><strong>At least one dead on 3rd day as NDMA issues rain emergency alert for Karachi, Hyderabad</strong></a><br><p>A man was killed in a rain-related incident on Thursday as parts of Karachi received rain again for a third day with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issuing an emergency alert.
Tuesday’s rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into Wednesday, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery. The rain-related death toll rose to 14. Most of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the past three days, according to hospital officials.
Parts of Karachi intermittently received rain today as well, beginning after 2pm.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the body of a 30-year-old, who died from an electric shock, was brought from Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority to the medico-legal section of Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre today. The death toll is now 15.
An emergency alert from the NDMA at 8:24pm said that heavy rain with thunder was expected in Hyderabad in the next hour or two, which may lead to urban flooding. It said heavy rain was also expected in Karachi within the next 60-90 minutes.
“Torrential rain may cause urban flooding and power outages. This system may affect again from August 24 to 28.”
 






The NDMA urged citizens to avoid travelling on flooded roads, stay away from electric poles, secure electrical appliances and take safety precautions while using them and check drainage systems in areas to prevent water accumulation.
It said residents of low-lying areas should keep an emergency kit ready and follow the instructions of the local administration.
 






Meanwhile, the Karachi Traffic Police issued alerts stating that thunderstorms and heavy rain had begun in the city.
“All passers-by and passengers are requested to stay away from dilapidated buildings, signboards, trees and electricity poles during their journey to avoid any possible accident,” the alert read, adding that citizens could contact the 1915 helpline in case of an emergency.
A separate alert urged people to be careful while travelling and discouraged unnecessary movement.
Rainfall figures from the Met Department at 8pm showed that Gulshan-i-Hadeed received the most rainfall with 18 millimetres (mm), followed by PAF Base Faisal (17mm), Saadi Town (13.3mm), Airport Old Area (11.2mm), PAK Masroor Base (10mm), Keamari (8mm), Orangi Town (7.8mm), Gulshan-i-Maymar (7.5mm), Surjani Town and North Karachi (7mm), Defence Housing Authority Phase VII (6.4mm), Korangi (4.4mm), University Road (4.2mm) and tracefall in Nazimabad.
In an advisory at 5pm, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned of torrential rains with wind/thundershower predicted in the country’s upper and central parts from Aug 23-27 and heavy rains expected in Sindh and eastern/southern Baluchistan from Aug 27-29.
In its daily weather forecast at 5:30pm, the PMD said rain-wind/thundershowers with isolated heavy falls were expected in Mithi, Tharparker, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sajawal, Tando Allayar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Sanghar, Jamshoro and Dadu with possible urban flooding as well.
In a 6:48pm alert on Karachi’s situation, the PMD said more rain with thundershowers and strong winds at most places and heavy rain at places was likely during the next one to three hours, due to which there was a risk of flooding in low-lying areas.
“All concerned agencies are directed to remain on high alert. The public is advised to take precautionary measures and stay informed during bad weather.”
Water drained across metropolis: administration
Karachi city administration issued a handout today outlining the drainage of water and traffic movement at various markets, underpasses and causeways, stating that rainwater has been drained from most city markets, including Jodia Bazaar, Allah Wali Market, and Jamia Cloth Market.
“More than four underpasses have been cleared of water and have been opened for traffic,” the handout read.
According to the handout, all deputy commissioners were working to drain rainwater from underpasses and roads and improve traffic flow, with assistant commissioners present in the field and collaborating with the relevant departments to resolve issues.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi was quoted as saying that all departments were working together with “strong coordination and cooperation”.
The handout stated that drainage work had been completed at Nazimabad Underpass, Tariq Road Underpass, Golimar Underpass and Sohrab Goth Underpass, with all four passages open for traffic.
 


Nipa and the Old Sabzi Mandi Road, from Civic Centre to Mazar-i-Quaid, were also opened for traffic. However, the commissioner has requested citizens to avoid using the road due to traffic congestion caused by a sewage issue.
“Traffic is flowing normally on Sharea Faisal and Jam Sadiq Bridge, where drainage work was previously completed and vehicular traffic was allowed,” the commissioner was quoted as saying.
Additionally, the Korangi Causeway and EBM Causeway, which were closed due to waterlogging, were opened for traffic after complete drainage.
Work was progressing rapidly at Drug Road Underpass and Sohrab Goth Underpass, where pumps have been installed.</p><small>2025-08-21 17:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619834-aleema-khans-son-shahrez-abducted-from-lahore-residence-pti-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>Imran's nephew Shahrez arrested, police confirm after abduction reports</strong></a><br><p>

A statement issued by Punjab Rescue Spokesperson Farouk Ahmed said the accident occurred on the Rahim Yar Khan Road in the Kot Samaba area. “Six people, including four rescue personnel, died in the accident,” he said.
According to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Adnan Shabbir, the incident took place at 3:21pm. He said the two injured people were taken to Sheikh Zayed Medical College Hospital for treatment.
Rahim Yar Khan District Police Officer Irfan Ali Sammon had reached the spot to monitor the relief activities. Deputy Commissioner (DC) Khuram Javed condoled the families of the deceased rescue officials and sought a report from concerned officers.
The Rescue 1122 statement added that the emergency services secretary instructed the district rescue officer to provide an immediate report of the accident.
“Provincial Minister for Emergency Services Khawaja Salman Rafique and Secretary Emergency Services Dr Rizwan Naseer expressed their regret over the loss of six lives in the Rahim Yar Khan accident,” it said.
Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Irfan Ali Kathia expressed condolences over the loss of six lives, saying the accident was “deeply unfortunate”.
He directed the DC to provide the best medical assistance. “The affected families will be assisted as per the policy of the Punjab government,” he said.
He added, “Citizens are requested to take precautionary measures while travelling.”
Road accidents are common across Pakistan due to reckless driving, poor road conditions, and weak traffic enforcement. Over-speeding and unfit vehicles add to the risk, especially on highways.
Last month, nine passengers died and 30 others were injured after a bus fell into a ditch near Balkassar Interchange in Punjab’s Chakwal district.
Six people were killed and seven were injured after a passenger bus caught fire after colliding with a loader rickshaw carrying petrol on the Western Bypass in Quetta on June 24.
In April, a bus driver was burnt alive and seven passengers were injured as their bus caught fire after hitting a mini-truck laden with pesticides at Gojra on the M-4 motorway near Nawan Lahore interchange.</p><small>2025-08-21 15:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619816-nab-repays-affectees-cheated-in-one-of-pakistans-biggest-financial-scams' target='_blank'><strong>NAB repays affectees cheated in one of Pakistan's biggest financial scams</strong></a><br><p>

The two countries were once one nation but split following a bloody civil war, which saw the territory previously referred to as ‘East Pakistan’ seceded to form the independent nation of Bangladesh. In the years since, Dhaka’s leaders, especially the ousted regime of Sheikh Hasina, stayed firmly in the Indian camp. However, after Hasina’s government was toppled last year, there has been a thaw in ties between the two capitals, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
The commerce minister is currently on a visit to Bangladesh. He was received upon his arrival in Dhaka by Bangladesh’s Commerce Adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin.
“Looking forward to engagements with officials and business leaders,” he said.
 






Kamal and Rahman discussed the importance of leveraging their economies and industry to address issues of food security, value addition in the food industry and aligning industrial technology.
Their discussions focused on exchanging expertise across diverse sectors through mutual exchange of delegations and knowledge sharing.
Kamal emphasised Pakistan’s interest in being a part of Bangladesh’s evolving industrial landscape through collaboration, joint ventures and mutual investment. He also stressed the need for a shared vision to create a conducive environment for industrial growth, then turning that relationship into a partnership through bilateral trade.
The minister focused on value-added industries for revenue generation and socio-economic uplift, and appreciated Bangladesh’s growth in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, textiles and information technology.
Rahman highlighted Bangladesh’s progress in industrial development and acknowledged the country’s growing industrial requirements. He also showed keen interest in knowledge sharing and industrial collaboration.
Rahman identified leather, ship-building, sugar, agro-processing and small and medium enterprises as areas of possible collaboration.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is set to visit Dhaka on August 23 to “discuss ways to strengthen coordination with Bangladesh”, according to Bangladesh’s Dhaka Tribune.
The report had said that FM Dar would have a meeting with Bangladesh Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain on Aug 24, in addition to other engagements.
Last month, Paki­stan and Bangladesh agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side.
The deal in principle, marking a breakthrough in bila­teral relations between the two states, was reached during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Bangladesh’s Home Minister Jahangir Alam Chowdhury.</p><small>2025-08-21 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21141023bd18901.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932293/sc-accepts-imrans-bail-pleas-in-eight-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>SC accepts Imran’s bail pleas in eight May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court on Thursday accepted the bail pleas of former prime minister Imran Khan in eight cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
In November 2024, a Lahore anti-terrorism court had denied Imran bail in the cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots, including an attack on the house of the Lahore corps commander. The incarcerated PTI leader’s plea challenging that was also rejected by the Lahore High Court (LHC) on June 24. Subsequently, days later, Imran had challenged that dismissal before the apex court.
A three-member bench led by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and comprising Justices Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Hasan Azhar Rizvi resumed hearing the petitions today.
Barrister Salman Safdar appeared on behalf of the PTI founder, while Punjab Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi represented the state. Both concluded their arguments, following which the CJP announced the bench’s decision.
However, Imran has multiple other cases against him. Imprisoned since August 2023 in a case related to state gifts, the PTI founder is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million graft case and faces pending trials related to the May 9 riots.
The PTI hailed the SC ruling, using the hashtag “Victory For Imran Khan” in its post on X.
 






Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar played down the development and said it was “sad” to see the party celebrating bail when Imran was already convicted. He added that bail was given to murderers, robbers and every criminal, saying that it did not mean acquittal and the case trial was still left.
“The trial process is underway. The May 9 case is the entire nation’s case … so much celebration on getting bail is beyond understanding. Does receiving bail mean burial or acquittal? The answer is no.”
 


The hearing
At the outset of the hearing, the Punjab prosecutor informed the court that he could not appear yesterday due to illness.
CJP Afridi, noting he had two questions from Naqvi, asked, “You must have read the Lahore High Court’s verdict. Can a final observation be made in a case of bail?”
During the hearing on August 12, the chief justice had raised questions over some observations made by the LHC, noting that the SC would not touch upon the legal findings so as not to affect any party’s case.
Asking his second question, the CJP said, “This same court (LHC) gave bail to a suspect on the charge of conspiracy. Will the principle of precedence not apply to this case?”
The prosecutor responded that a court’s observation in a bail case was always of an “interim nature”. “A court observation does not have any impact on the trial,” he contended.
When the hearing resumed after a brief break, the prosecutor requested that the court allow him to assist on the merits of the case.
However, CJP Afridi observed, “We will not allow anyone to argue on the merits of the case. You may only answer the legal questions pertaining to the conspiracy [charge].
“Show me a case where the Supreme Court has denied bail on conspiracy charges.”
He further said, “The Supreme Court has granted bail in two cases of similar allegations. Prove that your case is different from other cases.
CJP Afridi directed Naqvi to inform him about the details of the decision regarding the bail rejection and then read out the decisions in the court.
Following a brief break, Naqvi read out the bail approval decision in the Ejaz Ahmed Chaudhry case.
“You talk about conspiracy in the case. Is there any case in which there was a conspiracy and bail was rejected?” he questioned the prosecutor.
“Bail was granted in all the conspiracy cases that came up in the SC recently. The SC has granted bail in three cases of similar allegations,” he said, urging him to prove how the case was different from other conspiracy cases.
“There will be no evidence in conspiracy cases where bail was granted in the SC,” according to Naqvi. He argued that there was evidence of conspiracy on social media in the current case.
“You will not talk on merit at the stage of bail,” CJP Afridi remarked.
Meanwhile, Barrister Safdar said that he had data of all the bail cases related to conspiracy charges.
“The charges against Ejaz Chaudhry were of presence and conspiracy at the scene,” Justice Siddiqui said while Justice Rizvi questioned if Chaudhry was present on the spot on May 9 to which the prosecutor did not respond clearly.
“You are a prosecutor and you do not know the basic thing,” Justice Rizvi remarked while the chief justice questioned what evidence there was against Imran.
Naqvi said that the statements of three witnesses had been presented as evidence. “PTI founder has a central role in all cases,” he contended.
At this, CJP Afridi said, “If we go on merit, Salman Safdar will also speak.”
He added that the trial would be affected if the SC gave its observations on merit.
“My job was to warn you. The rest is up to you,” he stated and asked for other evidence in the case.
Justice Siddiqui asked, “What was the date of the FIR against the suspect?”
“The suspect is named in three out of 10 cases. The FIR was registered on May 9,” the prosecutor answered.
He said that the SC allowed the trial court to approach the court to conduct three tests of the founder, adding that the police approached the magistrate for voice matching, photogrammetric and polygrammatic tests.
“Despite the court’s permission, the suspect could not conduct the tests,” he added.
“If that is the case, there will be legal consequences,” CJP Afridi remarked.
“Are such tests normally conducted in other cases as well?” Justice Hassan Rizvi asked.
According to Naqvi, the law prohibited bail for the suspect. “There is solid evidence against the suspect,” he said.
“The evidence will be proven in the trial court,” CJP Afridi said.
“After the incident, the suspect was on bail for two months until his arrest,” Justice Rizvi said. He asked whether the two-month period was not enough for the police investigation.
The court approved eight bail applications of PTI founder following Naqvi and Safdar’s arguments.</p><small>2025-08-21 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21174854fbf85b8.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932484/india-says-no-bilateral-sporting-ties-with-pakistan-but-cricket-team-for-asia-cup-wont-be-stopped' target='_blank'><strong>India says no bilateral sporting ties with Pakistan, but cricket team for Asia Cup won’t be stopped</strong></a><br><p>India’s sports ministry on Thursday declared that India and Pakistan would not have any bilateral sporting ties even on neutral venues as per an unprecedented new policy but the cricket team would not be stopped from playing the Asia Cup next month as it is a multi-lateral engagement, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
Political tensions bet­ween the two nations over the years have cast a sha­d­ow over bilateral sporting events, causing major tournaments to hang in the balance. The countries’ teams have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, electing to play on neutral ground via a hybrid model instead.
Last month, the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) instructed all national sports federations to seek prior consultation and approval before participating in any sporting events held in India due to ’“security concerns”.
According to PTI, India’s sports ministry unveiled the new policy with regard to India’s international engagements with emphasis on Pakistan.
It added that a well-placed ministry source said the policy, which bars Indian athletes from travelling to Pakistan and likewise disallows disallows Pakistani sportspersons from going to India for bilaterals, was effective immediately.
Asked if Indian teams would be allowed to travel to Pakistan for any multilateral competitions, the source was quoted as saying: “In that scenario, we will examine the case before deciding anything.”
 


According to the new policy, “India’s approach to sports events involving Pakistan reflects its overall policy in dealing with that country.”
“With regard to international and multilateral events, in India or abroad, we are guided by the practices of international sports bodies and the interest of our own sportspersons,” the policy read.
“It is also relevant to take into account India’s emergence as a credible venue to host international sports events.”
Accordingly, Indian teams and individual players will take part in international events that also have teams or players from Pakistan, the policy stated, adding that Pakistani players and teams will be able to participate in such multilateral events hosted by India.
Earlier this month, it was announced that the Pakistan-India clash for the T20 Asia Cup would be held in Dubai on Sept 14.
In July, a cricket match between India and Pakistan was called off after Indian players, refused to play against Pakistan, citing recent “geopolitical tensions” between the two nations.

Last month, Pak-China Tajeer Etihad Action Committee launched a protest against the suspension of border trade via the Khunjerab Pass, blaming the federal government’s inaction over unresolved tax-related issues, which have inflicted heavy losses on importers and exporters over the year.
One of the organisers, Muhammad Ismail, claimed that the police had launched a crackdown against peaceful protesters, stating: “Police resorted to tear gas and aerial firing to disperse protesters from the venue.”
Speaking to reporters, Hunza Superintendent of Police Nabeel Ahmed said that there was no plan to launch a crackdown on the sit-in.
“Police were deployed only to arrest a suspect who is allegedly extorting traders at the customs and immigration area upon their return from China,” he said. “The sit-in organisers had been asked to hand over the suspect for investigation, but they have not done so yet.”
The protest organisers said that the police and district administration had warned the protesters to disperse from Sost.
Addressing an emergency press conference, Ismail, Ebadullah, Gul Sher and other committee members claimed that the police launched “an attack on protesters at midnight to sabotage the peaceful protest for the rights of GB people”.
The protest organisers said they had been engaged with various committees, including one constituted by the prime minister for negotiations, but claimed that “the government resorted to using force”.
The organisers highlighted that the GB traders were protesting for one month for their genuine demands, including customs clearance of 280 consignments which have been stranded at the Sost Dry Port for 10 months.
Opposition Leader in the GB Assembly, Kazim Mesum, issued a statement condemning the use of force, warning the government that suppressing peaceful demonstrations could ignite a larger movement across GB.
Separately, the Sost Bazaar Association held a shutter-down strike and protest rally against the shelling and firing by police and FC.
During a press conference, the association’s President, Ulfat Karim, said, “Sales tax and income tax are not applicable as GB was not constitutionally part of Pakistan.”
The association condemned the authorities’ action against the traders and denounced the indiscriminate shelling of shops, petrol pumps, hotels, and other properties, announcing its full support for the ongoing sit-in.
On July 28, traders in GB blocked Sost dry port, halting all trade and travel between Pakistan and China. The protest on the Kara­k­oram High­w­­ay (KKH) has paralysed the regional economy and stranded travellers, including Chinese nationals who also staged a protest demanding passage into China through the Khunjerab pass.
In June, thousands of passengers and tourists remained stranded at KKH for many hours after traders had blocked the road. The protesters vowed that the road connecting Pakistan with China would remain closed to traffic till the acceptance of their demands.</p><small>2025-08-21 10:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21154212291465c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932330/lahore-man-accused-of-sextortion-of-minor-sent-on-5-day-physical-remand' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore man accused of ‘sextortion’ of minor sent on 5-day physical remand</strong></a><br><p>A Lahore man accused of “sextortion” of a minor via social media platform Snapchat was handed over to police for a five-day physical remand, the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency (NCCIA) said on Thursday.
As per the court order given by a district and sessions court in Lahore, it was notified that the accused should be handed over to the police for a five-day investigation.
According to NCCIA’s application for the remand, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the accused was arrested after NCCIA received a tip-off from an international organisation. He was booked for sharing pornographic material via the social media application Snapchat and engaging in “sextortion” of a minor.
Upon arrest, NCCIA confiscated the phone of the accused and found pornographic material on the phone, in its “screenshot” and “screen-recording” folders.
 
 

During the initial interrogation conducted by the NCCIA, the accused confessed to the crimes.
Subsequently, a first information report (FIR) was registered against the accused under Section 22 (unauthorised use of identity information) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca).
The court ordered the accused to be presented on 26 August.
The investigation officer, NCCIA sub-inspector Shafqat Ehsan, had requested a 14-day physical remand, which was denied.
According to a report by a child rights organisation, Sahil, as many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024.  A gender-divide analysis indicated that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.
Of the 200 cases of child sexual abuse reported, 93 of the child victims were male and 108 were female.
Earlier this week, the interior ministry informed the Senate that of the 567 cases of sexual abuse registered in Islamabad between 2021 and June 2025, 200 of them involved children.

Earlier this month, mobile data services in the province were announced to be suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”. Balochistan’s Consumer Civil Society chairman, Khair Muhammad Shaheen, had filed a constitutional petition against the Pakistan Tele­communication Authority and others regarding the suspension of mobile phone internet services.
The petition argued that the mobile phone services were a basic mode of communication for businessmen, students, educational institutions and others. It added that the suspension constituted a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 9 (security of person), 15 (freedom of movement etc), 18 (freedom of trade, business and profession), 19-A (right to information) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution.
A two-member BHC bench, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Sardar Ahmed Halimi, conducted the first hearing on the petition on August 13, ordering the At­­torney General for Pakis­tan (AGP) Mansoor Awan and Balochistan Advocate General Adnan Basharat to file their replies on the shutdown of internet services in the province.
The same bench heard the case today, ruling that mobile internet services must be restored in Quetta within two hours.
Following the court’s order, mobile internet service has been restored in Quetta and some areas of Pishin and Chaman. Services will be fully restored in Dalbandin, Pishin, Chaman and Taftan within the next two hours, according to PTA officials.
“Orders related to mobile internet restoration are being implemented,” said PTA Director Jamil Ahmed, who appeared in the court when the hearing resumed after a break.
He added that internet services had been restored in some districts, but added that it “takes some time to restore the system”.
The hearing was adjourned until August 25, with the Chief Justice Barrech adding that if mobile internet was not restored by that date, the PTA secretary would be found in contempt of court.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks.
In November of last year, the PTA had announced the government’s decision to suspend internet and mobile services with immediate effect in many districts of Balochistan to ensure public safety, in the wake of terrorist attacks in the province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-08-21 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619756-field-marshal-munir-made-no-remarks-on-pti-in-brussels-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir made no remarks on PTI in Brussels: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

Judge Caprio, host of ABC series ‘Caught in Providence’ was known for his kindness, even while serving justice. According to CNN, Caprio billed his courtroom as a place “where people and cases are met with kindness and compassion“.
“Judge Frank Caprio passed away peacefully at the age of 88 after a long and courageous battle with pancreatic cancer,” said a post on the social media-famous judge’s Facebook account.
 
 

“Beloved for his compassion, humility, and unwavering belief in the goodness of people, Judge Caprio touched the lives of millions through his work in the courtroom and beyond,” the post recalled.
“His warmth, humour and kindness left an indelible mark on all who knew him […] In his honour, may we each strive to bring a little more compassion into the world — just as he did every day.”
Videos of Caprio “treating defendants with empathy and respect gained more than a billion views on social media and earned him the title of ‘the nicest judge in the world’”, Time magazine noted.
In clips posted on YouTube, Caprio is “often seen empathising with those in his courtroom”, CNN noted. “Caprio also used his fame to address issues like unequal access to the judicial system.”
In 2019, the internet sensation won the hearts of many when his interaction with a Pakistani student went viral. Caprio let off Ahmad Salman, an immigrant student, for three parking tickets.
A month later, the judge invited Salman to his family’s Sunday dinner, according to a snippet shared by the Caught in Providence show in 2022.
In a video statement, Judge Caprio’s son detailed that his father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer two years ago.
“It was the love and support that he received from all of you that lifted his spirits and boosted his soul to find the strength to fight on and outlive his diagnosis by a year and a half.
Caprio served as chief judge of the municipal court of Providence, Rhode Island, from 1985 to 2023, according to Time. He is survived by his wife Joyce Caprio, five children, seven grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.</p><small>2025-08-21 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619731-karachi-braces-for-more-rainfall-as-monsoon-system-lingers' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi braces for more rainfall as monsoon system lingers</strong></a><br><p>
