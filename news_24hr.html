It was a statement win for Gladiators, who came into the match against the defending champions as the league stage’s table toppers and the Saud Shakeel-led side hardly felt the heat of the big occasion.
After having posted 209-5, thanks to what proved to be a match-winning partnership between Chandimal and Faheem, Gladiators never really let United get away with the game as Usman took three wickets.
Chasing the big total, United — who will now face the winners of the first Eliminator between Karachi Kings and Lahore Qalandars — scampered on their way to 45-1 in the powerplay, with opener Alex Hales playing Faheem’s pace onto his stumps early in the innings.
The incoming Rassie van der Dussen responded to the slow start when he lifted two towering sixes over Faheem’s head in the seventh over. The South African went after pacer Mohammad Wasim Jr for two cracking boundaries in the ninth, but was undone by a deadly yorker.
 
 

Gladiators were 94-2 by the halfway stage after Salman Ali Agha and Sahibzada Farhan hit a four and a six respectively in the 10th over. Right after bringing up his half century in 33 balls, Farhan holed Usman Tariq’s spin out to Khawaja Nafay at square-leg.
As pressure increased over United, captain Shadab, who had slog-swept Usman for a six over midwicket, was stunned by a one-handed catch by his counterpart Saud, who jumped into the air to intercept the ball after Shadab had cut spinner Abrar Ahmed.
Faheem then returned to bamboozle the incoming James Neesham with an outswinger that chipped the bail off the stump before the Salman counterattacked with two boundaries as United reeled at 143-5.
But they got deeper in trouble when Mohammad Amir bounced out Imad Wasim.
A ramp shot by Salman off Mohammad Wasim suggested the batter could take the match till the end, but Usman’s return in the 18th saw him perish, with Naseem Shah following him back to the pavilion on the very next ball, virtually ending the proceedings before Amir and Wasim took the last two wickets.
Earlier, Chandimal and Faheem led Gladiators’ fightback after a difficult start. Getting together when Gladiators were reeling at 111-5 by the 12th over, the duo went on to play together until the penultimate ball of the innings, combining for 95 off 40 balls with Chandimal staying unbeaten at 49 off 29 (four fours and three sixes) while Faheem added 45 off 23 (four fours and three sixes).
Gladiators were effective with the bat in the powerplay, getting 68 off it but also losing three wickets; those of Saud and in-form batters Rilee Rossouw and Hasan Nawaz.
The fall of three wickets early into the innings did seem to play on the minds of Allen and Avishka Fernando; the Quetta batters present on the crease, with only 28 runs coming across the next four overs, also thanks to some tight bowling by spinner Imad and Neesham.
With Gladiators at 98-3 at the halfway stage, Fernando took on Imad in the 11th over, driving down the ground for four before slogging past midwicket for six, only to see Allen (41 off 27, seven fours) get caught in the same area two balls later.
The introduction of Shadab’s leg-spin in the next over brought about Fernando’s ouster as well, the right-hander getting trapped in front after adding 32 off 21 (two fours and a six).
Shadab’s return in the 14th over saw Dinesh Chandimal punishing the bowler for pitching it in the right-hander’s slot by two hits for sixes straight down the ground.
Chandimal cut Imad with prowess for a boundary and played a similar shot off Neesham for four more to bring up 150 for Gladiators by the 16th over.
As Quetta amped things up, Faheem bludgeoned Salman for a four before smashing his yorker for a straight six before Chandimal dispatched two fours and a six off Neesham.
Faheem took on Naseem in the next over, pulling for six and placing the ball past cover and backward point for fours. The left-hander dragged a slower one over the leg-side for another six before holing one out to Shadab in the final over, but by then Gladiators had enough on the board to eventually take the match.

The strong quake struck 82 kilometres (51 miles) northeast of Crete’s capital Heraklion at 3:19am GMT (8:19am PKT) at a depth of 68 kilometres (42 miles), the USGS said.
AFP journalists said it was felt as far away as Athens and Egypt.
Greek state television ERT said many residents in the Cretan regions of Rethymno and Lasithi were woken by the quake just after 6:00am (11am PKT) and quickly exited their homes as a precaution.
Local media showed supermarket items strewn on floors, and reported minor rockslides on rural roads.
The tremor “occurred at a great depth and there is no particular reason for residents to worry,” Athanassios Ganas, general director of Research at the Geodynamics Institute of the National Observatory of Athens, told ERT.
State news agency ANA said fire department units in Crete had been placed on general alert, with vehicles patrolling to assess the situation.
The mayor of Heraklion, Alexis Kalokerinos, told ERT that there were no particular problems in the city and that closing schools would not be necessary.
The quake struck just over a week after a 6.1-magnitude tremor hit near the island of Kasos east of Crete, and was felt in the outlying area.
The region, popular with tourists, has been hit with multiple tremors in recent months, prompting schools in Santorini and neighbouring islands to temporarily close.
Thousands of earthquakes, mainly of low magnitude, have been recorded since January between the islands of Santorini, Amorgos, Ios and Anafi in the Cyclades group southeast of the Greek mainland.
They have not caused casualties or significant damage.
Located where the African and Anatolian tectonic plates converge, the Aegean Sea is often hit by quakes.
But the region had not experienced a phenomenon of such magnitude since records began in 1964, experts say.</p><small>2025-05-22 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2212042574b2d45.jpg?r=120429' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912529/naila-kiani-eyes-12th-eight-thousander' target='_blank'><strong>Naila Kiani eyes 12th eight-thousander</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Renowned mountaineer Naila Kiani, only Pakistani woman climber to have summited 11 of the world’s 14 eight-thousander peaks, on Wednesday began her summit push to ascend Kanchenjunga (8,586 metres), the world’s third-highest mountain located in Nepal.
She arrived at Kanchenjunga Base Camp on May 5, completed her acclimatisation rotation, and had been waiting for a suitable weather window. According to a statement from her team, Ms Kiani left Camp 2 on Wednesday and was headed toward Camp 3, targeting to reach the summit by Thursday or Friday, depending on conditions.
“Climbing Kanchenjunga has been an incredibly difficult expedition and a harsh reminder of how hard it is to climb mountains over 8,000m,” Ms Kiani said in a message to her team before resuming her ascent. “I’m now at Camp 2 and need every ounce of physical strength and mental determination to make it through. I’m praying … it’s been very tough so far.”
Ms Kiani is part of the Imagine Nepal expedition. Her team said weather at the peak remains uncertain.

Seeks to become first Pakistani woman to summit all 14 highest peaks

If conditions allow, her final summit push was to start on Wednesday or Thursday from Camp 3.
“This expedition marks a significant step in her ambitious quest to climb all 14 of the world’s 8,000-metre peaks,” the statement read. Only 65 climbers globally, including just 14 women have conquered all 14 eight-thousanders peaks
Her previous summits incl­ude Everest, K2, Broad Peak, Nanga Parbat, Gasherbrum I and II, Annapurna, Lhotse, Manaslu, Makalu and Cho Oyu. The ascent of Kanchen­junga would bring her closer to completing the elite 14-peak challenge.
“Each mountain presents its own set of challenges, but the drive to represent Pakistan on these global heights keeps me going,” Ms Kiani said.
“I’m very grateful that the Bard Foundation has made this attempt possible and for their support throughout my mountaineering journey.”
“Kanchenjunga is known for its treacherous terrains and unpredictable weather,” she added.
“But with determination and the support of my family, team and followers, I’m hopeful for a successful summit.”
Ms Kiani was awarded the Sitara-i-Imtiaz last year for her mountaineering achievements.
She is also a Dubai-based banker, amateur boxer and mother of two.
She gained initial fame in 2018 after wedding photos at K2 Base Camp went viral.
In October 2023, Ms Kiani and fellow climber Sirbaz Khan survived an avalanche on Tibet’s Shishapangma peak, while four other climbers were killed or went missing.

Ms Rehman, chair of the Senate’s Standing Com­mittee on Climate Change and Environmental Coor­dination, issued the warning at a high-level session led by NDMA Chairman Lt-Gen Inam Haider Malik.
Calling the Indus River the country’s lifeline, she said over 90 per cent of Pakistan’s agriculture depends on it. “The Indus is already under climate stress, and now we are facing upstream aggression,” Senator Rehman said. “Over 240 million Pakistanis are effectively being held hostage by these escalating pressures.”

India’s suspension of the IWT termed ‘climate weaponisation’

She called for a coordinated national response involving the NDMA, the Ministry of Climate Change, and the Ministry of Water Resources. Ms Rehman characterised India’s suspension of the IWT as “not only a breach of international law, but a form of water and climate weaponisation.”
The consequences, she noted, could be devastating, especially for Sindh, where reduced water flow may lead to soil salinisation and food insecurity. “This isn’t a political issue alone. It’s an existential one,” she stressed, calling for immediate technical assessments and renewed meetings of the Indus Water Commission, which hasn’t convened in over two years.
The NDMA briefing revealed forecasts for heightened risks of early and volatile monsoon patterns, cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), and wind storms in the coming months. The NDMA chairman said climate disasters already cost Pakistan an estimated $4 million annually.
The agency reported it now monitors real-time climate signals using over 270 weather satellites and integrates data from seismic, hydro-meteorological, and oceanic systems. A new mobile application has also been launched to provide multilingual alerts to the public.
Mr Malik emphasised the importance of integrating multiple datasets, including infrastructure vulnerability and population density, for improved forecasting and more targeted warnings.

He made these remarks during a meeting with his lawyers at the Adiala Jail. The conversation has been shared from the incarcerated former prime minister’s ‘X’ account.
Mr Khan said that the nation needed to remain vigilant as India Prime Minister Narendra Modi can decide to attack on Pakistan any time to satisfy his domestic audience.  He said that the nation should remain united and the voice of masses should be heard.
 






Mr Khan said he has always said that he was willing to speak to those who have power, in the best interest of the sake of the country. However, he said that the talks should be for restoration of the constitution, rule of law, judicial independence. The former prime minister said that he does not want any deal or facilities for himself.

He also said that the negotiations with the government would be useless as it does not have any power or authority.
Mr Khan further said that it was unfortunate that the people who came on the streets on May 9 were being punished to change their narrative. He said that Dr Yasmeen Rashid and Andleeb Abbas were in the same vehicle and held joint presser but later one who changed the stance was freed and other was in jail. He claimed that Shah Mehmood Qureshi was being pressurised to record statement against him [Imran Khan] in the cipher case but now being punished as he refused to do so.
The former prime minister said that his sisters informed him about the first interview of his sons Qasim and Suleman which was appreciated by masses.
PTI protest outside IHC
Meanwhile, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser has claimed that all cases against the PTI founder and its workers were baseless, saying the judiciary must ensure decisions are made on merit.
Addressing a  PTI parliamentarians’ protest outside the Islamabad High Court, Mr  Qaiser stated that they had gathered to demand justice for their leader and party workers.
He remarked that even before the court verdicts were announced, the outcomes seemed to be known to the public, raising questions about transparency. He alleged that the judiciary was planning to distribute PTI’s reserved seats among treasury benches, which, he asserted, was a blatant violation of the Constitution.
He urged the Chief Justice of Pakistan and chiefs of all high courts to uphold the dignity and independence of the judicial system.
He further stated that the 26th Constitutional Amendment has undermined the justice system in Pakistan and vowed that PTI would challenge it at every forum.

US President Donald Trump quickly condemned the attack, saying, “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on anti-Semitism, must end, now!”
“Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA,” he added on social media.
 






Gunfire broke out on the sidewalk outside the Capital Jewish Museum in the centre of Washington as the venue held a social event for young professionals and diplomatic staff.
The victims were a young couple who planned to get married, the Israeli ambassador said.
A video clip circulating on social media showed a young bearded man in a jacket and white shirt shouting “free, free Palestine” as he was led away by police.
Police confirmed the suspected shooter walked into the museum after the shooting and had been detained.
“We believe the shooting was committed by a single suspect who is now in custody,” Washington Police Chief Pamela Smith told reporters.
“Prior to the shooting, the suspect was observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum. He approached a group of four people, produced a handgun and opened fire.
“After the shooting, the suspect then entered the museum and was detained by event security.”
She said the handcuffed suspect identified where he had discarded the weapon and chanted “Free, free Palestine”. Police identified him as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago.

“I am devastated by the scenes in Washington,” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement.
“This is a despicable act of hatred, of anti-Semitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy.
“America and Israel will stand united in defence of our people and our shared values. Terror and hate will not break us.”
‘Unspeakable act of violence’
Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said, “Harming diplomats and the Jewish community is crossing a red line.
“Israel will continue to act resolutely to protect its citizens and representatives — everywhere in the world.”
The targeted event appeared to be a reception hosted by the American Jewish Committee (AJC) for Jewish young professionals and the Washington diplomatic community.
The evening was “dedicated to fostering unity and celebrating Jewish heritage,” with an invitation to the event saying the location would be “shared upon registration”.
“American Jewish Committee (AJC) can confirm that we hosted an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC this evening,” AJC CEO Ted Deutch said in a statement.
“We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue… Our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”
 
 

The museum is in downtown Washington, close to the US Capitol and just 1.6 kilometres from the White House.
Police Chief Smith said officers responded to multiple calls of a shooting near the museum at around 9pm on Wednesday evening (6am Thursday).
First responders found a man and a woman unconscious and not breathing.
Despite life-saving efforts, both were pronounced dead.
Engagement
Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter told reporters the young staffers were a couple “about to be engaged”.
“The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,” Leiter said.
He added that he spoke to Trump by telephone, with the president assuring that the United States will “do everything it can possibly do to fight and end anti-Semitism.”

“We’ll stand together tall and firm, and we will confront this moral depravity without fear and with determination,” Leiter said.
Emergency vehicles remained at the scene in the morning after police taped off the area.
“We’re going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send the clear message that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters.
“The horrific incident is going to frighten a lot of people in our city, and in our country. I want to be clear that we will not tolerate this violence or hate.”</p><small>2025-05-22 06:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22110833acdeed8.jpg?r=110837' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912537/sc-constitutional-bench-member-decries-embarrassing-plea-targeting-ihc-judges' target='_blank'><strong>SC Constitutional Bench member decries ‘embarrassing’ plea targeting IHC judges</strong></a><br><p>• Regrets how CJP could mark cases to a judge mentioned in petition
• Observes it is embarrassing for judges to bracket them for deciding in favour of a political party
ISLAMABAD: Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan on Wednesday took exception to uncharitable pleadings on behalf of PTI chairman Imran Khan in which disparaging remarks were made against certain judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
“This is embarrassing even for judges to bracket them for deciding in favour of a political party,” Justice Hassan regretted, adding how the Chief Justice of Pakistan could mark cases to the judge mentioned in the petition after reading such remarks in the plea.
Justice Hassan was a member of the five-judge Constitutional Bench that had taken up a joint petition filed by five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kaya­­ni, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sat­tar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — pleading that three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194, read in conjunction with Schedule III of the Constitution.
In the petition, PTI founder Imran Khan had contended that the five IHC judges were punished because they decided false cases on merit registered and filed against the petitioner without fear or favour.
“Moreover, former IHC chief justice Aamir Farooq, who now was rewarded by appointing him as judge of the Supreme Court, was repeatedly asked to recuse himself from petitioner’s cases, but he refused to do so.”
“And when IHC judges made a representation to former IHC CJ, the same were dismissed forthwith, issuing a fresh seniority list in which the senior puisine judge of IHC was demoted from his position while a freshly transferred judge was put in the senior most position,” the petition had contended.
The petition went on to state that a few days later former IHC CJ was appointed to the apex court and hence rewarded for damaging petitioner’s case, life and liberty, whereas the judges who stood up against the illegal and undue external pressures were punished by having their seniority disturbed. The entire debacle clearly showed lack of good faith, which is a dagger in the heart of Pakistan’s stability, the petition had regretted.
While pointing towards Advocate Idrees Asharaf, Justice Hassan today observed that the counsel had filed two petitions on behalf of Advocate Raja Muqsid and PTI founder Imran Khan and wondered whether any political party or a politician could ever claim such a stance in his petition.
The counsel, however, explained that the petition, to which Justice Hassan was referring to, in fact was originally filed by PTI leader Shoaib Shaheen. The counsel made it clear that the points he highlighted in the petition he filed was based on legal plain stating that his aim in fact was for the enforcement of law and the Constitution.
However, Justice Hassan regretted that such a petition should be dismissed by imposing a heavy cost as a punishment, also stating that the system should be allowed to work.
Earlier, senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi on behalf of former presidents of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association contended that the central issue in the present dispute revolves around the seniority of IHC judges and if CB settles the matter then other issues regarding the transfer of judges to IHC as well as taking of oath before entering IHC will become merely an academic exercise.
The counsel urged CB to interpret Article 200 of the Constitution under which the judges were transferred to IHC in a way that the matter should not become a case of judges versus judges rather it should enhance the concept of comity among judges and reduces the conflict.
The counsel was of the view the seniority of the judges who were transferred should start from the bottom of the seniority list of IHC though they could retain seniority in their parent high court from where they have been transferred.
The record showed that the seniority issue was kept hidden from the chief justices at the time of seeking consultation with them, adding the seniority conflict among the judges was created by the executive when they have no power to disturb the seniority. This is where the malice comes, the counsel argued. The case will now be taken up again on Friday.

Prof Dr Tipu Sultan, who heads the 250-bed hospital in Kohi Goth, told Dawn that around three weeks ago, a woman from a nearby village had given birth at the health facility.
She suffered complications and was referred to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, where she remained under treatment for a week and died on Tuesday.
He said on Wednesday scores of people from nearby villages attacked the hospital, beat the staff with sticks and stones, damaged ambulances parked there and the health facility.
Dr Sultan said he and his colleagues had established the hospital several years ago, where quality treatment was being provided free of cost.
He said that the incident extremely saddened him. He said it was the second hospital in the world where treatment of fistula was being provided to women free of cost.
Dr Sultan, who was a former principal of the Dow Medical College, lamented that if such ‘hooliganism’ prevailed, who would provide services to the community.

“Our collective humanity calls for global and immediate action. I call on every world leader to put maximum pressure on the Israeli government to end this genocide and protect civilians,” she added.
She urged the international community to join her in supporting humanitarian organisations such as Anera, Inara, Kinder USA, Palestine Children’s Relief Fund, and the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, saying their “heroic workers are putting everything on the line to save lives”.

The treaty, which was signed by Presidents Masoud Pezeshkian and Vladimir Putin in January, provides for joint efforts to counter common security threats but stops short of a mutual defence agreement.
While the deal was alre­ady ratified by Russia’s State Duma, it passed the Iranian parliament with 191 votes in favour, eight against and three abstentions among the 212 members present, Iran’s official IRNA news agency reported.
The ratification comes after Iran held four rounds of talks with the US in search of a new deal to ally Western concerns about its nuclear programme.
Mediator Oman ann­ounced the fifth round of talks between Iran and the US is set to take place in Rome on May 23. “The 5th round of Iran-US talks will take place in Rome this Friday 23rd May,” Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said.

The proposal — which the US president ordered a week after his inauguration in January — would see Washington deploy missile interceptors in space to protect against ballistic and hypersonic threats.
Unveiling new details on initial funding for the project, Trump called it “important for the success and even survival of our country”.
In an interaction with reporters on Wednesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, “This is a sovereign matter for the United States. If the United States believes that there is a missile threat, then of course it will develop a missile defence system.”

Beijing denounces plan as threat to international security, accuses US of fuelling arms race

“That is what all countries do,” he added.
“Of course, in the foreseeable future, the course of events will require the resumption of contacts to restore strategic stability,” he added, referring to broader nuclear talks.
Peskov’s comments came two days after a call between US President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that the US leader said “went very well”.
Trump has sought to warm ties with the Kremlin, reaching out to Putin directly in a bid to broker an end to the three-year Ukraine conflict.
Russia had previously denounced the Golden Dome plan, warning it risked turning space into a “battlefield”.
In a joint statement with China earlier this month, both countries denounced the idea as “deeply destabilising”.
The plan’s Golden Dome name stems from Israel’s Iron Dome air defence system which has intercepted thousands of short-range rockets and other projectiles since it went into operation in 2011.
Washington faces various missile threats from adversaries, but they differ significantly from the short-range weapons that Israel’s Iron Dome is designed to counter.
China, which has deepened cooperation with Moscow in recent years, on Wednesday denounced Trump’s plans.
Beijing described Golden Dome as a ‘threat to international security’ and accusing the United States of fueling an arms race.

The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health, Islamabad, confirmed the cases of wild poliovirus in Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts.
According to an official, the child belonging to Lakki Marwat is a 26-month-old girl.
 
 

In Bannu, the victim is a 40-month-old boy from the Wazir tribe and resident of SD Wazir Tehsil, union council Sain Tanga.
“While high-quality polio vaccination campaigns continue nationwide, certain areas — particularly in southern KP — continue to face challenges, such as restricted access and difficulties in conducting house-to-house vaccination campaigns.
“These access and operational hurdles leave thousands of children, particularly in southern KP, at risk of exposure to poliovirus as a result of missed opportunities for vaccination,” the official said.
“Due to ongoing access constraints and community concerns, children in UC Bakhmal Ahmad Zai (Lakki Marwat) missed out on vaccination opportunities during the February and April immunisation campaigns, resulting in immunity gaps,” he added.

• CM says act formulated in consultation with all stakeholders
GILGIT: The much-awaited Gilgit-Baltistan Land Reforms Act, 2025 has finally sailed through the Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly, with a majority vote on Wednesday.
Opposition members in the assembly opposed the act, describing it as an attempt to deprive local people of their common lands, mountains, pastures and natural resources.
GB Land Reforms Act, 2025 was moved by Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan in the assembly session, chaired by Speaker Nazir Ahmed, on Monday.
After a two-day-long debate on various clauses of the act by the opposition members, GB Assembly members finally passed it with a majority vote as opposition members abstained from voting.
Speaking on the occasion, CM Khan said the GB government has formulated GB Land Reforms Act 2025 for the first time, in consultation with public representatives, lawyers, experts, civil society members, stakeholders to protect land ownership of local people. He added that under  “Khalisa Sarkar”, the barren lands in the region were not protected.
The chief minister said the assembly abolished the black law and introduced an act that would protect the ownership of local people of their lands, pastures, mountains and other natural resources. He said the act’s draft was also formulated during the PML-N and PTI terms, but the proposed bills couldn’t be tabled in the assembly.
He called it a success of the present GB government to pass the law after taking all the stakeholders into confidence.
PPP’s GB chapter president and member of GB Assembly Amjad Hussain, who introduced the bill, said it was a historic day as locals had been given ownership rights.
He said that under the “Khalisa Sarkar 1979” law, lands of GB were declared as state land. “After the GB Land Reforms Act 2025, the region’s people have been declared owners of the land,” he said.
According to the bill, “common land” refers to all lands, including forests, rivers, lakes, streams, rivers, glaciers, lakes, and such land will have ownership of local people.
The land cannot be allocated as property to any one individual or family and is indispensable for the collective use of the local community or environmental protection.

• Italy summons Israeli envoy
• Germany condemns shooting
• Pope asks Israel to allow aid in Gaza
• Turkiye seeks probe
JERUSALEM: The Israeli military said that it fired shots near an international diplomatic delegation which it claimed “deviated” from an approved route in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday.
Diplomatic sources said European Union diplomats were part of the delegation.
The Israeli military ass­e­rted “the delegation deviated from the app­roved route and entered an area where they were not authorised to be” and that soldiers fired “warning shots to distance them away”. No injuries or damage were reported, the military said.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said she had heard about the incident which happened on a visit by international diplomats organised by the Palestinian Authority.
“We definitely call on Israel to investigate this incident and also held these accountable who are responsible for this and any threats on diplomats’ lives,” she said.
The Spanish Foreign Ministry said a Spaniard was among the group of diplomats, who was unhurt.
“We are in contact with other affected countries to jointly coordinate a response to what happened, which we strongly condemn,” it said in a statement.
The Palestinian Auth­ority’s Foreign Ministry said the delegation was undertaking an official mission to observe and assess the humanitarian situation and document the ongoing violations perpetrated by Israel.
Footage on Israeli television showed individuals running to vehicles with diplomatic licence plates as shots were heard in the distance.
The Israeli military has killed dozens of Pales­tinians and destroyed many homes in the occupied West Bank since it launched an operation in January in the city of Jenin to root out Palestinian fighters. A video released by the Palestinian foreign ministry showed two men in Israeli army uniform pointing guns at a group of people from behind metal gates.
A European diplomat present during the visit said he heard repeated shots coming from inside Jenin refugee camp.
Italy summons envoy
Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani summoned the Israeli ambassador on Wednesday, after shots were fired during international diplomats’ visit to the West Bank city of Jenin.
Tajani said on X he had instructed his ministry to “summon the Israeli Ambassador to Rome to obtain official clarifications on what happened in Jenin”.
 






Germany condemns Israeli shooting
Germany “strongly condemned” on Wednes­day what Israel claimed were “warning shots” fired during a visit by foreign diplomats, including one from Germany, to the occupied West Bank.
“The Israeli government must promptly inv­es­tigate the circumsta­nces,” a foreign ministry spokeswoman said, adding that Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul would raise the “unprovoked shooting” with his Israeli counterpart.
“The independent ob­ser­­ver role of diplomats on the ground is indispensable and in no way poses a threat to Israeli security interests,” the spokeswoman added.
Turkiye demands inquiry
Turkiye demanded an immediate investigation on Wednesday over the shots fired during a visit by foreign diplomats to the occupied West Bank.
This attack must be investigated without delay and the perpetrators must be held accountable,“ the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Pope asks Israel to allow aid in Gaza
Pope Leo XIV on Wednesday appealed for Israel to allow humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, calling the situation in the Palestinian enclave “yet more worrying and saddening”.
“I renew my fervent appeal to allow for the entry of fair humanitarian help and to bring to an end the hostilities, the devastating price of which is paid by children, the elderly and the sick,” the new pope said during his first weekly general audience in St. Peter’s Square.

His spirit though has been reincarnated in numerous elected dictators, most recently in B. Netanyahu and N. Modi. No two modern leaders have shown such a flagrant disregard for societal norms, religious precepts, and legal undertakings. They deserve a Nobel Prize — for ethnic cleansing.
This analysis of Hitler fits both: “Hitler’s ‘trivial and bombastic rhetoric’ was designed to distract from his calculated and calibrated manipulation of the moment [.] What made Hitler so dangerous was his bluster, behind which lay his intuition, lightning-fast ability to assess a situation.”
In July 1932, before the general election that brought him to power, Hitler made an ‘Appeal to the German Nation’, “designed to reach beyond his fanatically loyal base and to embrace the general voting public”. Hitler was wedded to Germany, Netanyahu and Modi are to their ideology. They have inverted Mao Zedong’s aphorism that “power grows out of the barrel of a gun”. Their guns are balanced on ballot boxes.
The ceasefire of May 10 between India and Pakistan, like a pie crust, is waiting to be broken. Confrontation continues, but in other theatres. PM Modi is intent on reliving PM Indira Gandhi’s diplomatic blitzkrieg of foreign capitals in 1971, before she attacked East Pakistan the following month. Then, on Nov 5, speaking in Washington, she asserted disingenuously that “India has no desire to provoke war against Pakistan and has no territorial designs either on Pakistan” or on what she called ‘East Bengal’.

To its chagrin, India finds itself isolated.

Today, PM Modi has extended his battle front into international waters. His military prowess having been tested and found wanting, he has fallen back on a cheaper war — diplomacy. He has dispatched seven delegations abroad to justify India’s Paki-bashing. They include 31 members from his government and 20 politicians from other parties. Some have opted out of his jamboree, but not the publicity ravenous Congressman Shashi Tharoor.
To counter India, Pakistan has fielded a strong team, headed by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. His grandfather Z.A. Bhutto had been given a similar task in December 1971, but with too little time to be effective.
Three countries the Pakistani team will not need to visit are Turkiye, Iran and Azerbaijan. They have already voiced their support for Pakistan. India retaliated by revoking the Turkish company Celebi’s security clearance at Indian airports. Indians are being told to choose anywhere other than Turkiye as a tourist destination. Turkiye will not mind. Out of $60 billion earned by Turkiye from tourism, Indians contribute only $400 million. Azerbaijan has forfeited Indian goodwill at no great loss. Iran off stage played a ‘constructive’ and ‘effective’ role in achieving a ceasefire between India and Pakistan.
To its chagrin, India finds itself isolated — an unfriendly peninsula surrounded by disappointed neighbours. Its ambition to dominate the region has come to naught. Not one Saarc member has come out in support of India.
Many thinking Indians must be disappointed at India’s vicious savagery towards its own. Take former BJP leader L.K. Advani. He joined the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh at the age of 14 in 1941. (Modi had not even been born then.) He became a pracharak (full-time worker) in Karachi until 1947. In 2005, Advani, a co-founder of the BJP, incurred the wrath of the RSS when, while in Pakistan, he praised Mohammad Ali Jinnah as a “secular” personality. Advani like his hero Rama was exiled, to his own Dandakaranya.
Take the late Jaswant Singh. An early member of the BJP, Jaswant Singh was one of India’s longest serving parliamentarians (1980-2014). He served his country as its minister of external affairs, def­e­nce and finance. In 2010, he published a book on Jinnah: India, Partition, Independence. For hisintellectual impartiality, BJP expelled him from the party. He died an outcast.
Take the present Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri. He announced the Indo-Pak ceasefire on May 10 and then found himself and his innocent family vilified by his compatriots.
Take the Indian Army spokesperson Col Sofia Qureshi, a Muslim officer. She explained the ceasefire. A BJP MP (Vijay Singh) found this unacceptable. He called her “a sister of terrorists”.
Take the poet/lyricist Javed Akhtar. A frequent and welcome visitor to Pakistan, he now splashes vitriol on us to demonstrate his patriotism: “If I have a choice of going either to hell or to Pakistan, I would rather go to hell.” Javed Akhtar should read the sermon of the anti-Nazi pastor Martin Niemöller. Paraphrased, Niemöller warned: ‘First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out. Then, the trade unionists, the Jews … and then they came for me.’ Akhtar sahib should realise that his saffron India slyly devours its own.

• Says Nawaz was consulted before army chief’s elevation to field marshal
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said Saudi Arabia could be the “neutral” venue for much-needed talks between Pakistan and India on critical issues.
The premier also said that he had consulted PML-N President Nawaz Sharif on his decision to elevate Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir to field marshal.
Talking to a group of TV anchors at the PM House, he said that Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during the dialogue with India.
In response to a question if there was a possibility of a third venue for talks in light of the mediation offered by US President Donald Trump, the premier ruled out the possibility of China as a neutral venue, saying India would never agree to that.
However, a participant told Dawn, the PM expressed the hope that Saudi Arabia could be the third country where both sides could agree to hold the negotiations.
When it was pointed out that India intends to hold dialogue on terrorism while Pakistan wants to focus on Kashmir, the PM reiterated: “Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism will be the key points during Pakistan-India talks.”
Regarding the appointment of COAS Gen Munir as field marshal, PM Shehbaz said: “It was my own decision to make the army chief a field marshal.”
Responding to a question that Nawaz Sharif had always remained opposed to giving extension to the army chief’s term in office, PM Shehbaz said he took his elder brother into confidence before taking any decision and likewise the COAS was made field marshal after consultation with the ruling party president.
“I always consult Nawaz Sharif before taking any key decision and that also happened in case of [elevation of] Gen Asim Munir,” he added.
In reply to a question that the PTI-led KP government needs to be supported in its efforts for eradicating terrorism, the prime minister said Centre was already helping the province in this regard as over Rs600 billion had been released to the KP government under the Public Sector Development Programme.
He said that situation between Pakistan and India was de-escalating after the DGMOs of the two sides made contacts with each other.
He said if talks were held between the two arch rivals, the National Secur­ity Adviser will lead Paki­stan’s side in the process.
Meeting on housing
Presiding over a meeting on the low-cost housing, the prime minister said that affordable projects would not only make residential units accessible to the common man but would also boost national economy and create jobs.
He said the relevant task force, in collaboration with the ministry of fina­n­ce and banks, should soon submit recommendations for financing low-cost hou­s­ing projects, which should be included in the upcoming budget proposals.
He observed that sustainable growth of economy was closely linked with the development of the construction sector.
Ministers Ahsan Iqbal, Riaz Hussain Pirzada, Ahad Khan Cheema, Muh­a­mmad Aurangzeb, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, the FBR chairman and other senior officials attended the mee­t­ing, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The meeting was infor­med that the Condominium Act 2025 and amendments to the Foreclosure Law were in their final stages and after their approval it would become easier to obtain loans for the construction and ownership of homes under the low-cost housing schemes.
The task force briefed the meeting on the progress in initiating construction projects, particularly low-cost housing schemes.

These instruments are developed mainly in response to constrained fiscal space and the need to finance the shrinking PSDP and operate as extensions of sovereign debt without direct built-in cost recovery mechanisms. Can municipal bonds help create fiscal space without adding to debt?
Our approach to infrastructure financing has relied on centralised mechanisms that may no longer serve our governance structure or address climate resilience challenges. This approach is at odds with the 18th Amendment. The devolution of environmental management, urban planning and municipal services to the provinces, and by extension the local governments (LGs), demands a corresponding evolution in financing mechanisms. The intent of empowering lower tiers of government is not fulfilled if financial instruments are exclusively federal.
Pakistani cities face severe infrastructure deficits, with climate vulnerabilities manifesting locally. Karachi sees daily water shortages of around 700 million gallons against a need for 1.2 billion gallons. Less than 10 per cent of Pakistan’s wastewater undergoes treatment before disposal. Municipal waste systems clog drainage, exacerbating flooding. Such service deficiencies cost our economy Rs112bn annually in healthcare expenses and lost productivity. These deficits are the domains where municipal bonds could prove transformative.
Municipal bonds as self-financing service mechanisms: Unlike federal instruments, municipal bonds can directly finance infrastructure tied to service delivery with intrinsic revenue generation potential. Water supply networks can generate consistent user fees while liberating citizens from informal markets that extract Rs50-70bn annually through tanker mafias. Waste management systems can establish service charges to address the Rs15.5bn annual economic loss from improper disposal. Sewerage infrastructure, though barely developed, provides essential services; recent studies in Peshawar and other urban centres demonstrate citizens’ readiness to pay if service delivery is reliable.

Municipal bonds provide the financial engine to power the vision of the 18th Amendment.

Governance reform: A transition to municipal bonds would mean governance realignment consistent with our constitutional framework. The 18th Amendment envisioned LGs as service delivery vehicles; municipal bonds provide the financial engine to power this vision. Since 2010, fiscal federalism has transferred Rs25 trillion to the provinces through the NFC Award without the corresponding empowerment of LGs. The Punjab and Sindh LG Acts require amendments to authorise municipal bond issuance, while KP and Balochistan require more extensive legal reforms.
The preparatory process would drive urban governance reforms, enhancing transparency by identifying service gaps, and strengthening revenue collection systems that currently capture less than half of billable municipal taxes. The provincial finance commissions are not operational to create predictable fiscal transfers to municipalities. To begin with, medium-sized cities with a stronger private sector presence can be prioritised. Faisalabad, with its industrial base and Rs9.1bn annual municipal budget could pioneer a water infrastructure bond of $7-10m. Sialkot or Peshawar could issue an $11-18m instrument for modernising waste management. These issuances would require credit enhancements or partial guarantees from provincial set-ups until municipal creditworthiness is achieved.
Addressing capacity concerns: Critics may ask whether our municipalities possess the financial sophistication needed for capital market access. This approach underestimates the transformative potential of the bond preparation process. The rigorous external scrutiny inherent in credit rating assessments and investor due diligence creates powerful incentives for improvements. The Punjab Cities Programme has already initiated financial management improvements in 16 cities, demonstrating the potential of reforms through property tax digitalisation that reportedly increased collection by 37pc.
Municipal vs federal instruments: The green Sukuk and Wapda Eurobonds are implemented through top-down project selection without localised accountability, adding to debt obligations that are approaching Rs73tr. Municipal bonds finance infrastructure with intrinsic cost recovery potential, reducing debt sustainability concerns. Properly structured municipal bonds could achieve debt service coverage that is well above minimum thresholds for investment viability. As Mujtaba Piracha argues in Property Taxes and State Incapacity in Pakistan, empowering LGs with authority over setting tax rates and valuation will create stronger incentives for better alignment with local service provision.
Pakistan’s climate resilience requires infrastructure investment of $30-40bn over the next decade. Nearly 80pc of this manifests at the municipal level, where adaptive capacity is the weakest. Municipal bonds represent constitutional alignment, governance improvement, and climate resilience enhancement through improved service delivery.
Path forward: Successful implementation requires financial system reforms in four metropolitan corporations, 80 municipal corporations and 204 municipal committees. Revenue enhancement must improve property tax collection from current rates of 60-65pc to over 80pc, addressing the Rs285bn annual revenue potential forfeited.
Provincial legislation for municipal bond authority needs enactment alongside establishing provincial finance commissions with district-level finance awards that provide predictable revenue sharing. Learning from other cities like Ahmedabad, Cape Town, Bangkok and others who have issued municipal bonds, dedicated municipal finance departments must be created perhaps through a centralised municipal development fund supported by provincial planning and finance departments. Independent credit ratings are essential for investor confidence.
Conclusion: A three-phase approach offers a roadmap: First, initiate reforms in pioneer cities. Second, prepare for market entry with guaranteed bond pilots. Third, scale up to larger non-guaranteed issuances including green bonds and municipal sukuks, potentially unlocking $1-2bn in climate finance. The 18th Amendment promised governance transformation. Municipal bonds offer the financial mechanism to deliver on this promise while addressing climate resilience risks. The time for transition is now, as urban environmental service deficits are reaching catastrophic levels.

In a statement, the Ministry of Finance said it was initiating a comprehensive strategy to regulate digital assets and accelerate the growth of Pakistan’s virtual asset economy. On the recommendations of the Pak­istan Cryptocurrency Cou­ncil (PCC), a dedicated body, ‘Pakistan Digital Assets Authority’, would regulate blockchain-based financial infrastructure to ensure the FATF-comp­liant innovation, economic inclusion, and responsible adoption of digital assets, it said.
“Pakistan must regulate not just to catch up — but to lead. With the PDAA, we are creating a future-ready framework that protects consumers, invites global investment, and puts Pakistan at the forefront of financial innovation,” said Finance Minister and PCC Chairman Muhammad Aurangzeb.
He said PDAA would serve as a specialised regulatory body with a clear mandate to oversee licensing, compliance, and innovation within the digital asset ecosystem. It will regulate exchanges, custodians, wallets, tokenised platforms, stablecoins, and DeFi applications — all under a single, agile framework.
The strategic decision aligns Pakistan with other forward-thinking economies such as the UAE, Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong — all of which have established digital assets regulators to foster innovation while ensuring compliance with global financial norms.
The PDAA is expected to regulate more than $25 billion informal crypto market, enable tokenisation of national assets and government debt, provide legal clarity to global and local investors and facilitate monetisation of Pakistan’s surplus electricity through regulated Bitcoin mining.
The Authority is also expected to empower the youth and startups to build blockchain-based solutions at scale. With the proposed PDAA, Pakistan is signalling its intent to become a competitive player in the global digital economy, inviting responsible innovation and building trust with investors, entrepreneurs, and international partners.
“This is not just about crypto — it’s about rewriting our financial future, expanding access, and creating new export channels through tokenisation, digital finance, and Web3 innovation,” said Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of Pakistan Crypto Council — a body created a couple of months ago to guide cryptocurrency business in the country.

The State Bank’s latest data showed that banks had pulled back their funds from NBFIs, which were earlier injected largely to avoid government-imposed tax measures.
Banks had pumped over Rs1tr into NBFIs — a record for the sector — apparently as a strategy to avoid the incremental tax applicable in case of failure to achieve an advance-to-deposit ratio (ADR) of 50 per cent by the end of December 2024.
The SBP data revealed that the influx of liquidity into NBFIs exceeded the total stock of credit to the sector by 130 per cent as of mid-November 2024.
NBFIs are financial entities that provide select financial services without holding a banking licence.
Banks in Pakistan had been struggling to avoid the incremental tax linked to ADR shortfalls. The tax was introduced in the FY25 budget, prompting banks to reduce excess liquidity either by increasing advances or by curtailing deposit growth.
In pursuit of the latter, some banks reportedly issued notices to large depositors — with accounts ranging from Rs1bn to Rs5bn — asking them to pay a 5pc fee on their deposits.
However, the government eventually withdrew
The 15pc incremental tax after most banks managed to meet the 50pc ADR target before the December 2024 deadline.
The massive lending to NBFIs was a manifestation of this strategy. From July 1 to Nov 15, lending to NBFIs reached Rs1.015tr, in contrast to a net debt retirement of Rs55.8bn during the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Latest figures show that by May 9 this year, the outstanding credit with NBFIs stood at Rs416.2bn. Following their withdrawal from NBFIs in the second half of FY25, banks increased their investments in government securities, while advances to other sectors dropped significantly.
During July-May FY24, credit to NBFIs was negative, with net debt retirement amounting to Rs108.2bn.
The Rs1.015tr credit extended to NBFIs was 130pc more than the total credit stock of Rs441.6bn held by the sector as of June 30, 2024.
In April 2024, some bankers warned that a halt in bank lending to NBFIs could lead to closures of several institutions, as persistently high interest rates were hurting both banks and NBFIs.
Throughout FY24, the policy interest rate remained at 22pc, severely impacting the broader economy and allied sectors. However, banks remained insulated due to the government’s extensive borrowing from the banking system.
Most banks continued to avoid financing the private sector, preferring instead to park their liquidity in government bonds.

He warned that a nuclear confrontation bet­ween India and Pakistan will have devastating consequences for the entire region and beyond.
“There is a need to hold dialogue and find solution to the issue of terrorism. People of both countries seek peace, which is not possible until the three main issues — Kashmir, terrorism, and water — are resolved,” he said while talking to reporters after attending a briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
A former foreign minister, Mr Bhutto-Zardari will soon lead a high-level diplomatic delegation to various capitals to apprise the world leaders of India’s aggression aimed at destabilising regional peace.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently decided to send a high-level delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda in the aftermath of the recent military escalation.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari will lead the delegation, comprising Senator Sherry Rehman, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Hina Rabbani Khar, Faisal Sabzwari, Tehmina Janjua, and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
The PPP legislator told media persons that he and other members of the delegation had received an initial briefing at the Foreign Office on the ceasefire, Kashmir, terrorism and the Indian “attack” on the Indus Waters Treaty.
He said such briefings will continue for the next few days, and then as per the prime minister’s directive, they will visit different countries to present Pakistan’s stance, which is based on peace.
The PPP leader said Pakistan desired peace in the region which can be achieved by addressing the flashpoints, whether it was the Kashmir dispute or terrorism.
“Pakistan is one of the biggest victims of terrorism,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari cautioned that the “new normal” that India was seeking was not in its favour either.
“We have seen how after a terrorist attack, both countries can come close to a nuclear war,” he pointed out.
He expressed grave concerns about India’s weaponisation of water and highlighted the need for Pakistan to apprise the world about it.
He said they would inform foreign governments and people that a conflict between two nuclear countries would have severe consequences beyond the region.
The PPP chief appreciated the prime minister’s efforts during the conflict, saying Pakistan demonstrated a ‘reasonable and rational role’ after India’s baseless accusations.
“Pakistan was not the aggressor, we only defended ourselves,” he said, adding that “the world is welcoming our stance as we stood with the truth, while India built a narrative on lies and falsehoods.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari, in a recent post on X, announced that he was appointed by the prime minister to “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
“I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” he wrote.
In a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.

• If approved, power firms to charge Rs13bn more in June
ISLAMABAD: With a massive 22 per cent surge in power consumption in April compared to last year, the electricity price hike has once again returned to burden consumers, as public sector distribution companies (Discos) have sought a Rs1.27 per unit increase in the fuel price adjustment (FCA) for electricity consumed in April.
If approved, the ex-Wapda Discos would charge about Rs13 billion more from consumers in the month of June. The higher consumption is attributed to the early onset of high temperatures compared to last year.
 
 

The increase in fuel cost follows eight months of negative monthly adjustments and comes amid substantially higher costs permitted by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) through a 20pc increase in the base tariff, effective July 1, 2024. More than 68pc of the total power supply during April was derived from domestic fuel sources, with almost 28pc of that at zero fuel cost.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), which filed the petition for the increase in April’s fuel cost, reported a 22pc rise in power consumption over April 2024, and a 26pc increase over March 2025. It stated that electricity delivered to Discos in April amounted to 10,196 gigawatt hours (GWh), compared to 8,114GWh in March 2025 and 8,375GWh in April last year.
The power companies claimed that the average fuel cost in April 2025 was Rs8.95 per unit, slightly lower than Rs8.98 per unit in April 2024.
Nepra has scheduled a public hearing on May 29 to consider the petition filed by CPPA — a subsidiary of the Power Division — seeking “an increase of Rs1.2685/kWh over the reference fuel charge of Rs7.6803 per unit”. The CPPA stated that the actual fuel cost turned out to be Rs8.95 per unit and requested that the revised FCA be applied in the billing month of June.
According to the CPPA, about 10,513GWh of electricity was generated in April at an estimated fuel cost of Rs104.3bn (Rs9.92 per unit), out of which 10,196GWh was delivered to Discos at a cost of Rs91.24bn (Rs8.95 per unit).
Hydropower retained the largest share in the overall grid at about 22pc, down slightly from 24pc in April last year. The second-largest contribution came from RLNG at 21.5pc, followed by nuclear power at nearly 18pc.
This was followed by 14.5pc from local coal and 10pc from imported coal. Domestic natural gas accounted for about 8pc of the grid’s supply.
LNG-based power generation was the most expensive among major sources, with its cost reported at Rs24.26 per unit in April, followed by Rs16.61 per unit from imported coal and Rs11.82 per unit from local gas. Power generation from local coal cost Rs11.2 per unit.
The cost of nuclear fuel was Rs2.1 per unit in April, up from Rs1.83 in February and Rs1.7 in December. Three renewable energy sources — wind, bagasse and solar — collectively contributed 6pc to the grid. Wind and solar had no fuel cost, while bagasse-based generation remained at Rs5.98 per unit. Electricity imported from Iran accounted for about 0.3pc of total power supply, with a reported cost of Rs25.34 per unit.

The understanding was reached during an informal trilateral meeting of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing. The talks were part of Beijing’s broader effort to ease regional tensions and advance connectivity through its Belt and Road Initiative.
“Afghanistan and Pakistan expressed clear willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and agreed in principle to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible,” Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in a statement released by China’s foreign ministry.
“China welcomes this and will continue to provide assistance for the improvement of Afghanistan-Pakistan relations,” Yi said.

China, Pakistan agree on CPEC extension to Kabul

Also, Pakistan and China noted that there was an agreement on the extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan.
Although no country has formally recognised the Taliban regime since its return to power in 2021, several including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia maintain ambassadors in Kabul. China and the UAE also host Taliban-appointed ambassadors, while Russia last month agreed to accept a Taliban ambassador in Moscow.
Pakistan and Afghanistan currently only have chargés d’affaires posted to each other’s capitals.
Wednesday’s meeting followed a thaw in Pakistan-Afghanistan ties, which have been marred by deep mistrust, cross-border attacks, and sharp disagreements over the presence of the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants operating from Afghan territory. Islamabad has long accused Kabul of harboring TTP fighters, who were blamed for a 70pc increase in attacks inside Pakistan in 2024.
Recent diplomatic efforts have aimed to turn the tide. In March 2025, Special Envoy for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq visited Kabul for the first time in over a year. His mission was followed by a high-level visit by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on April 19, where both sides pledged to prevent their territories from being used for terrorist activities and agreed on trade facilitation measures.
The trilateral meeting in Beijing further built on this momentum. China, which has strategic interests in regional stability and economic integration, hosted the gathering to help resume the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral dialogue, which had been paused since 2023.
The key outcomes from the Beijing meeting. besides the agreement on the appointment of ambassadors in each other’s capitals, included commitments to enhance cooperation in security and counter-terrorism, including joint action against militant groups and external interference; support for extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) into Afghanistan; and an understanding to formally resume the trilateral process by convening the sixth China-Afghanistan-Pakistan Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue in Kabul.
“Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to promoting close, cooperative ties with Afghanistan, especially in trade, transit, health, and connectivity,” Pakistan’s Foreign Office said in a statement following the meeting.
China emphasised that all sides must “safeguard their sovereignty, security and national dignity” and reiterated its support for regional partners pursuing development paths “suited to their national conditions.”
With Wednesday’s developments, Pakistan and China appear to be betting that deeper engagement and economic incentives can draw Kabul closer and temper instability in the region.
CPEC extension
Wang Yi noted Chinese and Pakistani support for Afghanistan’s reconstruction and development, and readiness to expand trade exchanges with Afghanistan. He further said that there was an agreement on “the extension of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to Afghanistan.”
The same was echoed by FO, which said, “China and Pakistan reiterated their support for extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to Afghanistan under the broader framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation.”
All three sides appeared cautiously optimistic about the progress toward normalised ties between Islamabad and Kabul.
“The process of normalisation will not be quick,” commented a diplomat not authorised to speak publicly, “but the fact that Islamabad and Kabul are talking again at this level and agreeing in principle on ambassadors is a significant development.”
For Beijing, which has maintained an ambassador in Kabul and recognised a Taliban-appointed envoy last year, the meeting reflects a strategy of “mini-multilateralism”, which is a targeted diplomatic format aimed at tackling specific regional challenges.
The meeting’s significance is heightened by India’s recent diplomatic overtures to the Taliban, including a call last week between Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Amir Khan Muttaqi. This comes amid growing Taliban frustration with Pakistan over refugee deportations and border closures.

Exports witnessed significant growth to Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, spurred by recent changes in the regional political landscape. However, trade with these countries continues to face considerable challenges, largely due to unfavourable government policies.
Despite this positive development in exports, the overall trade gap with regional countries widened, primarily due to increased imports from China, India and Bangladesh during the period under review.
In FY24, the trade deficit with these countries stood at $9.506bn, up 49pc from $6.382bn in the preceding year.

Export gains to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka offset by soaring imports

Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw a hefty growth in July-April FY25. Still, exports to other countries, especially China, continued to decline during the period, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — rose 2.37pc to $3.743bn in July-April FY25 from $3.656bn over the same period last year.
Contrary to this, imports surged 23.84pc to $13.530bn in 10MFY25 from $10.925bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 23.87pc to $13.191bn in 10MFY25 from $10.649bn over the same period last year. In FY24, imports from China stood at $13.506bn, up by 39.78pc from $9.662bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh.
Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 11.65pc to $2.070bn in 10MFY25 from $2.343bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.
Imports from India increased 14.35pc to $196.77m in 10MFY25 from $172.07m over the last year. In FY24, imports from India rose 8.866pc to $206.89m — up from $190.04m in the same period last year.
Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $0.51m in 10MFY25 against $1.25m over the last year. Exports to India stood at $3.669m in FY24 against $0.329m in the same period the previous year.
Exports to Afghanistan increased 52.46pc to $666.59m in 10MFY25 from $437.22m last year. Imports stood at $22.77m against $7.38m in 10MFY24, a growth of 208pc.
The Torkham border station remained closed for almost 27 days last month which disrupted the imports and exports to Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s main exports to Afghanistan include sugar in the current fiscal year. In the past four months, Pakistan exported more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar, mostly to Afghanistan.
No formal data is available for trade with Iran, as most of it occurs through informal channels. However, Pakistan has adopted a barter trade arrangement, especially as smuggling of Iranian petroleum products and LPG through Balochistan’s porous border continues.
Exports to Bangladesh increased by 24.77pc to $668.94m in 10MFY25 from $536.12m. Imports grew 43.35pc to $68.87m in 10MFY from $48.04m over the last year. The uptick in trade followed the ouster of the Hasina government in Dhaka. Pakistan has resumed rice exports to Bangladesh in the current fiscal year.
Exports to Sri Lanka dropped 0.52pc to $326.90m in 10MFY25 from $328.62m the last year. This decline was attributed to reduced economic activity in Sri Lanka. Imports from Sri Lanka remained static at $49m during the months under review.
Shipments to Nepal fell to $2.17m from $2.42m over the last year.
Exports to Maldives rose to $7.96m in 10MFY25 from $7.67m over the last year. No trade activity was recorded between Pakistan and Bhutan during the current fiscal year or the corresponding period last year.

QUETTA/KHUZDAR: At least six people, including three students, lost their lives and over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted a school bus in Khuzdar on Wedn­esday, prompting the prime minister to visit Quetta to take stock of the security situation amid across-the-board condemnations.
The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials said, adding that at least 15 girl students are among the injured. The incident occurred near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when the bus was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
“It was a suicide attack through which the Army Public School bus was targeted at Zero Point in Khuzdar,” a senior police officer confirmed. Deputy Commissioner Yasar Iqbal Dashti also confirmed the explosion as a suicide attack.
A senior official in the Khuzdar administration told Dawn that about 49 people, including over 40 students, were on the bus when a powerful explosion took place next to it, which completely destr­oyed the vehicle.
 
 

Three girls who perished in the incident were identified as Ayesha Saleem (class 10), Hafsa Kausar (class 7), and Sania Somroo (class 6). “They were martyred on the spot,” an official said, adding that two of the three other deceased were identified as Muhammad Iqbal, driver, and Sepoy Qadeer.
According to the officials, some of the victims who received serious injuries were shifted to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Quetta.
No one had claimed responsibility for the attack till the filing of this report.
The attack on school bus prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet members to rush to Quetta where they received a security briefing. Later, a statement issued by the PM Office quoted him as saying, “Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies will relentlessly pursue all those involved in this barbaric act.
“The architects, abettors, and enablers of this crime will be held accountable and brought to justice and the truth about India’s cunning role, a real perpetrator of terrorism but feigns as a victim, stands exposed before the world.”
The statement detailed the incident, claiming the act was carried out by “state-sponsored proxies of India (Fitna al Hindustan)” and added that “dastardly terrorist incidents” were being orchestrated through proxies in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, “deliberately targeting civilians in a futile attempt to destabilise Pakistan”.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, along with the prime minister also visited the injured victims.
‘Instruments of its state policy’
Earlier, the PM was briefed by the Balochistan chief minister and the Quetta corps commander about the attack, which claimed the lives of three children and two soldiers and left 43 others, including 39 children, injured. The condition of eight students was described as critical.
The premier said the terrorist groups — masquerading under ethnic pretences — were not only being exploited by India as instruments of its state policy, but also a stain on the honour and values of the Baloch and Pashtun people, who have long rejected violence and extremism.
India’s reliance on such morally indefensible tactics, particularly the deliberate targeting of children, demands urgent attention from the international community, he said, adding that the use of terrorism as a tool of foreign policy must be unequivocally condemned and confronted.
PM Shehbaz and COAS Asim Munir highlighted that it’s time that the nation displays a very strong resolve similar to the one shown recently against the aggression by India, to bring the fight against foreign-sponsored terrorism to its logical and decisive end.
Bugti presser
Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti, in a press conference, accused India of targeting innocent children following its “political defeat” on May 9 and 10 He claimed that intelligence reports had warned of India-sponsored attacks in Balochistan. “We never imagined children would be targeted. Ajit Doval’s ideology has sunk to such disgraceful levels,” he said.
He claimed that while ‘hundreds of terrorists’ were killed or arrested last year, legal loopholes had led to their release. A new anti-terrorism law was being formulated, which would include provisions for establishing detention centres to address the issue of missing persons. He also urged Afghanistan’s interim government to honour its Doha Agreement commitments and ensure its soil is not used for cross-border terrorism.
‘Most heinous and cowardly’ attack
In a statement following the blast, the Inter-Services Public Relations said that “after having miserably failed in the battlefield, through these most heinous and cowardly such like acts, Indian proxies have been unleashed to spread terror and unrest in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”.
The ISPR said, “Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians”
It noted that India had “failed” in Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.
“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of [sic] basic human norms,” the ISPR said.
“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military media wing said.
Condemnation
President Asif Ali Zardari termed the attack a “heinous and inhumane crime” and vowed to expose this “India-backed terrorism” at an international level. “These terrorists do not want to see Balochistan developed,” he said in a statement.
PM Shehbaz condemned the attack as a cowardly act. “The attack on innocent children in a school bus by terrorists working under Indian patronage is a clear proof of their hostility towards education in Balochistan,” he said in a statement.
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari described the attack as ‘a despicable and inhuman act, beneath all moral and human values’. “This cowardice against our children is an attack on the soul of Pakistan. Innocent lives, full of dreams, extinguished in an instant. We share in the grief of the bereaved families,” he wrote on X, vowing that Pakistan would bring all those responsible to light and justice.
The US embassy in Islamabad said it stood with Pakistan in condemning the “brutal” and “unconscionable” attack. “The murder of innocent children is beyond comprehension. We grieve with the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts are with those recovering. No child should ever fear going to school. We stand with those in Pakistan working to end this violence,” it said.
The Chinese embassy said it was saddened to hear about the attack. “China firmly opposes all forms of terrorism. We strongly condemn this terrorist attack, extend our deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathies to the bereaved families, and wish the injured an early recovery,” it added.
Unicef also released a statement, extending condolences to the families, adding that it stood in solidarity with all those affected.

The authorities, however, have committed to meeting any revenue shortfall through reduced expenditure in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) during the current year. An increase in the petroleum levy and the introduction of a carbon levy on petroleum and other energy products are expected to be part of the forthcoming budget, sources said.
Informed sources told Dawn that, on the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, officials at the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) have discussed possible relief measures with the IMF mission, which has been engaged in budget discussions since May 14. Among the proposed concessions is an average 2.5 per cent reduction in income tax rates across all salaried income slabs.
However, this proposal hinges on IMF staff being satisfied with the government’s revenue plan that supports the programme’s target of a 1.6pc primary budget surplus — approximately Rs2.1 trillion. An official told Dawn that discussions on budget targets are still ongoing and that no measures have been finalised.

Authorities pledge PSDP cuts to cover revenue gap

Datasheets and projections, in line with the proposed budgetary framework reviewed in the first biannual review a few weeks ago, have been shared with the IMF. Responses to the Fund’s queries are currently being compiled. The official said that the IMF’s position on the proposed revenue and expenditure strategy will become clearer once its staff analyses the data through its software-based framework.
He added that the IMF has neither accepted nor rejected the proposed relief measures for the budget, contrary to reports in certain quarters. Formal discussions regarding budgetary proposals for the real estate sector have yet to take place.
The government’s “Tajir Dost” scheme for retailers, meanwhile, has failed to yield the desired results and is likely to be replaced by a more effective revenue collection strategy.
The IMF has also emphasised the need to reduce provincial expenditures and increase provincial revenue contributions to maintain fiscal discipline and progress towards implementing a national fiscal pact. A key priority at the provincial level, according to the Fund, should be the effective enforcement of agriculture income tax beginning September 2025.
The government has pledged to withhold PSDP disbursements to offset revenue shortfalls and expects additional tax revenues through the resolution of litigation cases. The Fund has already acknowledged the authorities’ commitment to pursuing resolution of outstanding legal cases — worth Rs367 billion out of a total Rs770bn under dispute. These include cases before the Supreme Court (Rs43bn), high courts in Islamabad, Sindh and Lahore (Rs217bn), and the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (Rs104bn).
A favorable SC ruling could effectively resolve cases involving an estimated Rs120bn, according to the IMF.
