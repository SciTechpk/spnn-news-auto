Inside a Google facility in Santa Barbara, California lives Willow, the most powerful computer in the world. But this is no ordinary PC, it is a quantum computer.
In the words of BBC economics editor, Faisal Islam, “[it] looks like a golden chandelier and contains the coldest place in the known universe”, but contains “technology pivotal to financial security, Bitcoin, government secrets, the world economy and more”.
Willow is an oil barrel-sized series of round discs connected by hundreds of black control wires descending into a bronze liquid helium bath refrigerator keeping the quantum microchip a thousandth of a degree above absolute zero.
There are no screens or keyboards. Each quantum computer is given a name such as Yakushima or Mendocino, they are each wrapped in a piece of contemporary art, and various graffiti-style murals adorn the walls.
According to Hartmut Neven, Google’s Quantum AI chief, the Willow chip has settled “once and for all” the discussion about whether quantum computers can do tasks that classical computers can’t.

Willow, housed at Google’s quantum computing facility, is capable of solving within minutes complex problems that would take the best computer in the world ‘more than trillions of years’

Willow also solved a benchmark problem in minutes that would have taken the best computer in the world 10 septillion years — more than the age of the universe.
This theoretical result was recently applied to the Quantum Echoes algorithm, impossible for conventional computers, which helps learn the structure of molecules from the same technology used in MRI machines.
In Neven’s words, this quantum chip can help with many problems facing humankind right now.
“It will enable us to discover medicines more efficiently,” he told the BBC. “It will help us make food production more efficient, it will help us produce energy, to transport ener­­gy, to store energy… solve climate change and human hunger.”
“It allows us to understand nature much better, and then unlock its secret to build technologies that make life more pleasant for all of us.”
Some members of the team working on Willow have just received the Nobel prize for the original research into “superconducting qubits”.
According to IBM, a quantum bit (or qubit) is the basic unit of information used to encode data in quantum computing, and can be best understood as the quantum equivalent of the ‘bit’, used by classical computers to encode information in binary.

 

In contrast to a traditional bit (either 0 or 1), a qubit is capable of existing in a superposition of both states (both 0 and 1) simultaneously, allowing for vastly more complex data representation.
The Willow chip has 105 qub­its. Microsoft’s quantum effort has 8 qubits, but uses a different approach. But the real race is to get to 1 million qubits for a “utility scale machine” that can do quantum chemistry, drug design, without error.
If you want to wrap your head around what it is capable of, imagine trying to find a tennis ball in one of a thousand closed drawers.
A classical computer opens each one in order. A quantum computer opens all of them at the same time.
Or similarly, instead of having to need a hundred keys to open a hundred doors in normal computing, quantum enables you to open all one hundred, with one key, instantly.
These machines will not be for everyone. They will not shrink down into phones or AI glasses or laptops.
But the point is that the power of these computers grows exponentially, and everyone is getting in on the act.
According to Sir Peter Kni­ght, Chair of the UK’s National Quantum Technology Progra­mmes Strategy Advisory Boa­rd, Willow has broken new ground.
“All the machines are really still at the toy model stage, they make mistakes. They need error correction. Willow was the first to demonstrate that you could do error correction, through repeated rounds of repairs, which improve,” he told the BBC.

Following the issuance of the policy directive, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) is expected to release the information memorandum (IM) for telecom operators and new entrants to participate in the upcoming spectrum auction.
Under the policy framework, spectrum fees have been fixed in dollars, while the exchange rate will be determined at the closing National Bank of Pakistan’s TT selling rate prevailing on the day preceding the auction date.
A minimum of 50 per cent of the spectrum fee will be payable within one year from the date of licence issuance. The remaining 50pc will be payable in five equal annual instalments at KIBOR offer rate plus 3pc.
Previously, interest rates were based on the London Interbank Offered Rate under the 2021 policy directive issued by the IT ministry. Under the new framework, licences will be issued for a period of 15 years. The PTA is expected to issue the IM shortly for telecom operators and any potential new entrants.
The auction will be conducted by the PTA for 15 MHz paired spectrum in the 700 MHz band, 3.6 MHz paired spectrum in the 1800 MHz band, 20 MHz paired spectrum in the 2100 MHz band, 50 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 2300 MHz band, 190 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 2600 MHz band, and 280 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 3500 MHz band.
The base prices for the various spectrum bands have been set at $6.5 million for 1 MHz paired spectrum in the 700 MHz band, $14m for 1 MHz paired spectrum in both the 1800 MHz and 2100 MHz bands, $1m for 1 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 2300 MHz band, $1.25m for 1 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 2600 MHz band, and $0.65m for 1 MHz unpaired spectrum in the 3500 MHz band.
At the same time, the IT ministry has taken note of broader concerns of the telecom industry and has asked the federal government to take measures in consultation with relevant stakeholders.
It has suggested that to enhance the market penetration of 5G-compatible smartphones, taxes should be reduced to promote local manufacturing. Another proposal is to allow duty-free import of 5G equipment to accelerate adoption.
The IT ministry has also asked the government to implement an industrial power tariff for the telecom sector through a joint task force comprising the ministry, Power Division, Nepra, PTA, telecom operators and power distribution companies.
The PTA has obligated PTCL to participate in the upcoming spectrum auction, while Jazz has welcomed the policy directive.
Kazim Mujtaba, president of Jazz’s consumer division, said that long-standing structural challenges faced by the telecom sector have been addressed, adding that these will translate into tangible progress, enabling sustained investment, network expansion and the delivery of affordable, high-quality connectivity nationwide.

ADEN: The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen said on Thursday that southern separatist lea­der, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, has fled the country by boat, as government forces advanced on the port city of Aden.
The coalition said in a statement that Zubaidi travelled from Yemen to Somaliland, where he boarded an aircraft to Mogadishu. The coalition stated the plane was later tracked to a military airport in Abu Dhabi.
The Somali government announced it has launched an investigation to determine if its airports were used to transport a “political fugitive”, a reference to Zubaidi.
The country’s Immigration and Citizenship Agency said that if this proved to be true, it would constitute a “serious violation” of national sovereignty.
Zubaidi’s escape follows his failure to appear for crisis talks in Riyadh on Wednesday. His group, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), claimed he had been asked to go to Saudi Arabia under threat.
In a statement, the Saudi-led coalition provided further details about the flight from Somaliland. It said the aircraft turned off its identification system over the Gulf of Oman before turning it back on 10 minutes before its arrival at Al Reef military airport in Abu Dhabi.
The situation in Aden appeared stable on Thursday, with Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces patrolling the streets and no sign of STC forces, a witness told Reuters. Authorities have also imposed a nighttime curfew in the city.
Aden served as the seat of Yemen’s internationally recognised government since Houthi forces seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014, but leaders of the Saudi-backed government left Aden last month after the STC took control of the city.

 

The Saudi-led coalition first intervened in Yemen in 2015 to support the government against the Houthis, an intervention that led to one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. The STC was established in 2017 and later joined the government coalition.
An STC delegation in Riyadh said it had held fruitful talks with the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, according to comments by Mohammed Al Ghaith, a senior official of the group.
Meanwhile, Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council on Thursday ousted the separatist leader from its ranks and referred him for investigation on charges of high treason after he fled the country, according to Arab News.
The council held an emergency meeting, revoking Zubaidi’s membership and dismissing two ministers, Transport Minister Abdul­salam Humaid and Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Waed Badhib, from their posts.
The meeting also revealed a split within the STC, as one of its prominent members, Abdulrahman Al-Muharrami, attended the session that voted to oust Zubaidi.
Al-Muharrami’s Giants Brigades forces have also been deployed to help prevent security breakdowns in Aden in coordination with the government, officials said.

The Brussels-based independent and non-profit think tank, founded by prominent statesmen, says in a new report that relations between the two countries have tanked, mainly because of the Afghan Taliban’s refusal to crack down on the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Since 2022, violence in Pakistan has spiralled. In 2025 alone, militants killed more than 600 Pakistani soldiers and police, mostly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, the two provinces bordering Afghanistan.
Islamabad blames the banned TTP for these attacks, along with Baloch insurgent groups, which it believes with evidence, are backed by arch-rival India.

Brussels-based think tank says Islamabad may strike Afghanistan again if militant attacks continue

“UN monitors assert that the TTP enjoys Taliban support, but the Taliban publicly deny that Pakistani militants are even in Afghanistan and say Islamabad provoked what they paint as homegrown violence,” according to the report.
On its western flank, after 11 Pakistani military personnel were martyred in a TTP attack on Oct 8, Islamabad conducted cross-border airstrikes, including its first-ever strike on Kabul, ostensibly targeting TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud.
Afghanistan retaliated with attacks on Pakistani military installations. Continued fighting claimed military and civilian lives on both sides.
The report cautions that Islamabad is likely to lash out again if it traces another strike back to Afghanistan.
The Taliban regime is badly outgunned, but its retaliation could still be lethal. Kabul claims to have missiles that can reach Pakistani cities, the use of which would likely provoke an even stronger Pakistani response.
South Asia
In South Asia, however, Islamabad’s foreign relations are far more fraught. After short wars in 2025 with both Afghanistan and India, another major attack by militants could upend the precarious calm that prevails between Pakistan and its two neighbours.
The report lists 10 conflicts to watch in 2026: Afghanistan-Pakistan, Myan­mar, Israel and the United States versus Iran, Israel-Palestine, Syria, Ukraine, Mali and Burkina Faso, Ethiopia-Eritrea, Sudan, and Venezuela.
The report says the world was careening into a dangerous new era well before Donald Trump’s return to the White House. Thus far, his second term has done less to slow things down than to put a foot on the gas. The year 2025 was a bloody one, and 2026 promises little better.
‘Trump effect’
Less predictable has been President Trump, whose first year back in the White House has turned world politics and international crisis management on their heads. Trump returned to power pledging to bring peace to a world ablaze. He has put himself centre stage in many wars and trouble spots.
Trump has brought fresh attention to peacemaking after years in which diplomatic efforts to end conflicts had been flailing.
But Trump has not calmed the global turmoil he decried on the campaign trail. In some cases, he has made it worse.
His deals, often built on other countries’ diplomacy, have brought respite to some battlefields but delivered no lasting peace anywhere.
Trump’s deal-making aims to bring US power to bear, whether in Gaza, by leveraging Israel’s dependency on Washington, or elsewhere, mostly by threatening tariffs or dangling business opportunities.
Trump’s bargaining must be set against the dearth of peace deals that preceded his return to power as well as the lack of progress in places where he does not engage.
European leaders, for example, focused on the existential peril they see on their doorstep, have less bandwidth for peacemaking elsewhere, the report says.

“He (Xi) considers it to be a part of China, and that‘s up to him what he’s going to be doing,” Trump told the newspaper on Wednesday.
“But I‘ve expressed to him that I would be very unhappy if he did that, and I don’t think he‘ll do that. I hope he doesn’t do that.”
Trump made the comments in the context of an exchange about what lessons Xi might take away from Trump‘s audacious military operation in Venezuela and the abduction of the country’s president, Nicolas Maduro.
The Republican president said he did not view the situations as analogous because Taiwan did not pose the same type of threat to China that he has said the government of Maduro posed to the United States.
He also repeated his belief that Xi would not make a move against Taiwan during his presidency, which ends in 2029.
“He may do it after we have a different president, but I don‘t think he’s going to do it with me as president,” Trump said.
The Trump administration said in a strategy document last year that it aims to prevent conflict with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea by building up US and allies’ military power.
China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own, and Beijing has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Taiwan rejects Beijing’s claims.
The Taiwan question is purely China‘s internal affair, and how to resolve it is a matter purely within China’s sovereign rights, said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington.
The United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is the island’s most important international backer and is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.
The issue has been an irritant in US-China relations for years.
Trump has largely avoided directly saying how he would respond to a rise in tensions over the island.</p><small>2026-01-09 02:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/09070806fb302bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965945/us-border-agent-shoots-wounds-2-people-in-portland' target='_blank'><strong>US border agent shoots, wounds 2 people in Portland</strong></a><br><p>A US immigration agent shot and wounded a man and a woman in Portland, Oregon, authorities said on Thursday, leading local officials to call for calm given public outrage over the ICE shooting death of a Minnesota woman a day earlier.
“We understand the heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis, but I am asking the community to remain calm as we work to learn more,” Portland police chief Bob Day said in a statement.
The Portland shooting unfolded on Thursday afternoon as US Border Patrol agents were conducting a targeted vehicle stop, the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement.
The statement said the driver, a suspected Venezuelan gang member, attempted to “weaponise” his vehicle and run over the agents.
In response, DHS said, “an agent fired a defensive shot” and the driver and a passenger drove away.
Reuters was unable to independently verify the circumstances of the incident.
Portland police said that the shooting took place near a medical clinic in eastern Portland.
Six minutes after arriving at the scene and determining federal agents were involved in the shooting, police were informed that two people with gunshot wounds — a man and a woman — were asking for help at a location about 3 km to the northeast of the medical clinic.
Police said they applied tourniquets to the man and woman, who were taken to a hospital. Their condition was unknown.
The shooting came just a day after a federal agent from US. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a separate agency within the Department of Homeland Security, fatally shot a 37-year-old mother of three in her car in Minneapolis.

 

That shooting has prompted two days of protests in Minneapolis. Officers from both ICE and Border Patrol have been deployed in cities across the United States as part of Republican President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.
While the aggressive enforcement operations have been cheered by the president’s supporters, Democrats and civil rights activists have decried the posture as an unnecessary provocation.
US officials contend criminal suspects and anti-Trump activists have increasingly used their cars as weapons, though video evidence has sometimes contradicted their claims.
Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said in a statement his city was now grappling with violence at the hands of federal agents and that “we cannot sit by while constitutional protections erode and bloodshed mounts”.
He called on ICE to halt all its operations in the city until an investigation can be completed.
“Federal militarisation undermines effective, community-based public safety, and it runs counter to the values that define our region,” Wilson said.
“I will use every legal and legislative tool available to protect our residents’ civil and human rights.”</p><small>2026-01-09 02:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644054-58-magnitude-earthquake-felt-in-islamabad-pindi-and-kp-areas' target='_blank'><strong>5.8 magnitude earthquake felt in Islamabad, Pindi and KP areas</strong></a><br><p>

OZ Developers were in a bidding war with software company i2c as they went head-to-head in the second round of the auction taking place at the Jinnah Convention Centre in Islamabad.
I2c’s final bid was Rs1.82bn before OZ Developers upped the ante and ended the night at Rs1.85bn, the highest ever bid for a PSL franchise.
The first round of the auction was won by FKS, which was also in a bidding war with i2c, whose final bid was Rs1.7bn.







The base price for the first franchise — the seventh team being added to PSL — was set at Rs1.1bn, while the base price for the eighth team was Rs1.7bn.
This will be Hyderabad and Sialkot’s first appearance since the league’s inception in 2015, with this year’s league set for March 26-May 3.
The cities up for potential franchise allocation included Faisalabad, Gilgit, Hyderabad, Muzaffarabad, Rawalpindi and Sialkot.
The current PSL teams include Lahore Qalandars, Islamabad United, Peshawar Zalmi, Quetta Gladiators, Karachi Kings and Multan Sultans.
Bidders for the two new teams were FKS, OZ Developers, Aim Next inc, Deharki Sugar Mills, Inverex Solar, i2c, Jazz, Prism Developers, VGO TEL, and Walee Pakistan.
Commentator and former Pakistan cricket team captain Wasim Akram hosted the auction as PSL CEO Salman Naseer joined him on stage.
“Ten years of PSL have lead us to this moment,” Naseer said at the start of the auction.
Akram coaxed the bidders buy reminding them that winning a bid was more than just ownership; it was the ability to design new logos, kits, interact with players and much more.
Ahead of bidding process, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi awarded a cash prize of Rs 90 million to the team that won the Rising Star Asia Cup.
The team that won the Hong Kong Sixes title was also awarded a cash prize of Rs 18.5m.







The bidding deadline was extended multiple times — initially from December 15 to December 22, and further to December 24 — amid growing interest from investors in Europe, the United States, the Middle East and beyond, following promotional roadshows in London and New York.
Ex-Multan Sultans owner Ali Tareen pulls out of auction
Earlier in the day, ex-Multan Sultans owner Ali Tareen announced on social media that he and his family would not be participating in the PSL auction.
“Our time with Multan Sultans was never just about owning a cricket team. It was about south Punjab,” he wrote in a post on X.
“[It was] about giving a voice to a region that had been overlooked for too long. That’s what drove everything we built.”
Tareen added that if he were to return to the league, it would have to be for the same reason, stating that south Punjab “is where my heart is”.
“This year, I’ll be in the stands. Cheering for players on and celebrating with the fans. And when the Multan team is being sold, we’ll be ready,” he wrote.

Plumes of smoke rose above the city skyline at dusk and the boom of artillery could be heard across Aleppo as the Kurdish fighters tried to repel the troops’ advance and cling to neighbourhoods under their control.
The fighting, which erupted on Tuesday, has driven more than 140,000 people from their homes and left at least seven civilians dead, according to Syrian authorities.
The deadly stand-off between Damascus and Kurdish authorities, who have resisted integrating into the central government, is a major challenge for Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has pledged to unite the country after 14 years of civil war.
Stalled talks on ceasefire
Syria’s army gave a window on Thursday for residents to evacuate the neighbourhoods held by Kurdish forces in Aleppo before launching new strikes there. It released more than seven maps identifying areas it said would be targeted and announced a curfew in the neighbourhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafieh from 1200 GMT.

The Kurdish forces, including the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and the Asayish, or internal security forces, said they had pushed back Syrian troops’ attacks.
Syrian sources told Reuters the US was spearheading efforts to reach a ceasefire.
SDF head Mazloum Abdi said the government forces’ strikes and deployment of tanks had undermined “the chances of reaching understandings, create conditions for dangerous demographic changes, and expose civilians trapped in the two neighbourhoods to the risk of massacres”.
Two government officials told Reuters that negotiations were underway over the withdrawal of Kurdish forces from the city.
The Asayish, in a written statement, denied that its forces had requested safe passage and called instead on the Damascus government to withdraw its forces.
“The attacks carried out against civilians in Aleppo have unfortunately exacerbated concerns about the true intentions of the SDF and created a pessimistic picture regarding peace efforts,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told a joint press conference with his Omani counterpart on Thursday.
“The SDF’s insistence on protecting what it has at all costs is the biggest obstacle to achieving peace and stability in Syria,” Fidan added.
Turkey views the US-backed SDF, which controls swathes of northeastern Syria, as a terrorist organisation and has warned of military action if the group does not honour the integration agreement.
Accusations of ethnic cleansing
The Kurdistan Regional Government’s Prime Minister Masrour Barzani said he was deeply concerned by attacks on Kurdish neighbourhoods in Aleppo, warning that targeting civilians and attempts to alter the area’s demography amounted to what he described as ethnic cleansing.
Barzani called on all sides to exercise restraint, protect civilians and pursue dialogue.

The SDF said Damascus’s evacuation warnings ahead of shelling could amount to forced displacement and war crimes under international humanitarian law.
Kurdish-led authorities established a semi-autonomous administration in northeast Syria and parts of Aleppo during Syria’s 14-year war and have resisted fully integrating into the new government that took power after former President Bashar al-Assad was ousted in late 2024.
Damascus reached a deal with the SDF last year that envisaged full integration by the end of 2025, but progress has been limited, with both sides accusing the other of stalling.
The US has sought to mediate, holding meetings as recently as Sunday, though those talks ended without tangible results.</p><small>2026-01-08 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08225814213e1da.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965801/at-imrans-zaman-park-residence-ttap-chief-calls-for-protests-on-feb-8' target='_blank'><strong>At Imran’s Zaman Park residence, TTAP chief calls for protests on Feb 8</strong></a><br><p>Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai on Thursday urged political leaders and workers to take to the streets and observe a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike, while talking to reporters outside Imran’s Zaman Park residence.
A TTAP delegation, led by Achakzai, departed from Islamabad to Lahore earlier today as part of the opposition’s “street movement” to hold political and social gatherings in the provincial capital.
“Slogans alone will not help release PTI founder Imran Khan from jail, but people rising up on February 8 and bringing the country to a standstill will,” he said.







The TTAP chief — flanked by Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Opposition Leader in the Punjab Assembly Moeen Riaz Qureshi — was speaking to the media after the arrival of the opposition alliance’s caravan in Lahore.
They faced obstacles such as interference by law enforcement agencies, vandalism of vehicles belonging to party leaders and supporters, and even arrests.







Achakzai said people from Bajaur to KP should come out on the roads on Febuary 8 and participate in the ‘Aman March’, holding black flags to show that they have come out to end oppression and fascism in the country.
He stressed that those who cannot join the rallies should sit in their streets as a mark of protest.
Acknowledging that the police allowed the caravan to reach Lahore, Achakzai urged them to act in the interest of Pakistan and not to satisfy the “ego of one person or family”.
“Obey orders that are aligned with the law,” he stressed, lamenting that it was wrong to attack people for raising slogans.







Answering a question about the dialogue process, Achakzai said the path to dialogue would open when the country shuts down on Feb 8.
“Whom should we engage in dialogue with? They (federal government) snatched our mandate, the courts snatched the PTI’s election symbol, and sentenced political leaders and workers to 10 to 20 years in jail,” he said.
“We have come to Lahore, urging people to join hands, to end the oppression being unleashed against innocent people in the country,” Achakzai added.
“We are not against [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif or [President] Asif Zardari, but we stand against those political parties and state institutions desecrating the Constitution of Pakistan,” he said.
He also regretted that the party, which raised slogans “roti, kapra aur makan” (bread, clothes and a home) was “busy damaging the Constitution through the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments”.
“Now people are not getting food, farmers are not getting the due price of their produce, and investors and youth are running out of the country,” the TTAP chief lamented.
Stating that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had also marched on GT Road and raised the slogan “vote ko izzat do” (respect the vote), Achakzai urged the Sharif family to come out on the roads and raise this slogan again.
The TTAP chairman said the country would be saved and progress would be made when the Constitution of Pakistan is restored and justice is dispensed.
Abbas said that no justice could be dispensed without restoring the rule of law in the country. He lamented that the government had ruined departments and institutions, and added that he saw lawlessness displayed on the GT Road while travelling to Lahore.
“The incumbent rulers wanted to prolong their rule by terrorising people,” he claimed, adding that people should stand against oppression and “defeat the fascists”.
“We have come out on the roads to save the country from the fascists,” he said.
PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik has instructed the party’s lawyers wing to lodge first information reports against police raids, which violated people’s privacy in their homes and damaged property, including vehicles in police stations.
TTAP convoy reaches Lahore
The TTAP convoy entered Lahore earlier today, with the alliance claiming that several of its workers were detained by the Punjab police.
“Despite all the fascism, oppression and barbarism, the caravan of the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan has successfully reached Lahore,” PTI’s Punjab chapter said on X at 7:32pm.







In a subsequent post, it said the convoy was heading towards the Zaman Park residence of jailed PTI founder Imran Khan, where Achakzai and TTAP Senior Vice-Chairman Allama Raja Nasir Abbas were expected to address the media.
“The Lahore administration has placed containers to shut off [routes to] Data Darbar,” the TTAP said on X.







Workers taken into custody, cars vandalised: TTAP
At 3:34pm, the TTAP claimed “dozens” of workers of the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) — a part of the alliance — were arrested in Lahore, including Senior Vice President Syed Hussain Kazmi.
Dawn has reached out to the police for a comment on TTAP’s claims of PTI and MWM workers being arrested.
The PTI, in a statement condemning the “fascism and oppression by the Punjab police”, also claimed that “multiple members of delegations present peacefully along the route of the caravan” were being taken into custody.
“Peaceful citizens and party workers, who are unarmed and pose no threat of any kind, are being subjected to extremely brutal behaviour by the fascist police acting on political orders,” it alleged.
The party further said that the vehicles of its MPAs Malik Fahad, Tanveer Aslam Raja and Sardar Muhammad Ali were vandalised at Kharian.
“Our ticket holders, organisational officials and workers were arrested at the location of Gujar Khan,” the PTI statement further said.
Shortly before noon, the TTAP alleged that the Punjab police had arrested “several” PTI workers and had taken action against its camp in Rawalpindi’s Gujar Khan.
It also shared videos showing a police van from the Gujar Khan station and men in police attire carrying batons.







In its statement, the PTI also alleged that late-night raids were being carried out on the residences of its workers in Lahore, “as a result of which, worker Rashid Yousuf Jan lost his life during a raid in the area of Hanjarwal”.
The PTI demanded that all “unjustly arrested” individuals be immediately released and that those responsible for these “unconstitutional and illegal actions” be held accountable.







The TTAP also claimed that Senator Abbas’s son was taken into custody.
“Right after the arrest, police officials expressed ignorance and took the stance that he was not in their custody,” the statement added.
However, a Gujranwala police official denied the arrest.
He told Dawn that Abbas’s son was “stopped for questioning when a car of a PTI rally hit a police constable”, but was then allowed to go ahead.



PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser strongly condemned the vandalism of the TTAP convoy’s vehicles by “masked individuals”, terming the Punjab government “fascist”.
“In our opinion, Mian sahib (Nawaz Sharif), who used to harp on about democracy and consider himself a champion of democracy, [why] is he silent on this?” Qaiser asked, adding that Achakzai was among the PML-N president’s “old friends”.







PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik, in a statement, urged party lawyers to get first information reports (FIRs) registered over the vandalism incidents and “invasion of privacy” through raids.
In a post, the PTI said: “Protesters were first surrounded and stopped, vehicles were attacked, windshields were broken, and when a peaceful protest was staged, violence was perpetrated against unarmed citizens.”
It also shared multiple videos, one of which showed at least six cars whose back windshields were damaged.
The PTI said the “direct responsibility of this action lies with Punjab’s TikToker chief minister and the government elements involved with her”.







‘Setting out to end oppression and cruelty’
A post by the TTAP on X at around 11am said that the delegation led by Achakzai had left for Lahore.







In a video before his departure to Lahore, Achakzai said, “We are not going to Lahore to conquer, curse at anyone or throw rocks at them; our slogan is that we are setting out to end oppression and cruelty.”
Achakzai, who has been nominated as the next opposition leader in the National Assembly, called on the public to stand with the opposition against a Parliament “thrust upon” Pakistan.
The TTAP chief stressed that the country was suffering from “endless issues because of ill-intended decisions”.
“The government itself knows that it is invalid,” Achakzai said.
“In this regard, the TTAP has appealed to people from all walks of life to protest on Feb 8 and come stand with us,” he said, calling on people to “close their shops, rickshaws, and taxis”.
“We are starting a peaceful movement and we are here to end oppression,” he reiterated.







Standing alongside Achakzai was the opposition leader of the Punjab Assembly, Moeen Qureshi, who extended his welcome to the TTAP chief.
“There are a lot of MPAs present here who will accompany Achakzai sahib to Lahore,” he said.
He warned Punjab authorities against treating the TTAP delegation the same way as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was treated during his visit to Lahore last month.
He also reiterated that the movement would be peaceful.
When the TTAP leaders reached Jhelum at around 1:30pm, Senator Abbas spoke to workers there and alleged that the people’s mandate had been stolen in the 2024 elections.
“There is economic exploitation now […] and the political crisis is intensifying. We have taken to the streets to end cruelty, […] for the fundamental rights of the people, for the poor, labourers, unemployed and farmers and for all those who are oppressed,“ he said, standing alongside Achakzai.
The senator said the alliance would take to the streets against “cruelty” across the country on February 8.







Malik, in a post on X in the morning, said that her party would accord a “grand welcome” to the TTAP members at nine locations along GT Road.
“This peaceful struggle is a struggle for the Constitution and the law,” the PTI’s Punjab chief organiser wrote.
In a post on TTAP’s X account, the alliance’s spokesperson, Hussain Yousafzai, termed the visit a “practice match for the larger movement”.
Yousafzai voiced optimism that the visit would give “hope to the PTI workers in Punjab”.







At a recent national conference organised by the TTAP alliance, KP CM Afridi had announced the observation of a “black day” at the national and international levels on Feb 8, which will mark the second anniversary of the general elections under which the existing parliament has been functioning.
The conference had also highlighted the need for a new Charter of Democracy — agreeing that the option of talks should never be closed — and put forth demands including an “independent” judiciary and election commission, as well as the release of “political prisoners”, which it believed were necessary for restoring stability in the country.
Meanwhile, as proposals for talks between the government and the opposition remain in limbo, a clique of politicians — under the banner of the ‘National Dialogue Committee’ (NDC) — on Wednesday called for the release of all political prisoners to reduce acrimony and pave the way for reconciliation.</p><small>2026-01-08 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08221427eac738e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965837/pakistan-muslim-countries-express-strong-condemnation-of-israeli-fms-visit-to-somaliland' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Muslim countries ‘express strong condemnation’ of Israeli FM’s visit to Somaliland</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and a wide selection of Muslim countries issued a joint statement on Thursday condemning a visit by Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to Somaliland earlier this week.
On Tuesday, Saar arrived in Somaliland for a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa.
The joint statement, issued by the Foreign Office (FO) today, was issued on behalf of the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Gambia, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Türkiye and Yemen, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
It recalled the earlier statement condemning Israeli recognition and “expressed strong condemnation” of the Israeli FM’s visit.
“The said visit constitutes a clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and undermines established international norms and the United Nations Charter,” the joint statement said.







It reaffirmed the 22 countries’ unwavering support for the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia and highlighted that “encouraging secessionist agendas are unacceptable and risk exacerbating tensions in an already fragile region”.
“Respect for international law, non-interference in [the] internal affairs of sovereign states, and adherence to diplomatic norms are essential for regional and international stability,” the joint statement added, commending Somalia’s commitment to peaceful international engagement, constructive diplomacy and international law.
The statement expressed the 22 countries’ commitment “in continuing to support diplomatic and legal measures taken by Somalia to safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity and stability in line with international law”.
It further stressed that Israel should respect Somalia’s sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity and honour its obligations in compliance with international law, further demanding that Tel Aviv immediately revoke its recognition of Somaliland.
Somaliland enjoys a strategic position on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa.
Israel became the first country to formally recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.
Last month, Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in rejecting Israel‘s recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.
The joint statement underscored their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of Somalia.
The statement added that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.</p><small>2026-01-08 17:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644026-illegal-pakistan-other-nations-condemn-israeli-officials-visit-to-somaliland' target='_blank'><strong>'Illegal': Pakistan, other nations condemn Israeli official's visit to Somaliland</strong></a><br><p>

They stated that a 30-year-old man and his 28-year-old wife were found dead inside a home in Lasi Goth with gunshot wounds.
Sohrab Goth Station House Officer Gul Baig told Dawn that the double murder appeared to be an ‘honour’ killing and said that the victims got married in Larkana district around six months ago.
“They moved to Karachi and were living in a rented house, where the girl’s relatives traced and allegedly shot them dead,” SHO Baig said. “The police called the Crime Scene Unit to collect evidence [and] the bodies were taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.”
Meanwhile, Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Javed Alam Odho took notice of the double murder in Sohrab Goth, spokesperson Syed Saad Ali said.
“The IG sought details of the incident from the DIG (Deputy Inspector General) East,” Ali said. “He also ordered the immediate arrest of the killers involved in the double murder.”
Last month, a couple who married with mutual consent was allegedly gunned down by the woman’s father in Machar Colony.
Docks police, in a statement, said that the male victim was gunned down while his wife was shot and injured by her father inside a home near Ayesha Masjid in Machar Colony.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2026-01-08 16:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08212510c3e2cd5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965825/negotiations-do-not-happen-in-jail-ptis-raja-says-talks-with-govt-will-not-happen-in-imrans-absence' target='_blank'><strong>‘Negotiations do not happen in jail’: PTI’s Raja says talks with govt will not happen in Imran’s absence</strong></a><br><p>PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said on Thursday that negotiations with the federal government would not take place if party founder Imran Khan is not present.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, Raja said that the party’s stance on talks is very clear: “You cannot come into our house, attack us, loot us and then invite us for negotiations.
“Give us an agenda, tell us what topics will be discussed,” he added. “We cannot negotiate in Imran Khan’s absence. You cannot expect to put him in a black hole while everyone else talks and the PM eats biscuits. It will not happen like that.”
Raja continued, recounting that between December 2024 and January 2025, they wanted to meet Imran and have him present at the talks, but that was not authorised.
He added that judicial probes into the riots on May 9, 2023, and the PTI’s Islamabad march on November 26, 2024, were also denied.
“The plan seems to be an effort to bury the attack on voters on February 8, 2024, and move on from it,” the party official claimed, referring to the date of the last general elections, which the PTI has repeatedly claimed were rigged.
When asked about whether talks would happen on January 12, as per Federal Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Raja replied that he was not aware of the date.
In response to another question about differing party views on talks, Raja emphasised that Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Imran’s sister Aleema Khan were on the same page.
“This past Tuesday, Achakzai sahib and Aleema were present outside Adiala jail. Together, they spoke with the press,” the secretary general replied.
“They’re saying the same thing: talks will only happen when the powers that be realise that the Pakistani people are tired of them and the system. It’s a system where people are struggling to find livelihoods, health and education. We need to express our displeasure.”
Raja further added that Achakzai had travelled from Islamabad to Lahore today for street mobilisation, but claimed that the TTAP chief was stopped several times along the route and several PTI workers had been arrested and “someone had died”.
“How can talks happen in this environment, if you are not willing to give even a little bit of political space?” he asked. “You have denied two distinguished gentlemen passage from Islamabad to Lahore and have turned Lahore into a battleground. And you want us to sit and talk?
“Negotiations do not happen in a graveyard or a jail, they require space.”
On December 23, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated his offer for talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.
Since then, the PTI has said that it would not come to the table, citing instructions from Imran. However, the TTAP opposition alliance, of which the PTI is a part, has stated its openness to talks.
Last week, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation.
“Two of them are my leaders, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif. The third is President Asif Ali Zardari, the fourth is [incarcerated PTI leader] Imran Khan, and everyone knows who the fifth is,” Sanaullah said.
In response to Sanaullah, PTI Chief Whip Malik Amir Dogar said the government should arrange a meeting between Achakzai, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, and the incarcerated PTI founder.
“Hopefully, a path will be made,” he added.</p><small>2026-01-08 16:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/081849501930ee9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965824/bangladesh-air-chief-discusses-enhancing-defence-cooperation-in-meetings-with-cdf-munir-naval-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh air chief discusses enhancing defence cooperation in meetings with CDF Munir, naval chief</strong></a><br><p>The air chief of Bangladesh on Thursday discussed avenues for enhancing defence cooperation with Pakistan in separate meetings with Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, and Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.
Bangladesh Air Force Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Hasan Mahmood Khan called on CDF Munir at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.
“During the meeting, matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence and military cooperation were discussed,” the statement read.
“Both sides underscored the importance of strengthening professional collaboration, training exchanges and defence ties between the Armed Forces of Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
According to the ISPR, ACM Khan lauded the “professionalism of Pakistan Armed Forces and appreciated their contributions towards regional peace and stability”.
CDF Munir reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to fostering enduring defence relations with Bangladesh. The ISPR said the meeting reflected the “longstanding and strong bonds between the two brotherly countries”.



Separately, ACM Khan called on Admiral Ashraf at the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad, the ISPR said.
“​During the meeting, matters of mutual professional interest, evolving regional security paradigm, and avenues for further strengthening bilateral defence cooperation were discussed,” the ISPR said about their meeting as well.



​ACM Khan “acknowledged the high professional standards of Pakistan Navy and expressed his desire to enhance collaboration between the two brotherly nations’ armed forces”, the ISPR said.
“The dignitaries agreed on the importance of increasing the frequency of high-level exchanges and joint training exercises to foster greater synergy.”
The naval chief highlighted the Pakistan Navy’s commitment to regional maritime peace and stability through its various initiatives.
The Bangladeshi air chief is leading a high-level defence delegation during his visit to Pakistan.
He met with his Pakistani counterpart on Tuesday, wherein both air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, ISPR said.

 

​The ISPR highlighted that ACM Khan’s visit underscored the “deepening defence ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh, following the significant” visit of Admiral Ashraf to Dhaka in November 2025.
During his visit to Bangladesh, Admiral Ashraf had met with Dhaka’s senior military leadership and discussed avenues to bolster defence cooperation, the Navy had said.
It had termed his trip, which also encompassed visits to the National Defence College and the Bangladesh Naval Academy, a “milestone”.</p><small>2026-01-08 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08165933b70f6c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965818/in-quetta-pm-shehbaz-stresses-brotherhood-and-cooperation-with-provinces-especially-those-facing-challenges' target='_blank'><strong>In Quetta, PM Shehbaz stresses ‘brotherhood and cooperation’ with provinces, especially those facing challenges</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Thursday that it is the government’s duty to work with provinces, especially those which are experiencing challenges, stressing the need for “brotherhood and cooperation”.
The premier said this while addressing political leaders in Quetta, where he also announced the launch of several development projects worth billions of rupees in the province’s education and infrastructure sectors.
PM Shehbaz began his address by stating it was unfortunate that Balochistan had been grappling with terrorism, and added that the role of the armed forces in combating terrorism could not be appreciated enough.
“Be it the soldiers and officials of the army, Rangers personnel and officials, or those of Levies, and the common man, their sacrifices will be remembered in history,” PM Shehbaz said.
He said the fight against terrorism was ongoing and Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan — were being provided support from our “neighbouring countries, which is unfortunate”.
“But, we are firm in our resolve to eradicate terrorism,” he said, lauding CDF for leading this fight.
In this connection, he also mentioned the CDF’s role during the military conflict with India in May last year, adding that India had been “taught a lesson which it will never forget”.
Speaking about Balochistan’s share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, the premier recalled that in 2010, the then-Balochistan chief minister, Nawab Aslam Raisani, had refused to cooperate unless the province received a 100 per cent increase in its resources.
“Balochistan is a beautiful part of Pakistan, and their demand was valid to an extent,” the premier said, adding that it was “obvious that more resources would be needed considering the vast distances within the province”.
He recalled that to “fulfil their demand, Punjab took the lead”.
“It was our duty to our Baloch brothers and sisters, and the resources in the NFC award are being disbursed in the same way till this day,” he said.
“Punjab cut Rs11bn a year from its share and sent it to Balochistan,” he added.
He continued: “Today, 16 years have passed since the NFC award, and nearly Rs200bn have been given from Punjab’s own share.”
“Because when it comes to family, you sit and make decisions like brothers,” PM Shehbaz said, stressing that “distances between provinces must be bridged”.
He further said that the government was building five Danish Schools in Balochistan at the same time,“ hoping that the move will lead to a decline in terrorist elements taking root in the province.
“This is our duty: to work with provinces — especially those that are very distant and experiencing challenges — this is the journey of brotherhood and cooperation which we all have to take,” the premier reiterated.
“There are no two ways to go about it,” PM Shehbaz stressed.
He also maintained that “nobody could match the steps taken by my brother Nawaz Sharif, for the progress and prosperity of Balochistan“.
The PM expressed willingness to work with the chief minister of Balochistan, the governor.
“We have to work together where there are challenges and come to the table to find solutions, ” the prime minister said.
While in Quetta, PM Shehbaz announced that five Daanish schools would be opened to provide quality education, while an Rs300 billion project to build the Chaman-Karachi Highway was also unveiled, state broadcaster Radio Pakistan reported.
The broadcaster also reported that the prime minister received a briefing on ongoing development projects from Balochistan Governor Jaffar Khan Mandokhel.</p><small>2026-01-08 15:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08182835ad9ba5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965823/only-bilateral-dispute-with-kabul-is-terrorism-emanating-from-afghan-soil-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Only ‘bilateral dispute’ with Kabul is terrorism emanating from Afghan soil: FO</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office (FO) said on Thursday that Islamabad had no “bilateral dispute” with Kabul other than terrorism emanating from Afghan soil.
“We do not have any bilateral dispute with Afghanistan except for this one issue. Terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is a major issue. So we need verifiable assurances, commitments that these acts will be stopped,” said FO spokesperson Tahir Andrabi during the weekly briefing in Islamabad.
The FO spokesperson also reiterated Pakistan’s longstanding demand for Kabul to take concrete and verifiable actions against those involved in terrorism against Pakistan from the Afghan territory.
During the briefing, the spokesperson clarified that Islamabad “does not wish to be hostile to Afghanistan” and Pakistan’s demand to Afghanistan “is very simple”.
The spokesperson reiterated Pakistan’s demand for written assurances from the Afghan Taliban that the neighbouring country’s soil would not be used by Fitna-al-Khawarij — the term the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“And this demand will stand unless we get concrete, verifiable, written assurances from the Afghan side that their soil will not be used. If this terrorism issue is resolved by Afghanistan, we have tremendous potential for improving bilateral relations,“ said Andrabi, adding that the landlocked country could become a hub for regional connectivity.
“The potential of such projects is immense, and it needs to be realised once we have those written commitments on terrorism from Afghanistan. Such commitments from Afghanistan are in the interest of its own country. This is a legal demand and could be fulfilled. This could lead to improvement in all bilateral relations,” the FO spokesperson elaborated.
The FO spokesperson’s statement comes as tensions between Islamabad and Kabul continue, mainly centred on Islamabad’s demand that Kabul take measures to end cross-border terrorism, which remains unfulfilled.
Pakistan, which has accused the Afghan Taliban of harbouring terrorists, carried out cross-border strikes in Afghanistan in October last year, following multiple casualties among its security forces and law enforcement personnel in terror attacks.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
Eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue with the mediation of Qatar and Turkey, but the talks failed to bring about any workable solution.
More recently, the military’s spokesperson termed the Afghan Taliban during a press conference on January 6 “the mother organisation” that he said had been harbouring such groups since 2021.
Pak-China-Afghan trilateral
During Thursday’s briefing, the spokesperson also said Islamabad would continue leveraging the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral foreign ministers’ dialogue, which showed the positivity with which Pakistan had approached the issue of Afghanistan.
But, he said, this positivity was “linked to the concrete, verifiable and written assurances from the Afghan side that their soil will not be used by terrorist elements” operating against Pakistan.
Pointing out that the Afghan side was not willing to give the verifiable and written assurances, he said, “Despite that, Pakistan wishes to engage with Afghanistan as diplomatic channels are open“.
“The embassy and consulates are functioning, and routine diplomatic exchanges take place.”</p><small>2026-01-08 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643987-field-marshal-reaffirms-pakistans-commitment-to-fostering-defence-ties-with-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal reaffirms Pakistan's commitment to fostering defence ties with Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>

Sources in Bannu police told Dawn that the vehicle, which belonged to Hangu police and was carrying prisoners for court appearances, came under fire at Domel Link Road.
A source in the Bannu Central Jail’s administration also confirmed this to Dawn, saying that the prisoners were being transported for court hearings as per routine. The vehicle was attacked on the way to the court, the source said.
Sources in Bannu police said the vehicle’s driver changed route and reached Karak following the incident.
The sources said two of the injured cops were being provided medical treatment at the district headquarters hospital in Karak, adding that Hangu District Police Officer Khanzaib Mohmand also visited the injured personnel at the hospital.
Separately, Karak police confirmed to Dawn that total three cops had sustained injuries in the incident.
Meanwhile, an investigation into the attack is under way and security in the area has been beefed up, according to police sources.

 

In recent days, multiple attacks targeting law enforcement personnel have been reported from various parts of KP.
On January 4, a policeman was martyred in firing by unidentified attac­kers in the Kashfi Khel area of Bannu.
The martyred constable Rashid Khan was leaving his home for work on Sunday morning when some armed assailants, who were on a motorcycle, opened fire, killing him on the spot.
Last month, five cops were injured after terrorists launched a late-night attack on a police checkpost in the Shaikh Landak area of Bannu.</p><small>2026-01-08 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08150342f86632f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965815/pti-takes-offence-to-being-labelled-terrorist-facilitators-says-there-should-be-no-politics-on-the-issue' target='_blank'><strong>PTI takes offence to being labelled ‘terrorist facilitators’, says there should be no politics on the issue</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Thursday took strong exception to being labelled “terrorist facilitators”, saying the party had always maintained that there should be no politics on the issue.
The remarks from the party came during a press briefing held in Islamabad by party chairman Gohar Ali Khan, and party leaders Salman Akram Raja and Asad Qaiser.
In his remarks, Gohar said, “The PTI’s stance has always been that terrorism is a menace and it is a national responsibility to eliminate it from its roots.
“Our stance has always been that there should be no politics on terrorism. In fact, we need a singular stance and narrative on terrorism,” he said, adding that the party and its leadership had always condemned terrorism.
“To say that the PTI and its government in KP is uncooperative is inappropriate and far from the truth,” he said, highlighting that a grand jirga was held on the matter in the province in October.
“Terrorists do not have a religion, nationality or boundaries. They do not differ between men and women. They attack our mosques, Eidgahs and we condemn each and every attack,” he said.
He said that at this time it was “inappropriate and dangerous” to ask why the PTI was not targeted by terrorists.
“We believe that any time someone comes under a terrorist attack, the whole of the country is targeted,” he said.
“If tackling terrorism requires a more serious approach, then the support of Twitter and press conferences should not be taken for levelling allegations. Present your argument at the relevant forums,” he said.
He further stated that the PTI government in KP had increased the capacity of the province’s police force and also spent Rs40 billion for this purpose.
Gohar said the top priority of the PTI and its government in KP was protecting the life and property of its people. “And there can be no compromise on this, nor has there been,” he said.
“Despite that, blaming us, doing press conferences and targeting us is making the rift wider and wider, which is harmful for the nation at this time,” he asserted.
“This should be avoided,“ he said.
“I am hoping that next time we will not feel the need to hold such a press conference. And I also hope that no press conference will be held against us either,” he said.
Raja, speaking at the press conference, also termed the allegations “unfortunate” and stressed that Imran and PTI were “not terrorist sympathisers”.
“Only a fool would sympathise with terrorists,” Raja maintained.
Addressing the allegations levelled at PTI on the matter of military operations, Raja held, “We stand with the people of Pakistan and can not accept the displacement and martyrdom of innocent people.”
He said that the PTI had always offered to “work in cooperation in deciding the action plan”.
Raja spoke about the grand jirgah in KP, where he said “all political parties, scholars, and intellectuals from KP, unanimously agreed that the current policy on counter-terrorism was wrong”.
“Bombs and explosives can not create the conditions for peace,” he reiterated.
Raja believed that the state’s priority should be to “bridge the gap between people in KP and state institutions”, stressing that PTI was the only party which could help bridge this “gap“.
“PTI can bring people and institutions together for a national purpose,” he added.
Raja said that PTI’s main proposal was that “we sit down and talk,“ stressing that until the “gap” is not addressed, the future will remain “unstable”.
In that regard, he urged that the party representative of the people in KP — PTI — can not be isolated in matters relating to policies on counter-terrorism.
Raja also maintained that “no negotiation — whether about terrorism or any other matter — could be done while keeping Imran Khan out” of the process.
Qaiser also spoke about the grand jirgah and said it was “unanimously decided that any policy the Centre brings should be made in consultation with the provincial assembly“.
He noted that there has been a “rise” in terrorism in the recent past and called into question the current counter-terrorism policies.
“If your policy has consistently failed, then it is time that you should review it, revisit it and adopt a policy which can help eliminate the issue”.
He assailed the Centre for “not providing KP funds for the development of its people“.
He stressed that such an attitude “serves to foster bitterness”.
Qaiser asserted that PTI was the “largest party in the country” and claimed that it was being “crushed”.
“We are not being allowed to hold rallies, which is our constitutional right and on top of that, a campaign is being run against us,” Qaiser added.
Qaiser, holding up a written statement issued after the grand jirgah, said, “This right here is our main stance“.
He read: “The peace jirgah condemns terrorism in KP and its merged districts and […] Every resource should be used in consultation with the provincial assembly and within the ambit of the law, to eliminate terrorism and ensure the establishment of peace in KP.
“Resolutions passed by the KP Assembly on the security situation and counter terrorism policies should be acted upon“.
He further said, “No party in KP has remained safe from terrorism.”
Some of the key demands made by the KP peace jirgah in October were taking the provincial government on board before making any decision regarding peace in KP and resolving the differences between the federal and provincial governments for the larger public interest.
The PTI press conference comes after the military’s spokesperson, in a wide-ranging press briefing accused a political party in power in Pakistan in 2021 — ostensibly referring to the PTI — of “internally facilitating terrorists”.
‘Decision on talks to be taken by Achakzai and Allama Nasir’
Barrister Gohar, in response to a question regarding the possibility of talks between the PTI and the government, said, “As we speak, no dialogue is being held with anyone — either the establishment or the government”.
However, he added that “whether there is going to be a dialogue or not and whether it will be with the government or the establishment, Khan sahib has given the mandate to decide about this only to Achakzai sahib and Allama Nasir Abbas”.
Raja also responded to the question, reiterating his earlier stance that there can be no dialogue without Imran.
“We did this before as well […], but nothing came of it,” he said, stressing that “any dialogue without Khan sahib’s opinion would be meaningless”.
On the matter of the appointment of the opposition leader in the National Assembly, Barrister Gohar said, “We were supposed to meet the speaker today, but then we found out that he has gone to Quetta, so we could not meet”.</p><small>2026-01-08 13:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643974-pm-shehbaz-reaffirms-resolve-to-eradicate-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reaffirms resolve to eradicate terrorism</strong></a><br><p>

Goraya made the remarks while addressing a joint press conference alongside Balochistan Additional Chief Secretary Hamza Shafqaat in Quetta, where he gave details about a terrorist arrested during an operation in Panjgur.
According to Goraya, the CTD, police and law enforcement agencies arrested a man, Sajid Ahmad alias Shahwaiz, who was a resident of Turbat during the operation.
He said the man had received a Master’s degree in Sociology from the International Islamic University in Islamabad, then worked on contract at Zubaida Jalal Government College for three years, before teaching at the University of Turbat.
The CTD DIG said Sajid had “remained with BYC and was in constant communication with its leadership”.
“One thing that has surfaced prominently is the role of the BYC. Every man or child who is facilitating or [is involved in] what they call a sharing network or intelligence network […] they are somehow linked to the BYC,“ the CTD DIG said.
“Besides Sajid, we have also arrested three others against whom we are registering FIRs (first information reports),” Goraya added.
He said that one of them was 18-year-old Sarfaraz, who was a resident of Kharan and had been tasked with conducting a recce of the police and their polio duties.
“He was also first made to join the BYC, involved in their protests and roadblocks,” the CTD official said, adding that the person who inducted him into BYC was Jahanzaib alias Mehrbaan, aged 20 years.

 

Jahanzaib “not only remained involved in recce but also transportation, including one instance where he transported Rs0.6million of extortion money from Quetta and another when he transported Rs1m, as well as medicines”, DIG Goraya said.
He further said that Jahanzaib had been involved in BYC’s roadblocks in Noshki and Kharan. “He participated in the BYC’s so-called missing persons protests and properly organised who to bring and what to post on social media,” the DIG said.
According to Goraya, Jahanzaib also “inducted” 18-year-old Bezan into the BYC, following which he joined the so-called Baloch Liberation Army (BLA).
Bezan’s brother Shafqat Yar was killed in firing when the Levies force was attacked in Khad Kocha, DIG Goraya said. “He (Bezan) was first inducted into BYC, then he went into BLA.”
“All these are those people and children who were subverted, and their minds were used to take them to the other side and assigned these small tasks,” he said.
“Fitna al-Hindustan, they say we do not induct children, we do not use women or children, but again and again we have said — even today we are telling you with evidence — that they first use the platform of BYC and then they take them forward by using children,” the DIG stated.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Goraya said there was a “proper network being run that depends on underage children, as they are not thoroughly checked when going to schools and colleges“.
“We must bring these things into their parents’ knowledge,” he stressed, adding that such youngsters would be taken to internment and rehabilitation centres that were being established in Quetta and Turbat, “so we can check how much their minds have been subverted”.
“We will hold dialogue with them, provide psychological treatment, and involve their parents and society’s notables. We will take them ahead as an improved, responsible citizen,” the CTD DIG said.
He said the terrorists subverted educated people, who had even remained on the government’s payroll, and through them, “many children and students — innocent minds who do not have a sense of what to do — they recruit them to BYC first to brainwash them and then properly induct them into the organisation”.
In a joint press conference held with provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind in April last year, DIG Goraya had questioned the legitimacy of BYC, later stating that it is not a registered organisation.
The same month, when a protest drive had paralysed the province, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti termed BYC activists as “abettors” of separatists.
Sajid involved with BLA, BLF
According to DIG Goraya, Sajid, who was apprehended from Panjgur, had been involved with the BLA and the banned Baloch Liberation Front (BLF).
“Their sharing network includes recce of different locations in Turbat by marking them on Google Earth, which he shared with his commander Dostain in our neighbouring country.”
The CTD complex, roads going to and from the Turbat airport, and an under-construction high court were among the locations where Sajid allegedly carried out reconnaissance.
Goraya detailed that the items recovered from Sajid’s vehicle when he was apprehended included a rocket-propelled grenade, five rockets, two M-16 rifles with 23 magazines and 800 rounds, 20 hand grenades with 22 fuses, 30 C4 explosive slabs, one jacket, remote controls, 13 UBGL rounds, a compass, helmets and 30 feet of detonating cord.
Sajid was heading from Panjgur towards Turbat, the officer said.
“Not only did [Sajid] share things with them (BYC), but also remained involved in writing subversive literature for them and also posted it on different social media websites and carried out recruitment,” the DIG said.
“Other than that, on motivation, Balaj joined BYC, Jalal joined BYC, Hamal joined too, and Hamal also properly joined BLA and remained in contact with him (Sajid).
“He (Hamal) also went with him (Sajid) to meet Dostain in our neighbouring country using different routes.”
According to DIG Goraya, forensics of Sajid’s mobile phone revealed that a “lot of material of smuggling, also known as Zambad, also came with him, even to the extent of extremely sophisticated weapons, equipment, which were brought through those Zambad and given to their members”.
The CTD official said Sajid’s sister-in-law had also been a part of BYC and houses were acquired under her name to dump and transport materials from there.
‘100 persons abroad conspiring against Pakistan’
Meanwhile, the additional chief secretary said a “Red Notice Cell has been activated”, which included the prosecutor general and officials of the CTD and the home department.
“They have prepared lists. There are more than 100 people who are abroad and conspiring against Pakistan, promoting and sponsoring terrorist activities in Pakistan, lobbying and doing propaganda,” Shafqaat said.
He noted that a court order was needed to forward any person’s name to Interpol.
The official explained that to issue a “red notice” for someone, the Balochistan government would first file a charge sheet in the court, which would then declare the person as a proclaimed offender, after which the government would approach the interior ministry to take the process forward.

 

Shafqaat stated that the federal and provincial governments were arranging for more funds to strengthen the CTD.
He highlighted that one of the “biggest successful steps” taken in 2025 by the provincial government was the establishment of Provincial Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre (Piftac), which has been fully functional since December.
“We will now establish it on the district level. We are hopeful that by March, all our intelligence and actions will be coordinated.”
“Detention centres have been established. Two amendments have been made in the Anti-Terrorism Act, and we will be launching faceless courts in two months,” Shafqaat said.</p><small>2026-01-08 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643932-pti-denies-allegations-of-non-cooperation-against-terrorism-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>PTI denies allegations of non-cooperation against terrorism in KP</strong></a><br><p>

Zalmay Khalilzad, who served as special representative to Afghanistan during the first Trump administration, tweeted on Wednesday that it was “a misunderstanding… to think that the agreement covered Afghanistan-Pakistan issues”.
In a post on his X account, he also attached the text of the agreement, which — among other things — contained a commitment to prevent the soil of Afghanistan being used by any group or individual against the security of the United States and its allies.
However, he posited that “a similar agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan… would serve the interests of both countries”.







Expanding on the idea, Mr Khalilzad said that the accord should be one “in which both countries commit to not allow any individual or group including ISIS and TTP to use its territories to threaten the security of the other, and in which they accept third party monitoring of such.”
“Based on recent conversations with Taliban leaders, I believe they are prepared to negotiate such an agreement. And it could be game-changing for the relations between these two neighbours,” he wrote on X.
Mr Khalilzad, who has also facilitated negotiations between Kabul and Washington to secure the freedom of US citizens being held in Afghanistan, is viewed by both capitals as an invaluable interlocutor.
In Washington circles, Mr Khalilzad is viewed as a hawk. He openly sympathises with jailed PTI founder Imran Khan and has — in the past — reserved critical words for Pakistan.

According to a statement issued by the PIA spokesperson, the airline was enhancing its flights to the United Kingdom.
“After the resumption of flights to Manchester and the announcement of flights from Islamabad to London from March 29, the airline has also finalised arrangements for the launch of a direct flight from Lahore to London from March 30,” the spokesperson said.
He added it would operate up to seven flights to the UK by the end of March.
He added that flights were being increased in light of the high demand and long-standing requests of Pakistanis and expatriates residing in the UK.
“All flights to the UK are operating on full loads,” he added.
The relaunch dates of Islamabad-London and Lahore-London flights were arranged for consecutive dates driven by demand and the airline’s readiness, the spokesperson said.
The airline will operate flights three times a week from Islamabad to London and one flight a week from Lahore to London, he said, adding it was also planning to operate more flights from Pakistan to other UK destinations in the future, while flights to London would be increased gradually.
He said the airline used to operate more than “22 frequencies” to the UK and expected to exceed this number.
In June 2020, the European Union Air Safety Agency had barred PIA from operating in EU countries over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers. The ban on flights followed the then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament, where he termed pilots’ licences “dubious”.
The European agency lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28, 2024. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
In September 2025, PIA received the go-ahead to resume direct flights to the UK after a gap of nearly five years. Subsequently, the airline resumed flights to the UK, with flight operations to Manchester resuming in the first phase.
Two months ago, the airline announced it was resuming direct flights to London in March 2026 after a six-year hiatus.</p><small>2026-01-08 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643917-diplomatic-channels-active-contacts-ongoing-with-afghanistan-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Diplomatic channels active, contacts ongoing with Afghanistan: Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

The statement said CDF Field Marshal Munir made the remarks while addressing officers during a visit to Lahore Garrison. He also reaffirmed the military’s resolve to respond to evolving challenges with professionalism and determination, it added.
“He said the armed forces remained committed to safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and internal stability, while promoting discipline, excellence and selfless national service,” ISPR said.







During the visit, where he was received by the Lahore corps commander, CDF Field Marshal Munir was given a comprehensive briefing on the formation’s operational preparedness, training standards and key initiatives to enhance combat efficiency, it said.
The statement added that he witnessed a “specialised field training exercise showcasing the latest technologies, underscoring the army’s emphasis on innovation, adaptability to match the dynamic future battlefield”.
He also inspected sports and recreational facilities being provided to troops, highlighting their importance in maintaining physical fitness, morale, and overall well-being, it said.
CDF Field Marshal Munir also visited a care centre at Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Lahore, lauding the efforts of the medical staff and administration in establishing a fully equipped, state-of-the-art healthcare facility, it added.
The CDF‘s remarks come after the military’s spokesperson stated that Afghan­istan had become a hub of terrorists and non-state actors, declaring the ruling Taliban “the mother organisation” which had been harbouring such groups since 2021.
In a wide-ranging and marathon press conference, he also spoke at length about souring relations with Afghanistan, the belligerence being witnessed from India, as well as levelling criticism against the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Imran Khan, without explicitly naming the latter.
Last month, the army’s top leadership had also warned political forces against undermining national unity through agitation or rhetoric, besides vowing to deal sternly with what it described as India-sponsored proxies involved in terrorism.</p><small>2026-01-08 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643902-karachi-dhaka-direct-flights-to-resume-on-january-29-after-14-year-hiatus' target='_blank'><strong>Dhaka-Karachi direct flights to resume on January 29 after 14-year hiatus</strong></a><br><p>

A statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Pakistan Air Force Air (PAF) Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu called on Royal Saudi Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Turki bin Bander bin Abdulaziz and Saudi Armed Forces’ Chief of General Staff General Fayiadh bin Hameed Al-Rowaily during a visit to the kingdom.
“During the meetings, matters pertaining to bilateral defence cooperation, regional security environment and future avenues of collaboration were discussed,” it said.
It added that the Saudi defence leadership “praised the professionalism, operational excellence and combat readiness of [the] PAF and expressed strong interest in enhanced joint training and operational collaboration, particularly in the domain of multi-domain operations“.
“They also appreciated Pakistan’s constructive role in promoting regional peace and stability,” it added.
“Both sides expressed satisfaction over the existing level of cooperation and agreed to further enhance engagement through joint training, operational collaboration and exchange of professional expertise, while highlighting the Pakistan–KSA Defence Agreement as a symbol of mutual trust and enduring brotherly relations,” the statement added.
It said ACM Sidhu highlighted during the exchanges the “historic and fraternal ties between the two countries and reiterated his commitment to strengthening military-to-military cooperation through bilateral and multilateral exercises”.
He also underscored the transformation of the PAF into a robust multi-domain force, integrating space, cyber, electronic warfare and artificial intelligence capabilities, demonstrated through its operational performance.
It further stated that the ACM’s visit “underscores the depth of the enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and reflects the shared commitment of both nations to further strengthen cooperation in the defence and aviation sectors”.
The visit comes as reports emerge about talks between the two countries to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal.
A day ago, Reuters reported a source as saying that discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced by the former.
The report quoted another source as saying that the jets were the primary option among others under discussion.
“The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion,” the report stated.
The development was reported months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.</p><small>2026-01-08 08:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/08125002589cd5a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965805/direct-bangladesh-pakistan-flights-to-resume-after-14-years' target='_blank'><strong>Direct Bangladesh-Pakistan flights to resume after 14 years</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh and Pakistan are to resume direct flights after more than a decade, Dhaka’s national airline said on Thursday.
Biman Bangladesh Airlines is scheduled to fly its first Dhaka-Karachi flight on January 29 and will be operated twice weekly, the first regular flights since 2012.
“We are relaunching the Dhaka-Karachi route with two weekly flights,” airline manager Bosra Islam told AFP on Thursday.
“The resumption of direct flights will significantly improve connectivity between Bangladesh and Pakistan, supporting business travel, tourism, and family reunions,” Biman Bangladesh Airlines said in a statement.
Travellers between Bangladesh and Pakistan must currently use connecting flights through Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha.
Cargo ships had resumed sailing from Karachi to Bangladesh’s key port of Chittagong in November 2024.
Last month, Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider had expressed the hope that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka would start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus.
Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly.
Recently, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq travelled to Dhaka for the funeral of the country’s first female prime minister Khaleda Zia in December.
