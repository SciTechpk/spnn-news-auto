Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com, “As per the family and the police record, the 19-year-old girl married in Lyari on June 15. She is now in a coma. Her physical examination findings are consistent with sexual violence.”
According to the contents of the first information report (FIR) registered at the Baghdadi Police Station on July 5 under Sections 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) and 376-B (punishment for gang-rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code, the complainant, the brother of the victim, said that he was a resident of Shah Beg Lane in Baghdadi, Lyari.
“On the third day of her marriage, my sister was subjected to brutal sexual violence allegedly by her husband. She remained admitted at a private hospital in the city and was later taken to Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre of Civil Hospital Karachi in a critical condition the other day,” the FIR read.
The complainant said his 19-year-old sister married the suspect on June 15. Her health condition deteriorated on June 30, compelling the family to bring her back home. She informed the parents that on July 17, her husband subjected her to an “unnatural sexual act”, per the FIR.
It added that the husband also sexually assaulted her with a foreign object. Subsequently, the husband subjected her to sexual violence, leading to bleeding. As per the FIR, the suspect threatened his wife with “dire consequences” if she disclosed anything to anyone.
The complainant said the family took his sister to a private hospital on Garden Road when her condition deteriorated, but no improvement was seen. The in-laws again took the victim to their home. Later on, she was brought to the trauma centre on July 4, where she was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), the FIR said, adding that the complainant was seeking legal proceedings against the suspect.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that the suspect had been arrested and an investigation has been launched.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
Last week, police had said that they had arrested the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.
In May, two sisters were subjected to a sexual assault in their home in North Karachi, police and doctors had said.
In April, in a rare verdict, an additional district and sessions judge in Gujranwala handed down 10-year rigorous imprisonment to a man for subjecting his wife to an unnatural sexual offence.</p><small>2025-07-07 17:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07224213c4bf831.jpg?r=224218' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922604/armed-men-hijack-3-oil-tankers-abduct-7-in-kps-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>Armed men hijack 3 oil tankers, abduct 7 in KP’s Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>Armed men hijacked three oil tankers and abducted seven crew members from the Tuchi bridge area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Monday, according to the police.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, leaving both provinces in a state of uncertainty. The provincial security situation has also been plagued by lawlessness.
Bannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Khan Kulachi told Dawn.com: “The incident occurred near Marwat Canal in the Tuchi bridge area and a total of three oil tankers were hijacked and their seven crew members abducted” after the convoy was intercepted while coming from North Waziristan.
Kulachi said that a first information report was lodged at the Baka Khel Police Station and a search operation was being conducted in the area. He added that no one had claimed responsibility or contacted anyone of the abductees’ families for ransom.
Last week, at least one person was killed and three others were injured after armed assailants attacked a jirga in Bannu.
Earlier in the month, a police official embraced martyrdom when unknown armed motorcyclists opened fire on him near his house in Ghoriwala town of Bannu district.</p><small>2025-07-07 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07221008b7eb471.jpg?r=221500' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922611/trump-slaps-allies-japan-south-korea-with-25pc-tariffs' target='_blank'><strong>Trump slaps allies Japan, South Korea with 25pc tariffs</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Monday that he was slapping 25 per cent tariffs on Japan and South Korea, in his first letters to trading partners ahead of a deadline to reach a deal with Washington.
Trump had said on the weekend that starting from today, he would send a first batch of up to 15 letters to countries informing them that he would reimpose harsh levies that he had postponed in April.
In near-identically worded letters to the Japanese and South Korean leaders, Trump said the tariffs would apply from August 1 because their trading relationships with Washington were “unfortunately, far from reciprocal”.
Trump warned the countries, both key US allies in East Asia, of an escalation if they responded to the new US tariffs.
But he also said he was ready to modify levies “downwards” if Japan and South Korea changed their trade policies.
Japan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Sunday that he “won’t easily compromise” in trade talks with Washington.
Trump originally announced sweeping tariffs on world economies on what he called “Liberation Day” on April 2, claiming the United States was being “ripped off”. Amid market turmoil, Trump then suspended the initial tariffs for 90 days, a deadline that expires on Wednesday.
But the Trump administration has said that the duties will not “boomerang” back until August 1, apparently extending the deadline despite denials from officials.
While the Trump administration has signalled hopes of striking dozens of deals by early July — at one point boasting of “90 deals in 90 days” — there have been limited results so far.
Washington has unveiled pacts with only Britain and Vietnam, while the US and China agreed to temporarily lower tariff levels on each other’s products that earlier reached three digits.
Later, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that 12 other countries will also receive letters about the new tariffs.
“President Trump will also sign an executive order today delaying the July 9 deadline to August 1, so that the reciprocal tariff rates or these new rates … will be going out the door within the next month and those countries continue to negotiate with the US,” she said during a press briefing.
She added that “in the effort of transparency”, the letter will continue to be posted to Truth Social.
When asked about which other countries would receive letters, Leavitt told reporters to “keep your eyes on Truth Social”.
 


‘Change their tune’
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said there would be a number of deals coming up.
“We are going to have several announcements in the next 48 hours,” Bessent told CNBC in an interview today. “We’ve had a lot of people change their tune in terms of negotiations. So my mailbox was full last night with a lot of new offers, a lot of new proposals.”
There was no immediate response from the White House on whether Trump would formally extend the Wednesday deadline for the tariffs to snap back.
Asked about Trump’s letters, Bessent said these would inform partners of the tariff rate their products face when trading with the US unless they want to “come back and try to negotiate”.
Bessent told CNBC that he would “be meeting with my Chinese counterpart sometime in the next couple of weeks”. The two sides have so far held high-level talks in Geneva and London. But Washington and Beijing’s pause on tit-for-tat tariffs is due to expire in mid-August.
 


On whether he was disappointed in the number of trade deals achieved so far, Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro maintained that he is “happy with the progress we’ve had”.
“Every country that we run a major deficit with is fully engaged,” he told CNBC.
Trump has also threatened another 10pc tariff on countries aligning themselves with the emerging BRICS nations, accusing them of “Anti-American policies” after they slammed his duties at a summit.
For now, partners are still rushing to avert Trump’s tariffs altogether.
The European Commission said that EU chief Ursula von der Leyen had a “good exchange” with Trump on trade when the pair spoke on Sunday.</p><small>2025-07-07 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0722104031f737f.jpg?r=222806' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922612/president-zardari-appoints-chief-justices-of-high-courts' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari appoints chief justices of high courts</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari appointed the chief justices to the four high courts on Monday.
Letters from the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) last week said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court, Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court.
The JCP had held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.
Four identical notifications from the law ministry said that the president appointed the chief justices, with effect from the date they take their oath of office, under clause (1) of Article 193 of the Constitution.
Article 193 outlines the process for the appointment of high court judges.
The chief justices are likely to take the oath sometime this week. Sources had said the notifications were expected today and the top judges may take oath the following day.
President Zardari would administer the oath to Justice Dogar at the Presidency, while the chief justices of the other high courts would take the oath from the respective governors.</p><small>2025-07-07 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07194018e61dcf7.jpg?r=194706' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922600/iran-president-says-tehran-open-to-nuclear-dialogue-with-us-accuses-israel-of-assassination-attempt' target='_blank'><strong>Iran president says Tehran open to nuclear dialogue with US, accuses Israel of assassination attempt</strong></a><br><p>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said in an interview released on Monday that his country has “no problem” restarting nuclear talks with the United States, provided that trust can be reestablished between Washington and Tehran, and also accused Israel of attempting to assassinate him.
The remarks, made during an interview with US journalist and former Trump confidante Tucker Carlson, came less than a month after Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign on June 13 against Iran and the US struck the Islamic republic’s nuclear facilities.
The attacks took place days before Tehran and Washington were set to meet for a new round of nuclear talks, stalling negotiations that were aimed at reaching a deal over Iran’s atomic programme.
“We see no problem in re-entering the negotiations,” the Iranian president said. “There is a condition … for restarting the talks. How are we going to trust the US again?
“We re-entered the negotiations, then how can we know for sure that in the middle of the talks, the Israeli regime will not be given the permission again to attack us?”
 


Pezeshkian also said that Israel attempted to assassinate him after Tel Aviv’s strikes killed top military commanders and nuclear scientists.
“They did try, yes. They acted accordingly, but they failed,” Pezeshkian told Carlson in response to a question on whether he believed Israel had tried to kill him.
“It was not the US that was behind the attempt on my life. It was Israel. I was in a meeting … they tried to bombard the area in which we were holding that meeting,” he said, according to a translation of his remarks from Persian.
More than 900 people were killed in Iran during the conflict, according to the judiciary. The Israeli attacks drew waves of retaliatory drone and missile fire, killing 28 people in Israel, according to authorities.
‘Forever wars’
The 12-day war between Iran and Israel saw it, along with the US, launching strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. A ceasefire between Iran and Israel has held since June 24.
On June 16, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not rule out plans to assassinate Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying it would “end the conflict” after reports emerged at the time that US President Donald Trump had vetoed the move.
During the interview with Carlson, Pezeshkian accused Netanyahu of pursuing his “own agenda” of “forever wars” in the Middle East and urged the US not to be dragged into it.
“The US administration should refrain from getting involved in a war that is not America’s war, it is Netanyahu’s war,” he said.
“I believe the US president can guide the region and the world to peace and tranquillity, or, on the other hand, to lead it to forever wars,” Pezeshkian said.
When asked about giving up Iran’s nuclear programme, Pezeshkian reiterated that Tehran was not pursuing nuclear weapons, nor was it in the past.
“Netanyahu, since 1984, has created this false mentality that Iran seeks a nuclear bomb … and it has put it in the minds of every US president since then,” the Iranian president said.
“We have never been after developing a nuclear bomb … because this is wrong and in contrast to the religious decree which has been issued by his eminence, the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is religiously forbidden for us to go after a nuclear bomb.”
When asked if Americans should be afraid of Iran, Pezeshkian tried to dispel those fears and said it was “a very wrong impression” of Iranians.
“Iran has never invaded another country in the last 200 years,” he explained. He added that when Iranians chanted, “Death to the United States”, they did not mean “death to the people or officials of the United States”.
“They mean ‘death’ to crimes, atrocities, bullying, to the use of force and anyone who would become an accomplice in crimes perpetrated by others,” Pezeshkian stated.
Later, Pezeshkian said on X: “I told Tucker Carlson: While we were negotiating in good faith at the request of the US, Netanyahu dropped bombs — literally — on diplomacy.
“Israel torpedoed the talks and killed peace. The world should remember who derailed the process,” he wrote.
The Iranian president said that his country neither started the war nor wanted it to continue.
“From day one, our policy has been clear: unity at home, peace with our neighbours, and stability in the region,” Pezeshkian wrote. He noted that the US must choose between reining in Netanyahu or following him “into another forever war”, adding that only US President Donald Trump can stop Netanyahu.
Pezeshkian quoted Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as saying that American investors “are welcome in Iran”.

A citizen filed a first information report (FIR), dated July 6, at the Satellite Town Police Station and said that the incident occurred on July 6 at 4:30pm. The case was registered under Section 298(C) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC)  which criminalises certain acts by members of the Ahmadi community, including calling themselves Muslims or referring to their faith as Islam.
Muhammad Irfan, public relations officer to the Gujranwala city police officer, told Dawn.com: “The suspect has been arrested and sent to jail on judicial remand for seven days.”
The FIR said that the complainant saw the Ahmadi man distributing biryani at a langar and “identifying himself as a Muslim and speaking and acting like a Muslim.”
Langar refers to the tradition of distributing free food, often associated with religious institutions and charitable organisations.
The complainant stated that he called two people but “the suspect fled from the scene when he saw us.”
Referring to the Ahmadi man in the report, the complainant said that he could not perform the rituals of Islam.
Condemning the development, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman expressed hope that the government would annul the FIR.
 






Last month, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) asked the Punjab police chief to prevent the Ahmadiyya community from observing Islamic rituals on the occasion of Eidul Azha and take action against its members if found violating the law.
In a letter, the LHCBA said that the followers of other religions and sects — especially the Ahmadis — are neither legally nor religiously permitted to use Islamic symbols and practices.
In March, the Human Rights Com­­mission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it had observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on homes of families belonging to religious minorities, as well as their places of worship.
 
 

The HRCP also spoke of Ahmadis’ “arbitrary detention”, “desecration of their graves” and the “vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women” to forced conversion.
The report, titled Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24, said over 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy, as of October last year. It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadi community.
One of the key findings of the report said that disinformation on social media sparked most of the registered blasphemy cases.
HRCP observed an “increasing weaponisation of blasphe­­my laws against Ahmadis”, with cases often initiated by law enforcement officials themselves.</p><small>2025-07-07 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/072023081784dbb.jpg?r=203159' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922603/us-revokes-foreign-terrorist-designation-for-syrias-hayat-tahrir-al-sham' target='_blank'><strong>US revokes foreign terrorist designation for Syria’s Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked the foreign terrorist organisation designation for Al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, according to a State Department memo filed on Monday, a major step as Washington moves to ease sanctions on Syria.
The memo dated June 23 was signed by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and was published in a preview of the Federal Register before official publication on Tuesday.
 






The move comes a week after Trump signed an executive order terminating a US sanctions programme on Syria, to help end the country’s isolation from the international financial system and build on Washington’s pledge to help it rebuild after a devastating civil war.
“In consultation with the attorney general and the secretary of the Treasury, I hereby revoke the designation of Al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (and other aliases) as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” Rubio wrote in the memo.
 
 

Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, was previously Al-Qaeda’s Syria branch. In December, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa led the HTS, which, together with other rebels, conducted a lightning offensive that ousted Syria’s former president Bashar Al-Assad.
Sharaa’s HTS severed Al-Qaeda ties years ago and says it wants to build an inclusive and democratic Syria.
Syria’s foreign ministry had no immediate comment.
Sharaa and Trump met in Riyadh in May, where, in a major policy shift, Trump unexpectedly announced he would lift US sanctions on Syria, prompting Washington to significantly ease its measures.</p><small>2025-07-07 15:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07151603d0e906f.jpg?r=203829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922569/punjab-assembly-speaker-defends-seeking-disqualification-of-pti-mpas-says-gladly-accepts-criticism' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab Assembly speaker defends seeking disqualification of PTI MPAs, says ‘gladly’ accepts criticism</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan on Monday defended his recent move to seek the disqualification of 26 PTI MPAs for their “unparliamentary conduct”, saying he was fulfilling his responsibility to uphold the Constitution.
On June 27, the speaker ordered the suspension of 26 opposition MPAs for 15 sittings of the provincial legislature after their protests disrupted Chief Mi­­nister Maryam Nawaz’s speech and caused chaos in the house. Days later, he filed a disqualification reference with the Election Com­mission of Pakistan against them.
Out of those MPAs, 17 were listed as belonging to the Sunni Ittehad Council, which PTI-affiliated candidates joined last year after their party was deprived of its election symbol. At least eight others, however, were stated as PTI MPAs.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore today, Malik stressed that his responsibility was to uphold the Constitution and he did not discriminate against any party.
“I am someone who brings things into my domain. I will accept criticism wholeheartedly, but while doing the calculations, while having a conversation.”
 


The speaker questioned the criticism against him from the opposition and the media, which suggested that the speaker did not have the authority to file such a reference.
“Many credible names in journalism who have a biblical position, […] editorials were written as well that a Constitutional red line must be there, and not a party leadership red line,” Malik noted.
“It was also written that it is an extreme step,” the speaker added, apparently referring to a Dawn editorial.
“It was further written that jurists think that the speaker does not reserve the right to approach the election commission,” Malik said.
The speaker highlighted he wanted to address the matter and the relevant laws, considering “such a huge editorial was written [and] such respected people were voicing their opinion on the media, including anchorpersons”.
 
 

Malik emphasised he had always tried to present himself as a “custodian”, with an understanding of his Constitutional responsibilities.
“If, as a speaker, the opposition believes I am a custodian and must protect their rights, should I not also give the same right to the treasury benches to be heard, to speak? […] Is that not their right?”
The speaker strongly rejected the allegations that the move to disqualify the MPAs was a means of silencing the opposition, saying that he “prioritised every point of the opposition […] at every opportunity”. “I have given them their due.”
He asserted he made every effort to ensure the opposition members were given as much time as possible to speak and that their rights were respected, adding, “I am not a man who steals the right to representation in assemblies.”
Malik recognised the MPAs’ right to protest under the Constitution, but said that it did not override his rights: “You cannot say vandalism is your absolute right or obstructing the house is your absolute right.”
The PML-N leader stressed that this applied regardless of party affiliation.
Malik acknowledged that assemblies and parliaments often featured scuffles and raised voices, rejecting the notion that a speaker had to take a “draconian position” against these. However, he stressed the need for this fighting to have limits.
 
 

“I have been in this House for two decades,” Malik said, adding that during that period he had never heard a finance minister — of any government — make a budget speech without being met with “noise, budget books being torn, uproar in the assembly, even attacks on the finance minister”.
Ten Punjab MPAs, including six who were suspended, have been fined Rs203,550 each for allegedly damaging public property during the June 16 session, when opposition members had tried to interrupt the budget speech by Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman.
“Will a finance minister not be able to make a speech for 22 years?” Malik said.
“Will any leader of the House […] ever have the right to speak here? Will their freedom of expression here become [suppressed] and will only the expression of the ones causing an uproar be treated as the right to protest?
“Will this be the order of the day? Will this be a new normal?”
The speaker further said: “If the leader of the House wants to speak, even if he was [PTI Founder] Imran Khan, should my party members obstruct him? I don’t support this. I only recognise one point: that you have taken an oath, that you will uphold the proceedings of the assembly according to the rules.”</p><small>2025-07-07 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07164029fe72888.jpg?r=170035' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922576/army-chief-dismisses-factually-incorrect-claims-of-external-input-in-operation-bunyanum-marsoos' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief dismisses ‘factually incorrect’ claims of external input in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir on Monday dismissed Indian claims of Pakistan receiving external support in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent tensions with India, terming them “irresponsible and factually incorrect”.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally drop their guns.
Reuters reported that the deputy chief of India’s army alleged last week that China gave Islamabad “live inputs” on key Indian positions during the conflict. India fought two adversaries during the conflict, with Pakistan being the “front face” while China provided “all possible support”, Lieutenant General Rahul Singh had said at a defence industry event in New Delhi.
“When the DGMO (director general of military operations) level talks were going on, Pakistan … said that we know that your such and such important vector is primed and it is ready for action … he was getting live inputs from China,” he said. Singh did not elaborate on how India knew about the live inputs from China.
A statement issued by the Inter-Services Publications said that Field Marshal Munir addressed the matter today while speaking at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad.
He said that India’s “inability” to achieve its military objectives during Operation Sindoor and the subsequent claims signified “its lack of operational readiness and strategic foresight”.
“Insinuations regarding external support in Pakistan’s successful Operation Bunyanum Marsoos are irresponsible and factually incorrect and reflect a chronic reluctance to acknowledge indigenous capability and institutional resilience developed over decades of strategic prudence.
“Naming other states as participants in the purely bilateral military conflagration is also a shoddy attempt at playing camp politics and desperately trying that India remains the beneficiary of larger geopolitical contestation as the so-called net security provider in a region which is getting increasingly weary of its hegemonic and extremist Hindutva ideology.”
 






It further stated that “in contrast to India’s strategic behaviour resting on parochial self-alignment”, Pakistan had forged “lasting partnerships based on principled diplomacy, anchored in mutual respect and peace, establishing itself to be a stabiliser in the region”.
In his remarks, the army chief reiterated the country’s “principled stance”, warning that any misadventure or attempts to undermine national sovereignty or territorial integrity would be met with a “swift and resolute response”.
“Any attempt to target our population centres, military bases, economic hubs and ports will instantly invoke a ‘deeply hurting and more than reciprocal response’. The onus of escalation will squarely lie on the strategically blind arrogant aggressor who fails to see the grave repercussions of such provocative actions against a sovereign nuclear state,” the statement quoted him as saying.
“Wars are not won through media rhetoric, imported fancy hardware, or political sloganeering, but through faith, professional competence, operational clarity, institutional strength and national resolve,” the army chief concluded.
He lauded the armed forces and urged the graduating officers to remain steadfast in the values of integrity, selfless service, and unwavering commitment to the nation, the statement added.</p><small>2025-07-07 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07191532975f13f.jpg?r=193415' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922598/two-men-shot-dead-over-honour-in-karachis-mangophir-police' target='_blank'><strong>Two men shot dead over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Mangophir: police</strong></a><br><p>Two men were shot dead while a third one was injured over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Manghopir area on Monday, police said.
‘Honour’ killings refer to the murder of individuals, predominantly women and girls, by family members who believe the victim has brought “dishonour” upon the family.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
Manghopir police SHO Imran Ahmed Khan told Dawn.com, “The victim was in a relationship with a woman from their native town in Balochistan’s Bolan district.”
Khan added that the couple had arrived in Karachi about four days ago and were living with the man’s relatives near Gulshan Chowk in Mohammed Khan Colony.
He said as per the initial probe, the woman’s brother and other relatives traced the couple and shot the man along with his maternal uncle. Meanwhile, another maternal uncle was injured during the attack.
“Shaman, 25, and Ishaq Balach, 30, were killed, while Habibullah, 35, was injured,” SHO Khan said. “The suspects took the woman back to Balochistan after killing the two men.
He added that the bodies and the injured were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, and that the police were waiting for the victims’ heirs to lodge a first information report to initiate formal legal proceedings.
Last month, two men were shot dead while a third was injured in what police described as an ‘honour’ killing in Karachi’s Ittehad Town, while in a separate incident in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a young man was also killed for the same reason, according to an FIR.</p><small>2025-07-07 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612873-pakistanis-to-learn-from-dubais-governance-and-public-service-excellence-in-exchange-programme' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistanis to learn from Dubai's governance and public service excellence in exchange programme</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025. Terrorists in Balochistan, previously engaged in a low-level insurgency, have recently intensified their attacks. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) emerged as a key perpetrator of terrorist violence in Pakistan in 2024.
“Three personnel were injured in a blast targeting a patrolling vehicle of the highway police in Nasirabad’s Rabbi area,” Highway Police’s Senior Superintendent of Police Khadim Husain said.
He added that the incident took place when the highway police team was patrolling the area as per routine.
Citing preliminary reports, Husain said the blast was conducted through a remote-controlled device. The injured were immediately taken to a hospital in the Dera Murad Jamali town, located 12km from Rabbi, the SSP added.
“The police have initiated an investigation,” SSP Husain said.
In June, Pakistan witnessed a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).
 
 

Over a week ago, security forces killed two terrorists during an operation in Balochistan’s Duki district.
Earlier this month, security forces eliminated two “India-backed” terrorists after an attack on government offices in the Mastung district killed a teenager and injured seven others.
On June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat’s Mongochar area. In a separate attack in Kalat, a CTD officer was gunned down by unknown armed men, while a police official was among two killed in Mastung.
In May, four people were injured when unidentified motorcyclists threw a grenade at a house in Nasirabad. In March, Nasirabad police claimed to have foiled a sabotage attempt ahead of the Pakistan Day celebrations and seized explosives.</p><small>2025-07-07 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612867-sweden-announces-resumption-of-visa-services-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Sweden announces resumption of visa services in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier in the month, a meeting of top federal and provincial government officials discussed and stressed the need to revive the jirga system in the merged districts. A jirga is a traditional form of conflict resolution, primarily found in Pashtun societies of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where a council of male elders gathers to settle disputes based on local customs and traditions
The meeting discussed ways to promote an effective alternative justice system in tribal districts.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad along with other party leaders, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said: “In none of the committee meetings was reviving the jirga system discussed for the tribal areas, and after the 18th Amendment, that right was with the provincial government.
“After the 25th Amendment, when the tribal areas were merged with KP, the federal government no longer had the right to make a committee there.”
Former KP governor Shah Farman, MNA Iqbal Afridi, KP Finance Minister Aftab Alam Afridi, PTI central information secretary and MNA Sheikh Waqas Akram and others accompanied Gohar.
“I would like to thank the PTI chairman and other leadership for stopping the mines and minerals bill. When the federal govt got to know that this [bill] would be stopped, this is where this ruse started to gain access to the mines and minerals,” Iqbal said.
Meanwhile, the KP finance minister said, “Today, the (Ministry of States and Frontier Regions) Safron ministry called a meeting to interfere in the province’s issues, although after the merger, it is completely the provincial government’s right to legislate for the merged districts.
“We have a 2020 act for alternate dispute resolution, and we are trying to improve on it, but then why is the Safron ministry interfering in the province’s issues?”
He said that the increased share in the National Financial Commission award after the merger was also not provided by the federal government to KP.
In May, a multi-party conference organised by the Awami National Party rejected the proposed KP Mines and Minerals Act, 2025, declaring it a “clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan”.
The bill recommended the establishment of licensing and exploration sections at the directorate of the mines and minerals directorate, as well as a mines and minerals force in the province.
Though the bill provides for the protection of landowner rights and training and other opportunities for the local communities, it is silent about if those communities are to receive any share from the mining operations in their respective areas.</p><small>2025-07-07 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612865-vulnerable-citizens-urge-to-prepare-emergency-kits-amid-flood-warning' target='_blank'><strong>Flood warning: Vulnerable residents urged to prepare five-day emergency kits</strong></a><br><p>

Sweden in April 2023 indefinitely closed its embassy in Islamabad, citing the security situation as the reason. As a result, the Migration Section was unable to handle requests, nor could any documents be sent to consulates, Gerry´s, or applicants’ addresses.  “We understand that this will cause inconvenience; however, the safety of our applicants and staff members are of highest priority,” a notice placed on the embassy’s website had read at the time.
The embassy reopened in April this year, according to its website.
According to the FO, the Swedish and Pakistani foreign ministries held bilateral consultations in Stockholm on July 2, where the decision to resume visa services was announced by the Swedish side.
“Effective July 7, 2025, Pakistani nationals can apply for a Schengen visa from within Pakistan for visits to Sweden of up to 90 days,” the FO said.
 






It welcomed the positive development, saying it “reflects the strengthening of bilateral relations between the two countries”.
The FO added that the Pakistani delegation to the bilateral consultations in Stockholm was led by the additional foreign secretary (Europe), while the Swedish side was led by the director general for global affairs from the Swedish foreign ministry.</p><small>2025-07-07 13:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612859-african-lion-kept-as-pet-in-gujar-khan-home-confiscated' target='_blank'><strong>African lion kept as pet in Gujar Khan home confiscated</strong></a><br><p>

The woman suffered scratches and bruises, and the two children, aged five and seven, were hospitalised after the attack last week, but their injuries were not life-threatening, provincial wildlife officials said.
The lion, which was kept without a licence in a house in Lahore, was confiscated and sent to a local safari park, said Mubeen Elahi, Director General of the Punjab Wildlife and Parks Department.
The owner was later arrested, police said.
Keeping exotic animals as pets has been fueled by social media, with owners often showing off their animals online as status symbols.
“According to the new regulations for keeping big cats, no individual is allowed to keep a lion without a licence, without adhering to the required cage size and without following other standard operating procedures,” Elahi said, adding that the punishment is up to seven years in jail.
“As well as confiscating the 18 animals, the department raided 38 lion and tiger breeding farms and arrested eight people for violating the rules,” he said, adding that all farms will be inspected by the end of this week. “There are 584 lions and tigers in homes and breeding farms in Punjab.”
“I know plenty of people who keep big cats as pets,” said Qaim Ali, 30, who himself had a lion but sold it after it attacked his nephew. “Most of them are not interested in breeding but keep them as a symbol of power and influence in society.”
The department on Saturday arrested five individuals and seized 13 lions after launching a crackdown against people illegally keeping the big cats without a licence.
A press release issued by the provincial government said that the wildlife department launched a “major province-wide crackdown” on the special directives of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz against those keeping lions without a licence.
“This operation is being carried out under a zero-tolerance policy and has already led to significant progress,” the press release said, adding that authorities conducted inspections of 22 locations across the province.</p><small>2025-07-07 12:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/071409496ddc8bf.jpg?r=141626' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922557/sindh-govt-suspends-sbca-dg-over-lyari-building-collapse' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt suspends SBCA DG over Lyari building collapse</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government on Monday suspended Sindh Building and Control Authority (SBCA) Director General Ishaque Khuhro over the recent building collapse in Karachi that claimed 27 lives.
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market collapsed on Friday morning, with the rescue operations concluding yesterday. The building had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, with the SBCA saying it had issued multiple prior notices to residents to vacate the structure since 2023.
A notification issued by Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, stated that the SBCA DG’s services were “placed under suspension with immediate effect for the reason of misconduct and inefficiency”.
It added that Khuhro’s headquarters during the suspension period would be at the Services, General Administration and Coordination Department. He would “draw his salaries and allowances during the suspension period as admissible under the rules”.
Shahmir Khan Bhutto, a Grade-20 officer serving as the secretary of the chief minister’s Inspection, Enquiries and Implementation Team Department, was notified as the new SBCA DG.
Speaking on the development, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said: “Today, the chief minister has also suspended the DG SCBA and has ordered the home minister to immediately register an FIR (first information report) on the incident and that strictest action be taken against all those involved.”

Memon was addressing a press conference in Karachi alongside Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar and Local Government (LG) Minister Saeed Ghani.
According to Ghani, other SBCA officials who were suspended included the director, deputy director and building inspectors assigned to Lyari. He also noted that the Sindh government has announced Rs1 million in compensation to the families of the 27 deceased people.
Major opposition parties — the PTI, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami — have condemned the PPP’s Sindh government, the SBCA and other authorities, accusing them of “criminal negligence”.
They not only demanded compensation and alternative residences for the affected families, but also called for the registration of manslaughter cases against the officials responsible for the tragedy.
Noting the loss of 27 lives, Memon said: “The entire province, nation and all of us as the government representatives are saddened and equally share the grief of the bereaved families.”
“The chief minister has taken a very strict notice of this,” he asserted.
 
 

Memon said CM Murad’s notice of the incident was aimed at ensuring strict action “against those who did not fulfil their duties or even if they fulfilled, they were not able to implement them”.
He added that the fact-finding committee formed on the incident, which was given three days to present a report, would submit its report within two days due to the Ashura public holidays over the weekend.
Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi will now head the committee, according to Ghani.
51 ‘extremely fragile’ buildings
During the media briefing, Ghani also mentioned that there were 51 buildings in Karachi that were “extremely fragile and should be demolished”.
He said the city commissioner has been directed to provide the number of residents and units in those buildings, as well as the details of whether they own the property or have rented it, so that the process of demolishing them can be started.
“The Karachi commissioner has to also provide assessments of the 588 buildings which were declared dangerous within two weeks so that we can decide which of the buildings need to be destroyed and which can be fixed through major repair,” he added.
In a recent statement, the SBCA noted that 588 buildings have been declared dangerous throughout Karachi, with 107 such buildings in Lyari alone.
 


Ghani asserted that all SBCA officers appointed in Lyari since 2022 will be identified and included in the inquiry, adding: “If the committee finds involvement or criminal negligence of any officer, they will be included in the FIR and face legal action.”
“If any negligence even by the [SCBA] DG is found in the inquiry, then he will also be included in the FIR,” the LG minister said, noting that Khuhro was in the role in 2022, when the building’s survey was conducted.</p><small>2025-07-07 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612849-senate-committee-divided-over-adding-reproductive-health-to-school-curriculum' target='_blank'><strong>Senate committee divided over adding reproductive health to school curriculum</strong></a><br><p>

According to Rescue 1122 Swat spokesperson Niaz Khan, “Eleven seminary students were injured when a pickup vehicle lost control and crashed near the Kedam police checkpoint in Swat’s Bahrain town.
“The students, who hailed from Kalam, were on their way home after their holidays in Batkhela Town.”
He said the Rescue 1122 medical team swiftly arrived at the site of the incident after receiving a report. “After administering initial medical aid, the injured were transferred to nearby hospitals.  Three students, who were declared severely injured, were safely transported to the Civil Hospital in Madyan.”
In another incident, he said a man was killed while four others sustained injuries when a three-wheeler plunged into a deep ravine after its brakes failed. The driver died on the spot, Khan said.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain, and poor infrastructure.
Earlier this month, six members of a family were killed in Azad Jammu and Kashmir when their car veered off the road and plummeted hundreds of feet, crashing onto the right bank of the Neelum River, officials said.
The accident occurred at a sharp bend on the Neelum Valley road near Chilyana village, approximately 50 kilometres northeast of Muzaffarabad.
On June 25, four people were killed and two injured in separate road accidents.
Rahimabad police said a passenger bus collided with a car travelling to Buner near the Odigram area, resulting in the deaths of Altaf Rehman, Yasir Khan and Fida Mohammad, residents of the Deewana Baba Degar area of Buner. Khalil Zada, a resident of Gagra Buner, was injured in the accident.
Meanwhile, two motorcycles collided in the Malaki Dam area of Barikot, resulting in the death of one rider and injuries to another. The injured individuals from both accidents were transferred to local hospitals for treatment.</p><small>2025-07-07 11:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/071156426d961f3.jpg?r=120405' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922543/yet-another-record-high-as-psx-soars-past-133000-points' target='_blank'><strong>Yet another record high as PSX soars past 133,000 points</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) soared to new highs on Monday as shares crossed the 133,000 barrier, with analysts attributing the optimism to a “favourable” taxation regime for equities following the passage of the federal budget.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,771.48 points (1.34 per cent), to stand at 133,720.54 points at 11:21am, from the previous close of 131,949.06 points.
It reached an intraday high of 133,862.01 points, before closing at 133,370.14 points — 1,421.08 points (1.08pc) higher than yesterday.
The PSX commenced the new fiscal year on a bullish note last week, as the KSE-100 index posted a robust 6.1pc gain during the outgoing week. Continuing that momentum, the market extended its record-setting rally for the seventh consecutive session today.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, noted: “A favourable taxation regime for equities and the increasing likelihood of equities outperforming other asset classes, amid improving macroeconomic indicators and lower inflation, have channelled flows towards equities.”
 
 

He highlighted that there was a “continuation of monetary easing — driven by falling inflation, fiscal discipline, a strong external account and a focus on structural reforms — which will keep equities in the limelight”.
Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com: “We believe the market is firmly in Phase 2 of the bull run, marked by rising retail participation, higher trading volumes, and broad-based gains across sectors.”
He noted that the passage of the Finance Act 2025-26 last week with “minimal surprises”, geopolitical calm, optimism around circular debt resolution, and the potential signing of a trade deal with the United States have all contributed to improving investor confidence.
 
 

“Retail investors should focus on long-term investing, staying consistent with their risk appetite and avoiding overreaction to short-term fluctuations,” Farooq cautioned.
“While pockets of speculation have emerged — typical of a bull market — overall valuations remain reasonable,” he added, advising investors to temper return expectations as “forward returns are likely to normalise compared to the outsized gains seen over the past two years”.
The upbeat sentiment has been supported by stabilising macroeconomic indicators. Inflation eased to a nine-year low of 3.2pc in June from 3.5pc in May. The trade deficit narrowed to $2.3bn for June — down 9pc month-on-month and 3pc year-on-year — while the full-year trade deficit for FY25 stood at $26.3bn, up 9pc from FY24.</p><small>2025-07-07 11:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612835-shoddy-attempt-at-playing-camp-politics-coas-on-indias-claim-of-chinas-assistance-during-recent-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>'Shoddy attempt at camp politics': COAS on India's claim of China's assistance during recent conflict</strong></a><br><p>

Gill, who notched a century in a losing cause in the first Test at Headingley, hit new heights in scoring 269 and 161 to set up a crushing victory by 336 runs which leaves the five-match series finely poised.
It was India’s first win in nine Tests at the Birmingham venue, following seven previous defeats and one draw.
“New captain, new India”, The Indian Express newspaper splashed across its front page.
Gill, 25, became the youngest Indian Test skipper to register an overseas win in just his second match in charge following the retirement of Rohit Sharma.
He eclipsed Sunil Gavaskar, who was 26 when he led India to victory over New Zealand at Auckland in 1976.
Gill came into the series with concerns over his batting average overseas, which had been less than 30, but he has shut down all the noise by stroking a remarkable 585 runs from four innings.
Cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar called it a “Shublime innings from the man of the moment,” offering his congratulations for “powering India to a brilliant Test victory.”
Tendulkar, writing on social media, added: “India’s approach was to take England out of this game and force them to play differently, making sure that there would only be one winner.”
 






‘Drowning Street’
Fast bowler Akash Deep took a match haul of 10 wickets after replacing the rested Jasprit Bumrah as England were bowled out for 271 in their chase of 608 on day five.
“What impressed me most about the bowlers was the length they bowled”, Tendulkar said.
Deep took 6-99 in the second innings, including bowling the world’s top-ranked Test batsman Joe Root with a delivery that nipped away sharply and was called the “ball of the series” by Tendulkar.
Batting great Virat Kohli, who also retired before the series, said: “Great victory for India at Edgbaston” and wrote that India had been “fearless and kept pushing England to the wall.”
 






“Brilliantly led by Shubman with the bat and in the field… special mention to (Mohammed) Siraj and Akash for the way they bowled,” he added.
Former captain Sourav Ganguly praised Gill’s performance and India’s superior bowling attack, calling Akash and Siraj “workhorses”.
 






Indian newspapers had a field day with an outpouring of joyous puns.
The Times of India said: “Deep’s 10 send Eng to Drowning Street” and “Edg-bastian breached.”

Gupta, the ICC’s seventh CEO, succeeds Geoff Allardice, who resigned from the post in January after four years in office.
Gupta was broadcaster JioStar’s chief executive for sports and live experiences.
ICC chairman Jay Shah said Gupta “brings extensive experience in sports strategy and commercialisation, which will be invaluable for the ICC”.
The role attracted more than 2,500 applications from candidates across 25 countries, the ICC said.
 
 

“These are exciting times for the sport as marquee events grow in stature, commercial avenues widen and opportunities such as the women’s game scale in popularity,” Gupta said in a statement.
“Cricket’s inclusion in the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games and the rapid acceleration of technology deployment/adoption could act as force-multipliers for the cricket movement around the world,” he said.
According to the ICC’s website, Gupta was appointed as the JioStar Sports CEO in November 2024 and has “held multiple leadership roles in content, programming and strategy”. He began his career as a journalist in 2010 at Star India (now JioStar).
“Under his stewardship, the sports portfolio at Star India scaled across consumer and commercial objectives with a strong emphasis on long-term growth and operational efficiency,” the ICC highlighted.

Yaum-i-Ashura processions in major cities across the country concluded peacefully on Sunday evening amid tightened security. A total of 4,836 processions and 5,480 majalis were carried out, with 12 processions taking place in Peshawar.
Thousands of police personnel — including constables and police snipers — were deployed across major cities alongside emergency rescue personnel for the safety and security of mourners carrying out processions.
Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Qasim Khan told Dawn.com that drone-jamming technology was used for the first time by Peshawar police.
“A drone-jamming gun was used for the first time during the Ashura procession,” he said.
“With the help of Peshawar Anti-Drone System, drone cameras helped in jamming.”
He noted that drones had been used by terrorists in the southern districts of KP. “Now KP police can jam suspicious drones,” Khan said.
“New technology can disable suspicious drones at a distance of up to three kilometres.”
Naqvi praises LEAs for peaceful Muharram processions
Separately, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi praised law enforcement authorities for their coordinated security efforts to ensure a peaceful and secure environment during Ashura processions across the country.
“All processions and gatherings in Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Sindh, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir concluded peacefully,” he said today in a post on X.
 






He paid tribute to the army, Rangers and police for their “hard work” during the Ashura processions and thanked “every soldier, officer, and official assigned to the security of Ashura”.
The interior minister noted that the security forces performed their duties with “dedication and harmony” and provided foolproof security to the mourners’ processions and gatherings.
“From Muharram 1 to Ashura, an effective and coordinated security plan was successfully implemented,” Naqvi said. “All forces and field formations demonstrated exemplary discipline and unity day and night.”</p><small>2025-07-07 08:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612789-cant-allow-vulgar-language-pa-speaker-defends-move-to-disqualify-mpas' target='_blank'><strong>'Can't allow vulgar language': PA speaker defends move to deseat opposition MPAs</strong></a><br><p>

The incident comes at a sensitive time with Turkiye in talks to end the conflict with the Kurds after the PKK militant group agreed to end its decades-long armed struggle.
The conflict, which began in 1984, has cost more than 40,000 lives.
The deaths occurred as the Turkish troops were searching for the remains of a soldier who was shot dead by Kurdish fighters in the area in May 2022 and whose body was never recovered, Turkiye’s defence ministry said.
“Three other of our heroic comrades in arms, affected by methane gas, have died, bringing the total number of victims to eight,” the ministry said on X on Monday.
It did not explain the origin of the methane gas in the caves.
“During a search operation in a cave… previously known to have been used as a hospital… 19 of our personnel were exposed to methane gas,” the ministry said on Sunday.
When the soldier whose body the troops were looking for died in 2022, Turkiye was waging Operation Claw Lock, with its troops seeking to eradicate Kurdish PKK militants holed up in caves along the border.
News of the deaths emerged as a delegation from the pro-Kurdish DEM party was visiting jailed PKK founder Abdullah Ocalan as part of the ongoing negotiations with the Turkish government.</p><small>2025-07-07 07:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0711061345b20d4.jpg?r=112733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922536/sabalenka-stands-tall-norrie-survives-to-reach-wimbledon-quarter-finals' target='_blank'><strong>Sabalenka stands tall, Norrie survives to reach Wimbledon quarter-finals</strong></a><br><p>Women’s top seed Aryna Sabalenka and men’s defending champion Carlos Alcaraz both survived tough tests to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals and Cameron Norrie kept alive British singles hopes after surviving a five-set thriller on Sunday.
Sabalenka ruined home favourite Emma Raducanu’s dream in the previous round but had the Centre Court crowd cheering her on as she beat Elise Mertens 6-4 7-6(4) in a high-quality duel.
Wimbledon’s new automated line-calling technology came under fire after an embarrassing malfunction robbed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of a point during her last-16 victory over Britain’s Sonay Kartal on Centre Court.
Spaniard Alcaraz came through a ferocious firefight against Russian 14th seed Andrey Rublev 6-7(5) 6-3 6-4 6-4 to stay on course for a third successive title.
“Andrey is one of the most powerful players we have on Tour and is so aggressive with the ball. He forces you to the limit on each point,” Alcaraz, bidding to become only the fourth man to win back-to-back French Open and Wimbledon titles multiple times, said on court.
The 22-year-old second seed extended his current winning streak to 22 matches and will take on Norrie for a place in the semi-finals after the unseeded Briton soaked up 46 aces from towering Chilean Nicolas Jarry to win a feisty Court One battle 6-3 7-6(4) 6-7(7) 6-7(5) 6-3.
While Alcaraz seeks a Wimbledon hat-trick, Sabalenka is eyeing her first title on the London lawns after missing last year’s tournament with injury and the 2022 edition due to the ban on Russian and Belarusian players, and the 27-year-old made a fast start against Mertens.

Sabalenka, who claimed doubles titles at the US Open and Australian Open partnering Mertens, was then put through the wringer before raising her level to prevail.
The victory improved her win-loss record against Belgian Mertens to 11-2 and she said the growing adoration of the crowd made a big difference after fans were on the other side of the fence when she met Raducanu on Friday.
“I definitely felt the support. It was so amazing playing and feeling the support. I didn’t have to pretend that they were cheering for me because they were really cheering for me,” said Sabalenka, who will face the 37-year-old German Laura Siegemund in the quarter-finals.
“What can be better than that? I really enjoyed it. I hope it can stay the same all the way, and they help me energy-wise to stay strong and to face all of the challenges.”

Heavy showers
Siegemund, the second-oldest player to start in the women’s draw this year, swatted aside plucky Argentine lucky loser Solana Sierra with a 6-3 6-2 victory in a Court Two match interrupted by the heavy showers that prompted organisers to shut the roofs for the day’s play on Centre Court and Court One.
While Sierra was the first lucky loser to reach the last 16 in the professional era, Siegemund created her own slice of history by becoming the oldest woman to reach her first Wimbledon quarter-final.
Explaining her run, Siegemund said it was simple. “It’s like you have an opponent. Either you find good solutions and you execute well, you go forward, or you don’t, and you don’t go forward. So it’s very simple,” she said.
Sierra’s fellow South American, Jarry, fought back brilliantly against Norrie after saving a match point in the third-set tiebreak but fell short in a needle match.
Jarry seemed irritated at times during the heat of battle and the players exchanged words at the end.
“Cameron played unbelievable. Not unbelievable, played great. He did his job. He plays like that,” said qualifier Jarry, whose total ace count reached a tournament-leading 111.
Asked what happened, Norrie said there had been no problem.
“I think he just said I was being a little bit too vocal,” he said. “Honestly, nothing but credit to Nico for his performance. I guess we both really wanted to win.”

Norrie, a 2022 semi-finalist, is the last British hope after the unseeded Kartal’s run ended with a 7-6(3) 6-4 defeat by experienced Russian Pavlyuchenkova.
The big talking point in that match was the malfunction of the Electronic Line Calling system, which left the Russian former French Open runner-up seething after being robbed of a game point at 4-4 in the opening set when there was no ‘out’ call despite a Kartal shot landing over the baseline.
Umpire Nico Helwerth sought advice from tournament organisers via telephone and then ruled that the point should be replayed, with Pavlyuchenkova going on to have her serve broken.
“We were waiting for a decision as the system was down, but I was expecting to hear if they said the ball was in or out,” she said. “I expected a different decision. I just thought also the chair umpire could take the initiative.
“That’s why he’s there sitting on the chair. He also saw it (was) out, he told me after the match. I thought he would do that, but he didn’t. I think it’s also difficult for him. He probably was scared to take such a big decision.”
Organisers said it had been caused by the system being ‘deactivated in error’.
American fifth seed Taylor Fritz marched on after his Australian opponent Jordan Thompson retired with a thigh injury at 6-1 3-0 down in their fourth-round meeting.
Up next for Fritz is a meeting with Russian 17th seed Karen Khachanov who thumped Poland’s Kamil Majchrzak 6-4 6-2 6-3.
Fritz is not the only American to reach the quarter-finals, after 13th seed Amanda Anisimova beat Linda Noskova 6-2 5-7 6-4 in the day’s final action.</p><small>2025-07-07 06:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07105451551640f.jpg?r=110631' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922534/reuters-x-account-restored-in-india-after-suspension-over-legal-demand' target='_blank'><strong>Reuters X account restored in India after suspension over legal demand</strong></a><br><p>The Reuters News account on X was restored in India on Sunday, a day after the social media platform suspended it, citing a legal demand.
“At this time, we are no longer withholding access in India to your account,” X said in an email to the Reuters social media team, without elaborating.
Representatives for X, Reuters and the Indian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the restoration of the account.
Earlier on Sunday, a spokesperson for the Indian government’s Press Information Bureau told Reuters that no Indian government agency had required withholding the Reuters handle, adding that officials were working with X to resolve the problem.
A Reuters spokesperson had said the agency was working with X to resolve this matter and get the Reuters account reinstated in India as soon as possible.
Reuters World, another X account operated by the news agency, which was blocked in India, was also restored late on Sunday night.
The main Reuters account, which has more than 25 million followers globally, had been blocked in India since Saturday night. A notice told X users that “@Reuters has been withheld in IN (India) in response to a legal demand”.
 
 

In an email to the Reuters social media team on May 16, X said: “It is our policy to notify account holders if we receive a legal request from an authorised entity (such as law enforcement or a government agency) to remove content from their account.”
“In order to comply with X obligations under India’s local laws, we have withheld your X account in India under the country’s Information Technology Act, 2000; the content remains available elsewhere”.
Reuters could not ascertain if the May 16 email was linked to Saturday’s account suspension, nor could it determine what specific content the demand referred to, why its removal was sought or the entity that had lodged the complaint.
While the email did not specify which entity had made the request or what content they sought to remove, it said X had been advised that in such cases, a user could contact the secretary of India’s Information and Broadcasting Ministry.
The secretary, Sanjay Jaju, did not respond to requests seeking comment.
The 2000 law allows designated government officials to demand the takedown of content from social media platforms they deem to violate local laws, including on the grounds of national security or if a post threatens public order.
X has long been at odds with India’s government over content-removal requests. In March, the company sued the federal government over a new government website that the company says expands takedown powers to “countless” government officials.
The case is continuing. India has said X wrongly labelled an official website a “censorship portal”, as the website only allows tech companies to be notified about harmful online content.</p><small>2025-07-07 06:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07092639f1c5b7a.jpg?r=105549' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922525/death-toll-from-texas-floods-reaches-78' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from Texas floods reaches 78</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from catastrophic floods in Texas reached at least 78 on Sunday, including 28 children, as the search for girls missing from a summer camp continued, and fears of more flooding prompted evacuations of volunteer responders.
Larry Leitha, sheriff of Kerr County in Texas Hill Country, said 68 people had died in flooding in his county, the epicentre of the flooding, among them 28 children.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott, speaking at a press conference on Sunday afternoon, said another 10 had died elsewhere in Texas and confirmed 41 were missing.
US President Donald Trump sent his condolences to the victims and said he would probably visit the area on Friday. His administration had been in touch with Abbott, he added.
“It’s a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible. So we say, God bless all of the people that have gone through so much, and God bless, God bless the state of Texas,” he told reporters as he left New Jersey.
Among the most devastating impacts of the flooding occurred at Camp Mystic summer camp, a nearly century-old Christian girls camp where 10 Camp Mystic campers and one counsellor were still missing, according to Leitha.
“It was nothing short of horrific to see what those young children went through,” said Abbott, who noted he toured the area on Saturday and pledged to continue efforts to locate the missing.
The flooding occurred after the nearby Guadalupe River broke its banks after torrential rain fell in the central Texas area on Friday, the US Independence Day holiday.

Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said the destruction killed three people in Burnet County, one in Tom Green County, five in Travis County and one in Williamson County.
“You will see the death toll rise today and tomorrow,” said Freeman Martin, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, also speaking on Sunday.
Officials said on Saturday that more than 850 people had been rescued, including some clinging to trees, after a sudden storm dumped up to 15 inches (38 cm) of rain across the region, about 140 kilometres northwest of San Antonio.
Kidd said he was receiving unconfirmed reports of “an additional wall of water” flowing down some of the creeks in the Guadalupe Rivershed, as rain continued to fall on soil in the region already saturated from Friday’s rains.
“We’re evacuating parts of the river right now because we are worried about another wall of river coming down in those areas,” he said, referencing volunteers from outside the area seeking to help locate victims.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency was activated on Sunday and is deploying resources to first responders in Texas after Trump issued a major disaster declaration, the Department of Homeland Security said. US Coast Guard helicopters and planes were aiding search and rescue efforts.
 


Scaling back federal disaster response
Trump has previously outlined plans to scale back the federal government’s role in responding to natural disasters, leaving states to shoulder more of the burden themselves.
Some experts questioned whether cuts to the federal workforce by the Trump administration, including to the agency that oversees the National Weather Service, led to a failure by officials to accurately predict the severity of the floods and issue appropriate warnings ahead of the storm.
Trump’s administration has overseen thousands of job cuts from the National Weather Service’s parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, leaving many weather offices understaffed, former NOAA director Rick Spinrad said.
Spinrad said he did not know if those staff cuts factored into the lack of advance warning for the extreme Texas flooding, but that they would inevitably degrade the agency’s ability to deliver accurate and timely forecasts.
Trump pushed back when asked on Sunday if federal government cuts hobbled the disaster response or left key job vacancies at the National Weather Service under Trump’s oversight.
“That water situation, that all is, and that was really the Biden setup,” he said, referencing his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden. “But I wouldn’t blame Biden for it, either. I would just say this is 100-year catastrophe.”
He declined to answer a question about FEMA, saying only, “They’re busy working, so we’ll leave it at that,” Trump said.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA and NOAA, said a “moderate” flood watch issued on Thursday by the National Weather Service had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall and said the Trump administration was working to upgrade the system.
Joaquin Castro, a Democratic US congressman from Texas, told CNN’s “State of the Union” program that fewer personnel at the weather service could be dangerous.
“When you have flash flooding, there’s a risk that if you don’t have the personnel … to do that analysis, do the predictions in the best way, it could lead to tragedy,” Castro said.
‘Complete devastation’
Katharine Somerville, a counsellor on the Cypress Lake side of Camp Mystic, on higher ground than the Guadalupe River side, said her 13-year-old campers were scared as their cabins sustained damage and lost power in the middle of the night.
“Our cabins at the tippity top of hills were completely flooded with water. I mean, y’all have seen the complete devastation, we never even imagined that this could happen,” Somerville said in an interview on Fox News on Sunday.
 


Somerville said the campers in her care were put on military trucks and evacuated, and that all were safe.
The disaster unfolded rapidly on Friday morning as heavier-than-forecast rain drove river waters rapidly to as high as nine metres.
A day after the disaster struck, the summer camp, where 700 girls were in residence at the time of the flooding, was a scene of devastation. Inside one cabin, mud lines indicating how high the water had risen were at least six feet (1.83m) from the floor.
Bed frames, mattresses and personal belongings caked with mud were scattered inside. Some buildings had broken windows, and one had a missing wall.</p><small>2025-07-07 05:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/07084103c50f0d9.jpg?r=104835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922519/brics-nations-slam-trump-tariffs-condemn-strikes-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Brics nations slam Trump tariffs, condemn strikes on Iran</strong></a><br><p>Brics leaders at a summit on Sunday took aim at US President Donald Trump’s “indiscriminate” import tariffs and recent Israeli-US strikes on Iran.
The 11 emerging nations — including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa — account for about half the world’s population and 40 per cent of global economic output.
The bloc is divided about much, but found common cause when it comes to the mercurial US leader and his stop-start tariff wars — even if it avoided naming him directly.
 
 

Voicing “serious concerns about the rise of unilateral tariff” measures, Brics members said the tariffs risked hurting the global economy, according to a summit joint statement.
Trump fired back at the bloc directly on social media on Sunday night.
“Any country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of Brics will be charged an additional 10 per cent Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
 


Earlier, Brics also offered symbolic backing to fellow member Iran, condemning a series of military strikes on nuclear and other targets carried out by Israel and the United States.
In April, Trump threatened allies and rivals alike with a slew of punitive duties, before offering a months-long reprieve in the face of a fierce market sell-off.
Trump has warned he will impose unilateral levies on partners unless they reach “deals” by August 1.
In an apparent concession to US allies, such as Brazil, India, and Saudi Arabia, the summit declaration did not criticise the United States or its president by name at any point.
No show
Conceived two decades ago as a forum for fast-growing economies, the BRICS have come to be seen as a Chinese-driven counterbalance to US and Western European power.
But as the group has expanded to include Iran, Saudi Arabia and others, it has struggled to reach meaningful consensus on issues from the Gaza onslaught to challenging US global dominance.
Brics nations, for example, collectively called for a peaceful two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict — despite Tehran’s long-standing position that Israel should be destroyed.
An Iranian diplomatic source said his government’s “reservations” had been conveyed to Brazilian hosts. Still, Iran stopped short of rejecting the statement outright.
In perhaps a further sign of the diplomatic sensitivities, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister skipped Sunday’s discussions entirely, according to a Brazilian government source.
Saudi Arabia is among the world’s leading beneficiaries of high-tech US military exports and is a long-standing US partner.
 
 

The political punch of this year’s summit has been depleted by the absence of China’s Xi Jinping, who skipped the meeting for the first time in his 12 years as president.
The Chinese leader is not the only notable absentee. Russian President Vladimir Putin, charged with war crimes in Ukraine, also opted to stay away, participating via video link.
He told counterparts that Brics had become a key player in global governance.
The summit also called for regulation governing artificial intelligence and said the technology could not be the preserve of only rich nations.
The commercial AI sector is currently dominated by US tech giants, although China and other nations have rapidly developing capacity.</p><small>2025-07-07 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/071017501d5aa54.png?r=102905' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922528/at-least-2-dead-hundreds-injured-as-typhoon-danas-lashes-southern-taiwan-with-record-winds' target='_blank'><strong>At least 2 dead, hundreds injured as Typhoon Danas lashes southern Taiwan with record winds</strong></a><br><p>Typhoon Danas lashed southern Taiwan with record winds and strong rain early on Monday, killing two people and injuring more than 330 in a rare hit to the island’s densely populated west coast, where businesses and schools were shut.
Taiwan is regularly struck by typhoons but they generally land along the mountainous and sparsely populated east coast facing the Pacific.
Typhoon Danas, at one point listed by Taiwan’s weather authority at the second-strongest level, headed north towards the Taiwan Strait after making landfall along its southwestern coast late on Sunday.
 


It has greatly weakened since and was forecast to hit eastern China later this week.
“The typhoon track is rare… the whole of Taiwan will be affected by the wind and rain one after another,” President Lai Ching-te said in a post on Facebook, urging citizens to make preparations.
Power to more than half a million homes was cut and over 300 domestic and international flights were cancelled, government data showed. The north-south high-speed rail line scaled back services.
The National Fire Agency said one person was killed by a falling tree while driving and another died after their respirator malfunctioned due to a power cut.
Record winds of around 220 kilometres per hour were recorded in the southwestern county of Yunlin, while more than 700 trees and street signs were blown over across western cities and towns, government data showed.
There was no major report of damage in the Tainan Science Park that houses tech giants such as TSMC.
Maritime officials in eastern China’s Zhejiang province raised their emergency response to the second-highest level on Monday, according to state broadcaster CCTV.
As of 10 am (7am PKT), 121 passenger vessels and 64 ferry routes had been suspended across the province, CCTV reported. Authorities also halted 181 construction projects, including wind farms, as a precaution.
Danas is expected to gradually approach the coastal areas between Zhejiang’s city of Taizhou and Fuzhou city in neighbouring Fujian province, according to the China Meteorological Administration.
The typhoon is forecast to make landfall along the stretch late on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-07-07 05:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612777-what-are-chances-of-rain-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>What are chances of rain in Karachi?</strong></a><br><p>
