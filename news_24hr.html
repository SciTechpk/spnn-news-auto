Based in Norway, the forum aims to act as a “driving force for global cooperation to ensure freedom of expression for all”, according to its website.
The award was presented to her by Philippine Nobel Laureate Maria Ressa in the award ceremony of the forum’s annual conference in Lillehammer, Norway for her “extraordinary courage, integrity and impact in the struggle for the rule of law and justice”.
The award jury said the lawyer’s work had “inspired the local community and earned global recognition-making”.
“The recipient’s outspoken stance has made her a role model for a new generation of lawyers and students, especially women, and instilled hope and optimism in them. She’s shown that the legal profession can be a viable avenue for justice and systemic change, even in hybrid regimes,” Ressa said while presenting the award.
She said that despite continued pressure, the lawyer continued to defend Pakistan’s most vulnerable and marginalised communities.
“Her advocacy remains rooted in legal, nonviolent and ethical resistance; a principled human rights work model in one of the world’s most challenging environments. Her resilience in the face of such challenges is a testament to her courage and dedication and it calls for our continued support and empathy.”
Digital rights expert and activist Usama Khilji said he was proud of the lawyer for her “fearless courage & inspiring a generation of young people, giving them hope when there is little left”.
 






Rights activist Sammi Deen Baloch said she was “truly delighted” to see the “formidable defender of free speech and human rights” receive the award.
“This is a powerful international recognition of Imaan’s fearless fight for free expression and democracy in Pakistan.
“In a country where standing up for human rights and free speech comes at great risk, Imaan has remained determined. Despite threats, intimidation, and false charges, she continues to rise with courage defending truth, justice, and the fundamental right to speak freely.”

The high-level team — consisting of three former foreign ministers, two former foreign sec­­retaries, two former ambassadors to the US, and a serving federal minister — arrived in New York yesterday for consultations at the United Nations, the Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement today.
The delegation will also visit Washington DC, London and Brussels, the FO said.
Ex-FMs PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Hina Rabbani Khar and Khurram Dastgir; Senators Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari and Bushra Anjum Butt; and Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua are members of the first delegation.
The PPP said in a post on X that the delegation met elected UNSC members “to expose Indian propaganda” and present Pakistan’s position to representatives from Denmark, Greece, Panama, Somalia, Algeria, Guyana, Japan, South Korea, Sierra Leone and Slovenia.
“India’s targeting of urban areas and suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty are a threat to regional peace,” Bilawal told the representatives.
The statement said he refuted “baseless Indian allegations” with arguments before the representatives, saying that “accusing Pakistan without any research or evidence is unacceptable.”
“The international community should not be limited to post-conflict resolution efforts but should find pre-conflict solutions for lasting peace in South Asia.
“Pakistan’s response to Indian aggression was measured, responsible and in accordance with the UN Charter,” he briefed the representatives about the country’s response in the recent military escalation with India.
Other members of the delegation also briefed the UNSC representatives that India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty could lead to water shortage, food crisis and environmental destruction in Pakistan.
The statement said the representatives appreciated Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts.
 






In a separate post, Bilawal said the two sides held a “substantive exchange” in which Pakistan’s “principled and responsible stance in the face of India’s escalating provocations” was conveyed.
“Reaffirmed our abiding commitment to restraint, diplomacy, dialogue, and a rules-based international order. Underscored the dangers of India’s weaponisation of water by violating [Indus Water Treaty] and resolving the Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions. Pakistan unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and remains a victim of terrorism, planned and sponsored from beyond our borders. We do not seek conflict, but stand fully prepared to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity. South Asia cannot afford another crisis.”
 






The delegation earlier met China’s United Nations envoy Fu Cong to discuss the regional security situation and Indian aggression.
Bilawal expressed gratitude for China’s support during the tensions with India and briefed the Chinese official on Pakistan’s “responsible conduct” after the Pahalgam attack.
“India rejected Pakistan’s offer for a transparent and impartial investigation. Resolution of Kashmir issue is essential for lasting peace in South Asia,” Bilawal told the Chinese envoy and appealed to China to play its role in this regard as per the UN resolutions.
“The international community has moved beyond crisis management and towards solutions. India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty is tantamount to weaponising water,” Bilawal said.
The delegation also expressed serious concerns over “India’s targeting of Pakistani citizens”.
The two sides agreed to oppose unilateral actions and aggression and vowed to restore peace in the region through multilateral cooperation. They also emphasised the need to respect the UN Charter, international laws and agreements.
 






“Reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to the ceasefire, regional stability, and a peaceful resolution in accordance with the UN Charter. The international community must reject India’s dangerous ‘new normal’ of aggression,” Bilawal said of the meeting with the Chinese official.
 






The group is scheduled to meet UN Secretary-General António Gute­rres, the president of the UN General Assembly and ambassadors of all five permanent members of the Security Council. It will also address a joint session of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation envoys.
In a post on X, Bilawal said he was carrying a “clear message” with him.
“Pakistan seeks peace with dignity, dialogue with purpose, and partnerships built on justice. The unresolved issue of Kashmir continues to threaten regional peace. Any aggression over shared water resources challenges not just Pakistan’s sovereignty, but global stability. We reject terrorism in all forms, yet oppose its misuse as a political tool to target Pakistan. Trade must become a bridge, not a battleground. It’s time for the world to engage, not ignore.”
 






The delegation will kick off its engagements on June 3, with planned meetings with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, senior administration officials, lawmakers, think-tank analysts, and leading media organisations.
Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi, will visit Moscow from June 2 to June 4, according to the FO.
During the visit, Fatemi is scheduled to hold meetings with senior Russian officials and also engage with the media and think tanks.
“The visits of these delegations are aimed at projecting Pakistan’s perspective on the recent Indian aggression,” the FO statement read.
“The delegations will highlight Pakistan’s responsible and restrained conduct — seeking peace with responsibility — in the face of India’s reckless and belligerent actions in violation of international law.”
The delegations will also highlight that “dialogue and diplomacy should take precedence over conflict and confrontation”.
The statement read that the delegations will underscore the importance of the international community to play its due role in promoting a lasting peace in the region, including the immediate resumption of the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty.
“The delegations will engage in a series of meetings with the leadership of international bodies, public office holders, senior officials, parliamentarians, think tanks, media and diaspora,” the FO said.
‘Strategic importance and not mere photo opportunities’
Separately, Senator Sherry Rehman said that the delegation led by the PPP chairman has already begun its US visit with a “packed schedule of high-level multilateral meetings in New York”.
 
 

In a statement, Rehman emphasised that the meetings will have strategic importance and not be “mere photo opportunities”.
She added that the country’s status as “a responsible and stable middle power” is being highlighted during the engagements, and that the country had a clear interest in “regional peace and security”.
“Adherence to international laws is part of Pakistan’s foreign policy,” Rehman said, adding that the “fabricated” Indian narrative against the country “will not be allowed to take the form of truth this time”.
“India has started using false terrorism allegations as justification for war. This trend cannot be allowed to become the norm,” she said, adding that the country would not be part of any Indian “film script”.
The PPP leader said, “Chairman Bilawal Bhutto has successfully presented Pakistan’s solid position on water, Kashmir and violations of international laws of war and peace.
“Pakistan, as a responsible nuclear state, believes in a broad and fair dialogue based on peace,” she added.</p><small>2025-06-02 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02231719305acc6.jpg?r=231725' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915022/punjab-orders-crackdown-against-arms-display-use-of-hilux-pickup-trucks' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab orders crackdown against arms display, use of Hilux pickup trucks</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday ordered a crackdown against the display of weaponry and use of Toyota Hilux pickup trucks in the province.
The newly formed Crime Control Department (CCD), a specialised unit dedicated to tackling crime in the province, will take “indiscriminate action” against those who create “fear and panic” through such displays.
According to a statement by Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Sohail Zafar Chatha, “Spreading fear and panic in the society and displaying weapons cannot be allowed at all.”
“CCD officers have been ordered to take indiscriminate action against those displaying weapons,” he said.
He added that over 21,000 Safe City cameras will be used to monitor those displaying weapons and modern artificial intelligence will also be used to identify weapons.
 
 

Referring to luxurious pickup trucks, the Hilux has become a symbol of power, status, and intimidation in a society marked by significant class divisions.
Hiluxes part the traffic — speeding up behind cars and flashing their lights, demanding drivers move out of their way. Guards with faces wrapped in scarves and armed with AK-47s can be packed into the back of the truck, its windows blacked out. In Karachi, a city rife with street crimes, the imposing Vigo Dala deters even outlaws.
The Hilux debuted in 1968, but the model that became popular in Pakistan was the mid-2000s Hilux Vigo. In recent years, the “Vigo Dala”, as it is locally known, has soared in popularity as an escort vehicle among newly successful urban business owners.</p><small>2025-06-02 18:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/022313243e2ab5b.jpg?r=231632' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915023/trump-xi-will-likely-talk-this-week-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>Trump, Xi will ‘likely’ talk this week: White House</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping will likely hold a long-awaited call later this week, the White House said on Monday, as trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies ratchet back up.
Trump reignited strains with China last week when he accused the world’s second-biggest economy of violating a deal that had led both countries to temporarily reduce huge tit-for-tat tariffs.
“The two leaders will likely talk this week,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing when asked whether Trump and Xi would speak.
Trump and Xi have yet to have any confirmed contact more than five months since the Republican returned to power, despite frequent claims by the US president that a call is imminent.
Trump even said in a Time magazine interview in April that Xi had called him — but Beijing insisted that there had been no call recently.
Stock markets around the world mostly slid on Monday as the US-China tensions resurfaced.
Trump in early April introduced sweeping worldwide tariffs that targeted China most heavily of all, accusing other countries of “ripping off” the United States and running trade imbalances.
Beijing and Washington last month agreed to slash staggeringly high tariffs on each other for 90 days after talks between top officials in Geneva.
But Trump and top US officials Washington officials last week accused China
of violating the deal, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying Beijing was “slow-rolling” the agreement in comments to Fox News on Sunday.
Beijing rejected those “bogus” US claims on Monday, and accused Washington of introducing “a number of discriminatory restrictive measures.”
Trump has separately ramped up tensions with other trade partners, including the European Union, by vowing to double global tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 per cent from Wednesday.</p><small>2025-06-02 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02222647b3c50a6.jpg?r=223149' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915020/' target='_blank'><strong>Man convicted for desecrating Holy Quran outside London’s Turkish consulate</strong></a><br><p>A man who desecrated a copy of the Holy Quran outside the Turkish consulate in London was found guilty on Monday of committing a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a verdict critics said effectively reinstated an abolished blasphemy law.
Hamit Coskun, 50, was fined 240 pounds ($325) at London’s Westminster Magistrates’ Court after being convicted of being disorderly by shouting “F*** Islam” as he held aloft the burning book near the consulate in central London in February.
The lawyer for Coskun, whose father was Kurdish and his mother Armenian and who lived in central England, had argued that the prosecution amounted to an attempt to bring back a blasphemy law that was abolished in England in 2008.
Coskun had denied the charge and said on social media he was carrying out a protest against the Turkish government. While he was holding the book aloft, he was attacked by a man with a knife who kicked and spat at him.
“Burning a religious book, although offensive, to some is not necessarily disorderly,” said Judge John McGarva.
“What made his conduct disorderly was the timing and location of the conduct and that all this was accompanied by abusive language. There was no need for him to use the ‘F word’ and direct it towards Islam.”
He was motivated by “hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam”, McGarva said.
“Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,” said the judge.
State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.
“He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,” said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.
The National Secular Society (NSS), which helped pay his legal fees, said the prosecution was “a significant blow to freedom of expression”, a sentiment echoed by the main opposition Conservative Party.
“Britain has no blasphemy laws. Yet this verdict creates one de facto,” the party posted on X.
“Parliament never voted for it. The British people do not want it. This decision is wrong.”

An Adani spokesperson called the report “baseless and mischievous” in a statement, adding: “We are not aware of any investigation by US authorities on this subject.”
The WSJ said it had found tankers travelling between the Gulf and billionaire Gautam Adani’s Mundra port in western India exhibiting traits that experts say are common for ships evading sanctions.
It said the US Justice Department was reviewing the activities of several LPG tankers used to ship cargoes to Adani Enterprises, the group’s flagship entity, citing people familiar with the matter.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the report and the US Department of Justice and the US Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Adani said it did not handle any cargo from Iran at its ports, as a matter of policy. It said all its LPG trade, which accounts for 1.46 per cent of Adani Enterprises’ total revenue, was fully compliant with domestic and international laws, including US sanctions regulations.
A shipment referred to by the WSJ was handled as a “routine commercial transaction” via third-party logistics partners and supported by documentation identifying Sohar, Oman, as the port of origin, Adani said.
US President Donald Trump said in May that any party buying Iranian oil or petrochemical products would immediately be subject to secondary sanctions.
Last November, US authorities indicted Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, on suspicion of paying bribes to secure power supply contracts and misleading US investors during fund-raising in the United States.
Adani Group has denied the accusations and vowed to fight them.</p><small>2025-06-02 17:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/022218568cadfb6.jpg?r=231937' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915014/shoaib-akhtar-dr-nauman-niaz-reignite-feud-with-defamation-notice-sent-to-maverick-ex-pacer' target='_blank'><strong>Shoaib Akhtar, Dr Nauman Niaz reignite feud with defamation notice sent to maverick ex-pacer</strong></a><br><p>Former star cricketer Shoaib Akhtar received a defamation notice of Rs1 billion from sports journalist and former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) official Nauman Niaz on Monday, reigniting yet another feud between the two personalities.
The legal notice dated May 29, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, claimed that the ex-pacer made “baseless” and “unethical” comments regarding Niaz.
On May 25, Akhtar appeared on a show on a private news channel where he said that Niaz “used to carry our bags” and “he was kept for that purpose”, the notice stated.
“Your [Akhtar’s] comment/remark was not only factually incorrect, it was an assault on memory and dignity,” it said.
The notice read that Akhtar’s statement employed “foul and defamatory language” against Niaz, with the “sole intention of destroying the reputation acquired by him [Niaz] through hard work”.
“That the false statements and the representations made by you [Akhtar] … have injured the reputation of our client [Niaz], lowered him in the estimation of others, reduced him to ridicule, unjust criticism, dislike and contempt …”
“It is expected that our client will suffer severe financial and reputational loss and harm as a result of your actions,” it added.
The notice asked Akhtar to issue an apology and retraction within 14 days, otherwise, he will face legal proceedings under Defamation Ordinance 2002 with damages amounting to Rs1bn.
In a post on X, the former “Rawalpindi Express” wrote that he received a “legally defective, unfounded, ego-satisfying and utterly frivolous” defamation notice from Niaz, saying that he has contacted a lawyer “to draft and send a befitting reply in this regard”.
 






The pair have engaged in similar feuds in the past.
In 2021, Niaz tendered an “unconditional apology” for his misconduct with Akhtar in a live TV show a week ago, prompting the resignation of the former star pacer from the channel.
 
 

They were part of a panel for a PTV Sports programme, where Akhtar credited the Pakistan Super League’s Lahore Qalandars franchise for discovering Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf.
Niaz took issue with Akhtar’s comments and said: “You are being a little rude so I don’t want to say this but if you’re being over-smart then you can go. I am saying this on air.”
Once the show resumed after a break, Akhtar apologised to the guests on the panel and announced his resignation from PTV, saying that he could not continue with the programme because of “how I was treated on national television”.
Niaz later confessed to his “mistake” and said that the reaction to his outburst was justified. He added, “I had no right. To err is human and for that, I apologise. Not only once, but a million times. Shoaib has been a rock star. Whatever happened on camera was unbecoming.”</p><small>2025-06-02 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02205929a23981a.jpg?r=210901' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915012/responsibility-of-sc-judges-to-speak-truth-demands-courage-to-defy-political-pressure-justice-shah' target='_blank'><strong>Responsibility of SC judges to speak truth demands courage to defy political pressure: Justice Shah</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court (SC) Senior Puisne Judge Mansoor Ali Shah has said that SC justices have a responsibility to “speak truth to power, guided by the Constitution as their unwavering normative anchor”, in an interview seen by Dawn.com on Monday.
Shah has previously expressed that the judiciary needs to stand against influence or pressure from the executive. In November 2024, he said, “The independence of the judiciary is the cornerstone of justice, and its true test lies in a judge’s ability to stand firm under authoritarian regimes.”
Speaking exclusively to law magazine The Legal, Shah said that the role of SC justices must be understood as that of protectors of the Constitution and fundamental rights rather than as policymakers.
“Judges must balance respect for legislative intent with a commitment to constitutional principles, ensuring that the judiciary acts as an impartial arbiter rather than a policymaker,” he said in response to a question about the role of SC judges amid a shifting legal landscape.
“Their role demands not only legal expertise but also wisdom, courage, and humility, as their decisions profoundly impact individuals and society at large,” he added.
“At the heart of this role lies a deeper philosophical imperative: judges must speak truth to power, guided by the Constitution as their unwavering normative anchor.”
Justice Shah noted that this responsibility “requires not compromise but courage to defy political pressures, resist majoritarian impulses, and stand firm in the face of injustice”.
“Let future jurists not be defined by fear or fatigue, but by purpose. Let them carry forward a judiciary that is not complicit in silence, but committed to struggle. The Constitution doesn’t just need protection it needs protectors,” he emphasised.
Previously, Shah termed the passing of the 26th Constitutional Amendment “one of its (the judiciary’s) weakest moments in our history”, expressing concern that executive overreach was interfering in judicial affairs and processes.
In a letter to SC Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail written in December, Shah wrote, “This unprecedented shift in the composition of the JCP (Judicial Commission of Pakistan) poses grave risks, including the potential for political appointments and the packing of courts with judges lacking an ideological commitment to the rule of law.”
In a landmark decision in May, the SC allowed civilians accused in the May 9, 2023 riots — triggered by the arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan — to be tried in military courts, overturning an earlier ruling that declared military trials of civilians null and void.
However, the decision was not unanimous — the two dissenting judges, Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afghan — declared military court convictions “without jurisdiction” and unconstitutional. Rights groups and leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) have likewise decried the ruling, citing concerns over due process.
The legal fraternity weighed in too, warning that the judgment threatened the right to a fair trial and chipped away at civilian justice system.</p><small>2025-06-02 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02215413291465c.jpg?r=215509' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915016/madressah-teacher-held-by-muzaffargarh-police-for-alleged-rape' target='_blank'><strong>Madressah teacher held by Muzaffargarh police for alleged rape</strong></a><br><p>A madressah teacher who allegedly molested a student in Muzaffargarh’s Bet Mir Hazar Khan area has been arrested, police said on Monday.
According to Muzaffargarh District Police Officer Dr Rizwan Ahmed Khan, the teacher in Jatoi tehsil allegedly raped the student and locked him in the madressah for five days to prevent him from reporting the assault.
“The teacher had invited his young student to his room under the pretext of a massage and raped him,” DPO Khan alleged. “A case was registered against the teacher and he was taken into custody.”
The Bet Mir Hazar Khan Station House Officer (SHO) said, “Such a brutal person will be punished severely according to the law and such people do not deserve any concession.”
In a separate incident, police have said that they will arrest a tailor’s son who allegedly raped an 11-year-old girl and blackmailed her with video footage of the assault six months ago.
The incident took place in the Riazabad area of Kot Sultan, where a girl had gone to learn sewing at a tailor’s house and was allegedly later raped by his son.
She alleged that the suspect found her alone at home and raped her, filming the assault. Threatening to share the footage and “make it viral”, the suspect allegedly continued raping the victim for the last six months.
The girl’s father said that when questioned, the victim spoke about the incident. A medical examination revealed that the girl was five months pregnant.
A case has been registered at Kot Sultan police station upon the complaint of the victim’s father.
SHO Haroon Raza Randhawa said that under the supervision of DPO Layyah Ali Waseem, a case was registered and teams were formed to apprehend the suspect, whom he said “would be arrested soon”.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
It showed that nine children were abused per day during the year, while a gender-divide analysis indicated that out of the total reported cases, 1,791 (53 per cent) victims were girls and 1,573 (47pc) boys.</p><small>2025-06-02 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607420-pakistan-and-china-call-for-peace-in-south-asia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan and China call for peace in South Asia</strong></a><br><p>

Officials have beefed up heat mitigation measures, hoping to avoid a repeat of last year’s Haj, which saw 1,301 pilgrims die as temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius.
Temperatures were forecast to exceed 40 degrees Celsius this week as one of the world’s largest annual religious gatherings starts on Wednesday.
 
 

The Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam, must be performed at least once by all Muslims with the means to do so.
As of Friday, more than 1.3 million pilgrims had arrived in Saudi Arabia for the multi-day pilgrimage, according to officials.
This year, authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials, doubling their efforts against heat-related illness following the lethal heatwave of 2024.
Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres (12 acres), thousands more medics will be on standby and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, Saudi Arabia’s Haj minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah told AFP last week.

Today, with temperatures topping 40 degrees Celsius, the health ministry said 44 cases of heatstroke had already been treated.
The latest artificial intelligence technology will also help monitor the flood of data and footage, including video from a new fleet of drones, from across Makkah to better manage the mammoth crowds.
Despite the punishing heat, pilgrims were overjoyed as they arrived in Makkah.
‘Very, very, very hot’
“This is really a blessing from Allah,” Abdul Majid Ati, a Filipino lawyer and Sharia counsellor, told AFP near the Grand Mosque.
“We feel so peaceful and safe in this place.”
Abdulhamid, from Nigeria, said he was “very happy” to be performing his second pilgrimage in a row at just 27 years old.
But the young man said he never walks out without his sunglasses, describing the temperatures in Makkah as “very, very, very hot”.
The rites in the holy city and its surroundings, which follow a lunar calendar, fall again this year during the hot month of June.
Last year, most of the deaths were among unregistered pilgrims who lacked access to air-conditioned tents and buses.
“They were caught by surprise because the intensity of the heat was so high that their adaptation measures failed,” said Fahad Saeed of Climate Analytics, a think tank based in Germany.
In the run-up to this year’s Haj, Saudi authorities launched a widespread crackdown on unregistered worshippers, using frequent raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.
Arrest and deportation
Haj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals by lottery.
But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt the Haj without a permit — though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.
Along with hefty fines, those found illegally entering Makkah during the Haj face a potential 10-year ban from Saudi Arabia.
Large crowds at the Haj have proved hazardous in the past, most recently in 2015 when a stampede during the “stoning the devil” ritual in Mina, near Makkah, killed up to 2,300 people in the deadliest Haj disaster.
Saudi Arabia earns billions of dollars each year from the Haj and Umrah pilgrimages undertaken at other times of the year.
The pilgrimages are also a source of prestige for the Saudi monarch, who is known as the custodian of the two holy mosques of Makkah and Medina.
For Mariama, a 52-year-old pilgrim from Senegal, the journey to Makkah has fulfilled a lifelong dream.
“I was dreaming about it, thinking about it every time to come here to do the Haj,” she said.</p><small>2025-06-02 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607408-bilawal-vows-to-present-pakistans-message-of-peace-with-dignity-and-equality-at-un' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal vows to present Pakistan's message of ‘peace with dignity and equality' at UN</strong></a><br><p>

According to the Saudi Ministry of Haj and Umrah, over 7,000 volunteers work across Makkah and other holy places to facilitate the pilgrims. They are the “unseen anchors” whose efforts, often behind the scenes, ensure that the pilgrims do not face hardships.
“You may not know their names. You may not remember their faces. But
if you have ever performed Haj, you have felt their kindness — a bottle of cold water pressed into your hand, a voice gently guiding you when you felt lost,” the ministry said.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
The statement said that the volunteers sacrifice their own Eid celebrations, sleep and comfort so that they can help out the pilgrims in many ways, narrating the stories of multiple volunteers.
One of the volunteers, Amani Al-Atawi, who was the executive director of the Sharaf Association, was the one who welcomes people at the border town of Halat Ammar.
“Amani and her team are already on their feet — offering cool bottles of water, sweet dates, and clear directions in languages the pilgrims can understand.
It’s simple, but powerful. That first smile. That gentle hand offering help
without being asked. It sets the tone for everything that follows.”
The statement said that Amani sees her work as a “calling” which extends to “a sense of calm, care, and welcome that stays with pilgrims long after they have moved on from the border”.
It further said that she has exchanged Eid festivities for long shifts, without being with her family. “It’s hard … My family asks why I’m not home, but when I see a pilgrim’s
face light up with gratitude, or when they whisper a dua for me, it’s like I’m
carrying their blessings back to my family. That’s worth everything,” she was quoted as saying.
Another volunteer was the 24-year-old Huda Alalawi, who was an emergency medical specialist and paramedic. She was quoted in the statement as saying, “It makes me feel truly present, and that my existence has real value.”
Huda has played a critical role since 2022 to “preserve the lives of pilgrims, alleviate their pain, and provide them with necessary medical care”, the statement said, adding, “She frequently utilises Nusuk cards for swift access to pilgrim information and seamless coordination of urgent needs, actively lending her expertise to
bolster the Red Crescent’s broader medical support efforts across the holy
sites.”

The ministry said that the pilgrims might come across “youthful presence”, such as the 22-year-old Khalid Al-Mansour, who was a psychology student. “Khalid might sit with a young man from Nigeria, visibly overwhelmed by the sheer crowds and the
relentless heat,” the statement said.
He was quoted as saying, “Haj can be intense — spiritually, physically. I tell them it’s okay to feel lost. That’s part of the journey.”
One of the older volunteers was the 56-year-old Bakheet Alghamdi, who has worked as a Haj volunteer for 36 years, according to the ministry. He was a certified first aid trainer who was “often found guiding lost pilgrims, expertly managing
transport, or providing critical medical support when it is needed most”.
The statement said that he once performed CPR to save a pilgrim’s life, while another time, he was responsible for reuniting a wheelchair-bound couple from
Pakistan.
“Most pilgrims may not remember their [volunteers’] names. But they will never forget the kindness — the outstretched hand, the quiet reassurance, the unexpected calm in a moment of need,” the statement said, stressing that their efforts do not “ echo loudly“, but were steady, and full of compassion and care.

The PCC was officially launched in March to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
According to a press release by the finance ministry, the meeting was chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and attended by PCC Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib, governor of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), chairman of Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and government officials.
“The meeting focused on the draft regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets in Pakistan, aiming to align with international standards and evolving technological trends,” the press release said.
It added that the participants discussed options for establishing “an autonomous regulatory authority to oversee and regulate the digital finance and crypto ecosystem in the country”.
“It was agreed to constitute a technical committee comprising representatives from SBP, SECP, Law Division, and IT & Telecom Division,” the ministry said, adding that the committee will review the draft laws and propose a robust framework and governance structure to be reviewed by the PCC in the next meeting.
The press release said that the PCC members gave valuable input for “a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment” which aims to promote “responsible blockchain adoption, safeguarding investors, and advancing financial inclusion”.
The finance minister appreciated the contributions of all stakeholders and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to creating a “future-ready financial infrastructure that supports innovation while maintaining financial stability and regulatory compliance”, it added.
 
 

Last week, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance held a meeting, where PPP MNA Sharmila Farooqi introduced a bill on digital currency regulations. Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said that the ban on cryptocurrency was still in place across Pakistan, stressing the need for its regulation during the meeting.
The same day, Saqib had unveiled the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. He announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance”.
Cryptocurrencies are gaining momentum globally as the number of use cases is increasing and many countries are now making them legal. However, it has had a mixed reception by regulators globally.
In some countries, like El Salvador, it has legal tender status, while in others, including Pakistan, India and China, it is not accepted as payment for goods and services, nor can one own it legally, though it is not officially banned either.</p><small>2025-06-02 15:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021722523c25247.jpg?r=172306' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911026/doctored-screenshots-posing-as-dawn-circulate-on-social-media-heres-how-you-can-verify' target='_blank'><strong>Doctored screenshots posing as DAWN circulate on social media — here’s how you can verify</strong></a><br><p>Screenshots of news stories doctored to look like articles on DAWN.com have been circulating on social media since at least March, with certain images posted in the form of sponsored ads on social media platforms leading to dubious links.
DAWN has taken up the matter of the impersonated images with the relevant authorities. All news stories by DAWN will appear on its website or can be checked on its official social media accounts:

Doctored images
The earliest known such image spotted this year was of former caretaker foreign minister Jalil Abbas Jilani with the following headline in upper case: “THE ACCUSATIONS AGAINST JALIL ABBAS JILANI HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED!”
 


Immediately, the image presents stark differences when compared with articles on DAWN.com.
 



The doctored image’s headline is centred, whereas DAWN’s headlines are left-aligned

Viewed on a desktop, the headline is followed by the author byline, dateline and social media plugins before the picture, whereas these elements are missing in the doctored image
There is no attribution or detail in the headline of the doctored image as to whose allegations or what types of allegations were confirmed by whom

The former foreign minister was the subject of another similar hoax article that was also shared as a sponsored ad with the following title: “Pakistan central bank sues Jalil Abbas Jilani for his remarks on live TV show”.
 


This doctored image also presents several discrepancies that can tip readers off to the fact that it’s not a genuine article on DAWN.

The author byline, dateline and social media plugins remain missing
DAWN does not overlay text over images in its articles

The Ministry of Information had fact-checked both alleged reports in a post on X on March 13, denouncing them as fake.
 






More recently on May 1, an alleged screenshot of DAWN.com was shared by an Indian account on X with the following title: “Fears Mount Over F-16 Security After Aircraft Theft Linked to TTP”, claiming that the news outlet had reported that the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan militant group had stolen an F-16 fighter jet of the Pakistan Air Force.
Among others, doctored screenshots of alleged stories on PTI founder Imran Khan and the army chief were also widely shared.
 


Comparing the screenshot with an image of a report from DAWN’s official website showed the same glaring error as mentioned above, of the headline written in uppercase, unlike the outlet’s normal style.
The spacing between the headline and byline is also noticeably larger than the consistent format seen on DAWN.com.
 


The viral screenshot was also fact-checked by iVerify Pakistan.
More tips to spot fakes
Apart from the format issues identified above through comparing doctored screenshots with genuine articles, here are more tips that can help you determine fake or doctored DAWN articles.
1. Perform a keyword search
If in doubt, perform a keyword search using the main elements from a headline. If true, the results will either bring up the authentic DAWN article or similar reports from other publications on the same development.
If the search yields nothing, then that viral image or story you saw is more likely to be fake.
2. Specific DAWN website keyword search
For a more specific keyword search, showing only results from DAWN’s website, perform the following:

Enter the following format on your search engine: “Name of article site:Dawn.com”
The results will only yield relevant articles and reports from the DAWN website
If the story is authentic, it will likely pop up in the first hit

3. Check archives
Depending on whether or not the doctored images and stories have datelines to go with them, as in the fake F-16 story above, you can corroborate whether DAWN actually published such a story. Here’s how:

Go to the Dawn.com homepage

Click on the ARCHIVE section in the top bar
Select the date on the calendar for which you want to see all stories published

Performing the above for the F-16 story yielded no such report on the news outlet’s website for May 1, 2025.
Pattern of repetition
These were not the first attempts to mislead the public by circulating fake news using the DAWN brand.
In April 2020, a fake social media post doctored to pose as DAWN.com surfaced on Facebook and Instagram, attempting to mislead the public by suggesting that then-army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa had been “possibly infected” with Covid-19 and falsely claimed that he was under self-quarantine.
In October 2018, another fake screenshot of a news story attempted to mislead the public by suggesting that PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz was expecting and falsely claimed that “DAWN news” had obtained her medical reports.
Earlier in August that year, yet another screenshot of a fake news story falsified to look like an article on DAWN.com had surfaced on social media, in an attempt to mislead the public by implying that then-PTI leader Faisal Vawda had withdrawn a petition against the alleged corruption of Karachi mayor Wasim Akhtar.
In a similar occurrence, in June 2018, a fake Facebook post screenshot doctored to pose as DAWN.com was shared on social media. It attempted to misinform the public and stakeholders by suggesting that Afghanistan had accepted the Durand Line as an official border.
The doctored image led the Afghan National Security Council to issue a press release that mistakenly assumed the post was legitimate.</p><small>2025-06-02 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02162751957536b.jpg?r=163224' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914985/russia-ukraine-swap-peace-roadmaps-at-istanbul-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Russia, Ukraine swap peace roadmaps at Istanbul talks</strong></a><br><p>Russia and Ukraine on Monday swapped plans for ending their three-year war during talks in Istanbul aiming to find a way out of Europe’s largest conflict since World War II.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said any deal must not “reward” Russian leader Vladimir Putin, but said Kyiv was willing to take the “necessary steps for peace”.
Urged on by US President Donald Trump, Moscow and Kyiv have opened direct negotiations for the first time since the early weeks of Russia’s invasion, but have yet to make progress towards an agreement.
Monday’s talks come a day after Ukraine carried out one of its most brazen and successful attacks ever on Russian soil — using drones to hit dozens of strategic bombers parked at airbases thousands of kilometres behind the front line.
A first round of meetings in Istanbul last month yielded a large-scale prisoner exchange but no pause in the fighting, which has raged since Russia invaded in February 2022.
On Monday, the delegations “exchanged documents through the Turkish side, and we are preparing a new release of prisoners of the war,” Zelensky said at a press conference in Vilnius just after the talks in Istanbul concluded.
“The key to lasting peace is clear, the aggressor must not receive any reward for war. Putin must get nothing that would justify his aggression,” he added.
Opening the talks at the Ciragan Palace in Istanbul — an Ottoman imperial house on the banks of the Bosphorus that is now a luxury five-star hotel — Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the “eyes of the entire world” were watching.
Zelensky had said Kyiv was “ready to take the necessary steps for peace”, though the Russian and Ukrainian negotiating positions have long appeared irreconcilable.
‘Immediate ceasefire’
“If they are ready to move forward, not just repeat the same previous ultimatums, then there may be good and big news today,” a source in the Ukrainian delegation said ahead of the talks.
Ukraine wants a “full and unconditional ceasefire” to allow space to then discuss a long-term settlement. Russia has repeatedly rejected those calls.
Moscow says it wants to address the “root causes” of the conflict — language typically used to refer to a mix of sweeping demands including limiting Ukraine’s military, banning the country from joining Nato and massive territorial concessions.
Kyiv and the West say those concerns are baseless and that Russia’s assault is nothing but an imperialist land grab.
Tens of thousands have been killed since Russia invaded, with swathes of eastern and southern Ukraine destroyed and millions forced to flee their homes, in Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II.
‘No home’
In the frontline town of Dobropillya in eastern Ukraine, 53-year-old Volodymyr told AFP that he believes the talks in Istanbul would amount to very little.
“We thought that everything would stop. And now there is nothing to wait for.
We have no home, nothing. We were almost killed by drones,” he said.
In Kramatorsk, a garrison city near the front with trenches and rolls of barbed wire on its outskirts, a Ukrainian serviceman also said the talks in Turkiye would not likely bring out about any results.
“I have no faith in them. But it would be great if they could agree to stop, to have some kind of respite, so that we could take our guys, those who died, and so that guys would just stop dying,” he told AFP, sipping a coffee.
After months of setbacks for Kyiv’s military, Ukraine said it had carried out an audacious attack on Sunday, damaging some 40 strategic Russian bombers worth $7 billion in a major special operation.
Kyiv’s security service said the plan — 18 months in the making — had involved smuggling drones into Russia, then launching them from near the airbases, thousands of kilometres away from the front lines.
On the ground, Russia’s territorial advance gained pace in May, according to AFP analysis of data from the US-based Institute for the Study of War (ISW).
Ahead of the talks, Russian officials have called for Ukraine to be cut off from Western military support and cede territory still controlled by its army.
Kyiv has previously accepted it may only be able to get territory taken by Russia through diplomacy, not fighting.
Ukraine also wants concrete Western-backed security guarantees — like Nato protections or troops on the ground — that have been ruled out by Russia.</p><small>2025-06-02 14:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02122044793f02b.png?r=122300' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914954/karachi-residents-feel-more-low-intensity-tremors' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi residents feel more low-intensity tremors</strong></a><br><p>Another low-intensity earthquake was felt by Karachi residents on Monday, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).
The tremor was the third within 24 hours.
The most recent quake measured 3.2 on the Richter scale with the city’s densely populated Quaidabad area as its epicentre. The area’s residents had also experienced a similar 3.6-magnitude tremor at 5:33pm yesterday.
Both earthquakes originated at a shallow depth of 10 kilometres beneath the surface.

A separate tremor originating near the city’s Gadap Town was recorded at 1:05am earlier today. It measured 3.2 on the Richter scale and had a depth of 12km.
Ameer Hyder, the chief meteorologist at the Met Office in Karachi, told Dawn.com that the tremors were caused by an active fault line in Landhi.
He noted that the quakes’ intensity was not high and was “gradually declining”. While stating that no formal prediction could be made yet, Hyder expected the tremors to end within a week.

Experts have previously pointed out that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.
The country had witnessed around 20 low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.
 
 

In April, jolts were felt in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab — including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore — twice that month.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — according to geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.

Images showed a massive grey cloud billow forth from the volcano on the island of Sicily, beginning about 11:24am local time (0924 GMT), according to the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV).
Surveillance cameras showed “a pyroclastic flow probably produced by a collapse of material from the northern flank of the Southeast Crater”, the agency said.
A pyroclastic flow occurs when volcanic rock, ash and hot gasses surge from volcanos. They are extremely dangerous.
The explosive activity “had transitioned to a lava fountain”, INGV said, with the plume of ash expected to dissipate towards the southwest.
A red alert issued for aviation authorities said the height of the volcanic cloud was estimated at 6.5 kilometres.

The government has adopted austerity measures for the upcoming budget — set to be announced on June 10 — in line with the demands of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to implement stricter spending policies and raise revenues to reduce the budget deficit and improve debt sustainability, as part of its $7 billion loan programme. The global money lender also expects Pakistan to achieve a 3.6 per cent economic growth with 7.7pc inflation next year.
Speaking to reporters in Islamabad after a meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee, the planning minister noted that since 2023, the development budget had decreased, stating that Pakistan was observing “tight financial discipline in order to balance spending and income” — a process he said had been agreed upon with the IMF.
“Pakistan has faced such severe inflation that the federal government would end up spending the money it collected from the provincial governments to pay off loans,” he explained.
“The reason we have these debts is because the govt in power between 2018 and 2022 took multiple loans and the policy rate rose to 23pc due to heavy inflation,” Iqbal added. “Repaying those loans became 55pc of our spending. As a result, this has affected our development budget.”
“Since resources are limited, we need to focus on high-priority projects for national development.  We need to ensure ‘value for money’ in selecting projects.
“Efficiency and prioritisation of investment are two important pillars to fulfil lack of resources,” the federal minister said earlier while addressing the committee meeting.
He said that fiscal space will be provided in the next PSDP for projects of strategic importance. He said efforts have been made to align the development budget with national priorities while staying within limited resources.
The minister recalled that when the PML-N was voted out of government in 2018, the defence and development budgets were Rs1 trillion each.
Breaking down the development budget, Iqbal said that Rs664bn would be allocated to infrastructure projects including energy, water, transport and planning.
“The energy, water and highway sectors will be prioritised,” he noted.
He added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered that Rs120bn of the Rs1 trillion development budget be allocated to upgrade the N-25 Highway in Balochistan, which runs from Chaman to Karachi through Quetta.
“The road will be upgraded to an expressway,” he said. “Excepting this project, we have Rs880bn with which we have to balance the PSDP (Public Sector Development Programme).”
Iqbal further said that special areas such as Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan would receive Rs63bn, while the merged districts in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa would receive Rs70bn.
“Science and IT (Information Technology) will receive Rs53bn, bodies performing institutional reform will get Rs9bn, while the production sector will receive Rs11bn. Altogether, this makes Rs1tr,” he outlined.
“Our guiding principle was to make sure that we prioritise projects for which we have rupee cover and foreign funding available,” Iqbal explained. “Those projects of national importance are protected. At the same time, projects in their advanced stages will also receive funding to achieve completion.
“We will move away from token allocation as it renders projects unhealthy,” he added, further stating that the government will try and ensure transparency through a comprehensive monitoring system where projects will be observed by satellite.
Outlining the government’s annual plan, Iqbal expected Pakistan’s GDP to grow by 4.2 per cent.
He added, “4.5pc of that will be agriculture, 4.3pc from industry and 4pc from services.”
The planning minister said that the country set a target of $35bn for its exports and $39bn for foreign remittances.
“Remittances reached $27bn in 2022-23 and can reach $37bn in 2024-25 — an increase of $10bn,” he said. “I want to thank overseas Pakistanis for ignoring negative calls and claims that ‘overseas Pakistanis are upset’ and calls for boycotts and continuing to send remittances.
“It is a very big contribution and it is like oxygen to us,” he added, stating that there is scope for remittance figures to climb to $50bn in the future.
Iqbal mentioned that Pakistan had among the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the world. “We are ranked among the lowest tax collectors in the world. The rate is hardly 10pc whereas developing countries ahead of us collect 16-18pc,” he said.
“If we are serious about the nation’s development, then tax collection, tax evasion, and tax reforms will have to be considered as an aspect of national security as the top most priority,” the minister asserted.
“Every citizen should be watchman against tax evasion,” adding that the government is taking action against those earning millions but not paying taxes. He urged tax paying citizens to cooperate with the government against evaders.
Iqbal mentioned that within the next five years, the government needs to raised large amount of resources to fulfill the development budget.
“Last fiscal year, we started with Rs1400 billion, but it was reduced to Rs1100 bn. This year it has further reduced to Rs1000 bn. I think this raises a huge question mark about our future and is a sign for concern,” the minister cautioned.
“To reverse this situation, we need to increase the tax collection by huge proportions.”
He said the federal government will hand over development projects by provinces to the provincial governments and focus on projects by the Centre, adding that such projects are a huge strain on resources.
He mentioned that the federal budget has projects devolved to provinces but still a responsibility of the federal government, adding such projects have “reduced the space” of the Centre.
“Till 2018, PSDP hardly had 12-14 pct provincial projects. Between 2012-2013, the federal government moved forward with record development projects.
“After 2018, provincial projects began to creep in. By 2022, when we came back (to power), they were around 40 pct.”
Iqbal said while selecting PSDP for the upcoming year, the government ensured that international projects or those linked with multi-lateral organisations should be provided rupee cover as the top most priority.
He said the government ensured that allocations of resources for regions such a Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Kashmir, and merged areas are protected and there is no deduction so their requirements are fulfilled.
He said the third priority was that projects 70-80 pct in completion phase are allocated huge sums so they are completed and “moved from the books and improve our portfolio” and do not incur further costs.
Furthermore, he said under Uraan Pakistan initiative, the government needs to ensure that projects of “strategic importance” are allocated sufficient funds. This includes funds for Diamer Basha dam which is vital to address the water crisis that the government will have to complete with speed.
For connectivity, he said projects like Sukkur-Hyderabad motorway, Quetta-Chaman road, and second phase of Karakoram highway need to be prioritised.
Iqbal called for allocating funds to incomplete projects of Higher Education Commission so that the youth are not affected.
“We need to increase tertiary education by three times. Pakistan already have the lowest ratio in the region. Our ratio is 13 pct, India has 30 pct, Bangladesh has 25 pct, and China has 60 pct. We need to increase it in the future,” he asserted.
Regarding projects on low priority that could be frozen or shut down, the minister said the government has identified 118 projects worth Rs1000bn that need to be placed on low priority or capped to save resources.</p><small>2025-06-02 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0217570709e810a.jpg?r=175856' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914996/eight-injured-in-flamethrower-attack-on-israeli-hostage-protest-in-us' target='_blank'><strong>Eight injured in ‘flamethrower’ attack on Israeli hostage protest in US</strong></a><br><p>In the face of rising criticism of Israeli atrocities on Gaza, which has killed nearly 54,000 Palestinians, a man in the United States yelling “free Palestine” used incendiary devices to torch protesters rallying in support of Israeli hostages, injuring at least eight people in the US state of Colorado on Sunday.
The FBI said it was investigating the incident as a “targeted terror attack” and identified the suspect as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman.
He was booked into the county jail just before midnight on multiple felony charges, according to county records. His bond has been set at $10 million.
The incident comes as pressure on Israel rises to cease what has been called a “genocide” in Gaza by the United Nations and Amnesty International among other international human rights organisations.
Police in the city of Boulder said it was too early to determine a motive for the attack, which took place shortly before 1:30pm (12:30am PKT) at a demonstration outside a mall.
The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish activist group, said the “violent anti-Semitic attack” occurred at Sunday’s “Run for Their Lives” event, a weekly gathering of the Jewish community in solidarity with hostages seized during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the onslaught in Gaza.
FBI agent Mark Michalek told reporters the attack happened at a “regularly scheduled weekly peaceful event”.
“Witnesses are reporting that the subject used a makeshift flamethrower and threw an incendiary into the crowd,” he said, adding that “the suspect was heard to yell: ‘Free Palestine!’”
Boulder Police said that eight victims, four men and four women aged between 52 and 88, were transported to hospitals.
Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn told reporters that “at least one victim was very seriously injured, probably safe to say critical condition.”
The suspect was also injured before being taken into custody, Redfearn said.
Molotov cocktails
In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding clear bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.
He can be heard screaming “End Zionists!” and “They are killers!” towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground.
Other images showed billowing black smoke.
Boulder resident Alexis Cendon said he felt “very, very scared” after hearing about the attack near his workplace.
Sunday’s attack occurred during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot.
It comes almost two weeks after the fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington, where a 31-year-old suspect, who shouted “Free Palestine,” was arrested.
Boulder Police Chief Redfearn insisted it was “way too early to speculate motive,” but FBI chief Kash Patel described the incident as “a targeted terror attack”.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser labelled it “a hate crime”.
“People may have differing views about world events and the Israeli-Hamas conflict, but violence is never the answer to settling differences,” Weiser said.
White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller posted on X that the suspect was a foreign national who “illegally overstayed [his] visa”.
Fox News and CBS both cited US officials as saying Soliman was an Egyptian national.
The White House said President Donald Trump had been briefed on the incident.
‘Burning the streets’
Israel’s top diplomat Gideon Saar condemned Sunday’s “terrible anti-Semitic terror attack targeting Jews in Boulder”.
Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations Danny Danon also voiced outrage.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also described the Boulder incident as a “targeted terror attack,” while Attorney General Pam Bondi termed it “a horrific anti-Semitic attack”. Lawmakers on both sides of the political aisle expressed revulsion.
“Tonight, a peaceful demonstration was targeted in a vile, antisemitic act of terror,” top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a statement. “Once again, Jews are left reeling from repeated acts of violence and terror.”
Several organisations also decried the violence.
“This is an attack on all of us — and we will not stay silent,” the Israeli-American Council said in a statement.</p><small>2025-06-02 13:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021727529b6563d.png?r=172808' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914994/govt-announces-four-day-eidul-azha-holidays' target='_blank'><strong>Govt announces four-day Eidul Azha holidays</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Monday announced a four-day public holiday on the festive occasion of Eidul Azha.
According to a notification issued by the Cabinet Division, the government has declared a public holiday from June 6-9, 2025 (Friday to Monday).
“The prime minister has been pleased to declare the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th (Friday to Monday) as public holidays on the occasion of Eidul Azha,” the statement said.
Pakistan would observe Eidul Azha on June 7, the moon sighting Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) announced last month after the crescent for the month of Zilhaj was not sighted.
The committee’s meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad’s Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its office.
Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, “No testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan […]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.”
He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.
Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to see the moon. Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.
Dr Mohammad Hasan Ali, director of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Pakistan Meteorological Department; Shaukatullah Khan of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco); and Zainul Abedin from the science and tech ministry were among those present during the meeting.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><small>2025-06-02 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/021605225736bd3.jpg?r=160711' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914964/main-suspect-held-after-video-of-citizen-being-assaulted-in-karachis-dha-goes-viral' target='_blank'><strong>Main suspect held after video of citizen being assaulted in Karachi’s DHA goes viral</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi police on Monday arrested a main suspect along with his two employees over charges of beating a citizen in the city’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
The development came after a video of the incident went viral on social media earlier today, prompting authorities to take notice of it.
The man, identified as Salman Farooqi, was arrested from DHA and his vehicle was impounded, Karachi South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said in a statement.
The man, travelling in a luxury car, allegedly subjected a bike rider, who was accompanied by a woman, to torture on the Khayaban-i-Ittehad road after a minor accident.
Earlier today, the police had arrested the suspect’s driver and guard during late-night raids on his home and office in DHA. DIG Raza clarified that the held suspect was not a government employee.
Stating that the citizen who was subjected to violence had not approached the police to file a complaint, the DIG said the police were trying to contact his family.
Meanwhile, the Gizri police registered a first information report (FIR) against the suspect, his armed guard and driver on complaint of a citizen named Mohammad Saleem under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506-B (threat to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Other PPC sections invoked included 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 342 (wrongful confinement) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).
According to the FIR, Saleem identified himself as a cell manager of a cellular company. The complainant said he had gone to Ittehad Commercial for recovery at around 8:35pm on Sunday when a minor accident took place between the bike rider and a Land Cruiser.
 
 

The complainant said Farooqi put the bike rider hostage at gunpoint inside his vehicle, after which he beat him, used abusive language and threatened him.
He added that the woman pleaded with the vehicle owner but he pushed her back with contempt.
DIG Raza said the police were taking the issue “extremely seriously” and that an investigation has been launched. He asserted that no one was above the law and vowed to promise “complete justice” to the aggrieved citizen.
“The suspects involved in the torture would be brought to justice and all requirements of justice would be fulfilled. The law is equal for all, and there is no exception,” he said.
Meanwhile, both Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar and Karachi Additional IG Javed Alam Odho directed the South senior superintendent of police to submit a detailed report on the incident.
They further ordered him to take action against the culprits, as no one was above the law.
In another road rage incident in Lahore in March, armed guards of a private security company reportedly fired shots at a car rider at Dharampura Underpass, thrashed him and fled the scene, leaving a vehicle and some weapons on the spot.
In October last year, three men were held for their alleged involvement in assaulting women during a quarrel at a restaurant in DHA. They were granted bail later.</p><small>2025-06-02 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607377-govt-notifies-four-day-holidays-for-eid-ul-adha' target='_blank'><strong>Govt notifies four-day holidays for Eid ul Adha</strong></a><br><p>

On a month-on-month basis, it decreased by 0.2pc in May as compared to a decrease of 0.8pc in the previous month, according to data.
This was higher than the finance ministry’s expectations, which had anticipated inflationary outlook to “remain between 1.5-2.0pc in May, with a possible rise to 3.0-4.0pc by June”.
The finance ministry had depicted a cautious outlook towards growth in Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), presenting a rising trajectory for inflation during May and June.
Topline Securities, in a note, said that inflation during 11MFY25 had averaged at 4.61pc compared to 24.52pc in 11MFY24.

“Iran is drafting a negative response to the US proposal, which could be interpreted as a rejection of the US offer,” the senior diplomat, who is close to Iran’s negotiating team, told Reuters.
The US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Oman’s Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, who was on a short visit to Tehran and has been mediating nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington.
But after five rounds of talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to resolve the nuclear standoff, many issues remain unresolved.
Among clashing red lines is Iran’s rejection of a US demand that Tehran commit to scrapping uranium enrichment, viewed as a potential pathway to developing nuclear bombs.
Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
“In this proposal, the US stance on enrichment on Iranian soil remains unchanged, and there is no clear explanation regarding the lifting of sanctions,” said the diplomat, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Tehran demands the immediate removal of all US-imposed curbs that impair its oil-based economy. But for the US, the removal of nuclear-related sanctions should be done in phases.
Dozens of Iranian institutions vital to Iran’s economy, including its central bank and national oil company, have been sanctioned since 2018 for, according to Washington, “supporting terrorism or weapons proliferation”.
Trump’s revival of a “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since his return to the White House in January has included tightened sanctions and threats to bomb Iran if current negotiations yield no deal.
During his first term, Trump in 2018 ditched Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. In return, Tehran has rapidly violated the 2015 nuclear pact’s curbs on its nuclear programme.
The 2015 deal required Iran to take steps to restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from US, EU and UN economic sanctions.
The diplomat said the assessment of “Iran’s nuclear negotiations committee”, under the supervision of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was that the US proposal is “completely one-sided” and cannot serve Tehran’s interests.
Therefore, the diplomat said, Tehran considers this proposal a “non-starter” and believes it unilaterally attempts to impose a “bad deal” on Iran through excessive demands.
Two Iranian officials told Reuters last week that Iran may pause uranium enrichment if the US releases frozen Iranian funds and recognises Tehran’s right to refine uranium for civilian use under a “political deal” that could lead to a broader nuclear accord.</p><small>2025-06-02 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607369-man-poisons-children-takes-own-life-after-failing-to-afford-eid-clothes' target='_blank'><strong>Man poisons children, takes own life after failing to afford Eid clothes</strong></a><br><p>

The by-election for PP-52 (Sambrial) took place yesterday, two months after the seat had fallen vacant following the demise of PML-N MPA Arshad Javed Warraich — father of the winning candidate.
Analysts had expected a tough one-on-one contest between the ruling PML-N and the PTI-backed aspirants, whereas the PPP had also been running an aggressive campaign in Sambrial to perform better in the race.
According to Form-47 issued by the ECP today and signed by Returning Officer Muhammad Iqbal, Warraich clinched the seat by winning 78,702 votes.
Warraich’s main opponent, Fakhir Nashat Ghumman, who was an independent candidate backed by the PTI, was the runner-up with 39,018 votes.
PPP’s Raheel Kamran Cheema ranked third with 6,832 ballots cast in his favour, followed by Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s Muhammad Shafaqat with 4,851 votes.
The balloting had remained peaceful throughout yesterday, except for verbal arguments between PTI supporters and the police at some polling stations out of a total of 185.
PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram accused the Punjab government and the police of interfering in the by-election, alleging that its polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. The former ruling party also claimed to have “video evidence of the rigging”.
 






However, Provincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah, in a statement, denied these allegations. He said the voting process continued in all 185 polling stations without any interruption till 5pm. He said that the election commission would review any complaint regarding irregularities if it was provided in a proper way.
The local administration, apparently for security reasons, had placed containers in front of the RO office — a move lambasted by the PTI as well as the PPP, which also staged a sit-in in front of the office in Sambrial.
PPP leader and ex-premier Raja Pervaiz Ashraf also added to the PTI’s rigging allegations.
Speaking to the media in Sambrial yesterday, flanked by PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza, Ashraf claimed polling stations had been closed in several areas by the administration.
The ex-premier said it would be unfortunate if the results were changed, adding that it would not be a good omen for the government. He said it was not tolerable that rigging took place during the by-election.
 






The ECP had set up 185 polling stations, categorising 11 as highly sensitive, 38 as sensitive, and 136 as normal. A total of 1,696 officers and staff had been deployed to perform election duties across these stations.
The total number of registered voters in PP-52 was 297,185, including 157,725 male voters and 139,460 female voters.
The voter turnout was recorded as 44.79 per cent, with a total of 133,096 ballots cast, out of which 130,837 were counted as submitted in the right manner.
Elected to serve, says  Hina Warraich
After her victory, Warraich told Dawn.com: “This is not just my victory — it is the victory of the people of Sambrial. They did not elect me for politics but for service, and I will do my utmost to live up to their expectations.”
The PML-N leader went on to thank Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, adding that her support helped her. Warraich had served as chairperson of the Sialkot district council from 2016 to 2020.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed gratitude for the victory, congratulating Warraich.
“Thanks to the unbreakable bond between the leadership and the workers, PML-N continues to reflect the will of the people,” the premier asserted in a post on X.
He credited the victory to the unwavering leadership of PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and CM Maryam, as well as the dedication of his party workers.
 






In a statement, CM Maryam also felicitated Warraich on her success. “Thanks to the people of Sambrial for once again placing their trust in PML-N,” she said.
“This victory is a validation of our policies. The public has sent a clear message that they want progress, service, and stability,” she said.
The chief minister stressed her government was actively working for public welfare in every constituency, pledging that those efforts would now be further accelerated.
“We will live up to the trust the people of Sambrial have shown in us,” CM Maryam was quoted as saying by her party.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to a first information report (FIR) registered at the local police station, the incident occurred on Sunday when unknown armed men opened fire on a polio team in the village of Sheikho in Tangir Valley, the constituency of GB’s Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan.
However, the polio team remained safe.
According to the FIR, as soon as the polio vaccination team returned to Sheikho village after completing their duties, two unknown armed men stopped the team’s vehicle at the RCC bridge.
“You all are ruining the environment here by bringing [unveiled] women from Gilgit in the name of the polio campaign.
“If you do this again, you won’t be able to escape,” they said before shooting at the polio team vehicle, which sustained a punctured tire. The armed men then fled towards a nearby hill.
The incident occurred at 1:45pm, according to the FIR.
According to GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, the chief minister  has taken notice of the incident and has directed strict action.
The polio monitoring team had been shifted to a safe place immediately after the incident, Faraq said.
He said the polio team went to the area “without informing the police”, leading to the “unfortunate” incident.
First polio case reported in GB
The first case of wild poliovirus has been reported in GB, bringing the national total to 11 this year, as the country continues to battle the debilitating disease.
The Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health in Islamabad confirmed the new case of wild poliovirus in GB’s Diamer district.
While providing details on the case, GB Health Secretary Asifullah Khan said a 23-month-old child was diagnosed with poliovirus in Diamer’s Tangir area.
He said that the child has not travelled outside the area, however, the virus strain has been confirmed to originate from Karachi’s Liaquatabad area.
Asifullah observed that there was a record of administering polio drops to the child. However, he added that the child was not provided with the vaccines to be given immediately after birth.
To a question, the health secretary said that the department has not announced the detection of poliovirus to the public, but the case has been confirmed.
This is the first case of wild poliovirus reported from GB and the 11th confirmed case in Pakistan this year, said a statement by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme.
The third nationwide polio vaccination campaign of 2025, which began on 26 May, concluded yesterday, successfully reaching over 45 million children under five years of age across 159 districts, including high-risk areas of the country.
The programme called on all parents to ensure their children do not miss out on any opportunity to receive polio drops.
Before the latest case, there had been no reported cases of poliovirus in GB and the region was declared a polio-free zone.
Polio is a highly infectious and debilitating disease with no cure. The only way to protect children is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for all children under five, as well as the timely completion of all vaccines offered as part of the essential immunisation schedule.
Last year, the country reported more than 70 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
This year’s first nationwide polio vaccination campaign was held in February, followed by a fractional IPV-OPV Polio (injectable polio vaccine) campaign in Quetta and Karachi on Feb 20 and 22, respectively. Around one million children were targeted for vaccination in this campaign.</p><small>2025-06-02 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/02140000d3b6cd1.png?r=140115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914967/australias-glenn-maxwell-quits-odis-to-focus-on-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Australia’s Glenn Maxwell quits ODIs to focus on T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has retired from one-day internationals to focus on next year’s T20 World Cup, the country’s cricket board said on Monday.
Maxwell took the decision to prioritise his preparation for the T20 World Cup, to be held in India and Sri Lanka, and his commitment to franchise leagues, Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement.
“I think back to right at the start I was picked ahead of my time and out of the blue. I was just proud just to be playing a couple of games for Australia. I thought I was just going to have that,” the two-time World Cup winner said in the statement.
“Since then, I have been able to go through the up and downs of being dropped, being brought back, playing in a few World Cups and being a part of some great teams.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The 36-year-old has played 149 ODIs for Australia, scoring 3,990 runs at a strike rate of 126.7 — second only to Andre Russell’s 130.22.
Maxwell’s 201 not out from 128 balls while battling cramps in a 2023 World Cup match against Afghanistan is considered the greatest knock in this format.
Maxwell, who played the last of his seven tests in 2017, told the Final Word Podcast that the toll of 50-overs cricket, especially after a leg injury he suffered in 2022, affected his fielding ability during the Champions Trophy earlier this year.
“I felt like I was letting the team down a little bit with how (the) body was reacting to the conditions,” he said.
“I had a good chat with (chairman of selectors) George Bailey and I asked him what his thoughts were going forward,” he told the Final Word Podcast.
“We talked about the 2027 World Cup and I said to him ‘I dont think I am going to make that, its time to start planning for people in my position to have a crack at it and make the position their own’.”
CA chief executive Todd Greenberg congratulated Maxwell for “one of the most exciting and influential one day international careers in the format’s history”.
“Glenns ballistic batting has lit up the cricket world and been one of the cornerstones of Australias continued success in the 50 over game, including his heroic role in the 2023 World Cup triumph,” Greenberg said.
 






South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen announces immediate retirement from cricket
South Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen on Monday announced his immediate retirement from international cricket, bringing an end to a distinguished seven-year career with the Proteas Men, the national cricket team said in a statement on X.
The 33-year-old announced on Monday that he would be stepping away from the white-ball formats, which follows his retirement from red-ball cricket in 2024.
Klaasen made his ODI and T20I debuts in the summer of 2018, and went on to establish himself as one of the most destructive white-ball players of his generation.
“He has played 60 ODIs and amassed over 2 000 runs at an average of just under 44 in the middle order,” Proteas Men said.
“His power-hitting prowess was on full display during a blistering career-best 174 against Australia at his home ground, SuperSport Park, in 2023 — the second highest score ever recorded by a number five.
Renowned for his dominance against spin, Klaasen also represented South Africa in 58 T20Is, striking at a rate of 141.84, Proteas Men said.

The PSG thrashed Inter Milan by a record 5-0 in Saturday evening’s final in Munich, flying back to Paris on Sunday for a triumphal parade along the Champs-Élysées, then celebrations in a packed Parc des Princes stadium on the edge of the French capital.
The PSG winning the biggest prize in European club football for the first time sparked delirious festivities in France, but was marred by violence.
On Sunday, “we saw a resurgence of individuals driven by malicious intent who were not really PSG supporters”, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez told RTL radio.
“We arrested 79 people, some of them in the night,” he said, adding that order had been restored before dawn.
 


Some were detained for taking barriers and briefly blocking the ring road around Paris, while others had tried to vandalise businesses or light fireworks on the Champs-Élysées, he said.
On Saturday night, police had made more than 500 arrests across France, the interior ministry said, after more than 200 cars were torched and police clashed with youths.
In the southwest town of Dax, a 17-year-old boy died after being stabbed in the chest.
A 23-year-old man riding a scooter in central Paris also died after being hit by a vehicle.
A policeman was in an induced coma after being injured by a firework.
 


Receiving the triumphant team at the Elysee palace yesterday, French President Emmanuel Macron condemned what he called “unacceptable” violence during the festivities.
 


Many of the stars of the team, one of the youngest in the competition, are drawn from the huge football talent pool in the Paris suburbs after PSG’s Qatari owners turned their back on the policy of signing star players like Neymar and Lionel Messi.
A total of 11.5 million people tuned in across France to watch the match.</p><small>2025-06-02 09:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607342-karachi-experiences-six-rounds-of-tremors-in-24-hours' target='_blank'><strong>Landhi Fault triggers nine quakes in Karachi in last 24 hours</strong></a><br><p>

The Foreign Office issued a statement today after a flurry of antagonistic statements made by Indian leaders, including one made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson on May 29 where he stated that talks on the Kashmir dispute will only be held “when Pakistan hands over [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] to us”.
 






Responding to the antagonistic remarks, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said, “Any attempt to portray Pakistan as the source of regional instability is divorced from reality.
“The international community is well aware of India’s record of aggressive behavior, including documented support for terrorist activities within Pakistan,” he stated, adding that those facts could not be “obscured by hollow narratives or diversionary tactics”.
 
 

He reiterated that the Kashmir dispute remained a “core issue threatening peace and stability in the region” and the country will continue to advocate for a “just and lasting resolution to the Kashmir dispute in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.
He noted that the remarks made on the Indian side “underscored the utter futility of jingoism and coercion”, and that India will not be able to achieve its objectives through threats.
“Pakistan remains committed to peace and constructive engagement, but it is equally resolved to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression,” he stated.
The spokesperson emphasised that peace in the region demanded “maturity, restraint, and a willingness to address the root causes of conflict”.</p><small>2025-06-02 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607312-on-london-sojourn-nawaz-says-pml-n-made-pakistan-nuclear-power-built-jf-17-with-china' target='_blank'><strong>On London sojourn, Nawaz says PML-N made Pakistan nuclear power, built JF-17 with China</strong></a><br><p>
