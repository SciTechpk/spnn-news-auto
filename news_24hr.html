<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1923003/killing-fields' target='_blank'><strong>Killing fields</strong></a><br><p>AS Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, along with their respective delegations, sat down to dinner in the White House on Monday, Israeli forces were busy doing what they have been doing in the killing fields of Gaza for the past 21 months: murdering and pillaging.
And perhaps the most unfortunate development during this meeting was the fact that the Israeli leader — responsible for the murder of tens of thousands of Palestinian men, women and children — announced that he had nominated Mr Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Sometimes reality is far more grotesque than fiction. And though negotiations for a possible ceasefire continue, no one should doubt Israel’s long-term intentions even if the butchery stops: the Israeli state seeks to ethnically cleanse the occupied territories of their Palestinian inhabitants, and forever obstruct the chances of a viable Palestinian state.
 
 

Those who believe a two-state solution is still possible should listen closely to what Mr Netanyahu said at the White House. “Never again” he declared when discussing a “complete state” for the Palestinians, while adding that “overall security will always remain in our hands”. By security, one assumes the Israeli leader means that Tel Aviv will always retain the ‘right’ to butcher Palestinians into submission should they step out of line. As for Gaza? The Israeli leader repeated the intention to ethnically cleanse the Strip, and ship the Palestinians off to other countries.
His defence minister offered more details, saying that all of Gaza’s Palestinians will be rounded up into a concentration camp in Rafah, and after “deradicalisation”, they will be “encouraged” to leave for other states. Perhaps starvation and mass murder are amongst the methods the Israeli state uses to ‘encourage’ Palestinians to flee. But the brave people of Gaza are not ready to go anywhere; they would rather die on their land than face expulsion and exile.
Ever since the Oct 7, 2023 events, over 57,000 people have been slaughtered by Israel in Gaza. However, the Gaza Mortality Survey, conducted by experts from the UK and other Western states, suggests the actual death toll may be over 83,000.
But to the world these are mere numbers; no one has the moral courage to halt this massacre. What is particularly shocking is how much Zionism in modern Israel resembles Nazism in 20th-century Europe. Both are exclusionary ideologies, with their followers known to perpetrate unimaginable cruelty. The Nazis sent their victims off to the gas chambers; the Israeli state oversees a genocide in Gaza. But while Nazism is today rightly condemned the world over, the modern followers of Zionism get the best seat at the table, and are wined and dined by the world’s most powerful leaders, as the children of Gaza suffer and die in pain.

• Limited funds, land acquisition, geographical and security challenges cited as reasons for delays
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Monday expressed dissatisfaction over National Highway Authority’s (NHA) ‘poor performance’ and ‘lack of merit and transparency’ in award of mega infrastructure projects.
The Senate standing committee on communications directed the authority to ensure greater transparency, better project management, and enhanced coordination among relevant stakeholders to ensure timely and efficient completion of vital infrastructure projects across the country.
Chaired by Senator Pervaiz Rash­­id, the committee meeting reviewed the status of the ongoing NHA projects under public sector development programme (PSDP) and examine toll tax revenue details.
The senators expressed serious dissatisfaction over the lack of progress despite funds being made available. They also criticised the communications secretary besides the NHA for failing to meet their commitments.
When the NHA chairman reassured the parliamentary body that all pending projects would be initiated without further delay, the committee sought a regular update on progress.
Senators Saifullah Abro and Za­­mir Hussain Ghumro raised strong objections to the award of Tranche-III project to Ningxia Commu­nic­a­tion Construction — a company previously disqualified for failing to co­­­mplete the Lodhran-Multan project.
Senator Abro highlighted a conflict of interests, noting that the arbitrator appointed in a related dispute was allegedly a former legal adviser of the company.
The committee, however, agreed to address the matter separately in next sittings.
Senator Mohammad Abdul Qadir called for timely payments to contractors to avoid delays and asked the government to protect contractors’ rights during project allocation.
Senators Dost Ali Jeesar, Zamir Hussain Ghumro, Palwasha Moham­mad Zai Khan, Kamil Ali Agha, Ab­­dul Wasay, Asad Qasim and Jam Saif­­ullah also attended the meeting.
Rajanpur-D.I. Khan carriageway
The senators were briefed on the additional carriageway project along the Rajanpur-D.G. Khan (121km) and D.G. Khan-D.I. Khan (208km) portions of the National Highway (N-55) under the CAREC Corridor Development Investment Programme, Tranche-III. The NHA chairman said the ADB-funded project, whose PC-1 was approved in 2023, had 11 bypasses, but pending land acquisition delayed work. It would take at least three to four months more to begin work on the project, the panel was informed.
The Senate committee chairman noted that delays significantly increased overall costs and said priority should be given to completing the ongoing projects instead of initiating work on other projects.
PSDP
However, NHA officials briefed the committee that uplift projects under the PSDP (2025-26) were categorised as critical national projects, petroleum development levy projects, essential rupee-cover projects, near-completion projects and strategic new projects.
At the briefing, the NHA officials said Rs226.982 billion was allocated for 71 projects against the demand of Rs655.499bn.
They cited limited funds, land acquisition problems and geographical challenges among the causes of delay in the completion of projects. Frequent damages to machinery and infrastructure in Balochistan also came up during the discussion.
Toll tax, revenue
The committee was briefed on toll tax rates and revenue collection for 2023-25. The NHA reported that total 211 toll plazas were operational, 100 on national highways and 111 on motorways. Out of all, 68 toll plazas are auctioned and managed privately, while 16 are directly managed by the NHA. According to a revenue report, the NHA collected Rs32.98bn during the fiscal year 2023-24 and had projected revenue of Rs64.79bn for 2024-25.
Toll rates on the National High­ways are set at Rs30 for cars, Rs50 for wagons, Rs100 for buses, Rs120 for two- and three-axle trucks, and Rs250 for articulated trucks. Slightly higher toll rates apply at some specific locations such as the Kohat tunnel and the Islamabad-Muzaffarabad dual carriageway.
However, committee members expressed concern over the burden of high toll taxes on the general public. They also demanded the restoration of discontinued mobile phone service for toll tax payments to facilitate travellers.

The decision to post Frontier Corps (FC) personnel for security at the canal was taken by the provincial Apex Committee on Tuesday.
The meeting was presided over by Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and Corps Commander Lt Gen Rahat Nasim Khan.
The meeting was convened to discuss the law and order situation and other issues in the province.
The meeting resolved to intensify the ongoing anti-smuggling drive, with strict action to be taken against transport companies involved in illegal activities and FIRs would be lodged against offending drivers.

Apex committee warns blocking of road or highway won’t be allowed in the name of protest

While reviewing anti-terrorism measures, the meeting directed officials concerned to finalise rules under the Anti-Terrorism Act promptly.
The committee decided that protesters will not be allowed to block roads or highway in any area of Balochistan.
“No road in the province will be allowed to be blocked. The Constitution stands with the person fighting for life in an ambulance,” Mr Bugti said.
Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said action would be taken against those involved in smuggling, illegal remittances, extortion and subversive activities.
The committee also directed the FIA to act against illegal money transfers and step up action against those social media accounts spreading “anti-state propaganda”.
The committee also pledged to eliminate extortion and enhance operations against illegal immigrants.
Police and Levies personnel were ordered to strengthen the counter-terrorism response.
The Home Department briefed members of the committee on the digitalisation of the Fourth Schedule process.
The committee decided the provincial government will expand the Bolan route of the National Highway and construct the Dera Murad Jamali Bypass.
The National Highway Authority (NHA) was ordered to complete the Quetta Western Bypass by December 25.
He warned that anyone acting against the state would face consequences.
If the NHA delays or hinders road projects, the provincial government will assume responsibility for the project’s construction in public interest.
To that end, he said, the government has allocated Rs1.7 billion for the Bolan route expansion.
The meeting also resolved to ban the entry of liquefied petroleum tankers into residential areas.
The committee decided to celebrate Independence Day and ‘Marka-i-Haq’ — the official name for Pakistan’s response to Indian aggression in May — with patriotic spirit.

A country that is run by a dictator, whose foreign funding has dried up. Then along comes a cause for everyone to gel around, and civil society teams up with lawyers, who team up with politicians, who are all ushered in by the dictator in waiting, and they all get together in a televised circus and manage to topple the regime.
What follows is a few years of free for all, where everyone is trying to find their feet whilst some people, new to power, flex their muscles a bit too much. Judges decide the price of jams and jellies, whilst politicians in office write to their peers abroad complaining about the unregulated might of their own public servants. Meanwhile, the traditional bastions of state power teeter. Questions that nobody dared raise before are asked, and light is shone in areas which have lain in darkness for decades.
A completely new player in the power game also emerges: the television anchor. Able to say whatever they want, with few consequences, they feel they can take on the world. One of them is a particularly hard nut that some older power brokers decide to crack. When they fail, his colleagues run a direct challenge to the traditional nodes of power on their channel.
Enough is enough, decide the aging power chieftains. They shut down the channel, protests be damned. They dust off their communications centre, and start reaching out to other anchors directly, bringing them into the fold. There are helicopter rides and shooting range visits; brave-looking photos of being embedded on the front fighting terrorists. Slowly, the state propaganda line emerges, and when you cross that line you are chastised by your peers or contacted by an ever bolder chap who feels he can tell you what to do.

Months turn into years, and politicians are again brought to heel with power’s shiny new toys.

As the months progress, and a clearer strategy of the recapture of power emerges, instead of exceptional meetings with anchors who are willing to listen, they start sending out WhatsApp messages en masse to all TV persons giving a broad outline of what power thinks about every news-based issue on a daily basis. Errant anchors and journalists are no longer communicated with directly, unless they are already part of Team Power; power talks to their management instead.
Eventually, this pretence becomes too tiresome, and power’s underlings begin to communicate directly with news directors, sending them detailed headlines and explanations of how to treat all the news they have an interest in on a daily basis. Now power communicates with news managements directly only when there’s a glitch in the programme, when someone has expressed themselves with too much freedom or gone completely off-script.
Soon, these troublemakers are identified and the management told that it would be better for, and more lucrative (in terms of the state advertisement kitty), if these errant journalists were dispensed with. All the new hires in their place come from power’s WhatsApp group, now a flourishing institution in its own right.
Months turn into years, and politicians are once again brought to heel with power’s shiny new toys. Civil society campaigners are discredited through the legacy media, now entirely run like a well-oiled WhatsApp group. Just to remind the management of such media groups who the real boss is, new players are brought into the market. With shinier toys and deeper pockets, these new owners are part of power’s core crew, having come into wealth through their connections with the traditional nodes of power.
But there are still those pesky judges. The ones that were set a little too free when this circus first started. So power lies in wait. Slowly, a rift emerges from within. A rift first caused when power decides to take on a particularly troublesome judge, but fails to get him. But such is the fate of power, that the judge becomes its greatest asset. In turning on the system which nearly failed him, he exposes the other judges, leaving them without the protection of the pretence of outward unity they had until then. Power only has one playbook, so it uses it again.
Power contacts individual pesky judges, urging them to see the truth of power. Some listen and fall in line. For those who don’t, power contacts their management, convincing them of the rewards of power if the subordinates are brought into line. Power sees that the way to make pesky judges fall in line is by controlling what they get to hear and decide through the registry of each court. Power realises it’s easier to take over the registries themselves. Gradually, the same met­hod that conquered the media emerges. Power deputes underlings to coordinate with the judges who are on board, and separate underlings to rule the registries. But all this would be unnecessary if you could just get rid of the irksome judges and select who would take their place.
So power forms a pool of willing servants from amongst lawyers. It prepares them for service by lavishing on them state largesse, fixed retainers and regular briefs; convincing them of there being only truth in power. From these lawyers will come the judges of power, squaring the circle and closing the loop. Ensuring there will no longer be any circus in this country where the ringmaster doesn’t wear power’s uniform. Ensuring there will no longer be any pesky judges, which, in turn, will ensure there aren’t any pesky anchors and politicians.
Would you like a corner plot in that country? Would you be willing to pay the price of power?

There may not be any specific plan on the table yet to revert to the old order, but the prime minister’s decision to form a committee headed by the Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan to look into the matter has raised serious concerns.
A recent meeting of the committee members, comprising mostly federal government officials, stressed the need to revive the jirga system in the districts. According to media reports, ways were discussed to promote an effective alternative justice system in the former tribal districts. The jirga system, a traditional form of conflict resolution, was abolished after the merger of the seven tribal agencies in 2018 through the 25th Constitutional Amendment.
One fails to understand the objective behind such a regressive, unconstitutional move that will not only weaken the unity of the federation but also have serious implications for our national security. The KP government has rejected the committee’s formation, referring to it as federal interference in provincial matters, thus intensifying the stand-off between Islamabad and Peshawar.
Fata’s merger with KP in 2018 in the wake of rising militancy was viewed as a significant step towards bringing the lawless semi-autonomous regions into the mainstream and providing better governance and development to its population. But seven years on, the promise has not been fulfilled. The transition has faced numerous challenges mainly because of limited financial resources for the development of infrastructure in the merged districts and improvement in the lives of the people.

There’s something ominous about the centre’s efforts to revive the jirga system in former Fata.

Over the past seven years, the federal government has neither provided the promised development funds of Rs100 billion annually to the merged districts nor its three per cent share in the National Finance Commission award. The situation has worsened with the ongoing confrontation between the federal government and the PTI-led provincial administration. The resurgence of militancy in the region has also caused the complete collapse of governance in the merged districts.
Instead of addressing these challenges, it seems that the federal government is trying to revert to the old colonial structure, which was the main factor contributing to the backwardness of the former federally administered tribal areas called Fata.
The latter was governed by the controversial Frontier Crimes Regulation and political agents. Disputes were settled by local jirgas comprising tribal elders and maliks appointed by the federal government. The courts had no jurisdiction in the area, which was directly controlled by the centre. The provisions of the Constitution and the laws did not apply there.
For decades since independence, because of political and geostrategic reasons, there was no effort to bring the region into the mainstream. Fata’s semi- autonomous status provided the state plausible deniability when the region was turned into a centre for training and then launching militants from within the country and outside into Afghanistan to fight against the Soviet forces.
But this situation also resulted in Fata becoming a hub of militancy that threatened Pakistan’s own security. It also led to the complete collapse of state control over the strategically located region. The vacuum was filled by terrorist groups — such as the TTP — which took control of the area. While successive military operations largely cleared the area of militants, they also caused a huge humanitarian crisis as hundreds of thousands of residents were forced to leave their homes and businesses to escape the fighting.
Most of them might have returned to their devastated land, but many migrated to other areas in search of livelihood. One reason for integrating the tribal areas into the mainstream was to establish the writ of the state there and carry out development works in the conflict-devastated territory. But seven years on, the plight of the people in the districts has not improved. The administrative and justice system remain broken mainly because of lack of financial resources. This has added to the public’s discontent.
Most worrisome is the return of militancy in the merged districts with the weakening of the administration and justice system. The military is in the region fighting the insurgents. But the problem is that there is no realisation in Islamabad and Pindi that kinetic operations alone cannot bring peace and stability to the troubled areas. What is needed is the acceleration of the reform programme rather than reverting to the obsolete jirga system. There is an urgent need to strengthen the civil law-enforcement services and accelerate development work.
There was a broader consensus among the political parties, except for a few, on mainstreaming the former tribal territories. But this rethinking in the ruling party on reform is quite intriguing. Some reports suggest that there is move to bring back former Fata under federal rule thus allowing Islamabad to retake control of the mineral mines there.
In fact, the KP Assembly did not pass the mines and mineral legislation that would have given the federal government some control over the mines. The former tribal areas have huge deposits of rare earth and other minerals which has drawn the interest of the Trump administration.
There certainly is something sinister about the federal government rethinking ex-Fata’s reforms and the revival of the jirga system there. By denying the region its democratic and civil rights, the state is further alienating the tribesmen. It will be disastrous if the security pretext is used.
Some unconfirmed reports suggest that one reason behind the apparent move to backtrack on reforms are the security establishment’s concerns over the rising arc of insurgency in the region. But restoring the old order will only worsen matters. Any such move will strengthen the militants, further threatening our security. The state must respect the sentiments of the people who want to be fully part of the country.

Speaking at the conf­erence on ‘Pakistan’s Final Warning: Climate Calamity or Col­­lective Action’, the PPP senator said that despite unprecedented clim­a­­te shocks, there was a trou­­­bling silence in policy corridors.
“I see no alarm bells ringing anywhere in power corridors. No budgets are being recalibrated for coping better with the crisis,” she noted.
“If there is one priority for collective climate action in Pakistan it has to be water conservation. The water crisis means we have either too much water in the system and rivers at the wrong time, or too little when and where we need it, to sustain food security and livelihoods across the country.
Pakistan, she noted, is deeply underprepared for the scale of climate investment required: “To meet the climate crisis head on, everything will have to be scaled up. Finance is just one part of it. And let’s be clear — it’s not coming in anywhere close to the quantum needed by frontline ecosystems like ours.”
She also reminded the in­­t­ernational community of their responsibilities and str­­essed the importance of public-private partnerships.

Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi has called the SJC meeting to consider around two dozen pending complaints against superior court judges and a set of recommendations to streamline the process of handling complaints and ensure transparency while probing allegations of misconduct against judges.
The recommendations were prepared by Justice Munib Akhtar, also an SJC member.
The SC, through an announcement on the completion of the first 100 days of CJP Afridi in office, had explained the SJC had examined 46 complaints against constitutional officeholders and 40 of them have been disposed of. In five complaints, comments have been sought while further information was asked for in another case.
In one of the SJC sittings, it was decided regular sessions would be held every month in order to clear the backlog of outstanding complaints against superior court judges on a fast track.
Also, the SJC in its July 12 meeting is expected to resume consideration of a letter by six judges alleging interference by intelligence agencies in judicial affairs and calling for a thorough investigation. The letter was sent by six judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 25, 2024.
The SJC, at a previous session while considering different options concerning the letter, agreed to expand consultations, noting that the code of conduct of judges also applies to the heads of different institutions.
The letter had earlier prompted the then CJP Qazi Faez Isa to initiate suo motu proceedings after ex-CJP Tassaduq Jillani declined to lead a one-man commission to investigate the alleged meddling in judicial affairs. CJP Afridi, before assuming the top office, had recused himself from hearing the suo motu case, arguing that “inaction by IHC chief justice or judges” should not drag the Supreme Court into imposing its jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
“This may affect the functioning of the worthy [IHC] chief justice and judges in their discharge of judicial functions and would amount to interference in the independence of the high courts,” Justice Afridi had suggested at the time.
The weekend meeting of the council will also be attended by senior puisine judge of the Supreme Court Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Aalia Neelum and Sindh High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.
According to an announcement, the SJC is actively considering amendments to its code of conduct and procedure of enquiry.  The SJC had appointed Justice Munib Akhtar as head of a committee to propose amendments to the code of conduct.

• Sets aside notification declaring JUI-F’s Gorpal Singh minority lawmaker
• IHC also issues notice to Election Commission over KP reserved seats
PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday barred two women MPAs-elect of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly from taking oath and directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to modify its last year’s notification on the allocation of these seats.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal also set aside the ECP’s notification dated March 26, 2024, which had declared Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) candidate Gorpal Singh as MPA-elect on a seat reserved for non-Muslims in the KP Assembly.
The court directed the ECP to reallocate reserved seats for women and non-Muslims within 10 days in accordance with the law, after hearing all relevant political parties, their representatives and contesting candidates.
Until the ECP issues a new decision, the bench ordered that the oath should not be administered to JUI-F MPAs-elect Naheeda Noor and Arifa Bibi, who were elected on the disputed seats.
The bench issued a short order on a petition filed by the PML-N through its KP President Amir Muqam, who challenged two ECP notifications dated March 4 and March 26, 2024. These notifications declared candidates from various parties as MPAs-elect on reserved seats for women and non-Muslims.
The PML-N argued that both it and JUI-F had seven MPAs in the KP Assembly, but while PML-N received eight reserved seats for women, JUI-F was allotted 10. On the non-Muslim seats, JUI-F was granted two out of four seats, whereas PML-N was allocated only one.
The petition also challenged the ECP’s cut-off date of Feb 22, 2024, for independent MPAs to join political parties, after which reserved seat allocations were made.
The bench declared that the ECP’s use of the Feb 22 date for allocating reserved seats was illegal and contrary to the mandate of Article 106 of the Constitution, Sections 18 and 104 of the Elections Act 2017, and Rule 92 of the Elections Rules 2017.
The bench pointed out that the electoral college for reserved seats must include all members of political parties, as well as independent candidates who have joined parties, as of the actual date of election or allocation of the reserved seats.
A panel of lawyers, including Aamir Javed, Saqib Raza and Syed Inayat Shah, appeared for the petitioner and stated that the PML-N had initially won five seats in the Feb 8 general elections, and two independents later joined it.
Mr Javed said that the ECP allegedly calculated reserved seat allocations based on only six MPAs rather than seven. He noted that although an independent MPA joined PML-N on Feb 22, the same day he was officially notified as an MPA-elect, the ECP did not include him in the final seat tally.
Initially, the ECP allocated five women’s seats on Feb 22 — two each to PML-N and JUI-F, and one to PPP. On March 4, it issued a second notification for the remaining 21 seats, resulting in JUI-F receiving a total of 10 reserved seats and PML-N eight.
As for the four seats reserved for non-Muslims, one each was initially allocated to JUI-F, PML-N and PPP. The petitioner contended that the fourth seat should have been decided through a draw between JUI-F and PML-N, but the ECP unilaterally awarded it to JUI-F candidate Gorpal Singh.
The ECP was represented by Special Secretary Zafar Iqbal, legal counsel Mohsin Kamran Siddique, Special Secretary (Law) Mohammad Arshad and Deputy Director Saima Tariq Janjua. Advocate Naveed Akhter appeared for JUI-F and argued that his party had not been made a respondent in the petition despite being directly affected.
IHC issues notice to ECP
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday also issued a notice to the ECP on a petition filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P), seeking suspension of the ECP’s July 2 notification allocating 21 reserved seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the plea. PTI-P’s legal team, comprising Advocates Sultan Muhammad Khan and Tufail Shahzad, appeared in court alongside the party’s Central Secretary General Malik Habib Noor.
Advocate Khan argued that the ECP’s notification was based on flawed calculations and had deprived PTI-P, founded in 2023 by the former KP chief minister Pervez Khattak, of its lawful share of reserved seats. He maintained that the party should have received additional seats based on its performance in the Feb 8 general elections.
Justice Minhas inquired whether any court had suspended the notification. The lawyer confirmed that no stay had been granted so far. The court declined to suspend the notification immediately but issued a notice to the ECP to submit a response and adjourned the hearing.
PTI-P argued that allowing lawmakers elected through the disputed notification to take oath would cause “irreversible prejudice” and undermine the party’s main petition.
The party contended that the ECP’s March 4, 2024, notification erroneously recorded PTI-P as having secured only one general seat in KP, whereas it had actually won two — PK-73 and PK-103. This misrepresentation allegedly cost the party at least three reserved seats.
The matter was also earlier under review in the PHC, which had granted a stay on the oath-taking of MPAs on reserved seats. However, after a two-member PHC bench raised questions about the petition’s maintainability in light of similar proceedings at the IHC, PTI-P withdrew its petition from the PHC, resulting in the dismissal of the case and recall of the stay order.

Official sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.
Upon receiving intelligence about a group of Fitna al-Khawarij militants attempting to infiltrate the Pak-Afghan border in Lowi Mamund tehsil’s mountainous areas, security personnel responded swiftly, foiling the attempt and eliminating all eight militants, the sources said.
They said that following the successful action, the security forces have further tightened surveillance and monitoring of the border areas to prevent any future infiltration of Fitna al-Khawarij militants from the Afghan side.
While the military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), did not release an official statement about the operation, local residents confirmed the clashes between security forces and militants in the area.
According to the residents, the clashes between the security forces and the militants, which continued for several hours, left one child wounded.
They said that the injured child — identified as Muhammad Khan, son of Abdur Rouf — was first taken to Larkholozo Hospital and later transferred to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar.
The security forces’ fresh action against militants in Bajaur came about a week after a bomb explosion targeted a government vehicle in the Sadiqabad area of Khar tehsil on July 2, killing five people, including Nawagai Assistant Commissioner Faisal Ismail and Tehsildar Abdul Wakeel Khan, and injuring 17 others, including four policemen.

• Gohar finally meets party founder, asks supporters to prepare for ‘peaceful but powerful’ campaign
• Aleema says Imran’s sons, family will also join movement
ISLAMABAD: As PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Tuesday met party founder Imran Khan in Adiala jail after more than a month of repeated attempts to gain access to the incarcerated former premier, who is said to be kept in solitary confinement, the party founder issued a nationwide protest call.
The meeting between the two party leaders revolved around the protest movement announced by Imran Khan, which will reach its “peak” on Aug 5 to mark the second year of his incarceration in multiple cases. According to a statement on his X account in the evening, Imran Khan ruled out any kind of dialogue, saying the time for dialogue had passed.
“For the sake of the country, I have repeatedly talked about negotiations, but now the time for negotiations has passed. After the 26th Constitutional Amendment…the hope we had for justice from the courts has completely disappeared, so now no other method can bring the Pakistani nation out of this swamp of lawlessness except a nationwide protest movement,” the PTI founder said. It is pertinent to note that he does not have access to his social media accounts and someone else posts on his behalf.
“The complete plan of action for the nationwide movement will be presented this week - on August 5, my unjust imprisonment will complete 2 years. This day will be the culmination of our nationwide protest movement,” he said. “Now there will be no negotiations of any kind with anyone! There will be protests only on the streets so that the nation can get rid of the puppet rulers imposed by force,” he added.
 






Speaking to reporters outside the prison, Barrister Gohar confirmed that the PTI founder asked party workers, supporters, and the general public to prepare for a peaceful but powerful protest campaign starting August 5. “This is not just about political revenge anymore—it’s about every citizen’s rights being stolen. The founder has said this movement should now take the shape of a second Pakistan Movement,” Barrister Gohar stated. He revealed that Khan, even while in solitary confinement, remained “mentally sharper and more determined than ever” and “despite being silenced, the founder has given us a message—prepare, mobilise, and raise your voice peacefully but fearlessly”.
The PTI leader also criticised the prison authorities for continued mistreatment and isolation of Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, while also highlighting their prison conditions, disregard of court orders, and systemic efforts to break political resistance through isolation.
Mr Khan’s sister, Aleema Khan, who did not meet her brother, also spoke to media persons outside the jail alongside her sisters. She also talked about the protest movement announced by her brother, claiming that the entire family will be a part of the movement. Ms Khan said that Imran’s sons, Qasim and Suleiman, will go to the US to highlight injustices meted out to their father before coming to Pakistan to become part of the movement and Imran Khan had been informed about this. However, Ms Khan did not clarify if the duo will join the movement before Aug 5 or after. She said a plan regarding their visit was being formulated.
‘Solitary confinement’
Ms Khan also painted a grim picture of her brother’s conditions in prison. “He has been kept in complete solitary confinement for months. For the past week, even his newspapers, books, and television have been taken away. What sort of justice is this?” she asked.
She revealed that despite repeated legal requests and court directives, even basic human rights were being denied. “He is not a criminal. He is the former elected prime minister of this country. Yet he is being treated worse than convicted felons,” she claimed.
 
 

Ms Khan said that the PTI founder had told her during a previous brief meeting that his books were lying in the deputy superintendent’s room, inaccessible to him. “What threat do books pose to the state?” she questioned. “His voice is being silenced, his mind is being isolated, and now they want to completely disconnect him from the outside world.” “Even his doctor has not been allowed for 10 months,” he alleged.
Both Ms Khan and Barrister Gohar emphasised that Imran Khan’s health was being deliberately ignored. “For ten months, his personal physician—who has known his medical history for decades—has been denied access. If something happens, who will be responsible?” Ms Khan asked.
She also stated that Bushra Bibi was undergoing similar conditions in her prison cell. “She has been kept in solitary confinement as well. There are no visitors, no sunlight, no communication—just absolute seclusion. Is this how women are treated in custody in Pakistan?”
She said the authorities believe that by isolating the PTI founder, they can dismantle his influence and demoralise his supporters.
“Let me tell you clearly: he cannot be broken.
His spirit is stronger than ever. He told us—whatever happens, his message will reach the people,“ Ms Khan said, referring to Imran Khan’s recent communication from prison.

NAGAR KHAS: A view of a Glof flowing down Supultar nullah, damaging agricultural land, vegetation and irrigation infrastructure and blocking access to Hoper Valley.—Dawn

• Rapid melting of glaciers due to record temperatures causes floods in Hunza, Diamer, Chilas, Nagar
• Karakoram Highway blocked at multiple points; locals evacuated as homes damaged
• Downpour leads to urban flooding in several parts of Punjab
GILGIT / LAHORE: Record-high summer temperatures in Gilgit-Baltistan have accelerated the melting of glaciers, leading to heavy flooding in districts across the region.
The melting of ice, which resulted in glacier lake outburst floods (Glofs), blocked roads, damaged homes and left people stranded across GB on Tuesday.
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), high temperatures were recorded across GB last week.
GBDMA DG Zakir Hussain told Dawn the situation in GB is “unusual” this year.
He said high temperatures have increased the risk of flooding in rivers and streams, particularly in Diamer and Gilgit.
Last week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.
Currently, the water level in rivers and streams across the region is dangerously high as inflows have increased due to rapidly melting glaciers.
According to the GBDMA, a flash flood blocked the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at Gandlu-Muladad Padi near Chilas on Tuesday.
A flood in Hamari stream damaged the Nagar Khas Valley road, while deluge in Supultar nullah blocked the Hoper Valley road.
The rising water level in rivers blocked the Chipurson Valley road in upper Hunza while Siachen Road in Ghanche was severely affected by river erosion in Thugs and Bangilongba areas.
Flooding in the Botogah nullah in Chilas damaged makeshift bridges, leaving the communities without any route to cross the waterway.
Flooding in Hamari and Supultar nullahs in Nagar damaged agricultural land, irrigation and drinking water supply systems, link roads and public and private infrastructures.
Many areas were without water and electricity supply after damage to the infrastructure.
Local administration said continued land erosion in the Hamorkhay area in Nagar Khas has submerged fields, trees and other infrastructure and was threatening over a dozen households.
Flood also damaged public and private properties in Chilas of Diamer, Chipurson areas.
A Glof from Shishper glacier in Hassanabad nullah, Hunza, has once again threatened KKH and local properties.
GBDMA said four houses were evacuated as a precautionary measure following the Glof event.
The local administration has warned people not to travel to affected areas as the risk of flooding and land erosion is high.
Rescue efforts
Mr Hussain, the head of GBDMA, said the authority has mobilised machinery to reopen roads blocked by flooding.
“Our first responsibility is to save the lives of people,” he said, adding locals in affected areas have been shifted to safe places.
The GBDMA was also restoring irrigation channels as a majority of people in the region depended upon agriculture as their livelihood.
According to Mr Hussain, the agency is now looking to identify the behaviours of glaciers to understand the scientific reasoning for melting.
The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission has been requested to provide equipment for the monitoring of glaciers.
Meanwhile, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered the GBDMA, district administration and all relevant departments to remain alert in view of the floods.
All deputy commissioners have been ordered to take timely steps to prevent damage to life and property.
Urban flooding in Punjab
In Punjab, heavy monsoon rainfall on Tuesday triggered urban flooding in several cities as the province braces for above-average rainfall in the coming days.
In Lahore, rainfall led to waterlogging in Jail Road, Qurtaba Chowk, Liberty Chowk, and Lakshmi Chowk.
According to the Met Department, Jail Road and Qurtaba Chowk received the most rainfall, with 46 and 43 mm, respectively.
The average rainfall in the provincial capital on Tuesday was 40mm.
The deluge overwhelmed drainage systems in several areas, forcing the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) workers to install pumps to drain water from inundated areas.
Wasa Managing Director Ghufran Ahmad has directed round-the-clock drainage of water.
He said all resources must be deployed to protect low-lying neighbourhoods from inundation.
Across Punjab, the rainfall pattern showed sharp variations, with Sheikhupura recording the province’s highest total at 48mm.
The provincial government has put all disaster response agencies on high alert after Lahore and several other districts recorded heavy downpours, with Nishtar Town receiving the highest rainfall at 52mm.
PDMA meeting
In Sialkot, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) DG Irfan Ali Kathia held an emergency meeting on the preparedness of local authorities.
Mr Kathia said the province is expected to receive 40 to 60 per cent above-normal rainfall in the coming days.
The heavy rain is expected to result in flooding, particularly in riverine areas near Head Marala, where water flow was 70,000 cusecs on Tuesday.
Local administrations have established relief camps stocked with food and water supplies, while electricity poles have been reinforced.
In rural areas, special teams have been mobilised to protect livestock and ensure their safety during the monsoon.
Gujranwala Division Commissioner Naveed Haider Shirazi has ordered the immediate evacuation of dilapidated buildings.
“We cannot risk any loss of life due to structural collapses during these rains,” Mr Shirazi warned, noting that 16 million residents in his division were potentially at risk.
The authorities have warned people to avoid unnecessary travel and report flooding immediately.
CM’s directives
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has directed all institutions to remain on alert during the monsoon season.
Officials of Wasa, PDMA, local government, Rescue 1122 and traffic police must remain in the field to oversee relief activities and help citizens.
She further directed the commissioners and deputy commissioners to monitor water drainage from low-lying areas and the traffic police should prepare plans to avoid gridlock.

The Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice, which met under the chairmanship of Senator Farooq H. Naek, considered the Pak­istan Penal Code (Amendment) Bill, 2025, introduced by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri.
A proposed amendment to Sec­tion 323 of the Pakistan Penal Code, seeks to substitute minimum blood money from 30,630 grams of silver to 2,000 grams of gold or one fourth of the assets held by the convict.  
The bill also seeks to amend Sec­tion 330 of the PPC, by adding a new proviso and explanation. It also proposes to amend Section 331 to redu­­ce the time for payment of diyat in ins­­talments from five years to one year. 

CII chairman opposes bill but says final opinion will be given after council’s meeting

Senator Kamran Murtaza of JUI-F opposed the bill saying that the payment of diyat according to silver value has an Islamic background and its conversion to gold was a non-issue.
He said the 30,630 grams value was the minimum and the heirs of victim may refuse to accept the minimum and ask for more for a compromise. 
The chairman of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) also opposed all the three proposed amendments but said a final opinion will be given after a meeting of CII.
He also submitted a report to the committee which says that according to Islamic principles, the diyat payment can be made as per value of silver, gold and camels, and excluding expression of silver would be un-Islamic. 
It also says the government cannot keep the diyat amount with it if the heirs are free to forego. It says the time for payment of diyat should neither be one year nor five years and it should be fixed at three years. 
Senator Shahadat Awan of PPP said the Chairman of CII has expressed his personal opinion. He said it was an important Islamic and legal matter and a decision on this must not be taken in haste.
Speaking on the occasion, Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, the bill’s mover, said the issue of blood money has long been a matter of concern for both jurists and the judiciary.
Ms Zehri highlighted that the bill seeks to modernise the valuation mechanism of diyat taking into account contemporary economic conditions and the spirit of Shariah.
The statement of objects and reasons clarified that since traditional assets like camels, gold, and silver have fluctuated significantly in value and accessibility, a modern framework is essential to ensure fairness for both victims’ families and offenders. 
It is also necessary to create deterrence so that no one simply pays blood money and gets away, while the victim’s family suffers.
The committee recognised that the minimum amount of diyat must be consistent with Sharia stipulations and any amendment must strictly adhere to the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sharia. 
Given the sensitive nature of the matter, the committee resolved to defer further deliberations to allow for comprehensive input from all relevant stakeholders.
The ministry of interior will be invited to share their viewpoints, particularly on the practical implementation of the proposed amendments. 
Furthermore, the committee sought the final opinion of the CII, so that no legislation on diyat falls outside the bounds of Quranic principles.
The ministry of law was directed to compile a comparative chart on values of silver, gold, etc., and to outline the prevailing practices in other Muslim countries.

The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India since the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq” in May.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally drop their guns.
Iqbal presided over a preliminary meeting today under the prime minister’s directions to celebrate this year’s Independence Day with “full national spirit and renewed resolve”.
Senior representatives from the Inter-Services Public Relations, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of National Heritage and Culture, Ministry of Education and Professional Training, Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination and other departments participated in the meeting to discuss how to make the day “truly reflective of the feelings, aspirations and pride of the people of Pakistan”, according to a press release.
Iqbal said that this year’s Independence Day was being dedicated to the theme of “Marka-i-Haq” to “honour the courage, faith, and resolve of the nation”.
He said that the celebrations would send a “clear message to the world that Pakistan stands proud, strong and committed to its sovereignty”.
The minister added that at the same time, the government aimed to highlight the steady progress being made in economic recovery, defence resilience and international recognition of the country’s leadership, financial stabilisation and expertise, showing that Pakistan’s journey was “not just about survival but about rising to its full potential”.
While discussing the activities of the scheduled celebrations, the minister emphasised that every sector and official in charge should ensure that all universities and schools observe the day in the same format. The same was advised for provincial celebrations and celebrations abroad in collaboration with the Overseas Ministry.
“A robust discussion took place where the committee members shared the planned activities and innovative ideas for celebrations at the federal and provincial levels,” the press release said, adding that Iqbal said that a comprehensive plan should be developed with budgets.
“This year, we are not just commemorating another Independence Day; we are marking a moment of national revival. A moment that reflects the resilience of our people, the resolve of our state, and the rise of Pakistan as a global voice of strength, peace, and purpose. The world has seen that while Pakistan is a peace-loving nation, it will never compromise on its sovereignty. Our recent defence of our territorial integrity showed our maturity, strength, and our determination to protect regional stability without weakness.
“We must use this opportunity to honour the spirit of ‘Marka-i-Haq’, a defining chapter in our history where our armed forces, our citizens, our government, and every institution stood together. We are also seeing concrete gains across the board: inflation is down, exports are growing, digitisation is transforming governance and innovation is thriving. This is the time to celebrate Pakistan across every field, including military, economic, cultural and scientific and to tell our story to the world with pride and ambition.”
He emphasised that the celebrations must be unified. “One voice, one pride from every district, every province and every corner of the globe where Pakistanis live, so the world hears the unmistakable confidence of one nation standing tall.”
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said while addressing the meeting’s participants: “The nation stands as one united, unshaken, and ready to defeat any designs against it. Our civil and military forces are shoulder to shoulder. These celebrations will reiterate to the world what they are already telling us that we are united and strong,”
Information Minister Ataullah Tarar shared that extensive plans were underway with song competitions, special programming and a documentary. He assured the meeting’s members that the celebrations would be reflective of the country’s achievements and “celebrate the global acclaim the country is receiving”.
The participants shared a range of proposals to ensure that the celebrations reflected the “hearts of ordinary Pakistanis and involve everyone” from the cities to the villages, from students to artists, and from businesses to the diaspora.
Plans were also discussed for national songs, dramas, poetry gatherings, documentaries, cultural fairs, public events, school competitions and global embassy activities, “all designed to inspire the nation and tell its story to the world”.</p><small>2025-07-08 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/082234547cc77ec.jpg?r=230001' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922863/iran-says-it-has-not-requested-us-talks-since-war' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says it has not requested US talks since war</strong></a><br><p>Iran said on Tuesday it has not made any request for talks with the United States, after President Donald Trump said Tehran was seeking negotiations following last month’s war with Israel.
“No request for a meeting has been made on our side to the American side,” said Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei, according to Tasnim news agency.
Trump said on Monday that Iran was seeking talks with the US and that they had been scheduled, without specifying the time or the location.
“We have scheduled Iran talks. They want to talk,” Trump told reporters in the White House, where he was meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
“They want to meet. They want to work something out. They’re very different now than they were two weeks ago.”
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also reiterated Tehran’s position, rejecting talks at this stage.
“Although Iran has in recent days received messages indicating that the US may be ready to return to negotiations, how can we trust further engagement?” the Iranian top diplomat said in a piece he wrote for the Financial Times.
On June 13, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran that targeted military and nuclear sites as well as residential areas, and killed senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians.
 
 

The attacks began days before a planned meeting between Tehran and Washington aimed at reviving nuclear negotiations. The talks have since stalled.
The US, which had been in talks with Iran since April 12, joined Israel in carrying out its own strikes on June 22, targeting Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. Iranian authorities say the Israeli strikes killed at least 1,060 people. Israel, in turn, was hit by waves of retaliatory drone and missile fire, which authorities said left at least 28 people dead.
A ceasefire between Iran and Israel has been in place since June 24.
“After agreeing to new negotiations in good faith, we have seen our goodwill reciprocated with an attack by two nuclear-armed militaries,” Araghchi, who was also Iran’s top negotiator during the talks with the US, said in the Financial Times piece.
“Iran remains interested in diplomacy, but we have good reason to have doubts about further dialogue.”
‘Too soft’
On Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian came under fire domestically after voicing support for renewed talks with the US, with critics accusing him of being “too soft” in the wake of last month’s attacks on the country.
The backlash followed the release of an interview with US media personality Tucker Carlson, in which Pezeshkian said Iran had “no problem” resuming talks so long as trust could be rebuilt between the two sides.
“Have you forgotten that these same Americans, together with the Zionists, used the negotiations to buy time and prepare for the attack?” said an editorial in the hardline Kayhan newspaper, which has long opposed engagement with the West.
The conservative Javan daily also took aim at Pezeshkian, saying his remarks appeared “a little too soft”.
In contrast, the reformist Ham Mihan newspaper praised Pezeshkian’s “positive approach”.
“This interview should have been conducted a long time ago,” it wrote, adding that “Iranian officials have unfortunately long been absent from the international and American media landscape.”</p><small>2025-07-08 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08191503adbfa5c.jpg?r=191901' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922848/icc-seeks-arrest-of-taliban-supremo-afghan-chief-justice-over-persecution-of-women' target='_blank'><strong>ICC seeks arrest of Taliban supremo, Afghan chief justice over persecution of women</strong></a><br><p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Tuesday issued arrest warrants for senior Taliban leaders in Afghanistan over the persecution of women, a crime against humanity.
ICC judges said in a statement there were “reasonable grounds” to suspect Supreme Leader Haibatullah Akhundzada and chief justice Abdul Hakim Haqqani “have committed … the crime against humanity of persecution … on gender grounds”.
“While the Taliban have imposed certain rules and prohibitions on the population as a whole, they have specifically targeted girls and women by reason of their gender, depriving them of fundamental rights and freedoms,” the court said.
 






The court said the alleged crimes had been committed between August 15, 2021, when the Taliban seized power and continued until at least January 20, 2025.
 
 

The Taliban had “severely deprived” girls and women of the rights to education, privacy and family life and the freedoms of movement, expression, thought, conscience and religion, ICC judges said.
“In addition, other persons were targeted because certain expressions of sexuality and/or gender identity were regarded as inconsistent with the Taliban’s policy on gender.”
Taliban authorities rejected the warrants as “nonsense”.
The ICC warrants “won’t affect the strong commitment and dedication to sharia (Islamic law)” of Taliban authorities, spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.
“We don’t recognise any such international court, nor do we need it,” he added.
The ICC, based in The Hague, was set up to rule on the world’s worst crimes such as war crimes and crimes against humanity.
It has no police force of its own and relies on its member states to carry out its arrest warrants — with mixed results.
In theory, this means that anyone subject to an ICC arrest warrant cannot travel to a member state for fear of being detained.
- ‘Ongoing persecution’
After sweeping back to power in August 2021, the Taliban authorities pledged a softer rule than their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.
But they quickly imposed restrictions on women and girls that the United Nations has labelled “gender apartheid”.
Edicts in line with their strict interpretation of Islamic law handed down by Akhundzada, who rules by decree from the movement’s birthplace in southern Kandahar, have squeezed women and girls from public life.
The Taliban government barred girls from secondary school and women from university in the first 18 months after they ousted the US-backed government, making Afghanistan the only country in the world to impose such bans.
Authorities imposed restrictions on women working for non-governmental groups and other employment, with thousands of women losing government jobs — or being paid to stay home.
Beauty salons have been closed and women blocked from visiting public parks, gyms and baths as well as travelling long distances without a male chaperone.
A “vice and virtue” law announced last summer ordered women not to sing or recite poetry in public and for their voices and bodies to be “concealed” outside the home.
When requesting the arrest warrants in January, chief prosecutor Karim Khan said Afghan women and girls, as well as the LGBTQ community, were facing “an unprecedented, unconscionable and ongoing persecution by the Taliban”.
“Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable,” he added.
Khan warned at the time he would soon be seeking additional warrants for other Taliban officials.</p><small>2025-07-08 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08184428ab9b43f.jpg?r=184506' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922841/trump-faces-maga-meltdown-over-epstein-reversal-after-govt-says-sex-offender-did-not-have-client-list' target='_blank'><strong>Trump faces MAGA meltdown over Epstein reversal after govt says sex offender did not have ‘client list’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) base is up in arms after his administration effectively shut down conspiracy theories related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that had become an obsession for the US president’s diehard supporters.
Trump’s Justice Department and the FBI said in a memo made public on Sunday that there was no evidence that the disgraced financier kept a “client list” or was blackmailing powerful figures.
They also dismissed the claim that Epstein was murdered in jail, confirming his death by suicide, and said they would not be releasing any more information on the probe.
It marked the first time Trump’s officials had publicly scotched the stories, pushed by numerous right-wing figures, notably including the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) top two officials, before Trump hired them.
The backlash was swift and brutal from his “Make America Great Again” movement — who have long held as an article of faith that “Deep State” elites were protecting Epstein’s most powerful associates in the Democratic Party and Hollywood.
“Next the Department of Justice will say ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed,’” furious pro-Trump conspiracy theorist Alex Jones tweeted. “This is over the top sickening.”
 






Trump has managed to avoid much of the direct blame over the fiasco, with ire instead being directed at FBI director Kash Patel, his deputy Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Bongino and Patel spent years pushing conspiracy theories around the so-called “Epstein list”.
The controversy has clearly rattled Trump, who defended Bongino and Patel on social media as the “greatest law enforcement professionals in the world”, without explaining why he had spoken out.
Bongino reposted Trump’s praise and was deluged with furious responses.
 






But the lion’s share of the fury has been reserved for Bondi, who assured Fox News in February she had the Epstein client list on her desk and would get to the truth — in remarks endorsed by the White House.
Bondi was already on thin ice with MAGA after distributing binders labelled “The Epstein Files” to influencers at the White House that turned out to contain largely already public information and no new revelations.
‘Embarrassment’
“President Trump should fire [Bondi] for lying to his base and creating a liability for his administration,” far-right influencer Laura Loomer posted on X.
“She is an embarrassment and she doesn’t do anything to help Trump.”
 






White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was pressed about the controversy and said that Bondi was actually talking about Epstein-related paperwork as a whole, sparking even more MAGA fury.
“This is what happens when the dog catches the car. Or, to put a finer point on it, when you and the people around you become the very ‘Deep State’ you have spent years attacking,” CNN analyst Chris Cillizza wrote on his Substack newsletter.
Epstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 after being charged with sex trafficking.
Trump — who has denied visiting the US Virgin Islands home where prosecutors say Epstein sex trafficked underage girls — said ahead of his election he would have “no problem” releasing files related to the case.
It is one of a number of schisms that have opened in the MAGA movement in recent days, with supporters angry over Trump’s announcement that weapons supplies to Ukraine would resume.
 
 

Trump’s fiercely isolationist base was already upset at the president’s bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites and his statements calling for an easing of immigration raids on farms.
Beyond its insights into the power dynamics that animate Trump’s supporters, the affair has raised concerns that MAGA disillusionment will damage Republican prospects in the next election cycle.
The row comes with Trump under pressure from the launch of a new political party by his estranged former close aide Elon Musk, who had a bitter public split with the president over federal spending.
When the Trump-Musk feud blew up last month, Musk alleged that Trump was named in the Epstein files, but he later deleted his posts.
Trump was named in a trove of depositions and statements linked to Epstein that were unsealed by a New York judge in early 2024, but the president has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
Supporters on the conspiratorial end of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base allege that Epstein’s associates had their roles in his crimes covered up by government officials and others.
They point the finger at Democrats and Hollywood celebrities, although not at Trump himself.
“What’s the time?” the world’s richest man posted on his social media platform X on Monday, alongside an image of an Epstein countdown clock.
“Oh look, it’s no-one-has-been-arrested-o’clock again! “
‘Exhaustive review’
The DOJ and FBI’s conclusions came after an “exhaustive review” of the evidence amassed against Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 after being charged with sex trafficking, the agencies said in a joint memorandum.
Six years later, questions continue to swirl around Epstein’s life and death and the multi-millionaire hedge fund manager’s connections to wealthy and powerful individuals.
The memo, first reported by Axios, squarely rejected one of the leading conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein — that he did not commit suicide but was murdered while being held in jail.
“After a thorough investigation, FBI investigators concluded that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in his cell,” it said.
Video footage from the area where he was being held did not show anyone entering or attempting to enter his cell from the time at night when he was locked in till when his body was found the next morning, it said.
Extensive digital and physical searches turned up a large volume of images and videos of Epstein’s victims, many of them underage girls, the memo said.
“This review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one thousand victims,” it said, but did not reveal any illegal wrongdoing by “third parties”.
“This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list,’” the memo said. “There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.”
Epstein’s former assistant, Ghislaine Maxwell, is the only former associate of his who has been criminally charged in connection with his activities.
Maxwell, the daughter of British media baron Robert Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in New York in 2021 of child sex trafficking and other crimes.
Among those with connections to Epstein was Britain’s Prince Andrew, who settled a US civil case in February 2022 brought by Virginia Giuffre, who claimed he sexually assaulted her when she was 17.
Giuffre, who accused Epstein of using her as a sex slave, died by suicide at her home in Australia in April.</p><small>2025-07-08 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/082200485f8452a.jpg?r=221022' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922825/fact-check-rana-sanaullah-said-pakistan-should-follow-the-muslim-worlds-position-on-the-abraham-accords' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Rana Sanaullah said Pakistan should follow the Muslim world’s position on the Abraham Accords</strong></a><br><p>Posts from users on social media platform X on July 3 shared a post from digital media outlet Siasat.pk that attributed a statement to Adviser to the Prime Minister Rana Sanaullah that Pakistan should follow the Arab position on the Abraham Accords. However, the PML-N leader actually said that Pakistan should follow the position of the Muslim world on the issue.
The Israeli offensive, which began in response to Hamas’s unprecedented attack on October 7, 2023, has killed more than 57,000 Palestinians and destroyed much of the housing and hospital infrastructure in the enclave.
The Abraham Accords, brokered by the United States in 2020, are landmark agreements for diplomatic relations between Israel and several Arab nations, including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. These accords paved the way for formal ties, such as embassies and trade deals, underpinned by mutual interests in security, economic collaboration, and technology exchange. While celebrated as a diplomatic shift in the Middle East, the accords also sparked debate and resistance in Pakistan. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif have both affirmed that Pakistan will not join, asserting that any recognition of Israel would contradict its longstanding support for a two‑state solution and could only be considered if it served Pakistan’s national interest.
On July 3, a post from Siasat.pk on X shared a visual with the following quote attributed to Sanaullah: “Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran should make a joint decision regarding the Abraham Accords, Pakistan should align with Arab countries on the Abraham Accords.”
The post gained 15,000 views.
The same visual was also shared by former anchorpersons Imran Riaz and Sabir Shakir, both criticising it and racking up over 100,000 and 7,000 views, respectively.
It was reposted by a user, who, according to his X bio, is a journalist, with the caption: “Why have the ministers suddenly caught the fever of the Abraham Accords?”
It was shared on X by a user who is known for criticising PTI and, more recently, the PML-N.
The caption of the post questioned its authenticity, asking: “Did Rana sahib really make this statement, or is it just a stunt?”
The post was viewed by more than 29,000 users.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to keen public interest in the Abraham Accords and because many PML-N supporters were observed contesting the post.
Scanning the QR code in Siasat.pk’s post redirected to a July 2 X post by journalist Nadeem Malik, who had shared a 4:30-minute clip from his show ‘Nadeem Malik Live’, which featured Sanaullah as a guest.
The caption of his X post also attributed the same quote to the official as the post from Siasat.pk.
 






The transcript of the clip is provided below:
Nadeem Malik: “Rana Sahib, what is your opinion on the Abraham Accords? How should Pakistan move forward?”
Rana Sanaullah: “Look, the party or the government currently can’t have an opinion on the matter because this issue has not been presented or discussed at that level. As my two respected [fellow guests] have shared their personal opinion, I can share mine too. In my personal opinion … there has been a lot of bloodshed and injustice in Palestine. All Muslim countries and the world should establish peace there and the daily bloodshed must stop.
“For this purpose, if there is any kind of accord there, whether it is the Abraham [Accords] or any other kind of agreement between those forces and people directly involved there … and if it is acceptable to the group (Hamas) representing the Palestinians and the Arab countries sharing the border and then are agreed then I think Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and if Iran is included as well, these are major countries, there is Malaysia too, then they should make a joint decision and Pakistan should go with the Muslim world.
“If Saudi Arabia, Turkiye and Iran make a decision, and the Arab states directly impacted by this matter make a decision, then Pakistan should go along with it.”
Reviewing the clip makes it clear that Sanaullah said Pakistan should go along with what the majority of the Muslim world and its major regional players in the Middle East decide regarding the Abraham Accords.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that PM aide Rana Sanaullah said that Pakistan should follow the Arab position on the Abraham Accords is misleading.
The official said that Pakistan should follow the position of the Muslim world on the issue, including countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkiye, Malaysia and the Arab states directly impacted by the situation in the Middle East. To omit the names of the other countries or the mention of the Muslim world has the potential to misguide the public into thinking he said Pakistan should follow the Arab position on the matter, making it seem as if he was arguing for Pakistan’s subservience to its Arab allies.

Due to a significant rise in temperature, accelerating snow and glacier melt have triggered flash floods and landslides in various areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Amid heavy monsoon rains, the National Emergencies Operation Centre on Monday issued an alert for heavy rainfall and a flood-like situation in various parts of the country over the next two days, while 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, KP and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to the extreme weather.
Mansehra Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Amir Khadam told Dawn.com, “An eight-year-old boy, Ibrahim, drowned in the Jabba nullah due to a sudden surge in the water flow in a dried stream.”
He said the search for the drowned boy continued, and Rescue 1122 teams were making efforts for it.
Torghar Rescue 1122 spokesperson Atiqullah Afridi said, “A young man, Mohammad Zamin, drowned in the River Indus due to an increase in the water flow of the river.”
He said the rescue divers were in the field and struggling to retrieve the body of the man.
Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) Assistant Director Imtiaz Ali said that floods hit multiple areas in the Diamer region and heavy flooding was reported in Ghushay nullah, Batogah nullah, and Khinar nallah, which washed away water supply schemes and other infrastructure. However, he added that the damage from the floods was being assessed.
He continued that the Karakoram Highway was blocked at five different locations after flash floods brought massive debris and mud between Gilgit and Chilas of GB, suspending the traffic on both sides of the crucial route.
The GBDMA official said that the heavy machinery was being engaged in the road clearance work, and work was underway.
He added that no human loss was reported from anywhere in the area due to flooding.
Zubair Ahmad Khan, GBDMA assistant director for Hunza in Nagar region, said that it was reported that the main road leading to Hopper valley had been blocked at Supultar Nullah due to a heavy flood, accompanied by mudflow and large boulders.
“The flood occurred intermittently throughout the afternoon,” he said, adding, “The debris flow had now nearly stopped; however, the water level is still high, making it impossible to commence road clearance operations at this stage.”
He further said that the tehsildar, naib tehsildar, and Communication and Works (C&W) Department sub-engineer are present on-site, and the GBDMA excavator is available at the location.
“Restoration and clearance work will start tomorrow morning, subject to further improvement in water conditions,” he added.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan ordered relevant departments to remain alert in view of flood situation, according to a statement by his office.
“Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered all relevant departments including the GBDMA and district administrations to remain alert in view of the flood situation in different areas due to melting of glaciers and rise in river levels due to increase in heat intensity,” the statement read.
Deputy commissioners and relevant officers should take timely steps to prevent losses due to floods, Khan said, adding that departments should utilise all resources to initiate the timely rescue and rehabilitation process in any emergency situation.
On Sunday, six people were killed while one person was injured amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and KP, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMAs) in both the provinces.
More than 22 people were killed and 11 others were injured in KP in accidents related to rain, strong winds, flash floods and landslides since June 25, according to PDMA reports. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province, while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water.</p><small>2025-07-08 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0821284843611c9.jpg?r=212939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922858/govt-approves-four-potential-bidders-for-struggling-pia' target='_blank'><strong>Govt approves four potential bidders for struggling PIA</strong></a><br><p>The government said on Tuesday it had approved four parties, including business groups and a military-backed firm, to potentially bid for a stake in debt-ridden Pakistan International Airlines.
The government has been seeking to sell a 51-100 per cent stake in the struggling national airline to raise funds and reform cash-draining, state-owned enterprises as envisaged under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme.
It would be the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
Among the bidding groups, one is a consortium of major industrial firms Lucky Cement, Hub Power Holdings, Kohat Cement and Metro Ventures.
Another is led by investment firm Arif Habib Corp and includes fertiliser producer Fatima Fertiliser, private education operator The City School, and real estate firm Lake City Holdings.
Additionally, Fauji Fertiliser Company, a military-backed conglomerate, and Pakistani airline Airblue have been approved to bid for PIA.
“The pre-qualified parties will now proceed to the buy-side due diligence phase,” Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali said in a statement from his ministry.
The review process is set to last two to two-and-a-half months, with final bidding and negotiations anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2025, Ali previously told Reuters.
The privatisation ministry also said that the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation approved the transaction structure for the Roosevelt Hotel located in New York, including options for both outright sale and long-term lease.
From the Roosevelt Hotel, Pakistan is expecting over $100 million as a first payment during this year, Ali previously told Reuters.</p><small>2025-07-08 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613057-chief-justices-of-all-four-high-courts-sworn-in' target='_blank'><strong>Chief justices of all four high courts sworn in</strong></a><br><p>

The new government under conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz has frozen the programme, but Berlin’s administrative court said the family had been given a “legally binding” commitment and must be allowed to travel to Germany.
About 2,500 Afghans with similar approvals are estimated to be in Pakistan waiting to be able to travel to Germany.
The programme was set up for those who worked with Germany’s army or other institutions in Afghanistan, as well as journalists and activists judged to be threatened by the Taliban.
However, the new government under Merz — who made a crackdown on immigration one of his key election pledges — has said in its coalition agreement it wants to end the programme “as far as possible”.
The family concerned by Tuesday’s decision is currently in Pakistan and had lodged an urgent appeal, telling the court they were about to be deported to Afghanistan where they would be in fear of their lives.
The family was given approval to come to Germany in 2023 under the programme.
They then applied to the German embassy in Islamabad for visas but these have not been issued.
The court said the government had the right “to decide whether and under what conditions the admission programme for Afghan nationals will be continued” and could “abstain from new approvals during this decision process”.
But “it cannot release itself” from approvals which have already been given, it said.
According to the last update given about the scheme given in April 2024, more than 33,000 Afghans have travelled to Germany under the programme.</p><small>2025-07-08 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08202543077f14f.jpg?r=202610' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922850/govt-approves-sugar-import-of-upto-500000-tonnes-to-maintain-affordable-prices' target='_blank'><strong>Govt approves sugar import of upto 500,000 tonnes to maintain ‘affordable prices’</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Tuesday approved the import of half a million tonnes of sugar in a bid to maintain affordable prices of the commodity.
A day earlier, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had emphasised the need for a coordinated policy approach to ensure market stability for essential commodities and food items.
He chaired a committee meeting today to assess the sugar situation in the country and evaluate import requirements.
“The committee approved the import of up to 500,000 metric tonnes of sugar to ensure a stable supply and maintain affordable prices nationwide,” said a statement posted on X.
Dar stressed the government’s commitment towards “price stability and safeguarding consumer interests”, the statement said.
The meeting was attended by the food minister, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, the secretary of the food ministry, senior officials from the Ministry of Industries and Production, and industry representatives.
 






The Ministry of National Food Security and Research said in a press release that the government would import sugar and all arrangements were complete, with immediate implementation being initiated.
“This step was taken to maintain balance in sugar prices. The approach to importing sugar represents a different and clearly better strategy than that of past governments. In the past, subsidies were often relied on to create an artificial shortage of sugar, burdening the national treasury. The current government decided to export sugar at a time when sugar was available in abundance,” the ministry said.
It added that sugar was now being imported to stabilise prices.
Last month, the Sugar Advisory Board approved the import of 500,000 tonnes of the commodity, amid concerns over supply chain disruptions and alleged non-compliance by millers.
In March, Dar said that retail sugar prices should not exceed Rs164 after the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) warned sugar mills against price manipulation. Dar said that according to news reports, there was a spike in sugar prices to Rs178 -179, which was “obviously not tolerable” to the prime minister.
The same month, the federal government had decided to import raw sugar to “stabilise prices” in the country.</p><small>2025-07-08 15:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0819213730a6ab5.jpg?r=195410' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922849/justice-dogar-3-others-take-oath-as-regular-high-court-cjs' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Dogar, 3 others take oath as regular high court CJs</strong></a><br><p>Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and the three acting chief justices of the high courts took their oaths on Tuesday as the regular top judges.
The oath-taking ceremonies were held a day after President Asif Ali Zardari appointed them, based on the nominations by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
President Zardari administered the oath of office to Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, who has been serving in an acting capacity since February, during a ceremony held at Aiwan-i-Sadr in Islamabad.
The ceremony was attended by IHC judges, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, ministers, parliamentarians and the legal fraternity, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.

The development comes less than a month after the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, by a majority of 3-2, upheld the constitutionality of transferring three judges from other provincial high courts to the IHC and referred the matter of seniority determination to the president.
The matter of Justice Dogar and two other judges’ transfer to the IHC in February had sparked a controversy as he was made the senior puisne judge, paving the way for his appointment as the acting IHC chief justice after Justice Aamer Farooq’s elevation to the SC.
Five IHC judges, who were petitioners in the SC case, and four former presidents of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association have challenged the apex court’s ruling.
Oath-takings in Sindh, KP, Balochistan
Meanwhile, the high courts in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan also saw their chief justices taking oaths as regular top judges.
In separate ceremonies, Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah took oath as the Peshawar High Court (PHC) chief justice, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech was sworn in as Balochistan High Court’s (BHC) top judge, and Justice Junaid Ghaffar took the helm of the Sindh High Court (SHC).
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori administered the oath to Justice Ghaffar at a ceremony held at the Governor House in Karachi.
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, fellow SHC judges and members of the Karachi Bar Association and SHC Bar Association were present on the occasion as well.
 


After taking oath, Justice Ghaffar visited the Mazar-i-Quaid, where he laid a floral wreath. Responding to a reporter’s query there, he said the confusion of cases being heard by the regular bench or the constitutional bench would “settle down with time”.
Noting that it was the first time that cases had been categorised in such a manner after the 26th Amendment, Justice Ghaffar said whenever there was a confusion of jurisdiction, a larger bench was formed to decide it.
Meanwhile, Justice Shah assumed the responsibilities as the PHC chief justice in a permanent capacity as KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered the oath to him.
He was serving as the PHC acting chief justice since February 14, following the elevation of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim to the SC.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Minister for States and Frontier Regions Amir Muqam, and KP Assembly’s opposition leader Ibadullah Khan attended the ceremony.
KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed, Peshawar Commissioner Riaz Masood and other top officials were also present.
In a post on X, Kundi said he held a meeting with Justice Shah after the oath-taking to discuss the “vital role of the judiciary in ensuring justice, peace and stability”.
“I reiterated my full support for stronger collaboration between institutions to uphold the Constitution and address public grievances effectively,” the governor asserted.
 






In Quetta, Justice Barrech, who took the oath as BHC’s acting chief justice last month after the retirement of Justice Ejaz Ahmed Swati, was sworn in to continue that role.
Balochistan Governor Jaffar Khan Mandokhail administered the oath to Justice Barech at a ceremony held in the evening at the Governor House.
Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, Balochistan Assembly Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, and former governor and retired Justice Amanullah Yasinzai were present on the occasion, along with senior lawyers.</p><small>2025-07-08 14:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613040-imran-khan-wants-anti-govt-protest-to-hit-peak-on-august-5' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan wants anti-govt protest to 'hit peak' on August 5</strong></a><br><p>

Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.
The van, carrying boys and girls from the private Islamia Public School in Chikar, was returning students to their homes when it met with the accident near a spot known as Tambrial Mor, Jhelum Superintendent of Police (SP) Mirza Zahid Hussain told Dawn.com.
Chikar, a town and hill station in AJK’s Jhelum Valley district, is situated at an altitude of 5,272 feet above sea level and lies about 46 kilometres from Muzaffarabad, the state capital.
As a winter resort, Chikar’s educational institutions do not observe extended summer vacations, unlike other areas.
“It is assumed that after negotiating a bend, the vehicle went out of the driver’s control and fell down the road, causing injuries to almost everyone on board,” the SP said.
He said 16 people that were rushed to Chikar Tehsil Headquarters Hospital were later allowed to go home after treatment while of the 13 students hospitalised in Haitian Bala District Headquarters Hospital, two were kept there, and four others, including the driver, were referred to the Muzaffarabad Combined Military Hospital owing to their serious wounds.
“The rest of the school children were sent home,” he said.
A video clip shared by the SP showed the overturned van resting on a steep, forested slope, surrounded by local residents rushing to help.
“Had it not been for the tall trees that broke the fall, the van could have rolled further down the slope, resulting in heavier losses,” Hussain said.
Last week, six members of a family were killed in AJK’s Neelum valley when their car veered off the road and plummeted hundreds of feet, crashing onto the right bank of the river, officials had said.
In May, an assistant director, three inspectors and a constable of the AJK police lost their lives when their vehicle plunged into a deep ravine in the Poonch division.</p><small>2025-07-08 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613027-pm-shehbaz-appoints-qatari-royal-as-pakistans-tourism-ambassador' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz appoints Qatari royal as Pakistan's tourism ambassador</strong></a><br><p>

The federal government established the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to probe illegal activities on social med­ia. The NCCIA, operating under the Interior Divi­sion, has a key role in combatting cybercrime in Pakistan.
Sub-Inspector (SI) Waseem Khan of the NCCIA’s Cyber Crime Circle informed the Islamabad judicial magistrate on June 24 that under Section 37 (unlawful online content) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, the department was conducting an inquiry regarding 27 “Youtube channels who are involved in disseminating and propagating fake and misleading information against the state Institutions which is likely to cause fear, panic, disorder or unrest in the general public or society along with defamatory and fake remarks/information, which violates the privacy and harms the dignity of the officials of state institutions”.
Among the 27 channels are those of the PTI, journalists Matiuallah Jan, Wajahat Khan, Ahmad Noorani and Asad Ali Toor; former anchors Imran Riaz, Orya Maqbool, Sabir Shakir, and Moeed Pirzada .
He further said that the YouTube channels were “found involved in sharing highly intimidating, provocative and derogatory contents against state institutions and officials of state of Pakistan” and were a “source of publicly disseminating/propagating false, misleading and fake information against the state institutions/officials”.
He said that through their channels, the suspects had “attempted to provoke the general public and armed forces personnel by trying to create a feeling of ill-will among pillars of the state”.
SI Khan had requested the court to issue a warrant/subpoena to Google to remove/block the 27 YouTube channels.
Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Abbas Shah’s June 24 order, available with Dawn.com, said he had heard the inquiry officer (IO) and examined the record on file.
“In the light of facts explained and evidence presented by the IO, this court is convinced that the subject matter constitutes offences punishable under the Peca and penal laws of Pakistan.”
He ordered the “head officer in charge of the security department/custodian of records” to Google block/remove the 27 YouTube channels.
Earlier today, Toor said he had received a notice from YouTube, informing him about the legal request received to remove his channel. “You may choose to act on the said content in terms of the aforesaid court order. If you fail to do so, as per our local law obligations, we may comply with the request without further notice to you,” the notice said.
 






Farhan Mallick, the founder of media agency Raftar and a former news director at Samaa TV, was arrested on March 20 in Karachi and booked under Peca as well as the Pakistan Penal Code in a case related to alleged anti-state content on his YouTube channel.
The arrest was met with widespread criticism from media bodies as well as rights activists.
He was granted bail in April in the many cases against him pertaining to allegedly “anti-state” content and data theft through a call centre.</p><small>2025-07-08 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/081323329908189.jpg?r=132402' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922803/heavy-rain-expected-countrywide-over-next-two-days-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Heavy rain expected countrywide over next two days: PMD</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday issued an alert for heavy rainfall in several parts of the country, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northeast Punjab, Azad Kashmir and parts of Balochistan, for the next two days.
Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat. They are crucial to replenishing water supplies and agriculture, and therefore the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
At least 19 people lost their lives in Balochistan, KP, and the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi due to rain-related incidents in the past two days. An alert by the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) about a possible flood-like situation in various parts of the country has prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to order the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to be prepared to deal with potential emergencies.
In its latest weather update issued today, the Met Office said, “Monsoon rains continue to lash Pakistan, with further downpours expected in upper parts till July 10, 2025.
“Rain-wind/thundershower are expected today (July 8) in Punjab, KP, Azad Kashmir, GB, northeastern and southern Balochistan and Islamabad.”
The Met Office added that “heavy rainfall is also likely at isolated places in Kashmir, northeastern Punjab, Potohar region, and northeastern and southern Balochistan”.
 






“The public is urged to exercise caution and stay informed as rain continues in the coming days,” the weather agency advised.
The low-lying areas in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera and Peshawar are expected to be submerged due to heavy rainfall, it warned.
Islamabad and other areas will receive downpours with strong winds and thunderstorms, while Karachi and other areas of Sindh’s coastal belt could receive drizzling or light rainfall, it added.
The advisory warned against flooding in rainwater drains and local streams in Galliyat; Islamabad/Rawalpindi; Kashmir; KP’s Mansehra, Kohistan, Abbottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi and Mardan districts; Punjab’s Dera Ghazi Khan and Murree; and Balochistan’s Barkhan, Kohlu, Musakhail, Dera Bugti, Nasirabad, Sibi, Loralai, Zhob, Kalat, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Panjgur and Turbat districts.
It cautioned that heavy rainfall and downpours could cause landslides, leading to roadblocks and hurdles in traffic flow in the KP districts, Murree, Galliyat and Azad Kashmir.
In 24 hours since 8am yesterday, several cities recorded heavy to moderate rainfall across Pakistan.
In Punjab, Sheikhupura received 48mm of rainfall, Lahore 75mm, Islamabad 37mm (16mm in Saidpur, 12mm in Zero Point, 9mm in Golra), Gujranwala 6mm, Murree 5mm, Faisalabad 4mm, Sialkot 2mm, and 1mm each in Mandi Bahauddin and Hafizabad, along with traces of rainfall in Toba Tek Singh, Bahawalnagar and Kasur.
In KP, Balakot received the highest amount of rainfall (40mm), while Kakul ranked second with 31mm. Malam Jabba recorded 17mm; Bannu 8mm; Lower Dir 4mm; Cherat 2mm; Upper Dir, Bajaur and Ghalanai 1mm each; and traces of rain in Kalam and Peshawar.
In Sindh, Badin received 4mm of rainfall, Mithi 2mm, while Jacobabad, Larkana, Hyderabad and Karachi received traces. Balochistan’s Kalat recorded 17mm and Ziarat 12mm, with light rainfall in Lasbela.
In Azad Kashmir, Bandi Abbaspur received 7mm, Muzaffarabad 13mm (city area 7mm and airport 6mm), and Rawalakot and Kotli witnessed 1mm each.</p><small>2025-07-08 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/08162106f042f17.jpg?r=165111' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922833/pm-appoints-qatari-princess-as-brand-ambassador-after-she-scales-nanga-parbat' target='_blank'><strong>PM appoints Qatari princess as brand ambassador after she scales Nanga Parbat</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday appointed Qatari mountaineer and royal family member Sheikha Asma Al Thani as the brand ambassador for Pakistan’s mountains and tourism after she recently successfully summited Nanga Parbat, the ninth-highest mountain on Earth located in Gilgit-Baltistan region.
Known as the “Killer Mountain,” the 8,126-metre-high peak is considered one of the world’s most dangerous climbs due to its severe weather conditions and rough terrain.
In a post on X, the premier felicitated Sheikha Asma on the achievement.
 






“I am pleased to appoint Her Highness Sheikha Asma Al Thani as the Brand Ambassador for Pakistan’s mountains and tourism.
“My heartfelt felicitations to Her Highness on her recent feat of scaling Nanga Parbat. It is truly inspiring,” he wrote.
“Her achievement sends a powerful message of courage and determination, and stands as a testament to the enduring friendship between Pakistan and Qatar,” he added.
In a post on Instagram, Sheikha Asma described the relentless challenges she faced on her route to the summit and the emotional toll of the ascent.

“My ninth 8000er and one of the toughest climbs I’ve faced. This mountain tested me in ways I didn’t expect, from black ice beneath my feet to rockfall every few seconds. A constant reminder of how fragile life truly is,” she wrote.
“But even in that danger, there was growth. There was surrender and there was strength I didn’t know I still had. I climb not just to reach summits but to return to what matters, to strip away the noise and reconnect with myself,” she added.
“This mountain will stay with me forever.”
Sheikha Asma hoisted Qatar’s national flag at the summit and becomes the first Qatari woman to do so. Her earlier summits include Mount Everest, K2 and Makalu.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/613003-survivors-grieve-worry-about-future-after-deadly-building-collapse-in-karachis-lyari' target='_blank'><strong>Survivors grieve, worry about future after deadly building collapse in Lyari</strong></a><br><p>

In March, Mahrang and other BYC members were arrested for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.
Mahrang’s counsel, Advocate Israr Baloch, told Dawn.com that the BYC organiser and five other activists were presented before Judge Saadat Bazai, who approved the state prosecutor’s request for their 10-day physical remand.
The other activists were Gulzadi, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Ghaffar Baloch and Beberg Baloch. Advocate Shoaib Baloch also appeared in the court as their lawyer.
 
 

The BYC members were presented in the court in “four different” first information reports (FIRs) after the last extension in their MPO detention expired, Israr added.
Advocate Jibran Nasir, who has served as Mahrang’s counsel in a case last month, shared with Dawn.com the FIR numbers provided by Mahrang’s family of the four cases.
According to a BHC judgment from May provided by Nasir, the FIRs included those registered at the Civil Lines police station on March 19 for storming the Civil Hospital and at Brewery police station on March 2 for blocking the Western Bypass Road in Quetta.
Mahrang was taken into custody under MPO for a period of 30 days (first term) on March 22. Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody last month, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Referring to that, Nasir said in a post on Instagram: “After the state ran out of ways to exploit colonial MPO laws the liberty of the BYC leaders is now being infringed by exploiting the ATC and penal laws.”
“Expect long remands, delayed hearing of bail applications, likely dismissal of bail from ATC and when bail would finally be granted, expect another arrest and transfer to another district jail in another,” the renowned rights lawyer wrote.

BYC member Sammi Deen Baloch, in a post on X, called it a “matter of concern” that activists were being taken to court without evidence.
“Such actions not only cause the state to lose its credibility but also render its own legal and judicial system ineffective and meaningless,” she added.
 






While the BYC is not listed among banned organisations by the National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta), Mahrang is included on its list of proscribed persons.
Constitutional petitions seeking the release of Mahrang and two other activists were rejected by the Balochistan High Court (BHC) in May.
Subsequently, Mahrang’s sister Nadia Baloch appealed the Supreme Court in June against the BHC decision.
The petition alleged that her repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a “sympathiser of militants” was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising her voice for missing persons.
The same month, the Kech chapter of the BYC launched a three-day hunger strike in front of the Turbat Press Club in protest of the leadership’s arrests.</p><small>2025-07-08 11:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612989-islamabad-court-order-to-block-27-prominent-youtube-channels-over-anti-state-content' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court orders to block 27 prominent YouTube channels over 'anti-state content'</strong></a><br><p>
