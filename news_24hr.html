“The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket,” Naqvi posted on X, referring to referee Andy Pycroft.
“The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the match referee from the Asia Cup,” he added.
Spinners led by Kuldeep Yadav helped India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in the Asia Cup on Sunday as the neighbours met on the cricket pitch for the first time since a military conflict between them in May.
Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav stood firm and hit the winning six as Indian fans celebrated at a stadium, which had a lot of empty seats, and the players from both teams went off without handshakes.
After hitting the winning shot, Suryakumar and his teammates refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts. The captain said in the post-match press conference that the move was in alignment “with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) and the government”.
In the post-match presentation, Suryakumar said India took the match against Pakistan as “just another game” and dedicated the win to the Indian army.
“We stand with the victims of the families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity,” Suryakumar said. “We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.”
 






The Pakistan-India hostilities in May were triggered by an April 22 attack on civilians in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that New Delhi, without evidence, accused Pakistan of backing — a charge Islamabad strongly denies.
Following the developments, PCB chief Naqvi earlier today said on X: “Utterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today. Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports.
“Let’s hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace.”
 






Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha did not show up in the post-match ceremony as a reaction to the Indian team’s move.
Pakistan’s coach Mike Hesson explained that the reason Salman was absent from the ceremony was because of the Indian team’s “disappointing” conduct at the end of the match.
“It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Hesson said.
Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema “lodged an official protest over the behaviour of the match referee”, the PCB said in a statement earlier.
India resisted calls to boycott the match between the nations, with its cricket board stating it could not boycott an international event and that such a move would “bring a lot of negativity for all our future endeavours of hosting any multinational tournament”.

The high-level moot — being held under the umbrella of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) — is expected to draw heads of state and governments, along with senior officials, from across the Muslim world.
PM Shehbaz, along with Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, left for Doha on a one-day visit from Lahore, the ruling PML-N said on X.
 






“Pakistan gives immense importance to its relations with Qatar and condemns Israeli aggression against Qatar and other regional states,” the premier’s political party said.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar is already in Doha and actively participated in a meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday to craft the draft resolution that will be discussed during today’s summit, which has been co-sponsored by Pakistan.
PM Shehbaz has also undertook a one-day visit to Doha on September 11, when he met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to denounce the Israeli attack and show solidarity with the Gulf state.
Today’s summit has been convened to rally support for Qatar following the Israeli attack targeting Hamas leaders in the Gulf state on September 9. Five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer were killed in the attack. The attack — widely condemned by major world powers — was carried out while negotiations were underway for a ceasefire in Gaza, in which Qatar has been playing an instrumental role.
 
 

The summit will also discuss the “escalating developments in Palestine — following Israeli attempts to occupy Gaza, expand settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and forcibly displace the Palestinians“, according to an earlier Foreign Office (FO) statement.
Analysts say the high-level moot is meant to send Israel a clear signal. Tel Aviv’s attack has prompted US-allied Gulf Arab states to close ranks, adding to strains in ties between the UAE and Israel, which normalised relations in 2020.
According to a Dawn report, diplomats said leaders at the summit may also weigh in on pushing Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York.
 
 

Moreover, the United Nations Human Rights Council said today that it would host an urgent debate on Tuesday on Israel’s airstrike in Qatar.
The council said the debate would “discuss the recent military aggression carried out by the State of Israel against the State of Qatar on 9 September 2025’”.
Apart from PM Shehbaz, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Iraqi PM Mohammed Shia al-Sudani will also attend today’s moot in Qatar. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is also expected to participate, Turkish media reported.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas also arrived in Doha on Sunday, on the eve of the summit.
Pezeshkian today urged Muslim countries to cut ties with Israel. “It is possible that Islamic countries cut their ties with this fake regime and maintain unity and cohesion as much as possible,” Pezeshkian said before departing for Doha, adding that he hoped the summit would “reach a conclusion” on measures against Israel.
However, it remained to be seen whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, would attend, though he visited Qatar earlier this week in a show of neighbourly solidarity.
US President Donald Trump, who had dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York on Friday, made careful remarks before today’s Arab gathering as Washington’s two powerful Middle Eastern allies face a worsening rift.
“Qatar has been a very great ally. Israel and everyone else, we have to be careful. When we attack people, we have to be careful,” Trump told reporters.
 


The US president initially rebuked Israel over the attack, saying he was “very unhappy” about it. However, yesterday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.
Rubio is set to meet with Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today to examine the aftermath of Tel Aviv’s military action against Qatar and its effects on efforts for a Gaza truce.
Dar seeks steps against Israel to safeguard global order
Foreign Minister Dar met with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan today. The two leaders “strongly condemned Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified strikes on Qatar and other nations in the region”, the FO said on X.
“They reaffirmed unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, underlined the importance of the OIC and the Arab League in mobilising collective action of the Muslim Ummah, and welcomed the convening of the Arab-Islamic Summit.”
 






Dar yesterday also met with OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha, Egypt’s FM Dr Badr Abdelatty, Iran’s FM Abbas Araghchi, Malaysia’s FM Dato’ Seri Mohamad Hasan, Bangladesh’s Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain and Uzbekistan’s FM Bakhtiyor Saidov.
Attending the ministerial meeting, the foreign minister called for urgent steps against Israel to “safeguard the global order”.
During his speech, Dar highlighted that the frequency of meetings to discuss Israel’s activities in the region underlines “how Israel has become a persistent irritant and a danger to world peace and security”, according to a FO statement.
“Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the illegal and unprovoked Israeli aggression against the brotherly State of Qatar,” Dar was quoted as saying.
The foreign minister listed the following “urgent steps” that need to be taken:


Israel must be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should not be allowed to get away with attacking Islamic countries and killing people with impunity.


Creation of an Arab-Islamic task force to monitor the Israeli designs in the region and adopt effective deterrent and offensive measures in a synchronised manner to ward off Israeli expansionist designs.


Pursue the suspension of Israel’s membership in the United Nations. Following up on this step would be a clear message on seriousness by the ummah.


Member states should actively consider implementing additional punitive measures against Israel, as a means to reinforce accountability and deter further violations of international law.


The UN Security Council must urgently demand [from] Israel, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter … an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire, release of hostages and exchange of Palestinian prisoners.


Unfettered, sustained and secure humanitarian access to all civilians in need, and the protection of aid workers, medical teams and UN personnel in the [Occupied Palestinian Territories].


The revival of a genuine and time-bound political process to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting two-state solution in accordance with international law and relevant UN and OIC resolutions.

At issue is the provision of information on individuals living in, or entering, the United States illegally. Trump’s threat adds to a move critics have seen as federal overreach, with more than 2,000 troops patrolling the city.
The comments come after several thousand protesters hit the streets this month over Trump’s August deployment of National Guard troops to “re-establish law, order, and public safety“, after calling crime a blight on the capital.
“In just a few weeks. The ‘place’ is absolutely booming … for the first time in decades, virtually no crime,” Trump said on Truth Social.
 


Bowser’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s post.
Earlier, he had put the metropolitan police department under direct federal control and sent federal law enforcement, including members of ICE, to police the streets. It is unclear when their mission will end.
Trump blamed “radical left Democrats” for pressuring Bowser to inform the government about the non-cooperation with ICE, adding that if the police halted cooperation with ICE, “crime would come roaring back”.
He added: “To the people and businesses of Washington DC, don’t worry, I am with you and won’t allow this to happen. I’ll call a National Emergency, and federalise, if necessary!!!”
Bowser, who has previously praised Trump’s surge of federal law enforcement, bringing a sharp decline in crime, earlier signed an order for the city to coordinate with federal law enforcement.
The National Guard serves as a militia answering to the governors of the 50 states, except when called into federal service. The DC National Guard reports directly to the president.</p><small>2025-09-15 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/15124022a684fa7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942152/indian-forces-gun-down-top-maoist-rebel-two-others' target='_blank'><strong>Indian forces gun down top Maoist rebel, two others</strong></a><br><p>Indian security forces killed a top Maoist commander and two other rebels in a gun battle on Monday, officials said, as the government intensifies efforts to crush the decades-long conflict.
India is waging an all-out offensive against the last remaining traces of the Naxalite rebellion, named after the village in the foothills of the Himalayas where the Maoist-inspired guerrilla movement began nearly six decades ago.
More than 12,000 rebels, soldiers and civilians have been killed since a handful of villagers rose up against their feudal lords there in 1967.
The latest gun battle took place early on Monday in the mineral-rich eastern state of Jharkhand, India’s Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) said in a statement. The federal police described the operation as a “major breakthrough”.
Three “top Naxal commanders” were killed in the fight, the CRPF said, including Sahdev Soren, who was part of the central committee of the Maoist organisation. Authorities had issued a bounty of around $113,000 for his capture.
Last week, forces killed another Maoist commander and nine others in a fierce gun battle along the forested border between the states of Odisha and Chhattisgarh.
The Indian government has vowed to crush the rebellion by the end of March next year.
The rebellion controlled nearly a third of the country with an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 fighters at its peak in the mid-2000s. A crackdown by Indian troops across the “Red Corridor” has killed more than 400 rebels since last year, according to government data.
The group’s chief, Nambala Keshav Rao, alias Basavaraju, was gunned down in May, along with 26 other guerrillas.
The conflict has also seen several deadly attacks on government forces. A roadside bomb killed at least nine Indian troops in January.</p><small>2025-09-15 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1422563790700b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941744/pak-vs-ind-india-make-short-work-of-uninspiring-pakistan-win-by-7-wickets' target='_blank'><strong>Pak vs Ind: India make short work of uninspiring Pakistan, win by 7 wickets</strong></a><br><p>India romped to a comprehensive seven-wicket victory in their high-intensity encounter against Pakistan in the men’s Asia Cup 2025 in Dubai on Sunday.
The match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to ‘boycott’ the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands, as is customary, at the toss and after the match.
Then, at the post-match ceremony, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav seemingly ‘politicised’ the victory by bringing up the Pahalgham terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country.
“We stand with the victim’s families of the Pahalgam terror attack, and we express our solidarity, and we want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces,” the Indian skipper said.
Speaking at the post-match press conference, Yadav said: “Our government and the BCCI were aligned. We took a call and came here just to play the game and gave them (Pakistan) a proper reply.”
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha was not present at the post-match ceremony.
 






Pakistan’s white-ball head coach Mike Hesson explained that the reason the Pakistani captain was absent from the ceremony was because of the Indian team’s “disappointing” conduct at the end of the match.
“It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Hesson said.
 


The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed to Dawn.com that Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema, “registered a protest against the Indian team’s inappropriate behaviour.”
“Manager Cheema has also registered a formal protest against the match referee’s behaviour as well for requesting the captains not to shake hands during the toss,” the PCB said.
Earlier, it was a clinical performance by the Men in Blue after the Indian spinners ruled the roost in the first innings and Pakistan stumbled to 127-9 thanks to an excellent cameo by Shaheen Afridi down the order.
 
 

The pick of the bowlers for India was Kuldeep Yadav, who ended with figures of 3-18 as the Indian spinners never let the Pakistani batters settle.
He was ably supported by the left-arm spin of Patel and pacer Bumrah on a pitch that did not have any demons throughout the match.
Left-arm wrist spinner Yadav came into the attack and struck twice on successive balls to dismiss Hasan Nawaz and Mohammad Nawaz as Pakistan slipped to 64-6 before the 13 over mark.
Yadav was named player of the match for the second successive time in the tournament.
Wickets kept tumbling, but Shaheen coming in at eight down took all the Indian bowlers to the cleaners with four mighty sixes in his unbeaten 33 off 16 balls to push the total past 120.
Pakistan play UAE next on Wednesday and despite the defeat to India are expected to make the next stage and face India again next Sunday.
India, with two wins from two, are nearly through to the next Super Fours stage of the tournament with their final group match against Oman on Friday.

Yadav hits the ball for six, and that’s all folks for this Pakistan-India encounter as the Men in Blue gallop home by 7 wickets with ease.

Over 15 — Ind - 123-3
Yadav looking to finish things off quickly as he lifts Saim for four. Dube ends the over with a massive six and it looks likely Saim will finish as Pakistan’s most successful bowler with figures of 3-35 off four overs. India need five more to win.

Over 14 — Ind - 110-3
13.4: The Indian skipper Yadav cuts Nawaz for four in a statement of authority!
Frustration for Pakistan on the second ball as Yadav flashes, but the ball falls short of point and goes for four. The India skipper adds to the misery by cutting Nawaz for four past the same fielder two balls later. Pakistan seem to have no answer.

Over 13 — Ind - 100-3
The man with the golden arm strikes again!
Saim has knocked over Verma with one that gripped and spun.
 


Shivam Dube walks in. India need 28 runs more off the last seven overs as their hundred comes up.

Over 12 — Ind - 97-2
Yadav gets to his highest score against Pakistan in a T20I and then survives a review for lbw. India getting closer to the target as Nawaz floored a return off Varma.

Over 11 — Ind - 93-2

Where’s a miracle when you need one?
 



Mid-innings analysis by Umaid Wasim:
Pakistan need a miracle. India are coasting in the chase, there is no run-rate pressure, and Pakistan are having difficulty in exerting spells of sustained pressure. The Green Shirts need quick wickets if they are to have any chance.

Over 10 — Ind - 88-2
9.1: Verma launches Sufyan for six!
Sufyan brought in as Salman tried to stymie India with spin, but Yadav lifted him over fine leg for four — his first boundary. Pakistan need a breakthrough and needed it yesterday!

Three singles off the over as Abrar keeps Verma quiet.

Over 8 — Ind - 71-2
Sufyan brought in as Salman tried to stymie India with spin, but Yadav lifted him over fine leg for four — his first boundary. Pakistan need a breakthrough, and quick.

Over 7 — Ind - 64-2
Abrar looks the likeliest spinner so far to trouble India, although Sufyan is yet to bowl. Gives away just three runs in the over.

Over 6 — Ind - 61-2
Verma welcomed Nawaz with a reverse sweep for four and then got another on the third ball.
India is eating into Pakistan’s total. Required rate dips below five as the powerplay ends with Men in Blue at 61.

Over 5 — Ind - 48-2
Abrar has a loud shout for lbw against Yadav turned down. India failed to get a boundary in the over, just six runs coming off it.

Over 4 — Ind - 42-2
3.4: Saim has struck again!
Just when Abhishek Sharma looked like becoming a thorn in Pakistan’s ambitions of getting wickets and stopping the run flow, Saim struck. It was a case of one too many for the left-handed. Having hit back-to-back fours off Saim, he went for another and was caught at long-off.
 


Tilak Verma now at the crease. Only eight runs off the over. Saim looks keen to turn it around for Pakistan with the ball.

Over 3 — Ind - 33-1
Sharma v Shaheen again, and the Indian opener gets a four first-ball, slashing a wider delivery, and before hitting a monstrous six two balls later.
 


Suryakumar Yadav makes a quiet start. He comes into this match with a patchy record against Pakistan.

Over 2 — Ind - 22-1
Saim Ayub is into the attack; let’s hope he can emulate what the Indian spinners did in the first innings.
1.6: Saim has struck with his carrom ball yet again!
Pakistan is attacking with spin from the get-go, with Saim bowling the second over. Shubman Gill hits him for consecutive fours, but it’s one too many as he is stumped off the last ball. Pakistan have the wicket they wanted!

Over 1 — Ind - 12-0
0.1: Newbie Abhishek Sharma welcomes Shaheen Afridi with a boundary off the very first ball of the over.
India get off to a flier. Sharma smashed the first ball back past Shaheen for four and deposited the second ball for six over long-off.

Mid-match summary by Abyan Amir: The Indian spinners ruled the roost as Pakistan stumbled past 120 thanks to an excellent cameo by Shaheen Afridi down the order.
The pick of the bowlers for India was Kuldeep Yadav, who ended with figures of 3-19 as the Indian spinners never let the Pakistani batters settle.
He was ably supported by the left-arm spin of Patel and pacer Bumrah on a pitch that did not have any demons in the first innings.
The Green Shirts have something to defend on board, courtesy of four sixes by Shaheen to end the innings.
India will have to contend with Pakistan’s spin trio of Abrar, Sufyan and Nawaz
Will this be an Afridi cameo to remember, or will India gallop home easily? Only time will tell!
 







Over 20 — Pak - 127-9
Huge six by Shaheen off Pandya over long-on!
The next one is even bigger! It’s in the second tier as Pandya can only scratch his head.

Pakistan have something to defend.
Over 19 — Pak - 110-8
Hundred up for Pakistan!

Over 18 — Pak - 99-8
17.2: Shaheen smacks another six over long-off off Chakravarthy!
Pakistan suffered another blow when Faheem fell lbw two deliveries later. Shaheen keeps strike for the next over.

Over 17 — Pak - 90-7
16.1: Final hope Sahibzada’s attempt to accelerate brings about his downfall, hitting Kuldeep down Panya’s throat, after a patchy 44-ball 40.
16.3: Shaheen smacks Yadav for a huge six over wide long-on!
55 dot-balls in the Pakistan innings so far
With three overs to go, Pakistan risk falling short of even a run-a-ball total!

Over 16 — Pak - 83-6
Five runs off the over as India keep things tight. Pakistan need to push on with just four overs left

Over 15 — Pak - 78-6
14.3 Calls of shot in the newsroom as Pakistan’s only hope at the moment, Sahibzada pulls Yadav for a single.
Faheem finished the over with a four, but runs continue to be hard to come by for Pakistan.

Over 14 — Pak - 72-6
Umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge’s day is going as badly as the Pakistani batters.
He’s given two howlers, both were missing the stumps by miles.
Sahibzada saw a lbw decision overturned on review and finished the over with a four.
 



Over 13 — Pak - 64-6
12.4: Hassan Nawaz departs cheaply!
12.5: Mohammad Nawaz is gone first ball!
India will probably feel they can bowl Pakistan out in quick time. Kuldeep has once again tormented Pakistan. Two wickets in two balls — first Hasan Nawaz caught and then Mohammad Nawaz lbw. Sahibzada has been in from the start and now has all-rounder Faheem Ashraf for support. They are Pakistan’s last recognised batting pair.

Over 12 — Pak - 62-4
Sahibzada broke the shackles and launched the first ball down the ground for six. But two dot balls followed before Pakistan got two more singles. Runs are coming slowly for Pakistan.
 



Over 11 — Pak - 54-4
Singles off the first four balls in Abhishek Sharma’s first over, another off the last ball.
50 up for Pakistan in the 11th over of the innings.

Mid-innings analysis: In the four overs after the powerplay, Pakistan have only got seven runs whilst losing two wickets.
If Fakhar’s departure wasn’t enough, Salman never got going and in an attempt to get quick runs, fell to Patel, who now has two wickets.
Pakistan have to hit out of the spin trap if they are to post a match-saving total. Up to Hasan Nawaz to provide the impetus.

Over 10 — Pak - 49-4
Patel back into the attack as Salman cuts him.
It gets worse for Pakistan. Skipper Salman is caught in the deep.
Salman tried to hit out of the pressure, and only succeeded in getting a top edge off Patel. Pakistan are struggling.

Over 9 — Pak - 47-3
8.2: Salman was adjudged lbw second ball off the over as Chakravarthy changed ends, but Pakistan breathed a huge sigh of relief when it was overturned on review.
Chakravarthy continued bowling a nagging line to Salman with just two runs coming off the over.
Over 8 — Pak - 45-3
7.4: Fakhar is gone!
Axar Patel was brought on into the attack and got the big wicket of Fakhar Zaman off the fourth ball he bowled. Fakhar tried to hit him out of the park, but could only find Tilak Verma running in from long-on.
The onus is now on captain Salman Ali Agha to stabilise the innings.

Over 7 — Pak - 43-2
Only two runs off the over as India’s left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav comes into the attack. Pakistan have to start accelerating.

Over 6 — Pak - 42-2
Sahibzada went after Bumrah and swatted him away for six into the stands!
Got two runs after a miscue on the very next ball. Pakistan will be thankful they are just two down at the end of the powerplay, especially after the start they got off to.

Over 5 — Pak - 34-2
India brings on their first spinner — Varun Chakravarthy
4.3: Fakhar slots Chakravarthy for four down the ground
 


India brought spin to the attack in the shape of Chakravarthy but Sahibzada and Fakhar seem to have now settled down. Fakhar hit him down the ground for four as Pakistan’s rebuild continues.

Over 4 — Pak - 26-2
3.3: Sahibzada smacks Bumrah over wide long-on for a six!
Pakistan’s first six of the innings comes in the 4th over. The early inning jitters are now gone.
 


Another good over with no losses as Sahibzada and Fakhar look to rebuild Pakistan’s innings. Bumrah bowled two good balls to open the over before Sahibzada smashed him for six over long-on. Those were the the only runs in the over but crucially, Pakistan have not lost another wicket.

Over 3 — Pak - 20-2
Pandya is pulled away for a single by Fakhar.
2.3: Pakistan get their first boundary courtesy a pull by Fakhar.
Good over for Pakistan. Two singles came off the first two balls before Fakhar pulled a short one from Pandya for four — Pakistan’s first boundary. Fakhar got another with a drive through the legside off the fifth ball while three runs came from wides.

Over 2 — Pak - 7-2
1.2: Haris gets a top edge and Bumrah strikes. Pandya catches, running in from fine leg.
Pakistan have got off to the worst possible start. India have their tails up. Haris was the standout in the side’s tournament-opener against Oman but now he departs.
 


1.4: It gets worse for Pakistan. Fakhar has been adjudged lbw. The left-hander immediately reviewed
Pakistan get a reprieve, the review shows ball pitching outside leg.
Bumrah bowls a splendid first over with some searing yorkers. Gets the dangerman Haris and also had Fakhar, only for it to be overturned on review.

Over 1 - Pak 5-1
India’s Hardik Pandya starts off with a wide down the legside.
Saim Ayub falls on the very first ball of the match.
Saim Ayub’s troubles with the bat continue. He was also out first ball against Oman.
 


Mohammad Haris is off the mark on the first ball and Sahibzada also gets off the mark on the first ball.
Haris flashes and misses on the next ball. He blocks the penultimate ball off the over.
He hits out on the next ball and gets two.

Anthems
The Pakistani national anthem is being played first at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
 


The Indian anthem is being played next.
Pakistan openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan make their way to the crease.

Analysis by Dawn’s Umaid Wasim: Pakistan wanted to bat first and set an above-par total. India wanted to bowl first. Both sides will be quite happy with the outcome of the toss. Pakistan, though, face a trial by spin. The pitch is the same as the one for India’s opening match against the UAE. India skipper Suyakumar Yadav said at the toss that batting got easier in the second stanza of the UAE game, and perhaps that is why he wanted his side to be batting second.

An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster, but emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who engaged in a four-day military conflict earlier this year.
Even before the clashes in May, which nearly escalated into a full-blown war, bilateral cricket ties had been suspended. The arch-rivals now play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
Political relations have deteriorated further since the clashes, with several former Indian players urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking at the toss, said: “We’re very excited for the match.”
According to the captain, Pakistan’s rationale behind batting first is that the surface looks to be on the slower side.
His Indian counterpart, Suryakumar Yadav, said this team was really looking forward to this game.
Both teams are unchanged since their last encounters in the tournament.
Pakistan batter Saim Ayub said on Saturday that the team was not just focusing on the Pakistan-India match, but winning the men’s Asia Cup.
 


While reigning T20 world champions India are the firm favourites to retain their title, Pakistan are on a high, having convincingly beaten Afghanistan to win the final of a tri-series and Oman in the lead-up to the contest.
The two teams last faced each other in February, in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in the ODI format.

The blueprint seeking to build “an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era” comes against the backdrop of a shifting regional and global security and economic landscape, with Beijing — in the words of a Chinese foreign ministry official — “envisioning an even greater role for Islamabad in international and regional affairs”.
China has pledged its support to help Islamabad achieve that goal, the official stated recently speaking to a delegation of Pakistani journalists visiting Beijing.
The new roadmap draws mainly on earlier milestones, including the launch of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative in 2015, and subsequent documents and pledges like the long-term CPEC plan and the Framework Agreement on Industrial Cooperation.

In spite of a lot of optimism around the new China-Pakistan roadmap, many remain cautious as ‘an element of uncertainty still hangs’ over CPEC cooperation

It looks to expanding security ties, including stronger military cooperation and enhanced counter-terrorism coordination. Both sides described their strategic defence partnership as “irreplaceable” for regional stability, reiterating “zero tolerance” on terrorism. More importantly, while security ties remain central, both sides are consolidating economic cooperation.
The plan in question reaffirms CPEC as the “flagship” of their economic partnership and a pioneering project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), aligning its five corridors — growth, livelihoods, innovation, green and openness — with the growth goals of Islamabad’s Uraan initiative, with a focus on tighter security for Chinese nationals and projects in Pakistan amid targeted terrorist attacks against Chinese interests.
The roadmap for bilateral cooperation under what Pakistani officials often refer to as CPEC 2.0 follows Pakistan’s efforts to secure Beijing’s renewed support for its industrialisation through investment in the country’s manufacturing sector to accelerate export-led growth.
So far, energy and transport projects worth $25.2 billion have been completed under the first phase of CPEC, while schemes amounting to $26.8bn are in the pipeline.
The new five-year plan prioritises fast-tracked industrialisation in Pakistan through special economic zones, strengthening of mining and agricultural cooperation, and expansion of “small and beautiful” livelihood projects in health, education, agriculture and disaster prevention.
 
 

Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal recently told a media briefing that Pakistan and China had agreed to form a consortium of bilateral and multilateral partners, including the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, to finance the $7bn Karachi-Peshawar railway line.
Trade and connectivity will be bolstered through expanded use of the Khunjerab Pass for both bilateral and Afghan transit trade, while pushing forward trade liberalisation under Phase-II of their Free Trade Agreement. Besides, Beijing will encourage Chinese enterprises to invest in Pakistan while committing to providing “financial support (to Islamabad) within its capacity”.
In an interview with Associate Press of Pakistan, Professor Cheng Xizhong, a senior research fellow at Beijing’s Charhar Institute noted that the plan carries extraordinary economic significance as it will strengthen bilateral trade, investment and industrial cooperation.
With CPEC already delivering substantial outcomes, he maintained, the next phase will see greater investment, helping Pakistan boost its development capacity through industrial up-gradation and enhanced position in the global industrial chain.
In spite of a lot of optimism around the new roadmap redefining bilateral ties, many remain cautious. Speaking with Dawn, economist Adil Nakhuda noted that despite the optimism surrounding the action plan, “an element of uncertainty still hangs” over CPEC cooperation. “Security remains the foremost challenge while Pakistan’s fragile economic conditions are discouraging for Chinese investors.”
He points out that the first phase of CPEC, largely focused on energy and transport infrastructure, successfully addressed critical connectivity and growth bottlenecks. “The second phase, however, is supposed to drive industrialisation, FDI inflows and export growth. If exports don’t grow, the second phase will not be any different from the first one,” he cautioned.
For Pakistan to attract meaningful foreign investment, Mr Nakhuda said, it must first tackle security concerns, complete Special Economic Zones and carry out governance reforms. “You have to do this for foreign investors; don’t expect them to bring their capital here and also clean up your policy and governance mess for you,” he underlined, pointing to the need for ease of doing business, tariff rationalisation, factory law reforms, and a broader enabling policy framework. “We need a total policy overhaul for the success of CPEC 2.0.”
Others like Dr Safdar Ali Sohail, Executive Director at the Social Protection Resource Centre and a former civil servant, argued that “CPEC is now just one of several pillars of bilateral China-Pakistan cooperation, with military, security, political and diplomatic ties appearing to take precedence.”
Dr Sohail pointed out that linking economic cooperation with Pakistan’s Uraan programme reflects Chinese sensitivity to Islamabad’s growth priorities. For it to succeed, the plan must be backed in the next six months by targeted and definitive policies, strategies and funding commitments.

Where do Gulf states go from here?</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s recent strike in Doha crossed a line Gulf leaders had long assumed was sacrosanct: that Gulf capitals were under the American security umbrella and hence outside the operational zone of the Gaza conflict .
Not anymore. Gulf states are now grappling with a new reality: a risk-acceptant Israel willing to reorder the wider Middle East — even at the expense of US allies in the Gulf.
For Gulf leaders, the American inability to restrain Israel is perplexing. More fundamentally, a question looms: can they still trust the US security umbrella in a fracturing region?
Some allies more important than others
As a shocked Qatari leadership processed the strike, it looked to Washington and its Gulf partners for support. The US, meanwhile, issued only a mild rebuke of Israel for hitting another close ally that hosts the region’s largest US base, Al Udeid, home to CENTCOM’s regional headquarters. President Trump promised deeper defence cooperation with Qatar and claimed Doha was given last-minute notice of the strike. Qatar pushed back, terming the notification too late. Trump’s remarks dragged Doha into politically uncharted waters, forcing it to reassert its credibility as a reliable mediator.
 


For Qatar, the image of the country as a diplomatic mediator has become the lynchpin of its foreign policy in recent years. Israel’s strike on Hamas leaders in Doha struck at the very core of that strategy, shattering the perception of Qatar as a safe and neutral venue for dialogue between belligerents.
For Doha, its role as a trusted broker — backed by US support — has been central to expanding its diplomatic relevance with major powers and securing credibility in international forums. This mediation brand is not symbolic; it is Qatar’s primary tool for offsetting its geographic vulnerability and amplifying its influence in a region where it is dominated by larger neighbours such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Yet, now Qatar is looking up to these very regional neighbours to chart a regional response to Israeli aggression.
Realising the gravity of the moment, Abu Dhabi and Riyadh, the regional heavyweights, moved swiftly, framing the strikes as a challenge to ‘collective Gulf security’, not just Qatari sovereignty. This aligns with Article 2 of the ‘Joint Defence Agreement’ of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which states: “any attack on any of them is an attack on all of them and any threat to one of them is a threat to all of them”.
The real dilemma now is: how to treat an Israeli strike on Qatar as an attack on GCC states, without jeopardising their security cooperation with the US, which was meant to protect them in the first place? An uncomfortable truth is now evident for Gulf states: for the US, some allies matter more than others.
What next for the GCC?
At this point, expressions of solidarity and condemnation are simply not enough. Israel will not be deterred by statements alone, knowing Riyadh and Abu Dhabi remain constrained by their dependence on the US security architecture. Despite their show of support, recent history of Qatar’s tense ties with both the UAE and KSA also weighs on the collective response.
 
 

For now, Israel’s reckless behaviour of even attacking those regional neighbours who are facilitating mediation to end the war is hurting the decades-long US security pact with the Gulf states. Among the GCC states, Washington had found a pragmatic partner in Doha, and that collaboration had delivered results in recent years. However, due to Israel’s unhinged risk-taking, both the GCC and the US are now scrambling to restore the credibility of their security cooperation.
The challenge is most acute for Qatar, which must simultaneously restore its security and its standing as a mediator. Within days, Doha moved from mediator to victim.
Drawing on its experience of mediating between the US and the Taliban to end the Afghan conflict, Doha had assumed that Tel Aviv would not strike the very mediator facilitating the only channel linking Hamas, Israel, and Washington.
Qatar’s immediate priority is to raise the reputational cost of any repeat strike while hardening security around negotiations. It is leaning on Washington to restrain Tel Aviv, while underscoring the critical nature of the Doha channel. But trust is absent when Israel appears committed to a military-only path. Beyond mediation, Gulf states, especially Qatar, will now demand firmer guardrails against Israeli aggression and clearer red lines for operations on Gulf soil.
Alternatives to US guarantees do not exist in the short term: Chinese or Russian security patronage is neither feasible nor desirable, and even a regional security architecture involving Egypt, Turkey, or Pakistan cannot function without US assent and participation.
 
 

Crucially, the US umbrella was never designed to deter strikes from Israel — a crucial US ally — on Gulf territory. To adapt, Gulf states must develop defensive capabilities outside the US framework while deepening cooperation with regional partners. Early-warning and missile-defence systems from European and Asian suppliers could provide a ring-fence of protection, creating a semi-autonomous shield.
The Doha strike is more than a breach of sovereignty: it is a stress test for the entire Gulf security order. Outrage without deterrence is noise, and the Gulf cannot afford noise.
The signals from the Gulf must be concrete: tighter airspace control, joint threat alerts, and a quiet understanding that any actor striking inside GCC territory forfeits access to Qatar-hosted mediation.
For Washington, the credibility gap is real. If the US cannot restrain an ally from striking another ally’s capital during US-brokered talks, its security protection is not credible anymore. Finally, as the Gulf ponders a regional diplomatic response to avoid becoming next battle space, Qatar faces its own decisive moment: to host, or not to host?

The old order has been uprooted by the rise of new powers, and with it, a new global contest has begun.
In the battle for economic dominance, technology has become the new frontline. Just as artificial intelligence is transforming the way we work, cryptocurrencies are reshaping the very foundation of finance and challenging the state’s control over the flow of money.
For now, most digital currencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are notorious for their dramatic highs and lows, which makes them impractical to use as a reliable medium of exchange. Consumers need something more reliable. This gave rise to a new class of cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins.
 
 

Stablecoins are designed to keep their prices steady by linking their value to other assets like fiat currencies or commodities. This makes stablecoins a safer means for quickly transferring funds. And since blockchain transactions are recorded almost instantaneously on digital ledgers, these coins allow cross-border and retail transactions to be completed within minutes instead of days and within a fraction of the fee charged by card issuers and banks.
More importantly, stablecoins could lead to the rise of new, innovative products. It could play a similar role to that of bank accounts and money market funds, or tokens backed by stocks, private equity stakes, debt, and ETFs.
For these reasons, US President Donald Trump recently signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation (Genius) Act. The Act requires issuers to get a federal license, disclose the reserve composition, have a one-to-one high-quality liquid asset backing, and conduct independent reserve audits. It essentially demands full transparency from issuers in order to boost investor confidence in dollar-backed cryptos.
Already, companies are lining up to create their own stablecoins. Companies like Stripe, JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, and Amason are planning to issue their own stablecoins. In Pakistan, more than 100 million people are unbanked, and the use of stablecoins could provide a quicker way to bring them into the formal financial system without having to open a traditional bank account. This would greatly help the freelance community and overseas Pakistanis, who face hurdles in the form of high fees, payment delays, and a lack of access to reliable payment platforms like PayPal.

With the growing popularity of digital currencies, richer and more advanced countries may benefit from technological advancement, whereas poorer countries may have to grapple with the negative consequences

While there are obvious benefits, there is also a risk that the growth of these stablecoins could derail the financial system. The fear is that if companies and commercial banks start issuing their own private money, stablecoins could one day dislodge central banks and upend monetary policy control. This is especially true for developing countries like Pakistan, which are often plagued by volatile currency swings and inflation.
 
 

The use of dollar-backed stablecoins could potentially lead to the dollarisation of the economy. Already, dollar stablecoins are gaining traction in countries like Nigeria and Turkey, where fears of inflation are high and the trust in the government is low.
Pakistan, too, could face a similar threat. Informal money transfer and black market foreign exchange trading would lead to the creation of a parallel economy that exists beyond the reach of the central bank. Stablecoins’ ability to bypass intermediaries could lead to money laundering and terrorism financing concerns.
Once again, the disparity caused by new tech is in focus here. Richer and more advanced countries benefit from technological advancement, whereas poorer countries have to grapple with the negative consequences. Nevertheless, the United States has now endorsed stablecoins as part of its wider shift in its stance to promote digital assets in order to ensure the dollar’s dominance in an increasingly digitised world.
Regardless of who wins the digital currency race, the rise of such tech could one day pose a real threat to the Pakistani economy. The best solution for Pakistan is to double down on its effort to create its own Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). CBDCs can mirror a lot of the benefits that these new cryptocurrencies offer.
 
 

At the same time, the State Bank should also develop a framework for regulating stablecoins. Like many other new technologies before it, stablecoins could just be another hype. However, in the absence of any proactive measures, they could potentially be used by foreign powers to undermine the Pakistani economy.
Crypto was created to decentralise power. A bold invention in a time when states are increasingly seeking to consolidate their control over every aspect of life. Crypto’s past has proven its allure as well as the chaos that comes with it. It promises to revolutionise finance as well as destabilise it. The challenge now is to not stop innovation but to guide it.

One uprising may not be the single factor responsible for the transformation. However, using some examples of the past, we can say that such metamorphoses have already taken place in history.
Before discussing the Gen Z-led movement, I would like to cite one example from the last century — the French uprising of May 10, 1968, in Paris—which marked the end of one era and the beginning of another. That uprising also embodied the same attributes as the Gen Z protest, which had a global impact. Nepal’s Gen Z movement was spontaneous. It was guided by a historic sense of protest, spirit of rebellion and change.
The French uprising was organised by students. The single-day uprising, often referred to as the French Revolution, after the original revolution of 1789, brought significant changes and transformations in France and the world. I felt its effects as a youth in Kathmandu. The demonstrators were students from the younger generation and some from the older generation. Not only did they have different demands from the state, but they also expressed the purpose of the uprising in different idioms.
However, the primary objective was the same: To change the society and the French bureaucratic and obscurantist character. Regarding this uprising, James Miller, in his book The Passion of Michel Foucault, about the French Philosopher, states, “It made little sense tactically. It made perfect sense symbolically. For a barricade, in the mind of every educated French citizen, was the mythic emblem of revolt, a living image of the revolutionary tradition begun in 1789 and renewed in ‘four different years of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries’—and now… in May 1968.”

The Sept 8 Gen Z protest was a mix of ire and dreams

The Gen Z protest across Nepal, with Kathmandu — the capital — as the centre on Sept 8, 2025, evokes similar sentiments. The protest was a mix of ire and dreams. Such a combination is a feature of spontaneous rebellions and demonstrations we are all familiar with.
The last Nepali political revolution did share some of these qualities. We should view the Gen Z protest in a historical context because its legacy is set to leave a mark on Nepal’s history. The rebellious youths and people swiftly changed the pattern of the power structure, leading to the ouster of the prime minister.
The political change of 1990 had compelled King Birendra to give up the power centred on the Shah Kings. Following the movement, a multiparty democratic system was established. Later, the April 2006 People’s Movement compelled Birendra’s heir, his younger brother King Gyanendra, to step down from power. Ultimately, Nepal became a constitutionally Federal Democratic Republic on Dec 28, 2007. Modern scholars, including Lok Raj Baral, Krishna Hachhethu and others in the Indic region and the West, say that the very concept of a sovereign and centralised state has become an anachronism.
After Nepal’s vital transition, it was necessary to regulate the power structure in a careful, transparent and proper manner. For this, the country needed a crop of foresighted political leaders. The new system worked within a framework constituted by political parties. Their leaders generated a pattern of working with the multiparty system in the country, remaining committed to a new democratic culture and work ethic.
Many youths who demonstrated on Sept 8 were in school or college uniforms. Spontaneous, angry and bright, they were the metaphors of protests that galvanised the spirit of the rebellion. The most striking part was that they were symbolically significant. Their protest was part of a global movement of youths. When the corrupt, arrogant, short-sighted government shut down social media, it targeted the new culture, interests and sentiments of the youths who used them for various purposes. Everyone woke up to find that the government had banned major social media apps and messaging services. The government arbitrarily fixed a time for social media to surrender. Twenty-six social media firms, including Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Pinterest, and X, were given seven days to register under the new provisions.
 
 

The government’s move was short-sighted and guided by its autocratic mindset. They feared that the users would speak against them by creating fake IDs. Such use would spread hate elocutions, malicious and false news, and eventually lead to the commission of crimes. Such suspicion had no foundation.
The ban on platforms used by the social media-savvy generation startled them. Their response generated protest and rebellion against what the Gen Z generation called corrupt and wealth-amassing people. Violence erupted after the protests rose like a storm; on Sept 8 alone, reportedly, 19 people were killed. Then the government immediately rolled back the media ban.
The social media ban alone was not the cause of the anger and frustration. Corruption, favouritism and impunity also triggered it. The killing of the youths on Sept 8 provoked angry responses. There is no need to reiterate the order of events that followed. More than 50 people have lost their lives.
In the aftermath of the protest, Gen Z youths met with the army chief to form an interim government and restore order in the country. It was profoundly moving and revealing to hear about 10 prominent leaders of the Gen Z movement present their views about life, politics and generational questions at the Reporter’s Club on Sept 11. A leader was weeping, showing a shirt stained by his comrade’s blood. They were all in quest for the right idioms and ideas about charting a course of history in the country.
Nepal has experienced various vicissitudes of history. Now that we have an interim government led by former chief justice Sushila Karki, we are confident that this one, too, will steer the nation towards success. Kudos to all!

The agreement extends beyond railroads into highways, industry, agriculture, and livelihoods — signalling a deeper strategic partnership. According to a Dawn report, a pivotal follow-up meeting is set for Sept 26 in Beijing.
The ML-1 project is vital for Pakistan’s economy but has been repeatedly delayed since 2017 due to Covid-19 disruptions, political turmoil, financing disputes, liquidity shortages and security risks for Chinese workers. Initially estimated at $9.85bn, the cost was rationalised to $7bn through a bilateral agreement in October 2023 to make it viable.
Yet, even this revised figure may not remain immune from overruns if implementation is delayed further. Still, the new $7bn financing plan, with China, Pakistan, the Asian Development Bank, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank involved, is encouraging and draws the project closer to launch.
But ML-1 is not alone in facing this fate. Many federal and provincial development projects remain stuck in disputes and mismanagement, delaying completion and escalating costs. At the root lie two chronic flaws: Pakistan’s dependence on foreign loans that make timely funds uncertain and the state’s weak capacity to plan and manage projects in the public interest. Too often, schemes are designed for political mileage or to enrich contractors rather than serve people.
A 2022 study by Hafiz M Nadir and Dr Ahmed at Leeds Beckett University, covering 65 construction projects of the Frontier Works Organisation in Pakistan, found cost overruns averaged 28.3 per cent, with delays stretching an average of 2.1 years per project. Government department projects overshot costs by 37.6pc, while road projects suffered the longest delays — about 2.3 years each. The study urged public and private organisations, regulators, financiers, and the government to tighten planning, financing, and technical oversight to curb this chronic waste.

Many federal and provincial development projects remain stuck in disputes and mismanagement, delaying completion and escalating costs

The Diamer-Bhasha Dam illustrates the scale. Conceived in the early 2000s at Rs479bn, its cost has now crossed Rs1.05 trillion — a 119pc jump. Design changes, enhanced security, rupee depreciation, and land acquisition delays all piled on, raising the bill.
Even smaller projects reveal shocking revisions. In February 2023, Dawn reported that the government had approved Rs4.7bn for maintenance dredging at Gwadar Port — nearly five times the original Rs1bn estimate of June 2022. The sharp increase reflected years of deferred maintenance, underestimated technical needs, and poor assessments.
Urban transport tells the same story. The Orange Line Metro Train in Lahore, launched in 2014 at $1.6bn, got bogged down in litigation, heritage disputes, and technical hiccups. Final costs swelled once resettlement and financing charges were added. Karachi’s Circular Railway, once tagged at Rs20bn, now exceeds Rs200bn, according to Planning Commission estimates reported in local media. Poor federal-provincial coordination has kept it stalled.
Each escalation is more than a technical nuisance; it is a fiscal burden that demands fresh borrowing or diversion of funds from other priorities. In practice, social spending becomes the casualty. Health and education budgets are trimmed to accommodate emergency allocations. Economists warn that such “crowding out” undermines human capital and long-term growth.
 
 

Debt servicing already consumes more than half of federal revenues; overruns squeeze fiscal space further. Reliance on external loans to cover revised costs swells foreign debt, compounding balance-of-payments pressures. The result is familiar: more debt, less development, and heavier burdens on ordinary people.
This fiscal squeeze was stark in FY25; the PSDP began at Rs1.4tr, was cut to Rs1.15tr, then revised to Rs1.1tr. Actual spending fell to Rs905bn — nearly Rs500bn below the original plan. With debt servicing, administrative costs, and higher defence spending already high, overruns choked fiscal room. Cuts forced prioritisation of politically expedient infrastructure, especially roads, while sectors like education, health, and water lost ground.
Analysts trace recurring overruns to systemic weaknesses. A 2024 World Bank report, ‘Drivers of Delays in Procurement of Infrastructure Projects’, highlights how slow procurement and late contract awards set the stage for costly delays. Once underway, creeping design and scope changes push timeframes and budgets higher.
The report also points to weak preparation and overly optimistic cost baselines at the approval stage, leaving projects vulnerable to overruns. Though not specific to Pakistan, the findings resonate strongly with how large projects are conceived and executed here.
The consequences go beyond construction sites. Cost overruns erode value for money, undermine investor confidence, and worsen debt dynamics. With Pakistan already battling high deficits, every escalation adds financing needs — leaving less room for schools, hospitals, or social protection. Economists call it a “hidden tax on progress”.
The remedies are well known: realistic appraisals, transparent procurement, contingency financing, and timely contractor payments. Though rarely used in Pakistan, one simple but powerful tool is ‘earned value management’, which compares what was planned, what has been achieved, and what has been spent.
If numbers don’t match, managers get an early warning. It works like a dashboard, showing whether a project is running late or overspending.

• Opposition leader asks KE to withdraw MUCT increase in electricity bills
• Mayor claims City Council approved hike in its budget session
KARACHI: In a move drawing sharp criticism from the opposition for allegedly violating “defined legal limits”, the Karachi Metropolitan Corpor­ation (KMC) has increased the rates of the Municipal Utility Charges and Taxes (MUCT) for industrial and commercial users from Rs400 to Rs750.
Members of the business community complained that they were being charged nearly double the previous amount in the head of the MUCT.
The MUCT are collected via K-Electric bills from its consumers living within the jurisdiction of the KMC.
Leader of the Opposition in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin of the Jamaat-i-Islami has sent a legal notice to KE Chief Executive Officer Moonis Alvi, demanding that the power utility immediately withdraw the increase in the MUCT, which was made “unlawfully” without the approval of the elected City Council.
The notice highlighted that the KE raised MUCT rates to Rs750 per month for commercial properties, despite the last City Council resolution, which fixed the rate at Rs400 per month in June 2024. A subsequent proposal to increase the rate to Rs550 was deferred in 2025, and no new resolution has been passed since then, read the notice.
“The KE, which only acts as a collection agent on behalf of the KMC, has no legal authority to alter or enhance MUCT rates,” said Mr Saifuddin.
He said the arbitrary hike not only burdened citizens of Karachi, but also undermined the authority of the elected City Council and insulted the public mandate.
City Mayor Murtaza Wahab, however, expressed his “wonders” over “unawareness” of the opposition and its leaders about the “facts and procedures”.
“This increase has in fact been approved by the City Council in the budget session,” he told Dawn.“So this argument doesn’t stand that it’s a violation of the rules.”
He continued: “Secondly we only increased slab for the industrial and commercial users. The reason is this segment of the city is more prone to fire and other incidents where the municipal resources and utilities are spent more. We should not mislead people only for political point scoring.”
‘No new charges’
KMC officials claimed that no new charges were being imposed under the MUCT head.
“Historically, industrial and commercial consumers were charged up to Rs5,000 under the same category,” said an official.
The slab for industrial and commercial consumers had initially been reduced to Rs400 by the mayor, but it was being revised upward in the latest budget, he added.
“The funds collected through this municipal tax will be utilised for essential services, including the fire brigade and road maintenance,” added the official.
The KMC in August 2024 formally notified the collection of MUCT through K-Electric.
The KMC and the KE had signed an agreement in June 2022 which finally became effective from July 2024 after the City Council approved the levy.
The consumers are charged as per category, which is notified by the KMC from time to time.
Referring to different slabs of the MUCT, an official said that the KE consumers receiving bills of up to 100 units remain exempted from the taxes and those consuming units between 101 and 200 pay Rs20 every month.
Those consuming units between 201 and 300 pay Rs40 and those consuming between 301 and 400 units pay Rs100 through their KE bills.
The KE consumers consuming 401-500 units pay Rs125, the consumers of units between 501 and 600 pay Rs150, the consumers of 601 and 700 units pay Rs175 and those consuming more than 700 units pay Rs300 in their monthly bills.
All categories of commercial and industrial consumers pay Rs400 each with their electricity bills.

• Promises farmers emergency support packages for next sowing season
• Says loss assessment surveys likely to be completed within 15 days
TOBA TEK SINGH: As Pakistan grapples with devastating floods, a senior Inte­rnational Monetary Fund official confirmed an upcoming mission will evaluate if the country’s financial and emergency plans are adequate to handle the crisis, shortly after the finance minister signalled talks with the lender for relief.
An IMF team is expected in Pakistan by the end of the month for a review mission, Federal Minister for Finance and Reve­nue Muhammad Aur­angzeb said on Sunday, stressing that discussing flood-related financial needs with the IMF was a necessary step.
“There is nothing wrong with asking the IMF about the relief, because we are in the fund programme,” Mr Aurangzeb said during a visit to flood-affected areas in Kamalia. “The IMF responded very responsibly and the prime minister announced the relief.”
The minister’s comments came as damage assessments from the catastrophic floods, which have killed at least 972 people, are underway across the nation.
 


“Damage assessments are currently under way, and these are very important — not only for our talks with the IMF but also with other financial organisations,” he said.
While Pakistan plans a comprehensive discussion with the IMF, Aurangzeb noted that the cabinet has decided to first utilise the nation’s own resources to provide immediate aid to the millions affected.
“We have resources available for now. When the IMF team arrives, we will hold a comprehensive discussion with them about what we need at this stage, especially concerning rehabilitation and reconstruction,” he added.
 
 

Key relief measures already announced include a decision that flood victims will not be charged for their August electricity bills, with adjustments made for those who have already paid. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also set a 100-day deadline for the rehabilitation of all flood victims.
The government is also closely monitoring the economic fallout, including inflation. “Since international oil prices are falling, imported inflation is not very high,” Mr Aurangzeb said.
However, he acknowledged a discrepancy between farmers’ reports of severe crop damage and initial government assessments.
He assured that the government would not permit hoarding or price gouging and was considering special packages for farmers to help them sow their next crops on time, adding that farmers and the general public would be facilitated in every possible way so they could resume their livelihoods at the earliest.
He said the government was considering to announce special packages for farmers to enable them to sow their next crops on time.
He pointed out that both a climate emergency and an agriculture emergency had already been declared to protect agricultural productivity and ensure timely rehabilitation of the flood victims
During his visit, Mr Aurangzeb distributed aid to affected families and emphasised the need for better future planning to avoid similar devastation.
“We must learn lessons from past floods and improve planning to avoid such devastation in the future,” he remarked, adding that the location of housing schemes needed serious reconsideration.
IMF to review fiscal agility
Confirming the upcoming mission under the country’s existing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, the IMF’s resident representative in Pakistan, Mahir Binici, said the review would be critical in assessing the country’s financial capacity to respond to the disaster.
“The mission will assess whether the FY26 budget, its spending allocations and emergency provisions remain sufficiently agile to address the spending needs necessitated by the floods,” Binici said in a statement on Saturday.
In May, the IMF’s board approved a $1.4 billion loan to help Pakistan strengthen its economic resilience to climate vulnerabilities, but the disbursement of funds is contingent on the successful completion of reviews under the EFF.

The president expressed this resolve during a visit to top Chinese aerospace and defence conglomerate, the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), which manufactures the J-10C aircraft.
According to the President’s Secr­etariat, he is the first foreign head of state to visit the facility. He was accompanied by his children, PPP Chairman Bilawal and MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari.
During the visit, President Zar­dari met with the company’s engineers and scientists and pra­ised the Chinese-made aircraft’s capabilities, which he said were amply demonstrated during the recent Maarka-i-Haq and Opera­tion Bun­yanum Marsoos against India.
 







Head of state gets a peek at stealth fighter production; praises J-10C, JF-17 for strengthening aerial defences

The president lauded AVIC as a “symbol of China’s technological advancement and of the end­uring strategic partnership bet­ween Pakistan and China”.
He was briefed on AVIC’s capabilities, including the J-10, the co-production of the JF-17 Thun­der with Pakistan, the J-20 stea­l­th fifth-generation fighter airc­r­aft, and unmanned aerial vehicles.
Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, Paki­stan’s Ambassador to China Khalil Hashmi and China’s Amb­assador to Pakistan Jiang Zaid­ong also accompanied the president.
High-speed train
President Zardari also travelled from Chengdu to Mianyang via high-speed train.
 
 

During the half-hour journey, he praised China’s achievements in developing sustainable transport, calling its pollution-free electric propulsion and earthquake early warning technologies “a marvel of railway engineering”.
He noted that such innovations offered “valuable lessons for other countries including Pak­istan”. Officials highlighted that China operates the world’s largest high-speed rail network of over 45,000 kilometres, carrying more than 2 billion passengers annually on trains that run up to 350km per hour.
With trains running at up to 350km/h, the network links almost all major Chinese cities. China has built a standardised, dedicated passenger system that became a model of modern connectivity, they said.

The air hangs heavy and a hot afternoon sun beats down on the flood-ravaged neighbourhood littered with heavy boulders left by torrents.
Most of the village is in ruins, and mangled steel bars, broken roofs, and columns are peering out from under the rubble.
On Aug 15, flash floods tore through this hamlet, leaving a trail of destruction and trauma in their aftermath.

Still reeling from trauma of calamitous flooding, meagre compensation hampers Beshonai residents’ recovery

Still reeling from the shock, the villagers are even unsure about the number of their dead: everyone gives a figure. Some say it’s 84, while others believe 74 people died. However, many claim that several of their community members remain missing.
Besides physical destruction, the villagers also speak of mental scars inflicted by the deluge.
Jalal Ahmed, a student at the University of Buner, said they are paralysed by fear. “A large number of women from the area are still living with their relatives and refusing to come back, fearing more floods,” he added.
Hussain Shah, who lost his brother in the flood, told Dawn that when their local stream flooded on Aug 31, everyone in the village rushed to the nearby mountain in panic. “Women clutching their babies ran crying hysterically,” he says.
According to Dr Afsar Ali, a medical officer with the NGO Muslim Hands, at least 10pc of 200 patients examined by them suffer from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). “After counseling, we refer them to the district headquarters hospital for psychological rehabilitation,” Dr Ali told Dawn.
Dr Siraj Kamal agrees with his colleague, saying the situation will get worse once the shock wears off. “Now people are too busy with reconstruction, taking care of the injured and running after aid, and when all this is over, they will be hit harder by the depression and trauma,” Dr Kamal added.
But reconstruction also has its challenges. The villagers are particularly concerned about the compensation package offered by the government. Sahibullah, a resident, calls for their relocation to some other location, fearing the villager “could never rise from its ashes”.
Traders and shopkeepers aren’t happy as well, as they try to make repairs in the Pir Baba Bazaar, one of the busiest commercial centres in the district. A thick pall of dust follows every passing car, as traders install new shutters and shelves in their shops. Al Khidmat Foundation, the welfare arm of the Jamaat Islami, has painted the exterior of the damaged shop in its own blue colour.
Syed Wahid, president of Pir Baba Bazaar traders, estimates damages to the tune of Rs30 million, which the government’s aid package hardly addressed.
“Government is treating those who lost million and those who loses are in thousands with the same yardstick,” he complained. “How, those who have lost millions, are going to get their life on track with merely Rs500,000,” he questioned, while criticising the government for its unilateral approach.
“I am president of this bazaar where over 800 shops have been affected due to the floods and the authorities did not even bother to ask me for a meeting,” he rues. For Mr Wahid, interest-free loans by the government could help restart their businesses.
 
 

Khairullah Khan, a pharmacy shop owner, lost medicines worth Rs1.3 million besides damages to his shop. “Four shutters alone cost me Rs50,000 and I have to install shelves and do other repairs,” he told Dawn.
As the government response remains sluggish, Mufti Fazal Ghafoor the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl has made efforts to fill the vacuum.
A large number of locals were seen heading to a hujra at some distance from the Pir Baba Bazaar, where Mufti Ghafoor distributed sewing machines, photocopiers, and equipment for welders, electricians and carpenters besides other material.
The project, being executed through donations, also includes the construction of several two-room houses for orphans and widows as well as distribution of vans and rickshaws for those who have lost their means of livelihoods.
“We are working on construction of 40 houses and have laid foundation of 12 so far in various parts of the district,” Mufti Ghafoor told Dawn. He said that in some instances, they have also arranged land for construction of these houses. He said that they have also distributed walkie-talkies among locals of Beshonai for easy communication, as cellphone coverage was still patchy in the area.
Following the evening prayers, a large number of party’s activists gathered at a service station in the bazaar, which they had repurposed as a relief coordination centre, reporting about their activities.Mufti Ghafoor said that with the help of 5000 seminary students, they cleaned the Pir Baba Bazaar and residential areas in the surrounding neighbourhoods.
“There are many roads still not fully restored… I would have cleared them by now if I had the machinery,” Mufti Ghafoor added.

The 21-year-old Seville crossed the finish line in a 9.77 personal best ahead of Thompson in 9.82 and the USA’s reigning champion Noah Lyles, who won bronze with a season’s best 9.89.
“It was a good run because these two actually pushed me to run a personal best,” Seville, the youngest 100m champion, said at the post-race press conference. He became the third Jamaican sprinter to win this title.
“To come out here and run a 9.77 is something amazing, and in Japan is where I made my debut; to get a medal is something great for me.”
 






Jefferson-Wooden came in as the world lead and left Tokyo with a gold medal, proving her superiority to round off a season unbeaten. Tina Clayton continued Jamaica’s podium finish just minutes earlier when she blasted a 10.76 personal best while Olympic champion Julien Alfred took bronze with 10.84.
“This year has been nothing short of a dream. I’ve been working so hard for this moment to come out here and focus on my execution,” 24-year-old Jefferson-Wooden said. “To put on the perfect race at the perfect time, I’m just so happy and grateful.”
 






For Clayton, a medal wasn’t even a goal coming into her first senior championships.
“The goal was to execute,” Clayton told the press conference with a shyness poles apart from the confidence that won her a medal an hour earlier. “Silver was not in my thoughts, but God did so, and I’m grateful.”
The American women led the country’s gold medal rush as Olympic Champions Tara Davis-Woodhall and Valarie Allman were crowned world champions for the first time in the long jump and discus throw, respectively.
 






The men’s 10,000m also saw a rewriting of the script with two European medalists in a sport long dominated by the Ethiopians and Ugandan Joshua Cheptegi. France’s Jimmy Gressier eclipsed Ethiopia’s Yomif Keljecha in the last 10 metres to win gold, with Sweden’s Andreas Almgren taking bronze.
World championship silver medalist Jakob Ingebrigsten suffered a shock exit in the men’s 1500m heats due to an injury.
“I gave it my best today. It just wasn’t enough. I knew this could happen,” the 24-year-old Norwegian said in a post on Instagram soon after. “But giving up isn’t in my nature. I will be back.”
Much like his run at the Paris Olympics, Ingebrigsten could bounce back in the 5,000m — the heats scheduled on his 25th birthday — and win a third world title in the event.
 






Uruguay won their first medal of the competition and Julia Paternain didn’t even realise it when she crossed the finish line in third.
Earlier in the night in the women’s 100m semi-finals,there was a false start by reigning champion Sha’Carri Richardson. Veteran sprint queen Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce was a shock entrant into the final after a second place finish in her semis.
Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon cruised into the women’s 1500m final (4:00.34) ahead of countrywoman Dorcus Ewoi in 4:00.65. Ethiopia’s Freweyni Hailu fell in the first 100m of her semi-final but caught up to the pack in a flash and qualified for the final in 4:01.03.

• 48 Palestinians killed
• Netanyahu calls Rubio  ‘extraordinary friend’, says his visit shows strength of US-Israel ties
JERUSALEM: Israeli forces destroyed at least 30 more residential buildings in Gaza City and displaced thousands of residents, according to Palestinian officials, as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in the region on Sunday to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
At least 48 more Palestinians were killed since Sunday dawn as artillery shelling and gunfire by Israeli forces reported in Gaza City, as well as shelling from boats, according to Al Jazeera.
Israel has already announced its plan to seize the city, where more than a million Palestinians have been sheltering, and has intensified attacks on what it has called Hamas’ last bastion.
The Israeli army issued a new forced evacuation order for another building in Gaza City.
The military “will attack the building soon” due to the presence of Hamas infrastructure inside or adjacent to it, read a statement on X.
Israeli soldiers have been levelling one by one high-rise buildings in the northern city since starting a major offensive to occupy it.
Two more Palestinians died of malnutrition and starvation in Gaza in the past 24 hours, the territory’s health ministry said on Sunday, raising deaths from such causes to at least 422 people, including 145 children.
Israel blocked all food from entering Gaza for many months, before allowing some aid into the enclave despite the famine declared by the United Nations, which warned that far more was needed.
Thousands of people are estimated to have left Gaza City, but mostly the Palestinians are reluctant to leave, saying there is not enough space or safety in the south, where Israel had asked them to go after designating it as a ‘humanitarian zone’. People say that Israel has repeatedly hit so-called humanitarian zones.
In a post on X, UNRWA says Israel’s bombardment of Gaza City has been “constant” on Sunday, adding that there is “no safe place” in the besieged enclave.
Many Palestinians say they cannot afford to leave while others have pinned hopes on the Doha summit to pressure Israel to scrap its planned offensive.
 






14,000 buildings, shelters destroyed in a month
Hamas said that Israeli forces have destroyed at least 1,600 residential buildings and 13,000 tents since August 11.
In one of the latest strikes, Israeli forces stormed al-Khader Girls Elementary School in Jerusalem’s Old City and assaulted the mayor, Ahmad Salah, the head of the Parents Council, and a municipality member, Issam Naim, the Wafa news agency reports.
 
 

Mahmoud Abdullah, head of the Parents Council at al-Khader Unified Schools, said Israeli forces stormed the elementary school as students were leaving.
Abdullah added that soldiers beat him, Salah and Naim with rifle butts and their hands, causing bruises. He added that the troops threatened to “close all seven schools”.
The school complex has been repeatedly attacked by Israeli forces who target both female and male students.
At least 64,871 people have been killed and 164,610 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza while millions have been displaced since October 2023.

The countries agreed on the draft framework, which is part of the peace deal, a source familiar with the matter said, adding that the draft was now being discussed by stakeholders, including the private sector, multilateral banks, and some donor agencies of other countries.
Congo and Rwanda will likely meet in early October to finalise the framework, the source added. It would be signed by heads of state at a later date. The 17-page framework comes after the countries signed a peace deal in Washington in June at talks held by US President Donald Trump’s administration.
The deal aims to end fighting that has killed thousands and attract billions of dollars of Western investment to a region rich in tantalum, gold, cobalt, copper, and lithium. The draft builds on an outline for the framework reached in August and sets out implementation measures and coordination mechanisms.
The August outline called for cooperation on energy, infrastructure, mineral supply chains, national parks, and public health.
According to the draft, the parties would pledge to work with the United States and other international partners to develop additional regulatory initiatives and reforms “necessary to de-risk private sector investment in a cost-effective manner,” to reduce illicit trade and increase transparency.
They would also adopt outside transparency mechanisms, including committing to implement guidance from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, among others.
 
 

The draft framework calls for third-party inspections of mine sites and working with private sector partners to develop cross-border special economic zones, according to the draft.
The framework also sets out coordination mechanisms, including timelines for an annual high-level summit on regional economic integration and meetings of a steering committee and technical working groups.
Kinshasa and Kigali, as part of the deal reached in Washington in June, had agreed to launch the regional economic integration framework within 90 days.

The demand came after a recent report by the independent news outlet Drop Site News claimed that the Comm­on­wealth Observer Group (COG) group had “buried their report” after finding the Feb 8 general elections to be riddled with problems.
Although the group’s report on Pakistan has yet to be officially released, media outlets claimed to have obtained leaked copies of the report.
In a statement issued on Sunday, the COG said it was aware that a version of its report on the 2024 Pakistan general elections was circulating online, adding that they did not comment on leaked documents as a matter of policy.

C’wealth says report shared with govt, ECP; will be released this month

“The government and the Election Commission of Pakis­tan have already received the report. The full report, as we had communicated earlier,  will be released later this month, along with a number of COG reports currently in the publication pipeline,” the statement said.
The COG also maintained that its work is “carried out free from any interference”.
While announcing its preliminary findings on Feb 10, 2024, the COG had said that its findings and recommendations would be submitted to the Commonwealth secretary general, before being shared with the Pakistani government, and shared publicly.
 
 

The mission’s report has faced an inordinate delay, as most observation missions compile their findings and publish them within days or weeks of their compilation.
According to an excerpt from the leaked copy — whose authenticity could not be independently verified by Dawn — the report stated that: “Despite the fact that early vote counts indicated a landslide victory for candidates aligned with… the banned PTI… saw their polling leads rapidly reversed…”
In a statement issued on Sunday, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the leaked report validated PTI’s longstanding reservations about widespread pre- and post-poll rigging.
Zulfi Bukhari, a former aide to ex-PM Imran Khan, also raised questions about why the report was never released.
“Tomorrow, I will be consulting legal counsel to initiate proceedings aimed at securing disclosure, both of the report itself in full and of the decision-making processes that led to its suppression,” he wrote on X.

• Report warns green channel clearances shrinking scope of pre-clearance controls
ISLAMABAD: The Faceless Customs Assessment (FCA) system, inaugurated by the prime minister last year in Karachi to combat corruption, has incurred a revenue loss of about Rs100 billion in three months.
This was revealed in a detailed analysis by the Pakistan Customs Audit — an internal arrangement of the Federal Board of Revenue — spanning December 16, 2024 to March 15, 2025.
“The scrutiny of 13,140 goods declarations (GDs) led to detection of several discrepancies in 2,530 GDs that raise serious concerns about quality of assessments, indicating revenue and compliance risks,” said the 161-page report, which did not cover 100pc operations.
Of the reviewed GDs, the audit looked into 18pc cleared through the green channel, 76pc through the red channel, and 6pc through the yellow channel, highlighting weaknesses of the system, inefficiency of the human resource, under/overinvoicing, as well as widespread trade-based money laundering.
In some cases, importers of solar panels imported shipments in 2023 and brought containers for clearance more than a year later, prima facie having advance knowledge of the launch of the faceless system.
The audit found duty/tax evasion of Rs5 billion in 1,524 GDs, alongside loss of statutory fines worth Rs2.43bn, besides clearance of restricted goods valued at Rs10.54bn in 1,006 GDs, in violation of intellectual property conditions.
Another potential revenue loss of statutory fines worth Rs30.364bn was reported due to non-framing of contravention cases — based solely on GDs involving duty/tax evasions of Rs1 million or more.
The audit also highlighted fiscal fraud involving cancellation of asse­ssed or finalised GDs (involving duty/tax evasions) and fraudulent clearances of solar panel containers on unauthorised tax numbers “involving trade-based money laundering concerns”.
The analysis revealed that by applying the lowest statutory fine slab of 20pc, under SRO 499(I)/2009, the total fine worth Rs53.549bn sho­uld have been imposed and collected.
“In contrast, only Rs3.480bn was actually imposed/collected…in the 308 cases where contraventions were framed.” Even if cases involving higher duty/tax evasions (worth Rs1 million or above) were considered, the potential revenue loss would still amount to Rs30.364bn.
Transactional audits
The Directorate General of Pak­istan Customs said that due to human resource and time constraints, the directorate primarily relied on transactional audits rather than undertaking entity-based scrutiny, which is more comprehensive in identifying revenue-sensitive factors.
 
 

Moreover, the directorate restr­icted its audit scope to those red, yellow and green channel transactions/GDs that involved payment of duty and taxes.
The massive misuse of the system could be gauged from the fact that a Rs10 million worth of used Toyota Land Cruiser was cleared for a valuation of about Rs17,635, revealing an attempt to significantly misdeclare import values.
“The case reflects a serious risk of Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML). By declaring such a nominal purchase amount, the importer appears to have circumvented financial scrutiny, potentially paying the true cost through unofficial or illicit channels as declared value of vehicle had to be paid through remittances originating from foreign countries.”
In case of failure to substantiate that the actual value of the vehicle was paid through foreign country sources, it can raise concerns with regard to funds transferred through illicit channels involving hawala/hundi — a common hallmark of TBML schemes.
Discrepancies
The discrepancies included misclassification of HS Code, misdeclaration of value/non-application of valuation rulings (VRs), violations of SROs involving inadmissible concessions/exemptions, short payment of sales tax on retail price etc.
During the post-clearance audit of cancelled GDs, a fiscal fraud phenomenon was detected where assessed/finalised GDs were cancelled and refiled to evade duty/taxes. The modus operandi were such that GDs were filed by misdeclaring descriptions, HS codes, values, etc.
During examination/assessment when adverse findings were reported involving evasion of duty/taxes, instead of making payments, the importers requested the cancellation of GDs which was allowed. After a gap of a few days/weeks, the same importer again filed GD with same misdeclarations, but this time GDs were assessed at lower duty/taxes in favour of the importers. In this manner, the importers managed to evade duty/taxes while also avoiding fines.
The audit also found glaring examples of using vague descriptions, which eve­n­t­ually culminated in lower value asse­ssments. In such cases, at post-clearance stages, it becomes very difficult to detect misdeclaration beca­use primary lapse lies with the dep­artment/assessing officer who asse­ssed goods at a lower value, thus shi­fting the burden of proof to the department to prove any misdeclaration.
It said 54 solar panel containers belonging to five bogus importers were manifested in the year 2023, but fraudulently cleared through 28 GDs between Dec 2024 and Feb 2025, under different/unauthorised NTNs and Customs User IDs, reflecting exploitation of the FBR’s Registration Module and Customs Computerised System.
Even worse, some of these importers were previously arrested in similar cases and reported themselves as petty employees drawing Rs30,000 in salary. “This forms part of the broader solar panel money laundering scam—already a high-profile case—reflecting a serious systemic lapse”.
The audit highlighted that the increasing quantum of green channel clearances—now covering nearly 60pc of imports and 85pc of exports—is gradually shrinking the scope of pre-clearance controls.
Additionally, limiting visibility of GD particulars under the FCA undermined pre-clearance assessment quality. The audit observed that modern customs administrations operated on the principle of “front-end facilitation with back-end control”, maintaining an optimal balance between the two is critical.
“In Pakistan Customs’ case, front-end facilitation without proportionate back-end oversight has created a structural lag in the taxation framework, escalating both revenue and compliance risks,” the audit said, adding that the green channel had itself turned into a risk area.

RAWALPINDI / LAHORE: The Pakis­tan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has forecast rain, wind and thunderstorms across the upper parts of the country from Sept 15 to 19, warning of possible flash floods, landslides and damage to weak structures.
Authorities have been asked to remain vigilant and make necessary arrangements.
The Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) also issued an alert for the 11th spell of monsoon rains from Sept 16 to 19 in the catchment areas of all major rivers in the province.
According to the Met Office, moist currents of moderate intensity from the Arabian Sea are penetrating the northern regions, while a westerly wave is likely to approach from the evening of Sept 15, persisting until Sept 19.
Under these conditions, rain with thunderstorms is expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Char­sadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak and Waziristan between Sept 16 and 19, with occasional gaps.
In Kashmir, scattered showers are forecast from the night of Sept 15 to 19, with heavy falls likely on Sept 16 and 18. Similar conditions are expected in Gilgit-Baltistan, including in Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche and Shigar, between Sept 16 and 19.
In Punjab and Islamabad, rain and thunderstorms are predicted in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal and Jhelum from Sept 16 to 19, with showers likely in Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazirabad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikh­upura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Sahiwal, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh and Faisalabad on Sept 18 and 19. Isolated heavy falls are also expected.
Sindh and most of Balochistan will remain largely dry, with partly cloudy skies in coastal areas.
The PMD warned that windstorms, hailstorms and lightning could damage weak structures such as Katcha houses, billboards, electric poles, vehicles and solar panels.
It also cautioned of landslides in vulnerable hilly areas of KP, GB, Murree, Galiyat and Kashmir.
Heavy rainfall may trigger a rise in local nullahs and streams in Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbo­ttabad, Charsadda, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Murree, Galiyat, Islam­abad, Rawalpindi and Kashmir on Sept 18 and 19.
The department advised the public, travellers and tourists to avoid unnecessary exposure to vulnerable areas and stay updated on the latest weather advisories.
Flood threat in Sindh
With floodwaters moving downstream from Punjab, authorities in Sindh are on high alert as Guddu and Sukkur barrages brace for rising inflows. On Sunday, Guddu Barrage was passing a peak of 627,000 cusecs, with irrigation officials warning the figure could climb to between 650,000 and 700,000 cusecs in the coming days.
The Sindh Irrigation Department has identified vulnerable points on both banks of the Indus between Kashmore and Sukkur, particularly in the kutcha (riverine) areas of Ghotki, Shikarpur and Khairpur.
 
 

Officials say constant monitoring and reinforcement work is under way, though they remain cautiously optimistic that the flood peak will pass Sukkur without causing major damage.
Meanwhile, Sindh Senior Mini­ster Sharjeel Inam Memon has said so far over 163,000 people have been moved from riverine areas to safer location in view of the exp­ected flood.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, he said during the last 24 hours 5,269 people were evacuated from Katcha area.
He added that 252 people from riverine areas were shifted to relief camps, where a total of 469 people are currently staying.
Mr Memon said that 11,569 cattle were moved to safe areas during the last 24 hours, raising the total number of relocated cattle to 438,835.
He added that 51,308 cattle were provided with vaccines and treatment in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number treated to 1.2 million.
He said that the Sindh government has established 177 fixed and mobile health sites, where 6,596 patients were treated in the last 24 hours. So far, a total of 84,118 patients have received medical assistance, he added.
Motorway closure
Meanwhile, Motorway Police said that due to the possibility of damage to the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M-5) as a result of floodwater near Jalalpur Pirwala, it has been closed to traffic.
“Northbound traffic is being redirected from Uch Sharif, Jhangra and Jalalpur Interchange,” Mot­orway Police spokesman Syed Imran Ahmad said in a statement. “Southbound traffic is being diverted from Shah Shams, Sher Shah and Shujaabad South to alternative routes.”
Mr Ahmed added that NHA personnel are placing sandbags and stones to block floodwater.
In Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district, water was continuously flowing in its union council, Azmatpur, Mullanwali, Bazwala, Khangarh Doma, Sarki, Muradabad, Binda Ishaq, Mudwala, Lati Mari, Kundrala and Seetpur and submerged several villages.

Cotton zones hit
Moreover, for the first time in the country’s history, all major cotton zones in Pakistan have been affected by simultaneous rains and floods.
Though initial assessments suggest no significant damage to the crop nationwide, with the exception of severe losses in the Bahawalnagar district of Punjab, this week is critical for the country’s economy as a major flood surge from south Punjab enters Sindh, with continued rains in some Sindh districts set to determine the fate of cotton and other crops.
Ihsanul Haq, chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, said in a statement that Pakistan faces its biggest crisis due to Indian water aggression and unexpected rains. The full extent of crop damage, especially to cotton, will not be clear until the end of September.
He noted that the climate changes caused by the rains and floods have led to a minor virus attack on most cotton varieties in many cotton zones. He believes that a spray of urea fertiliser or boron could help mitigate this initial virus attack.
A high-level meeting on cotton rehabilitation, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, was held last week. It was attended by four federal ministers and various stakeholders.
While different proposals were reviewed, it’s widely believed that cotton rehabilitation will be difficult without enforcing crop zoning laws, which include a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones.
Sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones is a major concern. According to Mr Haq, it leads to environmental pollution that not only reduces the quantity of the cotton crop but also negatively impacts its quality. This is evident in regions like Balochistan and areas of Sindh and Punjab bordering Cholistan, where sugarcane is not grown.
The cotton produced in these areas sells for at least Rs500 per maund more than regular cotton because of its longer, stronger fibres and higher oil content in the seeds.
Last week, cotton trading in Pakistan was limited, and prices remained stable at Rs15,500 to Rs16,500 per maund.
Flooding continues
Meanwhile, catastrophic flooding continues to ravage south Punjab as broken dykes along the Sutlej and Ravi rivers have submerged hundreds of villages, disrupted major transport routes and displaced millions.
The PDMA and local administrations were managing evacuations and relief efforts amid rising water levels due to broken dykes and controlled breaches.
The evacuation operation continued in Khanewal, Kabirwala, Pir Mahal, Multan, Jalalpur, Jhangra, Uch and Alipur tehsil in Muz­affargarh district.
In Khanewal, several more villages were submerged after a canal dyke of Chak 58 was broken on Saturday night, while the government could not seal the Mai Sufuran dyke at the Ravi River near Head Sidhnai, and the water was inundating villages in Pir Mahal, Khanewal and Kabirwala.
In Multan’s Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil, the administration carried out a breach at Gillani Road to divert the flood from entering the city two days ago and it submerged several villages of Uch Sharif.
The controlled breach was also not filled after two days, and water continuously passed through it, causing a flood in the Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts.
Jalalpur city also lost its road connection with the Lodhran district after all the roads were submerged after the Noraja Bhutta dyke was broken three days ago. The Sutlej River water changed its direction and submerged several villages near Jalalpur Pirwala city and also reached the motorway exchange.
Relief operations
Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said that 4.57 million people of 4,700 mouzas were affected due to floods in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers in the province.
Sharing details about Pakistani and Indian dams, Mr Javaid said that Mangla Dam was 93 per cent full, Tarbela 100pc, while the Indian Bhakra Dam at the Sutlej River was 88pc full, Pong Dam 94pc and Thein Dam 88pc.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia on Sunday visited a relief camp in Seetpur union council of Alipur tehsil in Muzaffargarh district.
He told the media that evacuations were continued in flooded areas of Alipur, Jalalpur Pirwala and Rahim Yar Khan.
He predicted that the flood situation would ease significantly over the next two days, with only the Chenab at Panjnad Headworks currently in an extremely high flood at 411,000 cusecs. The Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was flowing at a medium flood level of 98,000 cusecs, while Head Sulemanki reported a low flood with a discharge of 78,000 cusecs.
Four children drown
Four children, including three siblings, drowned in a rainwater-filled pit in the suburban area of Killi Faiz Muhammad Charmai, Kohlu district, police said on Sunday.
According to police, the children were playing near the pit when they slipped in and were unable to get out. Despite efforts to rescue themselves, all four drowned.
Police and residents rushed to the site after the incident and retrieved the bodies, which were shifted to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Kohlu. All had died before reaching the hospital, officials confirmed.
The bodies were later handed over to the families after legal formalities. Residents said they had repeatedly warned the landowner to fill the deep pits, cautioning that they posed a danger to children. However, the owner allegedly continued excavating soil for sale, ignoring the warnings.

Cox said the accused gunman, Tyler Robinson, 22, will be formally charged on Tuesday. He remains in custody in Utah.
Investigators have yet to piece together why Robinson allegedly scaled a rooftop at Utah Valley University during an outdoor event and shot Kirk in the neck at long range on Wednesday.
Kirk, a staunch ally of United States President Donald Trump and co-founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA, was killed by a single rifle shot during the event attended by 3,000 people in Orem, about 65 kilometres south of Salt Lake City.
  @dawn.today US conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an influential ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah University, sparking a manhunt for a lone sniper who the governor said had carried out a political assassination. Authorities said they still had no suspect in custody as of Wednesday night, some eight hours after the midday shooting at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah, during an event attended by 3,000 people. The lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper’s nest on campus, remained “at large,” said Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, at a news conference four hours later. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com  
The killing ushered in newfound fears of a spike in political violence in the United States and an ever-deepening divide between the left and the right.
Robinson has not confessed to investigators, Cox told the ABC programme ‘This Week’.
“He is not cooperating, but all the people around him were cooperating, and I think that’s very important,” the Republican governor said.
 


One person who is apparently talking to investigators is Robinson’s roommate, who was also a romantic partner, Cox said, citing the FBI. Cox described the roommate as “a male transitioning to female,” and said the roommate has been “incredibly cooperative”.
Reuters has not been able to locate the roommate or representatives for the roommate to seek comment. Reuters could not determine who is serving as Robinson’s legal representative.
Asked on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ programme whether the roommate’s gender identity is relevant to the investigation, Cox said, “That’s what we’re trying to figure out right now. It’s easy to draw conclusions from that, and so we’ve got the shell casings, other forensic evidence that is coming in — and trying to piece all of those things together.”
 


Investigators found messages engraved into four bullet casings, which included references to memes and video game in-jokes. An affidavit filed by authorities in the case described these messages.
One of the inscriptions, according to the affidavit, read: “Hey fascist! Catch!” followed by a combination of directional arrows, an apparent reference to a sequence of button presses that unleashes a bomb in popular video game Helldivers II.
Kirk’s charged rhetoric, which often involved anti-LGBT and anti-immigrant comments, attracted legions of conservatives, but also engendered strong feelings from liberals and drew widespread criticism.
Robinson, a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College, part of Utah’s public university system, was taken into custody at his parents’ house, about 260 miles (420 km) southwest of the crime scene, after a 33-hour manhunt.
Investigators search for motive
Relatives and a family friend alerted authorities that he had implicated himself in the crime, Cox said previously.
While Robinson was raised by religious parents in a deeply conservative region of the state, “his ideology was very different than his family,” Cox said on Sunday on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ programme, without going into specifics.
 


State records show Robinson was a registered voter but not affiliated with any political party. A relative told investigators that Robinson had grown more political in recent years and had once discussed with another family member their dislike for Kirk and his viewpoints, according to the arrest warrant affidavit.
Robinson was “not a fan” of Kirk’s, Cox said on Sunday.
 
 

The killing has stirred outrage among Kirk’s supporters and condemnation of political violence from some across the ideological spectrum.
Many Republicans, including Trump, have been quick to lash out at the political left, accusing liberals of fomenting anti-conservative vitriol that would encourage a kindred spirit to cross the line into violence — even as the president and his allies have often invoked violent imagery against their opponents.
Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, urged calm on Sunday.
“We’ve got to turn the rhetoric down,” Johnson said on the ‘Fox News Sunday’ programme.
 


In conversations he has had with Republican and Democratic House members since Kirk’s killing, Johnson said, “There’s this recognition that people have got to stop framing simple policy disagreements in terms of existential threats to our democracy.” But Johnson also criticised Democrats.
“You can’t call the other side fascists and enemies of the state and not understand that there are some deranged people in our society who will take that as cues to act and do crazy and dangerous things. And that’s what we’ve seen in increasing frequency,” Johnson said.
On ‘Meet the Press,’ Cox assigned some blame to social media, saying it has “played a direct role in every single assassination and assassination attempt that we have seen over the last five, six years.”
Trump has credited Kirk with driving young voters to conservatism. His Turning Point movement says it has more than 800 chapters across college campuses. Kirk’s widow on Friday said the movement’s efforts would go forward.
A memorial event for Kirk will be held on September 21 in Glendale, Arizona, his organisation said.</p><small>2025-09-14 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14201838df4d901.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941937/israel-has-become-persistent-irritant-and-danger-to-world-peace-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Israel has become ‘persistent irritant’ and danger to world peace: Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday called for urgent steps against Israel to “safeguard the global order”, in the wake of Tel Aviv’s strike on Qatar earlier this week.
Israel targeted Hamas leaders on Tuesday in strikes on the Qatari capital, killing five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack drew widespread international condemnation, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, Israel’s main backer.
Attending a ministerial meeting in the Qatari capital, Dar delivered a speech where he highlighted that the frequency of meetings to discuss Israel’s activities in the region underlines “how Israel has become a persistent irritant and a danger to world peace and security”, according to the Foreign Office (FO).

“Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the illegal and unprovoked Israeli aggression against the brotherly State of Qatar,” Dar was quoted as saying.
“This reckless and provocative attack constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar, contrary to the fundamental principles of international law, including the UN Charter, in particular its Article 2(4) prohibiting the threat or use of force.”
Calling the attack “unwarranted, unjustified and appalling”, the foreign minister highlighted that this activity is emblematic of Israel’s rogue mindset, which disregards international law and norms.
“No state is safe from such an unhinged entity that defies all precepts of civilised behaviour, Dar stated. “The question of Israeli accountability is a test for the credibility of the global system.”
The foreign minister highlighted urgent steps that need to be taken “to safeguard the global order”:


Israel must be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should not be allowed to get away with attacking Islamic countries and killing people with impunity.


Creation of an Arab-Islamic task force to monitor the Israeli designs in the region and adopt effective deterrent and offensive measures in a synchronised manner to ward off Israeli expansionist designs.


Pursue the suspension of Israel’s membership in the United Nations. Following up on this step would be a clear message on seriousness by the Ummah.


Member states should actively consider implementing additional punitive measures against Israel, as a means to reinforce accountability and deter further violations of international law.


The UN Security Council must urgently demand [from] Israel, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter … an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire, release of hostages and exchange of Palestinian prisoners.


Unfettered, sustained and secure humanitarian access to all civilians in need, and the protection of aid workers, medical teams and UN personnel in the [Occupied Palestinian Territories].


The revival of a genuine and time-bound political process to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting two-state solution in accordance with international law and relevant UN and OIC resolutions.


 






Monday’s summit in Doha is expected to rally support for Qatar in the wake of last week’s Israeli attack targeting Hamas in the Gulf state.
A draft of the resolution that will be considered by heads of state condemned Israel’s attack as a destabilising escalation and said the states opposed Israel’s “plans to impose a new reality in the region”.
The draft, which was seen by Reuters, did not mention any diplomatic or economic moves against Israel. The resolution may change before the leaders meet in Doha on Monday.
The attack has prompted US-allied Gulf Arab states to close ranks, adding to strains in ties between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel, which normalised relations in 2020.
The emergency summit, bringing together members of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), began with a meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday to craft the draft resolution.
 






The gathering is a message that “Qatar is not alone … and that Arab and Islamic states stand by it,” Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit told the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.
Dar will “lead Pakistan’s delegation to the ministerial meeting ahead of the Emergency Arab-Islamic Summit”, a statement by the FO said.
Upon arrival, the deputy PM was received by Pakistan’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Aamer, Pakistan’s envoy to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and senior officials of the Qatari government.
 






The Arab-Islamic summit — held under the umbrella of the 57-member OIC — is expected to draw heads of state and governments, along with senior officials, from across the Muslim world. PM Shehbaz Sharif is also set to attend the high-level moot.
“The summit, cosponsored by Pakistan, has been convened in the wake of Israel’s airstrikes on Doha and the escalating developments in Palestine — following Israeli attempts to occupy Gaza, expand settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and forcibly displace the Palestinians,“ an FO statement said yesterday.
 
 

Diplomats said more than 50 OIC member states are expected to attend the Doha summit, where leaders may also weigh in on pushing Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York.
On the sidelines of the preparatory foreign ministers’ meeting, Dar today met with Egypt’s FM Dr Badr Abdelatty.
“They condemned illegal Israeli strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations, terming them blatant violations of sovereignty and international law. Both reaffirmed their unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and stressed the urgent need for unity across the Muslim ummah,” FO said in a statement.
 






Dar aslo with his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, on the sidelines of the meeting.
According to the FO, they strongly condemned Israel’s unprovoked strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations, terming them grave violations of sovereignty, international law, and the UN Charter.
“Both (leaders) underscored the pivotal role of the Arab League and the OIC in uniting the Muslim Ummah at this critical juncture and reaffirmed their unwavering support for the Palestinian people’s just struggle for freedom and self-determination,” the FO statement read.
 






Dar further met with with Malaysia’s Foreign Minister Dato’ Seri Mohamad Hasan on the sidelines of the meeting.
“They strongly condemned Israeli strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations as gross violations of sovereignty and international law,” the FO said.
“They reaffirmed unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and emphasized the vital importance of unity across the Muslim Ummah. They welcomed the Arab Islamic Summit as timely and essential for collective action at this critical juncture.”
 






‘Matter of grave concern’
Analysts say tomorrow’s Arab-Islamic summit is meant to send Israel a clear signal. Pakistan has been vocal in its criticism of Israel, especially taking the centre stage at a recent United Nations Security Council meeting, where it engaged in a heated debate with Israel.
“Repeated Israeli attacks against sovereign states in the region are a matter of grave concern, not only for the Muslim ummah but also for the wider international community,” FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told reporters on Friday.
Following the attack, PM Shehbaz undertook a one-day visit to Doha, where he met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to denounce the Israeli action and show solidarity with the Gulf state.
 
 

Qatar plays a mediation role in Israel’s recent war on Gaza alongside the US and Egypt. It hosts the largest US base in the region, and also recently gave US President Donald Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet to use as his presidential plane.
For the first time in recent memory, the US joined all 15 UNSC members in condemning the Israeli strike during Thursday’s emergency meeting. The US has historically shielded Israel from statements of condemnation by not endorsing them, but on Thursday, it opted not to veto the joint statement.
Despite ongoing tensions, Trump on Friday held a dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York.
The US president has said he was “very unhappy” about the Israeli attack on Qatar. However, earlier today, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.</p><small>2025-09-14 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/142030390f5c56a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941952/karachi-police-warn-citizens-against-aerial-firing-amid-pak-india-asia-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police warn citizens against aerial firing amid Pak-India Asia Cup clash</strong></a><br><p>As excitement builds for Sunday’s highly anticipated Pakistan-India Asia Cup cricket match, law enforcement authorities in Karachi have issued a strong warning against celebratory aerial firing, citing concerns over public safety and law and order.
Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Javed Alam Odho has directed all senior police officers across the city to implement strict measures to prevent such incidents. In a statement released by his office today, the AIG emphasised that aerial firing will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
“Those found involved in this illegal act will be arrested immediately, face legal proceedings, and be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” the police official added.
The Karachi police have appealed to citizens to celebrate responsibly and avoid any form of celebratory gunfire. Authorities warned that aerial firing is not only a criminal offence under the law but can also lead to tragic loss of life and injury.
Citizens have been urged to report any instances of aerial firing by immediately calling the police helpline at 15.
“The cooperation of the public is essential to maintaining peace and order in the city,” said a police spokesperson.
An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster, but emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who engaged in a four-day military conflict earlier this year.
Even before the clashes in May, which nearly escalated into a full-blown war, bilateral cricket ties had been suspended. The arch-rivals now play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
Political relations have deteriorated further since the clashes, with several former Indian players urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities.</p><small>2025-09-14 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623680-pak-vs-ind-asia-cup-match-karachi-police-issue-stern-warning' target='_blank'><strong>Pak vs Ind Asia Cup match: Karachi police issue stern warning</strong></a><br><p>

Zardari, who is on a 10-day trip to China, asserted this during a visit to the  the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — the country’s aerospace and defence conglomerate engaged in the design and production of a wide range of military and civilian aircraft,  including J-10C fighter jets that Pakistan employed during an escalation with India in May.
The use of these aircraft is said to have played a crucial role in shooting down India’s fighter jets, including Rafales, during the four-day escalation that ended with a ceasefire on May 10.
The statement by the President’s Secretariat today said: “On the 128th day since the ceasefire with India, President Asif Ali Zardari, constitutionally the supreme commander of the armed forces of Pakistan, visited the Aviation Industry Corporation of China”.

According to the statement, the president toured the sprawling complex in its entirety and met the AVIC’s engineers and scientists, “listening to their insights on innovation, production and future technologies”.
He was briefed on the AVIC’s “advanced capabilities, including the J-10 fighter jet, the co-production of the JF-17 Thunder with Pakistan, as well as progress in the J-20 stealth 5th-generation fighter aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, fully automated units, and integrated command-and-control systems for modern multi-domain operations”.
The statement quoted the president as saying that “J-10 and JF-17 have greatly strengthened the Pakistan Air Force, a fact clearly demonstrated during May 2025’s Maraka-e-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.
