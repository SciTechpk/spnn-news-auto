Specul­ation and debate over a possible 27th Constitutional Amend­ment reached fever pitch on Monday after the PPP claimed the government had sought its support for the proposed changes to the Constitution.
 
 

The proposed changes have sparked a nationwide debate, with political parties weighing their positions amid concerns that the move could roll back some powers devolved under the landmark 18th Constitution Amendment. The opposition PTI has announced its intention to oppose the proposed amendment ‘tooth and nail’.
Addressing the matter while speaking in the Senate session today, the deputy PM said: “Of course the government is bringing it and will bring it … the 27th Amendment will arrive … and is about to arrive. We will try that it be tabled in accordance with principles, laws and the Constititution.”
He reassured the opposition that the amendment would pass through the required steps such as a robust debate in Parliament and sub-committees.
“The government does not have reservations on anything. It is not the case that the amendment is tabled and there is voting on it in a haphazard, ad hoc manner; this will not happen,” he reassured PTI Senator Barrister Ali Zafar.
Dar said the government was following the “standard process” of legislative activity, saying it was consulting the PPP for now since it was the biggest ally of the government. “I have had at least three rounds [of consultations] and the law minister has also held,” he added.
The deputy PM said the government would also approach its other allies and take them on board before presenting the document of the amendment.
Referring to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s X post announcing that the government had approached his party over the issue, Dar said he had a complete right to do so.
“The areas he identified are not in the air. Let me also confess this thing, there have been talks on those topics.”
Two-thirds majority
A constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in both houses. In the 336-member National Assembly, the ruling coalition has 233 members, while the opposition holds 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, PPP 74, MQM 22, PML-Q five, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party four, and PML-Z, Balochistan Awami Party, and National Peoples Party one seat each.
In the Senate, which comprises 96 members, the ruling coalition does not enjoy the two-thirds majority of 64 senators required to pass a constitutional amendment. With 61 senators, the coalition would need at least three votes from the opposition to ensure its passage. In such situations, the government usually turns to the JUI-F to seek its support.

Haris and Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in September for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four match against arch-rivals India, ESPNCricinfo reported.
“Rauf was seen responding to heckling from Indian fans by signalling 6-0 with his hands and making gestures depicting the downing of aircraft, in apparent reference to the military conflict between India and Pakistan in May this year,” the report read. “Farhan had celebrated his fifty by mimicking a gunshot.”
In a press release today, ICC confirmed the outcomes of several Code of Conduct proceedings arising duirng the Asia Cup.
“The hearings were conducted by members of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees following incidents in the matches between India and Pakistan on September 14, 21 and 28,” the press release said.
During the Sept 14 India v Pakistan match, India’s Suryakumar Yadav “was found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which relates to conduct that brings the game into disrepute”. He was fined 30 per cent of his match fee and received two demerit points.
The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its Sept 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”.
Sahibzada was found guilty of the same offence and was issued an official warning, receiving one demerit point. Haris was also found guilty of the same offence and fined 30pc of his match fee, resulting in two demerit points.
The hearing  was conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson.
During the Sept 21 encounter between the neighbouring countries, India’s
Arshdeep Singh was found not guilty of an alleged breach of Article 2.6, “which pertains to using a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting, and therefore no sanction was imposed.”
The hearing was conducted by ICC Match Referee Andy Pycroft.
During the Asia Cup final on Sept 28, Jasprit Bumrah (India) accepted a charge under Article 2.21 for conduct that brings the game into disrepute and the proposed sanction of an official warning, which resulted in one demerit point, ICC said.
“As he accepted the sanction, no formal hearing was required.”
The ICC said that following a hearing conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson, Haris was again found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21. He was fined 30pc of his match fee and received two additional demerit points.
“This takes Rauf’s total to four demerit points within a 24-month period, resulting in two suspension points under the ICC’s disciplinary framework.
“In accordance with the Code, Rauf is therefore suspended for Pakistan’s ODI games against South Africa on Nov 4 and 6 2025,” ICC said.</p><small>2025-11-04 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/041658265c0b58d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953116/dick-cheney-former-us-vice-president-who-pushed-for-iraq-war-dies-at-84' target='_blank'><strong>Dick Cheney, former US vice president who pushed for Iraq war, dies at 84</strong></a><br><p>Dick Cheney, a driving force behind the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, who was considered by presidential historians as one of the most powerful vice presidents in US history, has died at age 84, his family said in a statement on Tuesday.
Cheney died on Monday night from complications of pneumonia and cardiac and vascular disease, his family said.
The Republican — a former Wyoming congressman and secretary of defence — was already a major Washington player when then-Texas governor George W Bush chose him to be his running mate in the 2000 presidential race that Bush went on to win.
As vice president from 2001 to 2009, Cheney fought vigorously for an expansion of the power of the presidency, having felt that it had been eroding since the Watergate scandal that drove his one-time boss Richard Nixon from office.
He also expanded the clout of the vice president’s office by putting together a national security team that often served as a power centre of its own within the administration.
Cheney was a strong advocate for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was among the most outspoken of Bush administration officials warning of the danger from Iraq’s alleged stockpile of weapons of mass destruction.
No such weapons were found.
 
 

He clashed with several top Bush aides, including Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice, and defended “enhanced” interrogation techniques of terrorism suspects that included waterboarding and sleep deprivation.
Others, including the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the UN special rapporteur on counter terrorism and human rights, called these techniques “torture”.
His daughter Liz Cheney also became an influential Republican lawmaker, serving in the House of Representatives but losing her seat after opposing Republican President Donald Trump and voting to impeach him in the wake of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his supporters.
Her father agreed with her and said he would vote for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in 2024.
“In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” said the man who had long been a foe of the left.
Cheney was troubled much of his life by heart problems, suffering the first of a number of heart attacks at age 37. He had a heart transplant in 2012.
Saying that Cheney had a “great run”, the former defence secretary wrote: “Vice President Cheney was a man of unparalleled patriotism and remarkable courage. He never paled before tough decisions, never flinched from responsibility, and always took the necessary action to keep our country safe.”
Taking on Iraq
Cheney and then-defence secretary Rumsfeld, who had been colleagues in the Nixon White House, were key voices pushing for the March 2003 invasion of Iraq.
In the run-up to the war, Cheney suggested there might be links between Iraq and Al Qaeda and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. A commission on the 9/11 attacks later discredited this theory.
Cheney predicted US forces would be “greeted as liberators” in Iraq and that the troop deployment — which would last around a decade — would “go relatively quickly … weeks rather than months”.
Although no weapons of mass destruction were found, Cheney in later years insisted that the invasion was the right decision based on the intelligence at the time and the removal of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power.

More than a decade earlier, as defence secretary under President George HW Bush, Cheney had directed the US military operation to expel an Iraqi occupation army from Kuwait in the first Gulf War.
He urged Bush senior to take an uncompromising line against Iraq after Saddam Hussein sent his troops to occupy Kuwait in August 1990. But at that point, Cheney did not support an invasion of Iraq, saying the United States would have to act alone and that the situation would become a quagmire.
Because of Cheney’s long ties to the Bush family and experience in government, George W Bush chose him to head his vice presidential search in 2000. Bush then decided the man doing the search was the best candidate for the job.
Upon his re-entry into politics, Cheney received a $35 million retirement package from oil services firm Halliburton, which he had run from 1995 to 2000.
Halliburton became a leading government contractor during the Iraq War. Cheney’s oil industry links were a subject of frequent criticism by opponents of the war.
The first Republican in generations
Richard Bruce Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, to Marjorie Lorraine and Richard Herbert Cheney on January 30, 1941, the day then-president Franklin Roosevelt turned 59. His mother was a waitress turned softball player, his father a federal worker with the Soil Conservation Service.
Both sides of the family were staunch New Deal Democrats, he wrote in his 2011 book In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir. Convinced that the president would want to know that he shared a birthday with the newborn, Cheney’s grandfather urged Marjorie and Richard to share the news by telegram with the White House.
In his family, he “was the first Republican probably since my great-grandfather who fought in the Civil War on the Union side,” he told the PBS documentary Dick Cheney: A Heartbeat Away. He moved as a boy to Wyoming with his family before attending Yale University. “I was a mediocre student, at best,” he said. He dropped out.
‘A deadly allergy to olive drab’
Back in Wyoming in 1962, he worked on building electrical transmission lines and coal-fired power stations, before eventually earning undergraduate and master’s degrees in political science from the University of Wyoming.
Of that time, he recalled a visit by then-US president John F Kennedy, who addressed students on the importance of using what they were learning to build a better nation and a better world.
“He had inspired us all, and at a time when I was trying to put my life back together, I was particularly grateful for the sense of elevated possibilities he described,” Cheney wrote in his memoir.

In his 20s, Cheney strongly disagreed with the students who shut down campuses in protest against the Vietnam War, he recalled in his memoir.
“As a general proposition, I supported our troops in Vietnam and the right of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations to make the decision to be involved there,” he wrote.
He himself was never drafted.
According to his biographer, John Nichols, Cheney repeatedly applied for deferments and exemptions to avoid conscription.
“Cheney reacted to the prospect of wearing his country’s uniform like a man with a deadly allergy to olive drab,” Nichols wrote in The Nation magazine in 2011. Cheney stated that he would have been happy to serve.
Embracing Darth Vader
Cheney went to Washington in 1969 as a congressional intern and held various White House jobs during the Republican administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.
One of his earliest mentors was Rumsfeld, who worked as the secretary of defence in both the Ford and George W Bush administrations. When Cheney became Ford’s chief of staff, he succeeded Rumsfeld.
During the 10 years he served as Wyoming’s only congressman, Cheney had a highly conservative record, consistently voting against abortion rights. He also voted against the release of imprisoned South African leader Nelson Mandela and against gun control and environmental and education funding measures.
His wife, Lynne, who had been his high school sweetheart, became a conservative voice on cultural issues. Liz, the couple’s eldest daughter, was elected to the House in 2016 after building a reputation for pushing hawkish foreign policy views similar to her father’s.
During his time as vice president, late-night television comedians referred to Cheney as Darth Vader. He shrugged it off by joking that he was honoured to be compared to the Star Wars villain, even dressing as Vader for an appearance on ‘The Tonight Show’ to promote his memoir.
‘Thank you to satan’
Even before the rise of Trump, his support for conservative issues was not uniform.
His second daughter, Mary, a Republican fundraiser, is a lesbian. Cheney spoke supportively of same-sex relationships, which put him at odds with the Bush administration’s push for a constitutional amendment against gay marriage. That amendment ultimately failed.
In 2006, he made headlines during a hunting trip in Texas when he accidentally wounded his friend, Texas lawyer Harry Wittington, in the face with a spray of birdshot.
Controversy continued to dog Cheney even after he left the Bush administration. He was the subject of a scathing biographical film in 2018 titled Vice, starring Christian Bale, who gained 18 kilogrammes and shaved his head to mimic the former vice president’s paunchiness and baldness.
“Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration on how to play this role,” Bale said in accepting a Golden Globes award for his Cheney portrayal.
During a book tour for his memoir, Cheney seemed to relish raising the ire of critics. Just before its release, he gleefully predicted it would leave heads “exploding” all over Washington.
He devoted parts of the book to settling scores with former colleagues such as Rice, whom he depicted as naive. Cheney also took aim at then-president Barack Obama’s worldview, puzzling over the Democrat’s concern that the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba was harmful to America’s image.</p><small>2025-11-04 14:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04181443ec76d62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953105/pia-operations-restored-after-engineers-strike-causes-delays-to-several-international-flights' target='_blank'><strong>PIA operations ‘restored’ after engineers’ strike causes delays to several international flights</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Tuesday said it has restored flight operations with some alternate arrangements after delays due to what it called a “strike” by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP).
However, the SAEP stated there was no strike from their side and the engineers were only adhering to mandatory safety and certification protocols.
PIA’s flight operations were disrupted across the country last night after the engineers’ group refused to issue clearances to aircraft, claiming that they could not compromise on travel safety.
The PIA said in a statement today: “A de-recognised entity, SAEP, in order to pressurise the management, tried to halt the operations during late hours of yesterday (Monday) night with their nefarious design to sabotage the privatisation process.“
It asserted that the PIA’s management team, along with key officials of the engineering department, immediately responded to the situation.
“By using alternative means and working tirelessly overnight and day, [the airline] restored the operations, thus mitigating the impact of already delayed flights for subsequent operations,” the statement added.
 






The airline assured the public that “flight operations are being fully restored and customer convenience is our utmost priority and that our operations run smoothly”.
According to the PIA, a total of seven flights — three from Islamabad, two from Karachi, and one each from Lahore and Sialkot — departed after delays ranging from four to 14 hours.
Five flights were cancelled by readjusting the load, and alternates were offered to the passengers.
 
 

A protest had been ongoing for the last two-and-a-half months, with the engineers fastening black ribbons around their arms while working.
However, the situation escalated when the SAEP members discontinued issuing clearance to airplanes, disrupting the flight operations and leaving hundreds of passengers stranded at the Islamabad, Lahore and Kara­chi airports.
SAEP president Abdullah Jadoon told Dawn that more than 570 aircraft engineers associated with the PIA were on strike and vowed to continue it until their demands were fulfilled.
Earlier today, a senior SAEP member had denied that the society was staging a strike. They insisted that the engineers were only adhering to mandatory safety and certification protocols as per their responsibilities.
“Unfortunately, instead of addressing long-pending professional and financial concerns, the PIA management has chosen to label lawful compliance as disruption, which is misleading,” the SAEP member said.
A spokesperson for the PIA had said the SAEP had no legal status and alleged that the main aim of this movement was to sabotage PIA’s privatisation, which was in its final stages.
Similar delays have occurred at nearly all major airports in the last two months due to engineers’ protests seeking a pay hike and other issues.
Flights impacted
According to the details provided by the PIA, flights that departed after the adjustment of revised slots/crew arrangement included the following:

Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Muhammad Moeenuddin Riaz, Hafiz Farhat Abbas and Ali Imtiaz filed the petition against the legislation that was bulldozed through the assembly last month amid the opposition’s protest. The Punjab government has been named as a respondent in the plea, and Justice Sultan Tanvir will hear this petition, according to lawyer Abuzar Salman Niazi.
The petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, says that Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act are “unconstitutional, unreasonable [and] illegitimate”. These provisions “brazenly and patently contravene” Articles 8 (laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights
to be void), 9 (security of person), 17 (freedom of association), 32 (promotion of local government institutions) and 140-A (local government) of the Constitution, the petition further states.
The petitioners contend that “a careful reading of the PLGA, 2025, makes it crystal clear that the same is a restrictive law aimed at curtailing and limiting the powers of elected representatives of the local governments”.
“Furthermore, it also undermines the genuine political process as it limits political choices of the voters. It mandates elections on non-party basis, which [is] tantamount to violating the most basic political freedoms enunciated in the Constitution,” the petition reads.
It says, “This newly elected law, which effectively introduced the systematic elimination of political choice, threatens the ideals of democracy, freedom, equality, tolerance and social justice as enunciated by Islam”.
Moreover, the law also “violates the freedom of association and the right to life and dignity”, the petition says, adding, “Such a legal arrangement disenfranchises the people by censoring the spectrum of their choice. This will lead people to feel alienated and marginalised.”
The petitioners have moved the court to declare Sections 15, 32, 25, 40, 55, 56 and 57 of the Act “ultra vires to the Constitution in terms of Article 8 […], being inconsistent with and in derogation of fundamental rights provided under Article 9 and 17 and also in direct conflict with Article 140-A of the Constitution”.
The petitioners have also requested the court to suspend the operation of the above-mentioned sections of the PLGA, 2025, during the pendency of the plea.
Legislation and election
The legislation was bulldozed through the Punjab Assembly on October 13, following the Election Commission of Pakistan’s strong intervention and announcement that much-delayed local government elections in the province would be held under the PLGA 2022 in the last week of December.
The ECP had rejected all excuses of the Punjab government in finalising and enacting the new PLGA and launched its delimitation process in the province from October 9.
The ECP order, however, was reversed on Oct 21 in light of the new legislation after a request by the Punjab government, which was given more time to finalise the delimitation and demarcation rules. Later, the ECP said local government elections in Punjab would not be possible before the second quarter of next year, as it would not have all the prerequisites to hold the electoral exercise during the current year.
PTI’s objections
The treasury had steamrolled the PLGA bill through the Punjab Assembly amid strong protests and disruptions by the opposition.
Subsequently, the PTI announced on November 2 that the legislation would be challenged in the LHC.
PTI leaders have expressed strong reservations about the non-party-based, one-vote, multi-member union council model, saying that the non-party system would weaken the role of political parties and place administrative officers in control rather than elected local representatives, undermining local government powers.
They say the centralisation of financial powers goes against the spirit of local autonomy, while the authority to appoint administrators for an indefinite period is unconstitutional.
They have demanded the restoration of direct elections for union council chairmen, the establishment of a fixed five-year tenure and a clear election schedule for local governments and strict restrictions on executive interference and administrators’ powers.</p><small>2025-11-04 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04185057d7734dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953107/naseem-saim-and-abrar-shine-as-pakistan-bowl-out-south-africa-for-263-in-first-odi' target='_blank'><strong>Naseem, Saim and Abrar shine as Pakistan bowl out South Africa for 263 in first ODI</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan rode on inspired spells of bowling by Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub and Abrar Ahmed to bowl out South Africa for 263 in the first One-day International at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad on Tuesday.
In the first international match at the venue in 17 years, South Africa had got off to the ideal start with half-centuries for debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius (57) and the returning Quinton de Kock (63) after they had been put into bat by Pakistan skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi.
But with the exception of skipper Matthew Breetzke (42) and Corbin Bosch (41) in the end, none of their batters could get going as Naseem (3-40), Saim (2-39) and Abrar (3-53) scythed through their line-up after the visitors had bossed the opening period of the game.
In front of an expectant crowd, Pretorius had given a signal of his intent in the second over when he drove and then punched Naseem for two boundaries. De Kock then clipped Shaheen, leading the side for the first time in a 50-over match, for four in the following over before Pretorius got two more boundaries off Naseem in the sixth.
The South African openers then laid into the spinners. De Kock danced down the track and hit a six off Abrar in the ninth before Pretorius treated himself to a four and six off Salman Ali Agha and then raised his half century off 48 balls midway through the 11th over.
De Kock then evaded the mid-wicket fielder to find a boundary in the 12th, with Salman having bled 30 runs in his first three overs. Abrar too wasn’t finding much joy, De Kock flicking him for a six in the next over and South Africa were coasting, reaching 94-0 by the end of the 15th.
Pakistan needed a breakthrough and it was provided by Saim as Pretorius’ slash found a diving Mohammad Nawaz; the left-hander departing after having hit seven fours and a six in his 60-ball stay.
The incoming Tony de Zorzi made a tentative start but then found the stadium’s roof off Nawaz for his first boundary in the 19th over.
At the other end, De Kock was proving a thorn for the hosts, dispatching anything loose to the fence and raised his half century with his fifth four — a sweep off Saim — in exactly 50 balls.
Shaheen brought back Naseem into the attack and after just three runs came off overs 23 and 24, the pacer struck when De Kock chopped him onto his stumps. The veteran, coming back to the ODI fold having retired after the 2023 World Cup, hit six fours and two sixes in his 72-ball knock.
Pakistan got a foothold they wanted and De Zorzi (18) departed in the next over, offering Saim a tame return, having pulled the previous delivery for four.
Breetzke and debutant Sinethemba Qeshile began the rebuilding job and after the run scoring had slowed down, the latter got it back up with three boundaries across two Shaheen overs.
Breetzke had been the slower of the two but got going against Abrar in the 33rd, a six over long on followed by a four. But just when the Proteas seemed to be gaining momentum, Nawaz struck to remove Qeshile (22).
Breetzke, though, was making hay against Abrar, pulling him for another six. But he was running out of partners as Donovan Ferreira was undone by the spinner.
Naseem cleaned up Breetzke off a no-ball but bounced back after that disappointment by getting George Linde caught behind two balls later.
The momentum was with Pakistan as South Africa reached the 40-over mark at 211-6. The visitors were eyeing a closing flourish, with Breetzke and Corbin Bosch helping themselves to boundaries in the 42nd over by Nawaz.
But Pakistan hit back again when Abrar ended Breetzke’s stay and then had Bjorn Fortuin lbw on the next ball. He almost had a hat-trick, only for the DRS to overturn Lungi Ngidi’s lbw.
Bosch, however, got stuck in and took South Africa past 250 — muscling away Shaheen for consecutive boundaries in the 45th over and repeating the trick in the next over by Abrar — before seeing his stumps dismantled by a searing yorker by Shaheen in the penultimate over. 
Naseem picked up his third wicket in the last over when he cleaned up tailender Lizaad Williams</p><small>2025-11-04 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04173125e307a5b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953119/tlp-leadership-cadre-from-central-punjab-lahore-severs-ties-with-banned-party' target='_blank'><strong>TLP leadership cadre from central Punjab, Lahore severs ties with banned party</strong></a><br><p>Ticket holders and office bearers of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) from central Punjab and Lahore on Tuesday announced that they were severing ties with the now-banned organisation, stating that they were “standing with the state”.
On Friday, all election ticket holders of the TLP from south Punjab announced that they had left the party, accusing it of pursuing an anti-state agenda that “aligns with the country’s enemies”.
In a press conference at the Lahore Press Club today, multiple TLP ticket holders and office bearers announced their decision to step away from the religiopolitical group, with lawyer Usman Khizr Mangat saying that one can engage in politics within the state, but not against it.
“Violence and mobs cannot create an impact by attacking the state,” he said. “Pakistan saw how these people carried out attacks. The government tried to start a dialogue, but the demands laid out were not accepted.
“The state is like a mother, it tried to negotiate for six, seven days constantly with these people (the TLP) and outlined Pakistan’s situation and its standing in the international community.”
Mangat noted that the unrest took place at a time when the country is “on red alert because of India in the east and Afghanistan in the northwest”.
“You saw that buses were stolen, people were armed and school buses carrying girls were hijacked. What kind of politics is this?” he questioned.
“Other parties protest under the Constitution and the law; they have the right to freedom of movement and freedom of speech, but you cannot exercise those rights at the cost of causing unrest within the state.”
Mangat added that the TLP “always thought themselves above the Constitution, the law and the state”, adding that this attitude could not be tolerated in any case.
“I, Barrister Usman Khizer Mangat, along with these ticket holders and officer bearers of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan, announce the end of our time with the TLP,” he stated.
“I am here to show my solidarity with the state,” Mangat added. “I stand with my state under any circumstance; it is my state and my state has been established. If my politics compromises my state’s stability and security, it is better I do not engage in politics.
“I am making it very clear that I am not under any pressure. With my free will, I am announcing that I am standing alongside the state.”</p><small>2025-11-04 13:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/041821351fefc5c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953123/india-ramps-up-support-after-afghan-quake-vying-with-china-for-influence' target='_blank'><strong>India ramps up support after Afghan quake, vying with China for influence</strong></a><br><p>India is ramping up aid to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and branding itself as the region’s “first responder” after Monday’s deadly earthquake, seeking to counter China’s efforts to fill the void left by the West, officials and analysts said.
Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was among the first to call his Taliban counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi on Monday, pledging more support after New Delhi shipped 15 tonnes of food.
Medical supplies would follow soon, he said, as his ministry promoted the hashtag #IndiaFirstResponder on X.
China on Tuesday said it too was ready to assist after the quake near Mazar-i-Sharif killed at least 20 people and injured more than 900.
India wields soft power
 
 

Both Asian giants are keen to deepen engagement with the Taliban, said Harsh Pant, head of foreign policy studies at the Observer Research Foundation think tank in New Delhi. India’s ties with Afghanistan have warmed in recent weeks, even as relations between both countries and Pakistan have soured.
“Behind India’s outreach to Afghanistan is the idea to create a certain resonance and goodwill among the local population as a form of soft power,” Pant said. “It’s unlikely India can fill the gap left by Western nations, but if it does not make an effort then China will.”
India hosted Muttaqi last month for six days and announced plans to reopen its embassy in Kabul, shut since 2021. It also pledged cooperation on hydroelectric projects and support for healthcare and public infrastructure.
“The reopening of the Indian embassy sends a political signal, short of India’s recognition of the Taliban, of a stronger Indian presence on the ground,” an Indian official said, adding that more aid would follow.
Muttaqi’s visit coincided with worsening Afghan Taliban-Pakistan relations after border clashes. Last week, India secured a six-month US sanctions waiver to operate Iran’s Chabahar port, boosting trade with Afghanistan and reducing Kabul’s reliance on Pakistan’s Karachi port.
Beijing eyes mining opportunities
China, which maintains close ties with Pakistan, told Afghanistan in August it was keen to explore mining and mineral opportunities and urged Kabul to formally join its Belt and Road Initiative.
Chinese and Indian support is crucial for the Taliban, which seized power after US-led Nato forces withdrew in 2021, but remains shunned by Western nations over restrictions on women and UN sanctions.
“Afghanistan’s isolation from the international banking system and the absence of normal coordination channels have made it far harder for aid and development funds to move,” said Ibraheem Bahiss of the International Crisis Group.
“Afghanistan’s humanitarian needs are not reducing — if anything, they’re rising because the population keeps growing while economic growth remains stagnant.”</p><small>2025-11-04 13:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632089-pakistan-welcomes-indias-sikh-pilgrims-for-guru-nanak-anniversary-first-since-may-war' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan welcomes India's Sikh pilgrims, first since May war</strong></a><br><p>

The three-month voter registration overhaul — known as the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) — kicked off in 12 states and territories, many of which are slated to hold local elections next year.
Tens of thousands of election officials and nearly half a million volunteers will go door-to-door to help residents complete voter enumeration forms.
Officials “will help the elector fill the enumeration form, collect it and submit it”, Election Commission of India (ECI) chief Gyanesh Kumar told reporters while announcing the exercise.
Earlier this year, the ECI conducted a similar revision in the eastern state of Bihar, home to more than 130 million people, ahead of its state elections beginning November 6.
 
 

The process led to the exclusion of around 6.5m names, which the ECI said was necessary to prevent the inclusion of “foreign illegal immigrants”.
Members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have long claimed that undocumented Muslim migrants from neighbouring Bangladesh have fraudulently registered as voters.
Critics, however, argue that stringent documentation requirements could result in large numbers of Indian citizens being wrongly removed from the rolls.
Activists have reported cases of living voters declared dead and entire families being struck off draft lists.
In August, India’s Supreme Court eased some concerns by ruling that the widely used biometric-linked Aadhaar identity card could be accepted as valid documentation for the process.
The latest SIR drive will cover major states, including Uttar Pradesh — India’s most populous state with about 199m people — as well as West Bengal with 91m, Tamil Nadu with 72m, and Kerala with 33m, according to the 2011 census.
Several rights groups and opposition parties have filed legal challenges.
Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin, whose party filed its opposition in the Supreme Court on Monday, said the exercise was a “mere trick to delete the names of genuine voters”.
“Voting is the body and soul of democracy, and that right is facing a threat,” he told opposition parties on Sunday.
The final electoral roll is expected to be released on February 7, 2026.</p><small>2025-11-04 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/041709409a293f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953117/weaponisation-of-iwt-cannot-and-will-not-succeed-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Weaponisation of IWT cannot and will not succeed: President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari said on Tuesday that the violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) by India could not and would not succeed, and warned against the weaponisation of water.
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
President Zardari addressed the issue while speaking at the Second World Summit for Social Development in Doha, Qatar today, saying: “We in Pakistan, on one hand, face the brunt of the impact of climate change, which has caused devastation for our people in the form of large-scale floods … on the other hand, we face a new threat in the form of water weaponisation. Water, which all the world knows, is an equal right of any human being and humanity.”
“We are being threatened from across the border with a new threat in the form of weaponisation of water, violation of the IWT. This poses a serious threat to 240 million Pakistanis. Such tactics cannot and will not succeed.”
 


A supplemental award by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it did not recognise the court or its decisions.
Under the 1960 IWT, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers. In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
The court, in its August ruling in the case, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said, adding that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
The president also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to social justice, inclusive development and global solidarity, emphasising the need to eradicate poverty, promote decent work and ensure equality and human rights for all.
The president expressed full support for the Doha Political Declaration and highlighted that the country’s vision for inclusiveness and sustainable development aligned with the spirit of the declaration.
“Pakistan remains steadfast in placing people at the centre of policy,” President Zardari added.
Showcasing Pakistan’s progress, he cited the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), which he said had empowered over nine million families through income assistance, healthcare and education. The initiative, he said, was recognised globally as one of the best social protection models.
He also reaffirmed the country’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, pledging to raise literacy to 90 per cent and ensure every child attended school within five years.
The president also mentioned initiatives such as the National Youth Internship Programme and green and resilient housing projects, which aim to empower young people and strengthen climate resilience through nature-based solutions, including mangrove restoration.
Outlining a roadmap to translate the Doha Declaration into action, Zardari urged the world to unite around three pillars: dignity, equality and solidarity, emphasising global financial reforms, debt relief, equitable taxation and expanded social protection.
Condemning  the “genocide, apartheid, and mass starvation” in Palestine, the president also called for a just and lasting peace.
The president also reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering support for the people of Kashmir, linking both struggles as two sides of the same coin in the pursuit of justice and self-determination.
“Development must begin and end with the betterment of people,” President Zardari said, adding that “we must rise above all differences to embark on a path of compassion and progress for all.”
 






PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also drew the attention of the UN secretary general to India’s weaponisation of water, pointing out that India had unilaterally and illegally suspended the water-sharing agreement and stopped providing discharge data on rivers, creating man-made disasters for Pakistan.
In a meeting with the UN chief, President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong support for multilateralism and the central role of the UN in promoting peace, equity and shared prosperity.
He underscored the importance of resolving longstanding disputes, including Jammu and Kashmir, in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and called for the reversal of India’s unilateral and illegal measures.
The president also reiterated Pakistan’s principled position on Palestine, stressing the need to end the suffering of the Palestinian people and to uphold their right to self-determination through the establishment of a viable, contiguous, and sovereign State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.
He also appreciated the UN chief’s leadership in addressing global challenges and for his continued support to Pakistan.
The president raised the issue of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, recalling that it remained one of the oldest unresolved items on the agenda of the UN Security Council.
He urged the implementation of relevant UN resolutions to ensure a just and lasting settlement in line with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
President Zardari also highlighted Pakistan’s longstanding contribution to UN peacekeeping operations, noting that Pakistani peacekeepers had served with distinction in conflict zones across the world.
The UN chief acknowledged Pakistan’s significant role in peacekeeping and expressed solidarity with Pakistan in its efforts to combat terrorism.
 






Meetings with Iraqi, Tajik counterparts
Zardari also met Iraqi counterpart Dr Abdul Latif Jamal Rashid, both reviewing the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reaffirming their mutual commitment to further strengthening longstanding ties.
Discussing trade and investment, both sides underlined the importance of enhancing economic linkages through increased business-to-business interactions and facilitative visa regimes.
President Zardari appreciated Iraq’s cooperation in facilitating Pakistani pilgrims and acknowledged the valuable contribution of the Pakistani community in Iraq, which served as a bridge of goodwill between the two nations.
The two leaders also exchanged views on regional peace, stability and cooperation, agreeing to maintain regular high-level contacts to advance bilateral relations.
The Iraqi president again invited President Zardari to visit Iraq.
The president accepted the invitation and stated that he would undertake the visit soon after the Iraqi parliamentary elections, scheduled for later this month.
 






He also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening bilateral cooperation in trade, investment, connectivity, energy, defence and people-to-people exchanges with Tajikistan.
President Zardari said that Pakistan greatly valued its multifaceted relationship with Tajikistan, rooted in shared history, culture, and linguistic affinity.
He noted that the Strategic Partnership Agreement signed in 2024 reflected the growing depth of ties between the two countries. He welcomed the resumption of work on the CASA-1000 project, terming it a flagship initiative for shared prosperity, and invited Tajikistan to explore new avenues of trade and connectivity through Pakistan, including the possibility of restoring direct flights.
President Zardari also commended the successful Dosti-II joint military exercise held in August 2025 and reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness to assist Tajikistan in defence cooperation and capacity building.
The Tajik president invited Zardari to visit the country, which the latter accepted.
The two leaders also shared perspectives on regional and global issues of common concern.

The 50-year-old former England soccer captain received the honour at the royal residence, more than 20 years after he was awarded a separate royal honour recognising his contribution to football.
Beckham, a lifelong admirer of the royal family, was dressed in a suit designed by his wife, Victoria Beckham, a fashion designer and former member of the Spice Girls pop band.
‘Doesn’t get any better’
He and King Charles shared a brief but warm exchange during the ceremony, with the king seen smiling and laughing as they spoke.
Coming out of the ceremony, Beckham said he cried when he first found out he was being awarded the knighthood.
“It’s such a big moment for our family and it’s so special,” Beckham told reporters, joking that he would not mind if his kids called him “sir dad”.
“I’m very proud to have such a special honour given to me. I grew up in a very humble background in the East End of London; always wanted to be a professional footballer; and then I’m stood here at Windsor Castle with the most important monarchy in the world,” he said, adding that “it doesn’t get any better”.
From East Londo to global stardom
Born in east London, Beckham made his Premier League debut for Manchester United in 1995, two years after he joined as a trainee. He went on to win six league titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League with the club, before playing for Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain.
He retired in 2013 with 115 England caps.
Known for his precise free kicks and crossing ability, Beckham also became one of the most commercially successful athletes of his era. He has worked with brands such as Adidas, luxury brand Armani, high-street retailer H&M and Pepsi and has been a goodwill ambassador for UNICEF since 2005.
According to the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, Beckham and his wife have a combined net worth of 500 million pounds ($671m).
A ‘huge royalist’ with ties to the monarchy
Beckham has long expressed admiration for the royal family, describing himself as a “huge royalist”.
In 2022, Beckham queued for more than 12 hours to pay his respects to the late Queen Elizabeth II as she lay in state at Westminster Hall, declining offers to skip the line.
“I grew up in a household of royalists,” he told ITV at the time. “
If my grandparents would have been today, I know that they would have wanted to be here.”
He attended both Prince William’s 2011 wedding to Kate Middleton and Prince Harry’s 2018 wedding to Meghan Markle.
Beckham has also developed a personal rapport with the King, sharing a mutual interest in gardening.
Last year, he was appointed an ambassador for the King’s Foundation, which supports education and sustainability initiatives.
Life beyond the pitch
Beckham married Victoria Adams, known as “Posh Spice” from the all-women Spice Girls pop group, in 1999. The couple have four children.
They opened up about their relationship in two Netflix documentaries. The series touched on the pressures of fame, family tensions and the challenges they faced during Beckham’s playing career, including tabloid speculation and time spent apart due to his international transfers.
Beckham has described his family as his “greatest achievement”.</p><small>2025-11-04 12:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632082-proposed-27th-amendment-tantamount-to-undoing-provincial-autonomy-raza-rabbani' target='_blank'><strong>Proposed 27th amendment tantamount to undoing provincial autonomy: Raza Rabbani</strong></a><br><p>

More than 2,100 pilgrims were granted visas to attend a 10-day festival marking the 556th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, founder of the Sikh faith, Pakistan’s High Commission (embassy) in New Delhi said last week.

Tensions remain high between Islamabad and New Delhi after the worst fighting since 1999 took place in May. The Wagah-Attari border — the only active land crossing between the two countries — was closed to general traffic following the conflict.
Pilgrims queued up on the Indian side of the border on Tuesday morning, some carrying their luggage on their heads, as the Indian Border Security Force looked on.

AFP journalists on the Pakistani side of the Wagah-Attari border saw dozens of them entering Pakistan.
They were received by Pakistani officials who presented them with flowers and showered them with rose petals.

Indian media reported that around 1,700 were due to cross into Pakistan, although there was no immediate official confirmation from Indian authorities.
The pilgrims will gather tomorrow at Nankana Sahib, Guru Nanak’s birthplace, about 80 kilometres west of Lahore by road, and later visit other sacred sites in Pakistan, including Kartarpur, where the guru is buried.

Pakistan’s High Commission had said last week its decision was consistent with efforts to promote “inter-religious and inter-cultural harmony and understanding”.
Indian newspapers reported Saturday that the government would allow “selected” groups to travel to Pakistan.
The Kartarpur Corridor, a visa-free route that opened in 2019 that allows Indian Sikhs to visit the temple without crossing the main border, has remained closed since the conflict.

The four-day clashes between the arch-rivals broke out in May after New Delhi, without any evidence, accused Islamabad of backing an attack targeting tourists in India-occupied Kashmir on April 22 — claims that Pakistan has strongly denied.
Sikhism is a monotheistic religion born in the 15th century in Punjab, a region spanning parts of what is now India and Pakistan.
The frontier between the two countries was a colonial creation drawn at the violent end of British rule in 1947, which sliced the subcontinent into India and  Pakistan.
While most Sikhs migrated to India during partition, some of their most revered places of worship ended up in Pakistan, including the shrines in Nankana Sahib and Kartarpur.

“A gas blast occurred at a canteen in the basement of the Supreme Court building at around 10:55am,” Islamabad Inspector General of Police (IG) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi said while speaking to the media after the incident.
He added that of the 12 injured, nine were taken to the Polyclinic hospital and three to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). IG Rizvi further told the reporters that the condition of two of the injured was “serious” who had sustained 80 per cent and 30pc burns. “The rest suffered minor injuries, most of which are burn injuries.”
In multiple videos received by Dawn following the incident, the damaged interior of parts of the SC building is visible with blood stains on the floor. In other videos recorded outside, people, including lawyers, could be seen spilling out of the building.
The IG said police, including special branch and along with bomb disposal squad and Rescue 1122 personnel, had visited the scene of the incident and carried out an investigation.
“Initial probe revealed that there had been complaints of gas leakage in the canteen located in the basement and a tea room for around past three days. Plumbers and technicians who work at the Supreme Court were looking into those,” he said.
He further stated that there was considerable leakage in the canteen today as well. Meanwhile, two of the air conditioners in the canteen were not working properly, he added.
“Technicians were repairing them, during which gas accumulated […] and a blast occurred.”
The IG said among the injured, the technicians repairing the air conditioners were most affected.
He also assured that no traces of any kind of explosives were found at the site.

Yesterday, the ruling party PML-N’s coalition partner PPP revealed it had been approached by the government for its support in passing a 27th Constitutional Amendment. The key features were heavily criticised by lawyers and politicians, who termed them an attempt to revoke provincial rights granted in the 18th Amendment.
“The proposed constitutional amendments of the federal government, with reference to provincial autonomy, amount to a rollback of the 18th
Amendment,” Rabbani said in a statement.
The 18th Amendment, passed in 2010, had allayed provinces’ concerns by devolving several ministries and departments from the Centre to them, including education and population.
 
 

“In the brittle internal political situation, playing with provincial autonomy will cast deep shadows over the federation,” the veteran politician warned.
Noting that the 18th Amendment “disarmed the extreme nationalists of a political discourse”, Rabbani said the suggested changes will “lend vigour to their extra-constitutional activities”.
The PPP leader also highlighted that revisiting devolved ministries will be a “financial burden” on the federal government. “Recalling the financial devolution will be against the scheme [of] participatory federalism,” he added.
“If the federal government is unable to manage its finances, then let the
provinces collect all the taxes and look after federal expenditures through the
Council of Common Interests,” the former senator proposed.
 
 

Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik has confirmed that discussions regarding the amendment had been and were still ongoing, but added that the government has not properly started working on a draft.
Even as recently as December 2023, various senior PPP leaders opposed revoking or altering the guarantees brought by the 18th Amendment — a party stance placing it against that of the PML-N.
During the past several years, Rabbani — a PPP senator when the 18th Amendment was passed — has repeatedly voiced strong objection to making any changes in the laws introduced in it.
In 2019, he accused the PTI government of conspiring to roll back the 18th Amendment, which he stressed ensured provincial autonomy.
Back in 2015, the PPP senator was in tears after voting in the Upper House of the parliament on the 21st Amendment for setting up military courts in the country, saying he voted in its favour against his own conscience.</p><small>2025-11-04 10:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632055-lhc-bans-commercial-activities-on-sundays-amid-smog-crisis' target='_blank'><strong>LHC bans commercial activities on Sundays amid smog crisis</strong></a><br><p>

Anil, the younger sibling of Asia’s richest person, Mukesh Ambani, has business interests ranging from power to defence, but has seen his fortunes wane over the last two decades.
In recent months, the industrialist has attracted law enforcement scrutiny with investigators probing alleged crimes ranging from diversion of bank loans to money laundering.
On Monday evening, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said it had frozen assets worth more than Rs75 billion, including office premises, residential units and over 132 acres (53 hectares) of land as part of its investigation.
The agency said it had “detected fraudulent diversion of public money by various Reliance Anil Ambani group companies” and that it was “committed to restituting” the proceeds of these crimes to “their rightful claimants”.
The ED also said it had initiated the probe based on a criminal case filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in August.
Reliance Infrastructure, an Anil Ambani-controlled firm, said in a Monday statement that the ED’s decision to seize company assets would have “no impact” on business operations.
The CBI case stems from a fraud complaint received by the State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, which claimed it was hit with a loss of Rs29.29bn after Reliance Communications “misappropriated” bank funds.
A Reliance spokesperson said at the time that the tycoon “strongly denies all allegations and charges” and “will duly defend himself”.
Anil was last in the public spotlight seven years ago after India’s opposition leader Rahul Gandhi accused him and Prime Minister Narendra Modi of dodgy dealings related to the purchase of Rafale jets from France — allegations that both denied.
India’s Supreme Court in December 2018 dismissed calls for a probe into the jet deal.</p><small>2025-11-04 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04160105a8d30ee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953100/dar-hails-historic-milestone-as-pakistans-first-google-chromebook-assembly-line-launched' target='_blank'><strong>Dar hails ‘historic milestone’ as Pakistan’s first Google Chromebook assembly line launched</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday launched Pakistan’s first Google Chromebook assembly line and hailed it as a “historic milestone” that would make digital tools more accessible.
“Today marks a historic milestone in that journey as we celebrate the invaluable partnership between Google and Pakistan,” Dar said while addressing a ceremony marking the launch in Islamabad.
 






Terming the move a “defining moment for our country’s digital transformation”, the deputy PM said localising the assembly of Chromebooks would make access to digital tools more affordable and inclusive, particularly in the education sector.
Dar, who is also the foreign minister, said the assembly line’s establishment held great economic significance as it laid the “foundation for jobs, supply chain, development and future tech exports”.
Dar said that under a strategic memorandum of understanding, Google and Pakistan would “collaborate to provide skills training for 100,000 developers nationwide while also developing targeted programmes for the gaming and startup industries”.
“Together, we will also advance localised AI-powered solutions, such as Android services for public safety and offer 100,000 Google Careers certificates to equip Pakistanis with world-class digital training and globally recognised credentials,” the deputy premier said.
 


“Google’s decision to open its local office in Pakistan is not just symbolic; it is a moment for national pride and a powerful endorsement of our country’s digital potential,” Dar stressed.
He added that it represented a “strategic milestone with far-reaching implications for the digital economy, the innovation ecosystem and global investor confidence”.
The deputy PM noted that Google’s local presence would bring it “closer to Pakistan’s developers, startups and entrepreneurs, enabling direct collaboration, capacity building, and great access to global platforms”.
During his address, Dar appreciated Defence Production Minister Muhammad Raza Hayat and Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) National Coordinator Lt Gen Sarfraz Ahmad for their contribution in “all such efforts”.
 
 

Meanwhile, in her remarks at the launch IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja termed the launch of Chromebook’s assembly line as a transformative step, Radio Pakistan reported.
Khawaja highlighted that the move brought together technology, manufacturing and education. She expressed the government’s commitment to continuing Pakistan’s digital journey at a fast pace.
In June last year, Google for Education’s country partner Tech Valley, National Radio and Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC), and Australia-based manufacturer Allied announced their intent to establish a Google Chromebook assembly line in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur.
Yesterday, a delegation of Tech Valley led by Kevin Kalis called on Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in Lahore and promised support to establish a Google Chromebook manufacturing factory in Punjab to boost technology-driven education and local IT infrastructure.</p><small>2025-11-04 09:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04121242007cea1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953096/4-militants-killed-in-intelligence-based-operation-in-kalat-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>4 militants killed in intelligence-based operation in Kalat: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Four Indian-sponsored terrorists were killed after security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Kalat district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Tuesday.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on the night of November 1, security forces conducted an IBO on the reported presence of militants belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
 






“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and resultantly, four Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” it said.
“Weapons and ammunition [were] also recovered from the killed terrorists, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities,” it added.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area,” the statement said, adding that security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue to wipe out foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.
President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to the security forces for eliminating the terrorists, his official account posted on social media platform X.
“The nation stands firmly with its forces in their resolve to root out terrorism under Operation Azm-i-Istehkam,” he said.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also hailed the armed forces, reiterating that the entire nation stood in their support with an unwavering resolve to protect the homeland, APP reported.
“Pakistan would continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication from the country,” the premier reaffirmed.
The development comes a day after the ISPR said at least three terrorists were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p><small>2025-11-04 09:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632052-e-challans-continue-in-karachi-for-traffic-violations' target='_blank'><strong>3,400 e-challans in a day — what were Karachi drivers fined for?</strong></a><br><p>

The visit comes as Trump pushes Saudi Arabia to join the list of nations that have joined the Abraham Accords. In 2020, Trump reached deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco to normalise relations with Israel.
The Saudis have been hesitant to join in the absence of steps toward Palestinian statehood.
Trump told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview broadcast on Sunday that he believed the Saudis would ultimately join the accords.
The US president also said earlier this month that he expected an expansion of the Abraham Accords soon and hoped Saudi Arabia would join the pact. In August, he also stressed the importance of Middle Eastern countries joining the accords.
Trump and the crown prince may also discuss a US-Saudi defence agreement. The Financial Times reported two weeks ago that there were hopes the two countries could sign such an agreement during Salman’s visit.
 
 

A senior Trump administration official told Reuters that “there are discussions about signing something when the crown prince comes, but details are in flux“.
The Saudis have sought formal US guarantees to defend the kingdom as well as access to more advanced US weaponry.
Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms, and the two countries have maintained strong ties for decades based on an arrangement in which the kingdom delivers oil and Washington provides security.
During Trump’s visit to Riyadh in May, the US agreed to sell Saudi Arabia an arms package worth nearly $142 billion. Trump had also welcomed a promise by Salman, for $600 billion in investment and quipped that it should be $1 trillion.</p><small>2025-11-04 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04073407876257c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953065/canada-and-pakistan-agree-to-facilitate-canola-trade-as-ottawa-seeks-new-markets-for-commodity' target='_blank'><strong>Canada and Pakistan agree to facilitate canola trade as Ottawa seeks new markets for commodity</strong></a><br><p>Canada and Pakistan have agreed to facilitate the export of Canadian canola to the South Asian nation, the countries said in a joint statement issued late on Monday.
Canada has been looking to open new markets for the commodity after China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada said it would levy a 100 per cent tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles.
In a joint statement released late on Monday, the two countries said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had held a phone call with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand on October 30, “reaffirming the strong and enduring ties between Pakistan and Canada and emphasising the importance of deepening cooperation in areas of mutual interest”.
 






“Pakistan and Canada agreed to facilitate the export of Canadian canola to Pakistan, recognising the significant potential of Pakistan’s expanding market for this Canadian commodity,” the statement said.
It added that the ministers also welcomed the successful conclusion of the first round of negotiations toward a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement. It said that led by Minister for Investment Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh and Canadian Minister of International Trade Maninder Sidhu, the agreement was an “important priority which reflects both countries’ dedication to fostering a stable and transparent investment environment”.
“Both sides also expressed keen interest in expanding bilateral cooperation on energy security and critical minerals, recognising the strong and growing role of Canadian companies in achieving Pakistan’s ambitious mineral development goals and harnessing its clean energy potential,” the statement said.
It further said that the minister also looked ahead to the upcoming sixth round of bilateral consultations, which would serve as a platform to “advance shared priorities, reinforce government-to-government and private sector linkages, and explore new avenues for strategic collaboration”.
“Pakistan and Canada remain committed to working together to promote peace, prosperity, and inclusive growth, both bilaterally and on the global stage,” the statement concluded.
Canadian Foreign Minister Anand also posted the joint statement on social media platform X.
 






Meanwhile, Canadian MP Rob Oliphant said that Ottawa was strengthening and diversifying its trade relationships.
“As we continue negotiations toward a Foreign Investment and Promotion Agreement with Pakistan, our governments have agreed to facilitate Canadian canola exports — a beneficial deal for both sides,” he said.
 






Canadian MP Shafqat Ali said the two countries were strengthening cooperation in areas of mutual interest, including renewed trade in Canadian canola.
“Good news for both our countries,” he said.
Last week, Dar and his Canadian counterpart had discussed the strengthening of bilateral trade and cooperation between the two countries. During the call, Anand had thanked Dar for facilitating market access for imports of Canadian canola to Pakistan.
“Both leaders appreciated recent constructive engagements, reaffirmed their commitment to advancing mutually beneficial economic cooperation,” the Foreign Office had said, adding that the two foreign ministers agreed to remain in close contact.
Subsequently, Anand said on X that she spoke to Canola Council of Canada and explained that “our diplomatic efforts had resulted in Pakistan’s decision to lift restrictions on imports of Canadian canola”.
“This decision re-establishes a significant market for Canadian canola producers,” she said. “As Pakistan expedites regulatory approvals, for Canadian canola, I understand that import orders have already been placed,” she said.

Trump, a Republican who has offered frequent commentary on the New York mayoral election, injected himself further into the race by crossing party lines to support Cuomo over Mamdani and the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, who trails badly in public opinion polls in the heavily Democratic city.
Cuomo, a longtime stalwart in the Democratic Party, is running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in the Democratic primary.
Tuesday’s New York City election has been closely watched nationally as one that could help shape the image of the Democratic Party as it seeks its identity in opposition to Trump.
 
 

Mamdani, 34, a self-described democratic socialist who is leading Cuomo in the polls, has energised younger and more progressive voters, but he has also alarmed more moderate Democrats who fear a shift too far to the left may backfire. Republicans have attacked Mamdani’s candidacy throughout the campaign, with Trump casting him as a communist.
“Whether you personally like Andrew Cuomo or not, you really have no choice. You must vote for him, and hope he does a fantastic job. He is capable of it, Mamdani is not!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Trump said a vote for Sliwa would only help Mamdani.
“If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home,” said Trump, a native New Yorker.
The US federal government is providing $7.4 billion to New York City in fiscal year 2026, or about 6.4 per cent of the city’s total spending, according to a report from the New York State Comptroller.
Trump has threatened federal funding cuts throughout his second term in office over climate initiatives, transgender policies, pro-Palestinian protests against Israel’s onslaught on Gaza and diversity, equity and inclusion practices.
Mamdani, a Uganda-born state assembly member, shocked political observers on June 24 with a convincing victory in the primary.
Mamdani has used his campaign to rally New Yorkers against establishment candidates like Cuomo, who was elected governor of New York three times but resigned in 2021 following a report from the New York Attorney General that concluded he had sexually harassed 11 women, including state employees.
A US Justice Department investigation later concluded Cuomo subjected at least 13 female state employees to a “sexually hostile work environment.”
“The MAGA movement’s embrace of Andrew Cuomo is reflective of Donald Trump’s understanding that this would be the best mayor for him,” Mamdani said at a campaign event following Trump’s endorsement of Cuomo.
“They (Trump and Cuomo) share the same donors, they share the same small vision, they share the same sense of impunity,” Mamdani said.
 






Mamdani’s policies include hiking taxes on New York City’s wealthiest, raising the corporation tax rate, freezing stabilised apartment rental rates and increasing publicly subsidised housing.
His rise presents both risks and rewards for the national Democratic Party, which acknowledges the need to appeal to young voters but is wary of Republican attacks over Mamdani’s criticism of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories and his democratic socialism, which has concerned New York’s finance community.</p><small>2025-11-04 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04122617eb0f40d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953097/us-seeks-un-approval-for-gaza-security-force-with-broad-2-year-mandate-report' target='_blank'><strong>US seeks UN approval for Gaza security force with broad 2-year mandate: report</strong></a><br><p>The United States is seeking approval from the United Nations for the establishment of an International Security Force (ISF) in Gaza with a mandate of at least two years, Axios reported on Tuesday.
According to the report, the US sent several UN Security Council (UNSC) members a draft resolution yesterday outlining the establishment of its proposed security force to maintain security in the Palestinian enclave.
Axios, which obtained a copy of the draft, said that the resolution was designated “sensitive but unclassified”. It reported that the resolution would give the US and other participating countries a broad mandate to deploy security forces to govern Gaza until the end of 2027, and allowed the possibility of extensions beyond that time.
The force would be established “in consultation with the Gaza ‘Board of Peace’”, to be chaired by US President Donald Trump, the publication reported. The Board of Peace is also to remain in place “at least through the end of 2027”.
However, a US official told Axios that the ISF was to be an “enforcement force and not a peacekeeping force”. The official said that the goal was to vote to establish the force in the next few weeks and deploy the first troops to Gaza by January.
 
 

The publication said the draft would serve as the basis for upcoming negotiations between UNSC members. It further said that the proposed resolution tasked the ISF with “securing Gaza’s borders with Israel and Egypt, protecting civilians and humanitarian corridors, and training a new Palestinian police force, with which it’s to partner in its mission”.
The ISF would also “stabilise the security environment in Gaza by ensuring the process of demilitarising the Gaza Strip, including the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” the draft stated, as well as taking on “additional tasks” as required to support the Gaza peace deal.
Axios said that this suggested that the mandate included disarming Hamas if it does not do so of its own volition.
The resolution further said that the ISF would deploy in Gaza “under unified command acceptable to the Board of Peace” and stressed that there would be “close consultation and cooperation with Egypt and Israel”. The proposed force would have the power “to use all necessary measures to carry out its mandate consistent with international law, including international humanitarian law”.
According to Axios, the ISF was intended to provide security in Gaza during a transition period during which Israel would gradually withdraw from additional parts of Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority would conduct reforms that would enable it to take over Gaza longer-term.
 
 

The draft resolution also called for the empowerment of the Board of Peace as “a transitional governance administration”. The draft resolution said that the board would be “supervising and supporting a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee of competent Palestinians from the Strip … which shall be responsible for day-to-day operations of Gaza’s civil service and administration”.
It added that aid would be delivered by organisations working with the Board of Peace, including the UN, Red Cross and Red Crescent; meanwhile, any organisation that misuses or diverts this aid it will be banned“.
Muslim nations’ meeting in Istanbul
The establishment of the ISF is a cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement, which paved the way for the October 10 ceasefire in the Palestinian territory. The ceasefire, which halted two years of continuous bloodshed, has been tested by fresh Israeli strikes in Gaza.
The ceasefire was achieved with the efforts of eight Muslim countries —Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — that worked with the Trump administration on the Gaza peace plan.
Foreign ministers from seven of these countries, namely Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia — met in Istanbul yesterday and agreed to back a post-war framework for Gaza, where Palest­ine’s governance and security is ensured by Palestinians. They also stressed the importance of a UN mandate for the proposed task force for stabilisation in Gaza.
After the meeting, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters that the propsoed taskforce to monitor the Gaza ceasefire under a US-brokered deal needed a mandate defined by the UNSC and a framework for legitimacy, on the basis of which countries would decide whether to send soldiers to the enclave.
Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” Fidan said yesterday.
“First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council.
“And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” Fidan said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington.
Top-level consultations are reportedly also underway in Pakistan over the question of sending troops for the proposed Gaza force, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the UN umbrella.</p><small>2025-11-04 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04110739fd6e361.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953092/citizens-anger-boils-over-after-dumper-truck-kills-man-injures-woman-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Citizens’ anger boils over after dumper truck kills man, injures woman in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Angered citizens set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it killed a man and injured his wife, resulting in some people opening fire on them, police said on Tuesday.
“A garbage dumper hit a motorcyclist on Nishtar Road near Karachi Sweets, killing him,” South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.
He identified the deceased man as 23-year-old Shahzeb Shahid and his wife as Misbah. The driver, Niazullah Afzal, was arrested and taken to a police station, DIG Raza said.
“The public set the dumper on fire,” the police officer said. He added that the blaze was later extinguished and 40 per cent of the vehicle was burnt. Police reached the site of the incident and the injured woman was taken to a hospital, a statement by the Karachi police’s media cell said.
 
 

A first information report (FIR) was registered against the dumper driver under Sections 320 (negligent driving) and 337-G (hurt by rash or negligent driving) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on the complaint of the victim’s father.
As per the FIR, the father received information about the accident of Shahzeb, who had gotten married three to four months ago, at around 12 midnight.
When he, along with other relatives, arrived at the hospital, his son had already expired, the complainant said. The complainant said the dumper driver was involved in rash and negligent driving.
Meanwhile, police also registered a separate FIR against Liaquat Mehsood, the Sindh president of the All Dumper Truck Owners Association, and other suspects for firing on the enraged protesters.
The FIR invoked Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed) and 337-H (ii) (rash or negligent act to endanger human life) against the dumpers association’s head and others.
In the FIR, complainant Abdul Qadir, who introduced himself as a social worker, said he was present at Nishter Road, where the dumper had killed the man and injured his wife when the public set the heavy vehicle on fire.
He claimed that at around 3:30am, Mehsood arrived with 20-25 people, including two to three armed men, who resorted to firing and fled.
The armed men continued firing while fleeing, the complainant said. The social worker said he wanted to initiate legal proceedings against Mehsood and other unidentified persons for open firing.
On the other hand, in a statement shared on Mehsood’s Facebook account, the dumpers’ association claimed people opened fire at the official’s car and attempted to set it on fire.
The association’s spokesperson threatened to block the Super Highway in protest at 2pm if a case was not registered over the incident.
Rise in heavy vehicle accidents
In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumpers and water tankers. Nearly 500 people lost their lives and 4,879 were injured in 2024 in road accidents resulting from various reasons, from reckless driving to construction activities, hospital data showed.
On October 12, a reckless dumper driver smashed into six vehicles, including three ambulances of the Edhi Foundation, near Merewether Clock Tower, killing a man and injuring two others. The driver, who possessed a “fake” licence, was arrested.
On August 10, two siblings were killed and their father was injured when a dumper truck ran over them on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall. A mob then set seven trucks on fire, which sparked protests from transporters.
August 15 recorded two accidents involving heavy vehicles, including one where a speeding water tanker ran over and killed a four-year-old boy in Orangi Town.
In another accident, a young couple lost their lives when a fast-moving dumper truck hit their motorcycle in the Sultanabad area on M.T. Khan Road.</p><small>2025-11-04 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/632035-four-indian-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-balochistans-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Four India-sponsored terrorists killed in Balochistan IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

“Where we are as a country, we find ourselves in a good spot at this point and time because there is a confluence of factors,” he said, adding that macroeconomic stability combined with “geopolitical tailwinds” had boosted the economy.
The finance minister made these remarks in a virtual address at the second edition of the Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference 2025 (PIMEC-25), which is being held in Karachi.
“Our traditional partners, who have helped us through thick and thin … we find ourselves in a spot that we can now leverage, and we should leverage — in terms of these relationships which have been strong for the longest time — to move from government-to-government (G2G) discussions to trade and investment flows into the country,” he said.
In his address, the finance minister described blue economy as a game changer for Pakistan’s future growth. He also went on to say that Pakistan had received “external validation” for its economic policies.
“After a hiatus of two to three years, we have three global rating agencies which are fully aligned, not only in terms of the upgrades we have seen over the course of this year but also [in terms of] their outlook, which is stable for Pakistan’s economy,” he said.
He noted that Pakistan was currently part of an International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme. Stating that a staff-level agreement was announced last month, he said that this pointed to the confidence being reposed in Pakistani authorities.
He said that improved trade and investment flows which were expected in the coming months would help the country in moving toward sustainable growth.
Talking about blue economies, he said that Pakistan had a “modest starting point”.
“We are hovering at about 0.4 to 0.5 per cent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) which equates to roughly $1 billion,” he said. He said that the current GDP was $411bn, adding that Pakistan’s “real potential” was $3 trillion.
“It is very heartening and encouraging to see that the Ministry of Maritime Affairs has also put a marker in the ground, which is ambitious but very reachable,” he said.
He said that the government’s aim of becoming a $100bn blue economy by 2047 was “transformational and the right ambition”.
He said that the broad pillars of getting to that number were “robust”, adding that it started with achieving excellence in fisheries and aquaculture. Aurangzeb said that Pakistan’s seafood exports were currently $500 million, saying that getting that to $2bn over the next three to four years was a “very achievable milestone”.
“As the finance minister, I would like to assure you … that we are going to ensure that there is policy consistency. Whatever we say, we see it through the cycle. So I think that is going to be a very important part of how we are going to take this discussion forward,” he said.
He went on to say that another pillar was the modernisation of ports and logistics, and digitisation of the country’s ports. He said that another was renewable energy which included looking at “innovative financing” for projects.
“We have done green bonds in the past,” he said, highlighting the need for issuing blue bonds and blended financing mechanisms to fund conservation and sustainable development initiatives.
He added that marine biotechnology and regional collaboration presented further avenues for growth, with the ultimate objective of integrating blue economy principles into Pakistan’s national economic transformation agenda.
He concluded his remarks by wishing all panelists and delegations participating in PIMEC a “fruitful and constructive discussion”, adding that he looked forward to receiving feedback at the end of the conference.</p><small>2025-11-04 05:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/04073953880f9c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1953061/demand-to-end-terror-from-afghan-soil-non-negotiable-army' target='_blank'><strong>Demand to end terror from Afghan soil ‘non-negotiable’: army</strong></a><br><p>• ISPR chief rejects reports regarding US drone operations

ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Monday adopted a tougher stance toward the Taliban regime ahead of the next round of talks in Istanbul, declaring that Pakistan’s only and non-negotiable demand is an end to terrorism emanating from Afghan territory.
“The conditions that Afghan Taliban keep putting forward are meaningless, what matters is the end of terrorism,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s spokesman, while briefing a group of journalists at Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“Pakistan has a one-point agenda: Afghan soil must not be used against us,” he asserted.
 
 

Gen Chaudhry’s remarks came as Islamabad prepares for the Nov 6 meeting in Turkiye, the next phase of negotiations following last month’s six-day talks in Istanbul between Pakistan and the Taliban regime.
Those talks, mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, produced a reaffirmation by both sides to ceasefire agreed in Doha and an agreement on establishing a monitoring and verification mechanism for cross-border terrorism, though implementation details remain unresolved.
Ahead of the upcoming Istanbul talks, Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah also held consultations with his negotiators, led by Mullah Najib, to deliberate on the next phase of dialogue with Pakistan, according to sources familiar with the discussions in Kandahar.
During his briefing, the military’s spokesperson highlighted that operations were underway against terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned TTP — with 1,667 terrorists killed.
Gen Chaudhry disclosed that 206 Afghan Taliban fighters and 112 TTP terrorists were killed during the recent border tensions.
Pointing to growing participation of Afghans in TTP and subsequent blurring of lines between the two groups, he said about 60 per cent of the terrorists killed during infiltration attempts in the last three to four months were Afghan nationals.
Afghan Tailban’s support to TTP
“The TTP is not a separate entity, it is a branch of the Afghan Taliban,” Gen Chaudhry observed, explaining that the outfit had sworn allegiance to the Taliban’s emir, “and we have clear evidence that the Taliban are settling TTP fighters in densely populated areas to provide them a protective shield”.
He added that while Pakistan continues efforts to settle matters peacefully with Afghanistan, “there can be no compromise on our security and sovereignty”.
The spokesman dismissed recent Taliban statements suggesting preconditions for dialogue, including demands that Pakistan end alleged support for the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP) and anti-Taliban propaganda. “Such conditions are meaningless. The only meaningful step is verifiable action against terrorists,” he said.
US drone operations
He categorically denied reports in “Afghan and Indian media” about a supposed secret US-Pakistan understanding allowing American drone operations in Afghanistan.
“This is fake news propagated by Zabihullah Mujahid,” the Taliban spokesman, he said. “Pakistan has not given permission to the US or any other country to use its territory for attacks inside Afghanistan. These claims are baseless propaganda.”
Pakistani officials view the Istanbul process as a test of the Taliban’s credibility. A senior security source said last week that Pakistan expects “credible evidence of action including dismantling of hideouts, disruption of logistical networks, and arrests of TTP leadership.”
False flag operation
The military spokesman warned that India was planning a “false flag” operation in the maritime domain to fabricate evidence of a major Pakistani strike or act of aggression, potentially triggering a new round of tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals.
Gen Chaudhry, citing intelligence reports, indicated India could stage the incident “in deep waters,” portraying it as a Pakistani attack to justify escalation and malign Islamabad internationally.
 
 

He said Pakistan’s armed forces were on “high alert” and would deliver a “far stronger, more decisive, and severe” response than in previous incidents if provoked.
Security observers say the military’s unusually pointed warning coincides with several converging developments that Pakistan views as provocative or politically timed including India’s Trishul exercise, Bihar state elections, and regional tensions.
Last Saturday, the government released a video confession by Ijaz Mallah, a fisherman from Sindh who had been detained by Indian forces in 2024. In the video, Malah claims he was coerced by India’s external intelligence agency, RAW, to engage in espionage-related activities in Pakistan.
ISPR officials cited the testimony as partial evidence of Indian maritime sabotage plans, connecting it to what they describe as a “covert Indian terror network” disrupted earlier this year.
Gaza peace force
The military spokesman said that any decision regarding the deployment of Pakistani troops to a proposed Gaza peacekeeping force would be made by the government and parliament.
His comments came amid reports that Pakistan is weighing a potential contribution of troops to an International Stabilization Force (ISF) for Gaza.
The proposed mission could also include disarmament and security enforcement tasks, which have drawn criticism from opposition parties. They argue the government has not held a full parliamentary debate and warn that participation without clear UN oversight could risk Pakistan’s complicity in coercive actions against Palestinians.

Similar delays occurred at nearly all major airports in last two months due to engineers’ protest seeking pay hike and other issues.
According to sources, hundreds of Umrah pilgrims were stranded at the Islamabad, Lahore and Kara­chi airports due to the delay in PIA flights scheduled for Saudi Arabia.
A spokesman for PIA said the Society of Aircraft Engineers had no legal status and alleged that the main aim of this movement was to sabotage PIA’s privatisation, which was in its final stages.
He warned that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he warned, adding that the management was obtaining alternative engineering services from other airlines to resume operations.
