“Customs officers… foiled yet another wildlife smuggling attempt, 16 live snakes… seized from passenger returning from Thailand,” said customs officers in the airport in the Indian financial hub.
The passenger, who arrived on Sunday, has been arrested, the customs agency said in a statement, with “further investigation underway”.
The live snakes included reptiles often sold in the pet trade, and were largely non-venomous, or with venom too weak to affect people.
They included garter snakes, a rhino rat snake and a Kenyan sand boa, among others.
In early June, customs officers stopped a passenger smuggling dozens of venomous vipers, also arriving from Thailand.
Days later, officers stopped another traveller carrying 100 creatures including lizards, sunbirds and tree-climbing possums.
Wildlife trade monitor Traffic, which battles the smuggling of wild animals and plants, has warned of a “very troubling” trend in trafficking driven by the exotic pet trade.
More than 7,000 animals, dead and alive, have been seized along the Thailand-India air route in the last 3.5 years, it said.</p><small>2025-06-30 13:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/261750401088e19.jpg?r=175628' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920298/explosives-sniffer-dog-deep-retires-after-nearly-a-decade-of-loyal-service-with-kp-police' target='_blank'><strong>Explosives sniffer dog ‘Deep’ retires after nearly a decade of loyal service with KP Police</strong></a><br><p>After years on the front lines of danger, a four-legged hero has taken his final bow. Deep, an 11-year-old British Labrador and one of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police’s “most trusted” explosives sniffer dogs, retired last week after nearly a decade of sniffing out threats, saving lives, and earning the respect of his human colleagues.
Trained in explosives detection, Deep was part of the KP Police’s elite K9 Unit, formed in 2014 to strengthen counter-terrorism efforts and support criminal investigations. Over the years, he worked alongside officers during high-stakes operations, security sweeps, and major public events, where his instincts often proved life-saving.
During his nearly 10 years of service, Deep showed that he was more than just a service dog: he became a symbol of loyalty and bravery.
To honour Deep’s outstanding contributions, the KP Police Special Branch K9 Unit held a modest but heartfelt retirement ceremony last Tuesday.
The event was attended by unit officials and K9 handlers and marked the first-ever formal retirement of a service dog in KP Police history. Deep was awarded an honorary medal and a certificate of appreciation for his exceptional service.
According to Adil Abdal, Director of the K9 Unit, Deep was born in 2016 and joined the force after completing his specialised training in explosives detection.
“Deep came into the spotlight in 2021 during a police operation in Dera Ismail Khan,” Adil told Dawn.com. “We had intel about an improvised explosive device (IED), and Deep successfully detected it, which was then defused by the bomb disposal unit.”
Gul Rehman, Deep’s long-time handler, shared his emotional bond with the canine partner. “For years, I had a very strong relationship with Deep,” he said.
“He always gave his 100 per cent during duty hours. We have grown emotionally attached to him — we will miss him in the field.”
Following his retirement, Deep is now living in Peshawar Police Lines, where special kennels have been set up to accommodate retired service dogs. These facilities are equipped to protect them from extreme weather and ensure a comfortable life post-service.
A routine medical check-up schedule is in place, and Deep is provided with a diet including both dog food and other nutritious items.
Initially, the department considered partnering with an NGO to find post-service homes for retired dogs. However, according to Abdal, the standard operating procedures (SOPs) of many NGOs in dealing with retired dogs were not satisfactory.
“We had no idea how Deep would be cared for once handed over,” he explained. “These dogs are not a burden on us.”
Instead, the department made a conscious decision to retain Deep within its own facilities. “Deep is a part of our team,” Adil said. “We’ve decided to take care of him for the rest of his life.”</p><small>2025-06-30 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/30162834dab6b95.jpg?r=162857' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921228/israel-steps-up-gaza-bombardment-ahead-of-white-house-talks-on-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Israel steps up Gaza bombardment ahead of White House talks on ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Palestinians in northern Gaza reported one of the worst nights of Israeli bombardment in weeks after the military issued mass evacuation orders on Monday, while Israeli officials were due in Washington for a new ceasefire push by the Trump administration.
A day after US President Donald Trump urged an end to the 20-month-old conflict, a confidant of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected at the White House for talks on a Gaza ceasefire, Iran, and possible wider regional diplomatic deals.
But on the ground in the Palestinian enclave, there was no sign of fighting letting up.
“Explosions never stopped; they bombed schools and homes. It felt like earthquakes,” said Salah, 60, a father of five children, from Gaza City. “In the news, we hear a ceasefire is near, on the ground, we see death, and we hear explosions.”
Israeli tanks pushed into the eastern areas of the Zeitoun suburb in Gaza City and shelled several areas in the north, while aircraft bombed at least four schools after ordering hundreds of families sheltering inside to leave, residents said.
At least 25 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Monday, health authorities said, including 10 people killed in Zeitoun.
 
 

The Israeli military said it struck militant targets in northern Gaza, including command and control centres, after taking steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians.
The heavy bombardment followed new evacuation orders to vast areas in the north, where Israeli forces had operated before and left behind wide-scale destruction.
The military ordered people there to head south, saying that it planned to fight Hamas fighters operating in northern Gaza, including in the heart of Gaza City.
Later on Monday, health officials at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis said at least 13 people had been killed southwest of Gaza City, bringing Monday’s death toll to at least 38.
Medics said most of the casualties were hit by gunfire, but residents also reported an airstrike. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military on the incident.
Next steps
A day after Trump called to “Make the deal in Gaza, get the hostages back”, Israel’s strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer, a confidant of Netanyahu’s, was expected on Monday at the White House for talks on Iran and Gaza, an Israeli official said.
In Israel, Netanyahu’s security cabinet was expected to convene to discuss the next steps in Gaza.
 
 

On Friday, Israel’s military chief said the present ground operation was close to having achieved its goals, and on Sunday, Netanyahu said new opportunities had opened up for recovering the hostages, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive.
Palestinian and Egyptian sources with knowledge of the latest ceasefire efforts said that mediators Qatar and Egypt have stepped up their contacts with the two warring sides, but that no date has been set yet for a new round of truce talks.
A Hamas official said that progress depends on Israel changing its position and agreeing to end the conflict and withdraw from Gaza. Israel says it can end the offensive only when Hamas is disarmed and dismantled. Hamas refuses to lay down its arms.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said that Israel has agreed to a US-proposed 60-day ceasefire and hostage deal, and put the onus on Hamas.
“Israel is serious in its will to reach a hostage deal and ceasefire in Gaza,” Saar told reporters in Jerusalem.
The US has proposed a 60-day ceasefire and the release of half the hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and the remains of other Palestinians. Hamas would release the remaining hostages as part of a deal that guarantees the end of the conflict.
The conflict began when Hamas fighters stormed into Israel on October 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took 251 hostages back to Gaza in a surprise attack that led to Israel’s single deadliest day.
Israel’s subsequent military assault has killed more than 56,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, has displaced almost the whole 2.3 million population and plunged the enclave into a humanitarian crisis.
More than 80 per cent of the territory is now an Israeli-militarised zone or under displacement orders, according to the United Nations.
Pressure mounts on Netanyahu to end Gaza campaign
Netanyahu’s rise in popularity during the war with Iran may already be fading, as pressure mounts at home to end the conflict in Gaza.
Netanyahu claimed victory over the Islamic Republic in the 12-day war that ended with a ceasefire last week, after Trump ordered US warplanes to join in bombing Iranian nuclear sites.
 
 

Political scientist Assaf Meydani, in a column on Israeli website Ynet on Saturday, said that alongside a “victory for both Trump and Netanyahu” in Iran, the Israeli leader “will have to explain a series of failures”.
Most notable among them, according to Meydani, is Netanyahu’s “failure to end the campaign in Gaza”.
“Hamas, though battered, has not been destroyed, and ‘Swords of Iron’ has become prolonged attrition,” Meydani said, using Israel’s name for its military campaign in the Gaza Strip.
“The people of Israel are strong, but tensions are simmering.”
Israelis fearful of the threat of a nuclear Iran rallied behind Netanyahu as he led the campaign against Israel’s longtime rival. Now that the war is over, domestic and international pressure has resumed to secure an end to the fighting in Gaza.
A public opinion poll published by Israel’s Kan public broadcaster the day after the ceasefire with Iran suggested a rise in support for Netanyahu.
But while his approval ratings went up compared to previous polls, 52pc of respondents in the Kan survey still said they wanted Netanyahu — Israel’s longest-serving prime minister — out of office.
Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they wanted the Gaza campaign to end, compared to 22pc who favoured continuing the fighting.
Israeli newspaper Maariv said on Friday that its polling showed a “surge” for Netanyahu immediately after the ceasefire with Iran had “evaporated almost entirely” within days.
In the coastal hub of Tel Aviv on Saturday, thousands of people gathered to demand a ceasefire deal that would bring home the dozens of hostages still held in Gaza.
Liri Albag, who was released from captivity in January under a short-lived truce, told the crowd that Netanyahu and Trump “made brave decisions on Iran. Now make the brave decision to end the war in Gaza and bring [the hostages] home”.
Netanyahu has also faced renewed pressure from one of his political rivals, former prime minister Naftali Bennett.
Criticising the Netanyahu government’s “inability to decide” on Gaza, Bennett called for “a comprehensive agreement that includes the release of all the hostages” to end “the terrible impasse and political confusion”.
“Netanyahu must step down. He has been in power for 20 years … that’s far too long,” Bennett told Israel’s Channel 12 in an interview that aired on Saturday.
“The people want change, they want calm,” added Bennett, who is widely expected to run for office again in the next elections, scheduled for late 2026.
Gil Dickman, a prominent activist demanding action by Israel to secure the release of the hostages, said that while “the operation in Iran was a success”, Netanyahu had “failed” to “make people forget his responsibility” for failing to prevent Hamas’s unprecedented 2023 attack.
Dickman, whose cousin Carmel Gat was killed in captivity and her body retrieved from Gaza in August, told AFP that Netanyahu’s “terrible failures and the abandonment of the hostages will not be forgotten”.
Expressing “cautious optimism” after Trump’s recent remarks, Dickman said there was “apparently an opportunity to end the war”.
“We couldn’t save my cousin, but we can still save those who are still alive in Gaza. “</p><small>2025-06-30 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611703-pakistan-urges-india-to-resume-full-implementation-of-water-treaty-after-hague-courts-ruling' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges India to resume full implementation of water treaty after Hague court's ruling</strong></a><br><p>

Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the British broadcaster that the US had signalled it wants to return to the negotiating table, a week after it struck three Iranian nuclear facilities.
“We have not agreed to any date, we have not agreed to the modality,” said Takht-Ravanchi.
“Right now we are seeking an answer to this question. Are we going to see a repetition of an act of aggression while we are engaging in dialogue?”
 
 

The US needed to be “quite clear on this very important question”, he said.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he was not offering Iran anything nor talking to it “since we totally obliterated” the country’s nuclear facilities.
“I am not offering Iran anything, unlike Obama,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
The two countries were in talks over Tehran’s nuclear programme when Israel hit Iranian nuclear sites and military infrastructure earlier this month, with the US joining by bombing three nuclear sites — Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan — on June 21.
At least 935 people were killed in Iran during its 12-day war with Israel, Iranian state media reported today, nearly a week since a ceasefire took hold. “During the 12-day war waged by the Zionist regime against our country, 935 martyrs have been identified so far,” the official IRNA news agency quoted judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir as saying, adding that the death toll included 132 women and 38 children.
The deputy minister revealed to the BBC that the US had signalled it did “not want to engage in regime change” by targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Takht-Ravanchi also said Iran should still be allowed to enrich uranium.
“The level of that can be discussed, the capacity can be discussed, but to say that you should not have enrichment, you should have zero enrichment, and if you do not agree, we will bomb you, that is the law of the jungle,” he said.
Israel claims that Iran’s nuclear programme is close to producing a bomb, whereas Tehran says it is for peaceful purposes.
It is not clear yet how much damage the strikes inflicted on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which Trump had said were “totally obliterated”.
UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said Iran would probably be able to begin to produce enriched uranium “in a matter of months”.
Takht-Ravanchi said he did not know how long it would take.
Under a 2015 deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium below 3.67 per cent purity for fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.
Trump abandoned the agreement in 2018 and Iran responded by producing uranium enriched to 60 pc — above levels for civilian usage but still below weapons grade.
That material, if further refined, would theoretically be sufficient to produce more than nine nuclear bombs.</p><small>2025-06-30 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611698-sindh-seeks-suspension-of-cellular-services-on-10th-muharram' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh seeks suspension of cellular services on 10th Muharram</strong></a><br><p>

According to the PCA’s rules, a supplemental award is an additional ruling issued by a court or tribunal after its initial decision, usually to address a specific issue that wasn’t fully resolved or to clarify certain points, such as jurisdiction, competence, or interpretation of a treaty or agreement.
India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
“In a supplemental award announced on 27 June 2025, the Court of Arbitration hearing the Pakistan-India dispute over Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric projects has found that its competence remains intact, and that it has a continuing responsibility to advance these proceedings in a timely, efficient, and fair manner,” the FO said in today’s statement.
“The Court of Arbitration decided to announce this supplemental award in the wake of India’s illegal and unilateral announcement to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.”
It added that the award “vindicates Pakistan’s position that the Indus Waters Treaty remains valid and operational, and that India has no right to take unilateral action about it”.
The FO urged India to “immediately resume the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and fulfil its treaty obligations, wholly and faithfully.”
 






Pakistan earlier welcomed the decision by the PCA to issue a “Supplemental Award of Competence” in the Indus Waters case, reiterating that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
According to the government’s statement, Pakistan welcomed the PCA’s decision and stated that the court affirmed its competence despite India’s unilateral action against the IWT.
“Pakistan looks forward to receiving the court’s award on the first phase on the merits in due course following the hearing that was held in Peace Palace in The Hague in July 2024,” the statement read.
“The high priority, at this point, is that India and Pakistan find a way back to a meaningful dialogue, including on the application of the Indus Waters Treaty,” the government said, reiterating remarks made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that Pakistan was “ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism”.
The Indian Ministry for External Affairs (MEA) had “categorically rejected” the PCA’s supplemental award and stated that it did not recognise the court itself, according to Indian newspaper The Hindu.
“India has never recognised the existence in law of this so-called Court of Arbitration, and India’s position has all along been that the constitution of this so-called arbitral body is in itself a serious breach of the Indus Waters Treaty and consequently any proceedings before this forum and any award or decision taken by it are also for that reason illegal and per se void,” the ministry maintained.
According to The Hindu, the MEA said that after the Pahalgam attack, India exercised “its rights as a sovereign nation under international law” and placed the IWT in abeyance “until Pakistan credibly and irrevocably abjures its support for cross-border terrorism”. The ministry additionally described the Court of Arbitration’s latest declarations as a “charade at Pakistan’s behest”.
‘Treaty remains in force’
According to a press release from the PCA, the court found that it was not open to India to suspend the IWT or hold it in abeyance unilaterally.
“The Court first considered the terms of the Treaty (IWT), which do not provide for the unilateral ‘abeyance’ or ‘suspension’ of the Treaty; rather, according to its terms, the Treaty continues in force until terminated with the mutual consent of India and Pakistan,” the press release read.
“The Court found that the terms of the Treaty, read in light of the Treaty’s object and purpose, do not allow either Party, acting unilaterally, to hold in abeyance or suspend an ongoing dispute settlement process, given that to do so would fundamentally undermine ‘the value and efficacy of the Treaty’s compulsory third-party dispute settlement process’.”
During the court proceedings, the PCA noted that it was not open to India to unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance “regardless of how India’s position was characterised or justified under international law”.</p><small>2025-06-30 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/301619339ec44c6.png?r=162034' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921205/several-injured-as-roofs-collapse-in-separate-incidents-in-cities-across-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Several injured as roofs collapse in separate incidents in cities across Punjab</strong></a><br><p>Several people were injured on Monday in separate incidents of roofs collapsing in cities across Punjab, according to rescue officials.
Six people were injured when the roof of a house collapsed due to heavy rain near Rawalpindi’s Lal Haveli. According to Rescue spokesman Usman Gujjar, the incident occurred early morning near New Sarafa Bazaar. The injured included three women and three men.
Four of the injured were provided first aid on the spot, while two otherswere shifted to the Rawalpindi District Headquarter Hospital. Their condition is said to be out of danger.
Rawalpindi Rescue 1122 control room received a call from near Lal Haveli to inform about the collapse of the roof, after which emergency vehicles reached the spot.
According to the caller, three people were trapped in the house. However, as per the rescue staff, no one was trapped in the house.
All the injured belonged to the same house and were identified as Muhammad Ali, 19; Akbar, 45; Easy, 27; Alina, 17; Two greats, 22; and Shabnam, 18. Gujjar said Easy and Muhammad Ali were shifted to the hospital and are currently out of danger.
In Multan, several girls were injured when the roof of a madressah collapsed.
Rescue personnel reached the site of the incident upon receiving a call at the control room. Upon reaching, people at the site told them the roof of the madressah was made from TR girders which collapsed during construction.
Rescue personnel pulled out the girls trapped beneath the rubble. Four girls were given treatment on the spot, while five others were given immediate medical assistance and shifted to Nishtar Hospital.
In yet another incident, the roof of a house collapsed in Lahore’s Jain Mandir Chowk, Old Anarkali. Five injured people were shifted to Ganga Ram Hospital, and no casualties were reported in the incident which took place at 1:50am.
According to Rescue 1122, the house was considerably old, with the dilapidated roof was constructed from wooden beams and tiles. Due to continuous rain for the past three days, the roof could no longer bear the weight and collapsed.
30-day ban near Nullah Lai
Subsequently, the deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi put a strict ban on activities like swimming and bathing in Nullah Lai or its tributaries, considering the “serious” weather warnings.
In a notification issued on June 28, the deputy commissioner of Rawalpindi, Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema, enforced section 144 in Rawalpindi District due to a prediction of heavy rainfalls, flash floods and potential urban flooding in the region.
As per the notification, strict measures under Section 144 will take effect for a period of 30 days from June 28, 2025, to July 27, 2025.
Activities like swimming and bathing in Nullah Lai and its tributaries in such weather conditions pose huge risks to human life. Hence, the deputy commissioner has imposed a strict ban on any recreational activity in Nullah Lai and its tributaries.
Dr Cheema also strictly prohibited unauthorised loitering, movement or gathering near the aforementioned water bodies.
“Citizens should strictly follow measures. Legal action will be taken against those violating the ban,” says Deputy Commissioner
An order to publish the notification in all government offices, courts and public places has been placed by the Deputy Commissioner.</p><small>2025-06-30 11:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/301442197e000c4.jpg?r=144305' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921210/22-killed-11-injured-in-kp-rain-and-floods-since-june-25-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>22 killed, 11 injured in KP rain and floods since June 25: PDMA</strong></a><br><p>At least 22 people died and 11 others were injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa  in accidents related to rain, strong winds, flash floods and landslides since June 25, according to a report by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water. Authorities have warned of potential flash floods and landslides as monsoon rains continue across the province.
The PDMA released a report on the loss of life and property due to rain-related incidents in different districts of the province including Swat, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Chitral, Buner, Swabi, Kurram Charsadda, Malakand, Shangla, Lower Dir, Torghar, and South Waziristan.
According to the report, the victims include seven men, five women and 10 children, while the injured include six men, four women and one child. A total of 75 houses were damaged due to rain, of which 64 were partially and 11 completely destroyed.
Swat was the most affected district, in which 14 people were killed and six people were injured, the report added.
The PDMA instructed the district administration to provide immediate assistance to the affected families and ensure the provision of medical facilities to the injured.
The disaster management agency said rains are likely to continue till July 1. The PDMA has already issued a letter to the district administration to remain alert and take preventive measures.
Rescue operation continues in Swat River
Meanwhile, rescue officials continued a search operation on the fourth straight day in the Swat River on Monday after a group of 13 tourists went missing amid heavy rainfall and a flash flood.
Efforts are being made to recover the body of a child who is still missing since Friday, while 12 bodies were found earlier.
Rescue teams are conducting search operations in various location along the river including Swat bypass, Kanju and Brikot to locate the missing child.
Adviser to the chief minister on information in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif assured that action will be taken against those responsible for the drowning of the tourists.
Speaking to the media, the adviser said 80 people have been rescued in the flash floods. He added that the provincial government will take ‘indiscriminate’ action against encroachments along the Swat River.
Saif claimed that sending a helicopter to rescue the tourists swept away by flash floods was not possible as the air ambulance lacked equipment.
“We have an air ambulance. But according to civil aviation, pilots, and other experts, it was not possible to rescue [the tourists] from the location,” he added.
He said the air ambulance is used to transport the injured but does not have the equipment required to airlift people in rescue operations.
He further said sending the air ambulance in the inclement weather conditions and tough terrain would have caused a disaster rather than rescue the stranded people.
Saif said those demanding KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation are also responsible for the deaths in Tharparkar, Sindh.
Earlier, CM Gandapur directed his inspection team to probe into the deaths in Swat River’s flash flood. He also expressed sorrow over the tragedy and announced compensation for the deceased.
The government suspended three officials from Swat’s district administration and one from the relief rehabilitation and settlement department.
People from all walks of life took to the streets on Saturday to protest the deaths, claiming that local residents reached out to Rescue 1122, local administration and other departments but received a late response, leading to the loss of lives.
The Swat Olasi Pasoon and civil society members demonstrated at Nishat Chowk in Mingora against the delayed response of authorities to the call of stranded tourists for help.
Political activists, traders and lawyers also joined them, blaming the Swat River deaths on the negligence of the district administration and rescue officials. The protesters called for the introduction of a modern rescue system, with helicopter service, and an early flood warning system.
They also voiced concerns about the growing riverbed mining in Swat, saying that the unchecked activity has altered the natural course of the Swat River, causing environmental damage and creating dangerous conditions for residents and visitors alike.
They demanded accountability over the flood-related deaths and improvement in disaster management and safety protocols to prevent such incidents in the future.</p><small>2025-06-30 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/301234535801e1f.jpg?r=123506' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921197/countrys-june-inflation-likely-to-remain-between-3-4pc-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Country’s June inflation likely to remain between 3-4pc: finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>The finance ministry, in its monthly economic outlook report on Monday, said that the consumer price index (CPI) inflation was expected to remain in the range of 3 to 4 per cent in June.
Last month, depicting a cautious outlook towards growth in Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), the Ministry of Finance (MoF) had presented a rising trajectory for inflation during May and June.
The year-on-year consumer inflation rate in May was the highest since Dece­m­ber, indicating a rebound in inflation after months of slowdown. According to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the CPI inflation had stood at 3.46pc in May 2025 as compared to the previous year.
“Inflation is expected to remain within the range of 3.0-4.0pc for June 2025,” said the finance ministry in its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook (June 2025) report.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said that the finance ministry’s inflation projections were in line with their expectations.
“We projected the inflation to remain at 3.2pc in June, the analyst said.
The report said that the outlook for LSM in the coming months appeared to be positive, supported by encouraging trends in high-frequency indicators such as cement dispatches and automobile sales.
Sales of cars, sport utility vehicles, pickups and vans clocked in at 14,762 units in May, reflecting a rise of 35pc year-on-year and 39pc month-on-month.
However, the finance ministry also stated that LSM showed a mixed performance in April 2025, registering a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 2.3pc while contracting by 3.2pc on month-on-month (MoM) basis.
“The uptake in loans to the private sector businesses suggests rising production activities and improved investor confidence,” the report continued.
With regards to the current account surplus, the report stated that the external account position continued to improve during the July-May period of the fiscal year 2024-25 on account of rising remittances and exports.
It stated that on the external front, higher remittances and exports will continue to keep the current account in surplus for FY 2025.
 
 

In the agriculture sector, the report said that quality seeds and mechanisation are expected to boost agricultural output.
“Imports of agricultural machinery rose by 10pc, worth $69.2 million in July–Apr FY2025, indicating rising mechanisation,” the report said.
Earlier this month, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb unveiled the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25, exuding confidence that the country’s economy would be able to post growth of 2.7pc in the outgoing fiscal year for the gross domestic product (GDP).
The National Accounts Committee showed Pakistan’s GDP growth at 1.37pc for the first quarter of FY25, 1.53pc for the second, and 2.4 for the third. This implies that the economy would need to post a growth rate of 5.5pc in the three months of April-June to get to the 2.7pc figure announced by the finance minister.
The GDP growth figure, however, is still lower than 3.6pc, marking the third successive year of the government missing its targeted figure.

In April, after having tested as many as six head coaches without any positive results in key international contests during the past two years for the national team, the PCB again advertised the post.
Aaqib Javed, the last interim head coach for both formats who had failed to deliver after performing double duties as selector and coach during the past six months, had left the job following this year’s ICC Champions Trophy held in February-March.
“The Pakistan Cricket Board today announces Azhar Mahmood as the acting red-ball head coach of the Pakistan men’s team,” a PCB press release read.
 






According to the press release, the former Pakistan all-rounder will serve in this role until the conclusion of his current contract.
“A seasoned cricketing mind, Azhar Mahmood steps into the role with an impressive portfolio of experience. Having served as the assistant head coach of the national side, Azhar has long been a pivotal part of the teams strategic core,” the PCB said.
The board added that deep knowledge of the game, combined with hands-on international exposure and proven success in the English county circuit, makes him exceptionally well-suited for this position.
“His red-ball pedigree was underscored by two County Championship titles, an achievement that speaks volumes about his leadership, tactical acumen and unwavering commitment to excellence,” the press release said.
The PCB said that it was confident that under Azhar’s guidance, the red-ball squad will continue to grow in strength, discipline and performance on the global stage.
Previously, Azhar has served several stints in different coaching roles for the Green Shirts, the latest being as the national side’s head coach for the five-match Twenty20 International series against New Zealand in April of last year.</p><small>2025-06-30 10:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611674-pakistan-india-conflict-hits-shared-love-of-film-music' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-India conflict hits shared love of film, music</strong></a><br><p>

According to information from Edhi and Rescue 1122, no casualties or injuries have been reported at the building, which is located near M Suleman Mithaiwala.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that the bridge connecting two buildings at the sixth floor had collapsed, leaving residents on higher floors stranded.

He noted that the bridge was an old and dilapidated part of the building whose structure may have been weakened in the recent rains.
“The building has been vacated and declared unlivable because it might collapse any time,” Khan said.
“There were difficulties during the rescue operation as it was an old area of the city where it is difficult to commission snorkels due to the congested locality.
“Besides people living in adjoining residential buildings refused to vacate, claiming their building was safe and questioning why the need to leave,” he said.
He added that a huge crowd had gathered at the site of the incident and it was difficult to move machinery.
As soon as Rescue 1122 Central Command and Control received information of the incident, the Urban Search and Rescue Team, along with one ambulance and one disaster response vehicle reached the scene, Khan said.</p><small>2025-06-30 09:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/30140303e3ced2c.jpg?r=141144' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921206/pakistans-foreign-policy-focuses-on-geo-economics-peace-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s foreign policy focuses on geo-economics, peace: Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday stressed that Pakistan’s current foreign policy’s focus is on geo-economics, calling for the reimagination of regional cooperation within South Asia.
In recent months, Pakistan has increasingly sought to restore relations with neighbouring countries. On June 19, Pakistan, China and Bangladesh launched a trilateral cooperation mechanism, pledging to pursue “win-win cooperation” in what marked a subtle yet significant shift in South Asia’s strategic landscape. In recent months, Pakistan and Afghanistan have set out to restore their strained ties as Pakistan seeks to pursue a “secure and prosperous future” for itself, according to Dar.
Speaking at an event held to commemorate the 52nd anniversary of the Institute for Strategic Studies (ISSI), Dar stressed the significance of using foreign policy as a tool to promote the country’s economic interests, stating that enhancing trade, prompting foreign investment, attracting remittances and technology flows and forging development partnerships are among the highest priorities of the foreign ministry.
In South Asia, he noted that India’s “impulsive actions” have long thwarted the process of regional cooperation in the region and rendered SAARC dysfunctional.
The foreign minister stressed that the region instead “needs a positive lift for solidarity, mutually beneficial collaborations and shared prosperity”.
Reiterating Pakistan’s commitment towards economic diplomacy, Dar noted that Pakistan recently set up a trilateral mechanism with Bangladesh and China.
Bangladesh and Pakistan have historically shared strained relations.
 
 

He went on to say that “such interventions can be envisaged with other south asian nations as well, based on principles of common interest, mutual benefit, and win-win mutual cooperation”.
On improving relations with Afghanistan, the foreign minister recalled that Pakistan has devised a trilateral mechanism with Afghanistan with the cooperation of China, as the country seeks to “reset Pakistan and Afghanistan’s relationship on a positive trajectory”.
“Our visit to Kabul on April 19 and Pakistan, China and Afghanistan’s trilateral meeting in Beijing paved the way for a qualitative change,’ he stated, adding that Pakistan has agreed to extend CPEC to Afghanistan.
“Having made sincere efforts in Afghanistan’s interest, it is our legitimate expectation that the Afghan interim government would take all steps necessary to ensure that Afghanistan’s soil is not used for terrorism against any state, particularly Pakistan,” he added.
Dar stressed that he has always pushed for economic diplomacy.
Speaking about Pakistan’s long-standing strategic partnership with China, he said, “our all-weather strategic partnership continues to scale up to new heights”, while ties with the United States are “expanding both in scope and substance”.
“The relationship with Russia is growing into a partnership deemed vital by both sides, and we remain fruitfully engaged with the EU [European Union], Japan, and ASEAN,” Dar stated.
Pakistan is also forging collaboration with Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and the UAE in the Gulf region, he added.
Noting the shifting of the world order given recent geopolitical events, Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to charting a “forward-looking course”.
Pakistan remains committed to safeguarding its sovereignty, territorial integrity and shouldering its obligations as a responsible member of the international community, he added.
On the matter of Indian aggression against Pakistan in May this year, the foreign minister pointed out that Pakistan gave a “quid pro quo plus” response — which is the “new normal” set by Pakistan if India insists on its dangerous notion of “limited war under the nuclear threshold”.
“The outcome of this four-day war has once again underscored the reality that India can neither intimidate nor coerce Pakistan,“Dar said, urging India to “rethink its present hubrisitic and misguided policies that threaten peace and undermine security in South Asia”.
Calling India’s move to hold the Indus Water treaty in abeyance illegal in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, he vowed that “Pakistan will continue to mobilise all international and legal forums to highlight India’s violation of international law”.
 
 

Reiterating Pakistan’s support for Kashmir, he stressed, “sustainable peace in South Asia remained contingent on a just and lasting solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute”.
The foreign minister also condemned the United States’ recent attacks on Iran’s nuclear facility in the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, calling it a “violation of international law and the UN charter”. He also condemned Israel’s actions in Gaza, terming it a “stain on the collective conscience of humanity”. He reiterated Pakistan’s call for the recognition of a Palestinian state.</p><small>2025-06-30 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611675-fm-dar-slams-indias-water-terrorism-vows-to-defend-sovereignty' target='_blank'><strong>DPM Dar slams India's 'water terrorism', vows to defend sovereignty</strong></a><br><p>

It also went one further: it thought to hand those seats to the ruling coalition. Thus, for the first time in our history, nearly two dozen seats were gifted to the same parties that had lost at the polls.
To break this down further: the public’s votes were doled out to those they had voted against. The result is an unelected ‘unity’ regime being handed a two-thirds majority, the very haul it needs to mangle the Constitution in earnest.
We know this to be true because of the disaster that has been the 26th Amendment — around last fall, the coalition parties were smarting from their lack of numbers. It was only after months of cajoling or coercing opposition lawmakers that the amendment could be passed — that too as a watered-down version of an even more atrocious bill.
 
 

But after this latest verdict, the Constitutional Bench has served that Constitution on a platter to the rejected parties: they can now reshape our legal order all by themselves.
This is because the PTI’s reserved seats are what tipped the scale: to meet the magic number of 224 seats (in a 336-strong assembly), the regime, at roughly 213 altogether, needed another 11 to get over the line.
They now have those and more: up for grabs were the PTI’s 22 reserved seats, and the coalition got all of them; 14 to PML-N, 5 to PPP, and 3 to fence-sitter JUI-F.
 


In sum, amendments can pass easily now, regardless of whether their authors were voted in or not. If the Constitution Bench’s view is anything to go by, democracy is besides the point.
What are reserved seats?
Reserved seats have a long and storied past in Pakistan — they were one of founding father Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s core demands, put to British rulers as well as the Hindu majority.
And with reason: to ensure historically underrepresented groups get a say in Parliament. That’s why, of the total 70 reserved seats in the National Assembly at present, 60 have been earmarked for women; 10 for religious minorities.
Given that equal opportunity doesn’t always mean equal participation, these candidates have been shielded from the rough and tumble of a direct election. They are instead allotted seats from pre-existing party lists after the election is over, in proportion to how many general seats their party has won.
It follows that the more general seats a party wins, the more the reserves that fall in its share.
That is, until the Constitutional Bench’s ruling: having turned that formula on its head, the Court has shown it’s better to lose with the system than win against it.
Take, for example, the absurd outcomes trickling out of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: in a province the PTI swept last year, the PML-N, PPP, and JUI-F are now eyeing more seats in reserve than what they’d won in the general election. The PPP, for example, hopes to bag two reserves — despite securing just one seat in the actual polls.
Apart from women and minorities, the Constitutional Bench seems to have created a third category: losers that serve democracy’s latest derailment.
How did all of this start?
It begins, as so much of this judicial surrender does, with former Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa. More specifically, with Isa’s infamous bat symbol verdict, yanking away the PTI’s electoral symbol right before the polls. Punishment, per the Isa Court, for not holding intra-party elections.
Enough ink has been spilt over how gross that verdict was (far more, it must be said, than when a similar decision stripped the PML-N of its lion symbol before the Senate races, at the height of Justice Saqib Nisar).
So we push ahead: the logical result of the bat symbol ruling should have been that PTI candidates would have to contest the polls under a symbol other than the bat, or, worst-case scenario, individual symbols.
Which would have been penalty enough: in a land where, in the eyes of the voting public, the symbol is the party, the PTI bore a clear handicap. But the election commission, cartoonishly hostile to whichever party is out of the deep state’s favour, went one further: it ruled that no candidate could contest from the PTI platform whatsoever.
In essence, the PTI hadn’t so much as lost its symbol as it had been dissolved overnight. Not only would its members have to contest with baingans, bottles, and bajas as its symbols, they would now have to do so as independents — as if the party didn’t exist.
 
 

Trap after trap
As we now know, a historic number of PTI-backed independents made it to Parliament anyway. But even there, the election commission met them with trap after trap — whittling down their numbers as much as possible.
For starters, the PTI’s broken bat fell foul of Rule 94 of the Election Rules — that parties are entitled to reserved seats only if they are allotted a symbol.
Looking for a way out, the 80 PTI indies first thought to join sectional party Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen, which had both symbol and seat. It was hoped the boost in MWM’s numbers would help PTI claim all the reserves it was entitled to.
But for reasons still hazy — rumour has it that PTI conservatives were ill at ease with their new ally’s brand — Imran Khan’s partisans opted out of MWM. Instead, they veered into Sunni Ittehad Council, another sectional party — one that hadn’t contested the election, let alone won a seat.
This blunder opened up a second trap: the law mandates that reserved seats be allotted to parties that actually contest the polls. And since Sunni Ittehad hadn’t contested, the election commission smirked, it was ineligible for reserves.
Not that this was what the commission used to think: it had tossed the Balochistan Awami Party a reserved seat in 2019 after elections were held in the ex-tribal areas, without the party ever having contested them. When confronted, the commission shrugged: if it was wrong then, it was correct now.
And it was also correct, it ruled, to have handed PTI’s reserved seats to the parties that had lost them.
Though Sunni Ittehad would appeal the commission’s ruling, a full bench of the Peshawar High Court upheld it: they were entitled to no reserves.
Try as it might, the independents had run out of options. So they returned to the Isa Court, which had created the crisis in the first place.
‘A cascading series of errors’
Thus began a month of Sunni Ittehad Council vs Election Commission of Pakistan. After eight anguished hearings, the Isa Court announced its decision on July 12, 2024.
On the question of how many reserved seats were bound for PTI, the Court split four ways: 8-2-2-1.
 


Justices Mandokhail, Isa dissent: 11 seats
Co-signed by Justice Isa — the closest he ever came to recognising the havoc wreaked by his bat verdict — Justice Mandokhail’s dissent repaired only a fraction of the harm.
It did so by cutting the 80 PTI independents in two: the 39 that had declared themselves PTI in their election forms, and the 41 that hadn’t. “We do not agree with … the ECP declaring PTI’s 39 affiliated returned candidates as independents,” the dissent held. “The electorate voted for them in their such [sic] capacity.”
The judges directed that reserved seats be allotted to PTI in proportion to those 39. The remaining 41 stood knocked out, based on the technicality that their forms didn’t say PTI (even as they claimed the party, and the party claimed them).
All said, the dissent halved PTI’s rightful share, and handed the loser parties reserved seats well above their proportion. Per the Isa Court’s formula, the ruling regime would still walk away with a two-thirds majority it never won.
Justices Aminuddin, Afghan dissent: 0 seats
The lowest score came from Justices Aminuddin Khan and Naeem Akhter Afghan, dismissing the petitions.
In their 25-page opinion (of which nearly 17 were consumed by facts and background), the dissenters held that Sunni Ittehad was before the Court, not PTI.
And since Sunni Ittehad hadn’t contested the polls, it deserved no reserved seats. Nor did PTI, which hadn’t asked the court for relief anyway.
The dissent proved extraordinary for two reasons: it didn’t cite a single precedent, and it was the first minority opinion to urge that its own majority be disobeyed.
Justice Yahya dissents: 0–7(?) seats
Like Justices Aminuddin and Afghan, Justice Yahya also dismissed Sunni Ittehad’s petitions outright.
As for the 80 PTI claimants, he directed the election commission to revisit the notifications of a handful of the 39 that had declared themselves PTI in their election forms; specifically, the lucky few that had also provided party certificates.
But unlike Justice Mandokhail’s dissent — which had at least handed over reserved seats to PTI in proportion to those 39 — Justice Yahya kept it narrow: he held that the Court itself could not order any such allocation. To do so “would not be legally appropriate”.
Though he found its behaviour “deeply concerning”, the same election commission was left to decide the future of the assembly.
8-member majority: 22 seats
Authored by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, the majority went furthest in restoring the people’s will. It held the election commission had been wrong to pretend as if the PTI stood dissolved, even if it had lost its symbol.
It also acknowledged the chaos caused by Justice Isa’s bat verdict: issuing it on the same day that party tickets were to be submitted had “contributed in causing confusion and prejudice to PTI, its candidates, and the electorate”.
Nor could such candidates have been forced to run as independents, or been deprived of their reserved seats.
 
 

Since the electorate couldn’t be made to suffer for the commission’s unlawful acts, the Court ordered that the 22 reserved seats be returned to PTI “as an obligation of justice”. The Constitution was a covenant, Justice Shah held; one that affirmed “the supreme role of the people in shaping their destiny”.
As to Justices Isa, Mandokhail, and Yahya excluding at least 41 independents, the majority replied: “We are completely at a loss to understand the logic, other than the constraint of the circumstances, as to why a candidate of a national-level political party … would become an independent candidate by his own free will.”
To quote the majority’s Justice Munib Akhtar, a “cascading series of errors” by the commission had forced the party into such a predicament. Whether or not the judge meant it as a reference, that exact expression was first used in relation to a gory plane crash from 1985 — a metaphor for systems breaking down.
And they would break down again: the state would never implement the verdict.
Review reversal
With no small encouragement from Qazi Faez Isa, the election commission refused to budge. Even the 26th amendment was passed — and the judiciary wrecked along with it — without the PTI being returned its reserved seats.
Hence, also, the amendment’s brand-new ‘Constitutional Bench’. Having achieved much of what it was created for — allowing military trials of civilians, as well as executive interference in the appointments of Islamabad High Court judges — the bench was set for a third act: reviewing Sunni Ittehad.
If while going against all principles of review: though the Supreme Court rules mandate that a review bench must be the same as the original, five of the eight majority judges — including its author, Justice Shah — were dropped without explanation.
They were replaced by seven newcomers, most brought in by the unity regime’s court-packing plan, which had inflated the Supreme Court’s 17-judge strength to 34. For context, India has 33 judges, despite a population five times the size.
Then again, policy concerns were hardly on the executive’s mind. “Observers will ask why the authorities are suddenly worried about how many judges there are in the Supreme Court,” a Dawn editorial wondered when the packing was underway. “Does it have something to do with how the bench ruled in the reserved seats case?” Well, yes.
As it turns out, when said court-packing was alleged before the bench, one new judge did recuse himself from the proceedings — but the bench was never reconstituted. For the first time ever, a smaller bench (12 members) would review the decision of a larger bench (13 members).
 
 

And in yet another first, that bench itself was headed by its most fervent dissenter: in what seemed to be pure happenstance, the executive had already decided on Justice Aminuddin as head of the Constitutional Bench. (The only judge on the judicial commission to have voted for Justice Aminuddin had been Justice Aminuddin.)
All of which brings us to the end scene: if not obvious already, Sunni Ittehad has been reversed in review. The PTI’s haul of reserved seats has dropped from 22 back to 0; its seats again dished out to the losers. Designed for the underrepresented, they are now tools for overrepresentation.
Not only has Justice Aminuddin’s view prevailed, even the original majority’s judges have swapped sides: Justices Mazhar and Rizvi have decided against Justices Mazhar and Rizvi from last summer, and accepted a review of their own decision. The final tally stands at 10-2.
If there’s a silver lining, it comes from said two: Justices Ayesha and Abbasi, who threw out the review petitions upon arrival. Even amid the judiciary’s continuing debasement, Justice Ayesha has given cause for hope: prior to standing up for the reserved seats verdict, she struck down military trials of civilians and rejected each tier of the bogus Practice and Procedure Act.
And more hope will be required: per Sunni Ittehad’s counsel, “The journey from stealing the general election to stealing the reserved seats is complete”.
Which means more corrosion ahead: the 27th amendment is now on the horizon, its contents still in the dark. Until it is exposed, and it must be, Pakistanis wonder: what rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p><small>2025-06-30 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/301238093d09bc8.png?r=124909' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921199/bangladeshs-biggest-port-resumes-operations-as-strike-ends' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s biggest port resumes operations as strike ends</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s biggest port resumed operations on Monday after customs officials called off a strike that had disrupted the export and import of goods for around 48 hours.
Sehela Siddiqa, joint tax commissioner and secretary of the National Board of Revenue (NBR) Reform Unity Council — a platform of protesting workers — confirmed the resumption of activities at Chittagong and all other ports.
“The ports are now fully functional and operating across the country,” Siddiqa told AFP. “All employees have returned to work.”
A section of employees at the NBR, the country’s tax collection authority, has been protesting for over a month against a move by the interim government to reform the agency.
The government’s proposal includes abolishing the NBR and establishing two separate bodies to handle tax policy formulation and tax collection.
Over the weekend, some NBR staff launched what they called a “complete shutdown”, stopping work in a range of departments, including customs.
The workers resumed duties after the government threatened tough action.
 
 

The deadlock ended late Sunday night after hours of intensive negotiations between NBR staff and the Ministry of Finance, mediated by business groups.
Senior NBR official Hasan Muhammad Tarek Rikabdar said they called off the strike after positive pledges from the government.
“We welcome the government’s decision to form an advisory committee for reforms in revenue management, and we hope to contribute to the process by actively participating in it,” he told reporters on Sunday night.
Meanwhile, the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) has launched a probe against six NBR officials, including Rikabdar, for allegedly amassing illicit wealth.

The number of returnees surged in recent weeks, as Afghans reported increased deportations and pressure to leave ahead of a July 6 deadline announced by Iran in May for Afghans without documents to leave the country.
For several days last week, the number reached 30,000 per day, the IOM said.
Figures have remained around 6-7,000 in recent days, Taliban border authorities and the UN said, with the numbers expected to increase ahead of the deadline.</p><small>2025-06-30 06:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611648-sindh-reports-first-death-from-dengue-for-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh reports first death from dengue for 2025</strong></a><br><p>

CHAUDHRY Nisar Ali Khan greets Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.—APP

ISLAMABAD: Rumours of a probable political rapproachment began swirling in the federal capital on Sunday, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his estranged former party colleague, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan.
Media reports said the PM arrived at Mr Nisar’s home with an offer to rejoin the PML-N. However, it could not be ascertained whether Mr Nisar accepted the offer or not.
It is believed the prime minister met Mr Nisar with the consent of his elder brother and PML-N president, Nawaz Sharif.
 






However, a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said the PM only inquired about Mr Nisar’s health.
“They discussed the national and international situation during the meeting,” said the official press release about the meeting that took place in a “very pleasant atmosphere” where the two leaders “revived memories of the past”.

PML-N leader refutes reports, says party in no mood to bring estranged leader

Videos of the meeting showed Mr Nisar’s son also sitting with his father during the meeting.
A senior PML-N leader told Dawn the PM only met Mr Nisar to inquire about his health, as he had not been well for the past few days.
There was no truth in reports that Mr Nisar had been asked to rejoin the party and that he assured the PM he would consider the offer, said the PML-N leader, who wished not to be named. “It is just a storm in a teacup.”
The PML-N leader stated it has not been discussed at any party forum that the top leadership wanted to bring back Mr Nisar into the fold.
PM Shehbaz might have remained in touch with Mr Nisar, but the disgruntled PML-N leader has severed all connections with Mr Nawaz since a long time, said the party leader.
 
 

The PML-N leader said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif now has a significant role in the party’s decision-making and “Mr Nisar had never been in her good books”.
He said the party apparently doesn’t need Mr Nisar because another leader, Engineer Qamarul Islam, has already won the same National Assembly seat from Taxila, which was Mr Nisar’s constituency.
He said after departing PML-N, Mr Nisar had spoken harshly against the party.
“This cannot be forgotten by party leaders. Therefore, there is no desire in the party to bring Mr Nisar back,” he added.
Another source said the meeting was held in a cordial atmosphere, where the PM complained to Mr Nisar in a lighter tone, saying, “You have forgotten us.”
Mr Nisar denied the impression, saying he had been ill lately.
Sources said the PM also condoled the death of Mr Nisar’s sister, who died recently.
Once considered a trusted aide of Nawaz Sharif, he remained associated with the PML-N for 34 years. He parted ways with the party just before the 2018 general elections, following differences with the elder Sharif.

• Despite US strikes, Tehran can resume enrichment ‘in months’, IAEA warns
TEHRAN: Iran on Sunday expressed “serious doubts” that Israel will abide by a US-brokered ceasefire that ended their 12-day war, demanding that the United Nations hold Tel Aviv and Washington responsible for the conflict.
The conflict began on June 13, when Israel launched a bombing campaign targeting military commanders and scientists linked to Iran’s nuclear programme.
“We did not start the war, but we have responded to the aggressor with all our power,” Iran’s armed forces chief of staff, Abdolrahim Mousavi, was quoted as saying by state television.
“We have serious doubts over the enemy’s compliance with its commitments including the ceasefire, we are ready to respond with force.”
During the war, Iran say it arrested dozens of people it accused of spying for Israel, and also seized equipment including drones and weapons.
Iran’s parliament on Sunday voted to ban the unauthorised use of communications equipment, including tech billionaire Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite internet service, according to the official news agency IRNA.
In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Tehran has formally requested that the Security Council blame its adversaries for the war and compel them to pay for damages.
 
 

“We officially request hereby that the Security Council recognise the Israeli regime and the United States as the initiators of the act of aggression and acknowledge their subsequent responsibility, including the payment of compensation and reparations,” Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote.
Enrichment resumption
Despite US assertions that its strikes obliterated key nuclear sites, the head of the UN’s nuclear watchdog cast doubt on how effective the campaign was in permanently halting Iran’s progress.
Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran could be producing enriched uranium again within months.
“The capacities they have are there. They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that,” Grossi told CBS News.
He noted that while strikes on facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan significantly set back Iran’s abilities, its nuclear knowledge is irreversible.
“You cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have,” Mr Grossi said.
Casualties and talks
The war killed at least 627 civilians in Iran and injured 4,900, according to Iran’s health ministry.
Retaliatory missile attacks by Iran killed 28 people in Israel, Israeli authorities said.
One of the deadliest single events of the war was an Israeli strike last Monday on Tehran’s Evin prison, which Iran’s judiciary said on Sunday killed at least 71 people.
The victims included staff, guards, prisoners, and visiting relatives.
The facility is known for holding political prisoners and foreign nationals.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called the strike “unacceptable” but said two detained French nationals held at Evin for three years were not believed to have been harmed.
Iran’s prison authority said it transferred an unspecified number of inmates out of the prison after the attack.
The fighting derailed nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, a staunch ally of Israel. US president, who announced the ceasefire, has threatened further stri­kes if Iran enriches uranium to worrisome levels.
According to the IAEA, Iran enriched uranium to 60pc in 2021, far beyond the 3.67pc limit set by the 2015 nuclear deal from which the US unilaterally withdrew in 2018.
Uranium enriched to 90pc is needed to produce a nuclear weapon.

“Make the deal in Gaza, get the hostages back,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform early on Sunday.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was due to hold talks later in the day on the progress of Israel’s offensive.
A senior security official said the military will tell him the campaign is close to reaching its objectives, and warn that expanding fighting to new areas in Gaza may endanger the remaining Israeli hostages.

Trump urges end to the war; Hamas signals readiness to resume talks

But in a statement posted on X and text messages sent to many residents, the military urged people in northern parts of the enclave to head south towards the Al-Mawasi area in Khan Younis.
 
 

“The (Israeli) Defence Forces is operating with extreme force in these areas, and these military operations will escalate, intensify, and extend westward to the city centre to destroy the capabilities of terrorist organisations,” the military said.
The evacuation order covered the Jabalia area and most Gaza City districts.
Ceasefire push
The escalation comes as Arab mediators, Egypt and Qatar, backed by the United States, begin a new ceasefire effort to halt the 20-month-old conflict and secure the release of Israeli and foreign prisoners still being held by Hamas.
A Hamas official told Reuters the group had informed the mediators it was ready to resume ceasefire talks, but reaffirmed the group’s outstanding demands that any deal must end the war and secure an Israeli withdrawal from the coastal territory.
Hamas has said it is willing to free remaining prisoners in Gaza, 20 of whom are believed to still be alive, only in a deal that will end the war.
23 killed in strikes
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli air strikes and gunfire killed 23 people in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory on Sunday, including three children.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that his services “transported 23 martyrs, including several children and women” killed in various locations around the Gaza Strip.
Separately, the Israeli military said in a statement on Sunday that a 20-year-old soldier was killed “during combat in the northern Gaza Strip”.

• Announces removal of PTV fee from utility bills
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday pledged that his government would never discourage the country’s solarisation boom, as he launched the ‘Power Smart’ mobile app to empower citizens and promote transparency in electricity billing under the ‘Apna Meter, Apni Reading’ initiative.
Addressing the launch ceremony in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz emphasised the government’s support for renewable energy, calling solar power a vital and growing resource for the nation.
“The government would not discourage the solarisation boom in the country, rather we welcomed the ongoing process, which is regarded as the most inexpensive way of producing electricity in the world,” the prime minister said.
He noted that the rapid adoption of solar energy is a key trend in the country.
“Pakistan is among the few countries where the solarisation process is rapidly taking place,” he added.
 
 

The premier identified the widening gap between high electricity production capacity and lower grid consumption due to solar adop­tion as a challenge the government is actively working to address.
Power Smart App
The ‘Power Smart’ app introduced under the ‘Apna Meter Apni Reading’ initiative is designed to empower consumers by allowing them to take a photograph of their electricity meter on a specified date and upload it to the app.
The monthly bill is then generated based on the uploaded image.
If a user provides a reading on the designated due date, that reading will be prioritised over any reading taken later by a utility employee, according to a statement from the Power Division.
“This is not just a technology feature but a solid reform in governance, which truly empowers consumers,” the Power Divi­sion said.
“With this system, consumers will not only be able to keep an eye on their bill, but now they will also be the guardians of the reading process.”
Officials highlighted that the system will particularly protect subsidy-eligible consumers.
A delay or error in meter reading can push a household’s consumption just over a subsidised slab, causing bills to spike dramatically.
For example, a bill for up to 200 units is approximately Rs 2,330, but if consumption rises even slightly above that, the bill can jump to over Rs 8,000 as the subsidy is removed.
“Through this app, it will be possible to ensure that the beneficiaries benefit from their subsidy by providing timely readings,” the Power Division said.
The application, available in five languages to improve accessibility across provinces, is intended to significantly reduce complaints related to over billing and unnecessary interference.
Federal Minister for Energy Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari said the initiative aims to give the responsibility of meter reading to consumers themselves.
“Meter readers mechanism has now been handed over to consumers through the developed app,” he said, adding that overbilling had been a major issue and the government had reimbursed billions of rupees to consumers charged in this regard.
Consumers can download the app from both Google Play Store and Apple App Store, the Power Division announced on X.
 






PTV fee removal
The prime minister also announced the removal of the Pakistan Television (PTV) fee from electricity bills.
Currently, consumers are charged a Rs35 monthly PTV fee through their electricity bills.
The PTV fee was a required charge in monthly electricity bills for years, however the government decided to abolish it to help households facing rising utility costs.
Vital reforms
The prime minister also highlighted that merit-based appointments have been made in the boards of power distribution companies (Discos) and that effective steps have been taken against corruption.
“Throughout Pakistan, vital reforms are introduced in the Discos boards where merit-based appointments are made,” he said.
PM also pointed to tough negotiations with independent power producers (IPPs) that led to a reduction in electricity prices by Rs7.5 per unit.
“We implemented ref­or­ms in the power sector but have a long way to go. We brought merit-based appoi­ntments in the boards of Discos, and took strong action against the corrupt mafia,” he said.
“We settled circular debt after negotiations with banks. When global oil prices were falling, we took advantage and reduced electricity prices,” he added.
PM Shehbaz identified power theft as the biggest remaining challenge, costing the country an estimated Rs500 billion annually.
He said strong efforts are underway to curb the menace.
The prime minister concluded by emphasising the government’s commitment to further reducing power tariffs for both industrial and household consumers and called for increased public awareness about the new app.
“It is a revolutionary technology, it will benefit every consumer in every home,” he said, urging the Power Division to raise awareness among consumers about the app.

• Relief worked out based on Nepra’s tariff determination, power purchase price, reduced subsidies under IMF deal
• Regulator to hold public hearing on Tuesday to consider Centre’s application
ISLAMABAD: The government wants to reduce the electricity price for consumers across the country starting July 1, it emerged on Sunday.
The federal government has filed a petition with the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), requesting a Rs1.15 per unit reduction in the tariff.
The change would be applicable to all but lifeline domestic consumers.
The power division has advised against any change in electricity rates for the first two lifeline slabs of domestic consumers, as they were already over-subsidised.
Nepra has called a public hearing on July 1 to complete the formality before notification and application of the revised tariff.
According to the petition, the per unit rate for lifeline consumers with up to 50 units per month would remain unchanged at Rs3.95, followed by Rs7.74 for those in the 50 to 100 units range.
For all other consumers and categories, the government has sought a flat Rs1.15 per unit reduction for FY2025-26, but the relief ranges between 3 to 10 per cent depending on their respective rates at present.
For example, protected consumers in the 1 to 100 units range would now be charged at Rs10.54 per unit, instead of Rs11.69 at present, a reduction of 9.8pc.
The subsequent slab — from 101 to 200 units — in the protected category would be charged at Rs13.01 per unit instead of Rs14.16 per unit, down 8pc.
The non-protected consumers — those consuming more than 200 units — will be charged Rs23.44 instead of Rs23.59 per unit for the first 100 units, down by almost 5pc.
The reduction in rates for all other categories, including commercial, industrial, agriculture and bulk consumers would vary from 3 to 4pc but flat Rs1.15 per unit.
The average rate would come at around Rs31.60 per unit, down from about Rs32.75 per unit at present.
These rates have been worked out on the basis of Nepra’s tariff determinations for all distribution companies to meet their revenue requirements, aggregate power purchase prices in FY2025-26 and reduced subsidy allocations in the federal budget under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The Nepra had determined Rs34 per unit national average tariff for FY2025-26 against Rs35.50 per unit this year.
 
 

The proposed tariff has been worked out after incorporating about 12.9pc lower subsidy allocation in the budget at Rs1.04 trillion for FY 2025-26 against Rs1.19tr in FY2024-25.
This includes an inter-Disco tariff differential subsidy (TDS) of Rs249.14bn in FY2025-26 against Rs276bn in the outgoing year, down 10pc.
Subsidy for tariff differential to tubewells in Balochistan will be Rs4bn in 2025-26, down from Rs 9.5bn in 2024-25.
The amount of subsidies for merged districts of KP and former Fata has been reduced by over 38pc to Rs40bn for FY 2025-26 from Rs 65bn for FY2024-25.
On the other hand, subsidy allocation for K-Electric has also been scaled down by 28pc, from Rs174bn in the outgoing fiscal year to Rs125bn for next year.
Likewise, the TDS for Azad Jammu and Kashmir has also been slashed by 31.5pc from Rs108bn this year to Rs74bn.
The subsidy allocation for Pakistan Energy Resolving Fund — meant to ensure timely payments to Chin­ese investors — has been protected at Rs48bn while TDS for the tribal region has been cut by 39pc from Rs65bn to Rs40bn instead.
However, a subsidy allocation of Rs400bn has been made in the budget, slightly higher than Rs394bn in FY2025-26.
The power division said its petition was in line with the National Electricity Policy, 2021 which provided under Clause 5.6.1 that the “financial sustainability of the sector is premised on the recovery of full cost of service, to the extent feasible, through an efficient tariff structure, which ensures sufficient liquidity in the sector”.
It said the proposed tariff was in line with the Nepra-determined rates for all Discos, the socio-economic objectives and budgetary targets.
The latest uniform tariff for Discos was set by Nepra through its determination dated July 13, 2024 that had been notified on July 14.
The Power Division said it had submitted to the federal cabinet on Saturday (June 28) the proposed uniform tariff.
Accordingly, the uniform tariff, being reflective of the federal government’s economic and social policy and based on the consolidated revenue requirement approved and determined by the regulator, was anticipated to receive unchanged approval.
The Power Division said the government will also maintain a uniform consumer-end tariff for K-Electric and Discos, even after their privatisation, through direct or indirect subsidies.
Accordingly, KE applicable uniform variable charge is required to be modified to recover the revenue requirements of KE determined by the Nepra in view of the proposed targeted subsidy and cross subsidies.

“We are building a state-of-the-art highway that meets all standards of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative. Tunnels and arch bridges will keep it straight and free of dangerous curves,” Amir Shafique, general manager of the Dasu hydropower project, told reporters on Sunday. 
The construction of the alternative KKH section within the Upper Kohistan district stretching from Kamila Bazaar to Summer Nullah is progressing well and, according to Wapda, is expected to be completed by 2026. 
“As the existing KKH will be submerged by the Dasu dam reservoir, the new section will meet Chinese standards. Even in case of landslides or flooding, traffic will continue to flow smoothly at full speed,” Mr Shafique said. 
He said that the 62km alternative section was part of the proposed 279km Thakot-Raikot route under the CPEC initiative, already approved by the Chinese government. 
“On this 62km section, 15 tunnels and nine bridges will be constructed to bring it up to international standards,” Mr Shafique said. 
He added that the KKH, a symbol of Sino-Pak friendship, was previously built around mountains and streams, and the new dual carriageway section will accommodate all types of traffic with enhanced safety and efficiency. 
Mr Shafique said work was well underway on state-of-the-art centenary box arch bridges at Louter (113 metres), Ocher Nullah (362 metres), Barseen (225 metres) and Dogah (78 metres) and reached various stages of completion and were expected to be wound up next year. 
“Previously, landslides and floods used to block traffic at these points for days or even weeks, but with the new route, such disruptions will no longer hamper the smooth flow of traffic,” he added. 
“This alternative section, which will also connect to the Hazara Expressway at Thakot, will be completed in two phases,” he said.
