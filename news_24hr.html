Athletics at the Games began not with a traditional pistol’s pop, but with the sharp, unexpected report of a rifle cutting through the cool Monday morning at the NPT&SC.
It was an omen. This would be a day of raw, unvarnished struggle, where the starting command itself felt like a call to battle.
The dust from the inaugural men’s 5,000m had barely settled before the December sun perched mercilessly over the open field. It transformed the arena into a kiln, making the very air an opponent.
In the women’s 10,000 metres, the drama was medical: Athletes wilted, fainted and were stretchered away — vanquished not by rivals, but by the searing haze.
Wapda’s Maria Bibi, who would emerge the quickest in 44 minutes and 21 seconds ahead of Navy’s Mumtaz (47:10.11), later stated the obvious with exhausted clarity.
“The heat felt extreme during the race and that’s why the athletes fainted,” Maria told Dawn. It was a race of survival, where the medal was, as Maria put it, “a cherry on the top” of simply finishing.
Amidst this brutal theatre of attrition, a sight unfolded that turned struggle into spectacle, and pain into pure wonder: Nine-year-old Kainat from Sindh running with a rhythm that seemed borrowed from a breeze.
While finishing was a task for veterans, she moved as if she had been training for precisely nine years.
On the final lap, she found a sprint that would have contended in a much shorter race, crossed the line third, and laid down on the track. The stadium’s cheer wasn’t just for a medal; it was a roar of sheer, unadulterated fascination.
After the medal ceremony, the media scrum proved more daunting than 25 laps.
“What do I say? I don’t get it,” the bronze medalist sighed, shrugging, turning her palms upward in helplessness. Coaxed by her coach, she found her voice, slow and sure the second time.
“My name is Kainat Khalil and I compete in long distance running. This is my first time competing at nationals,” the shy nine-year old told Dawn.
Then, the truth she made her own. “This was not possible but I made it possible,” she parroted what her coach had gently said to her just seconds before.
What goes through a child’s mind during such an ordeal? “Just that I need to run. However much there is to run, I will.”
Asked if she enjoyed this masochistic craft, the doll-sized athlete nodded a vigorous “yes!” Her advice to her peers was timeless. “Work really, really hard to get what you want.”
Before the sweat had dried, her eyes were already set on the Karachi marathon and then an international stage, where she dreams of gold for Pakistan.
ARSHAD’S SOARING JAVELIN
In her staggering feat, one could see the raw, uncut diamond of a potential that follows in the wake of the nation’s established stars — a lineage that leads directly to the global podium where Pakistan’s javelin star, Arshad Nadeem, has already shown what such belief, paired with supreme talent, can achieve.
The Paris 2024 winner Arshad, according to everyone’s expectations, clinched the gold medal with a 81.81m throw on his third and final attempt.
“This is one of the biggest events for the youth of our country, and it’s where I began participating” Arshad told Dawn, “That’s how I began my journey. There’s plenty of athletes coming out of these games that will compete for Pakistan next year at the Commonwealth Games or Asian Games, for example. The way I make Pakistan proud when I compete abroad, so will they.”
Around Kainat, who had a whole future ahead of her, and Arshad who reached the pinnacle, there were other champions who painted a chorus of adult burdens.
The women’s 100m saw Olympian Faiqa Riaz reclaim her title as Pakistan’s fastest woman, screaming in delight after battling back the self-doubt that followed her Olympic debut.
Self-doubt had overtaken her confidence after she lost two major local championships following her Paris 2024 debut, she told Dawn after the race.
“I’ve just reclaimed my national games title and I’m immensely proud,” she vowed, a veteran rewriting her own narrative.
She bagged gold for Wapda in 11:70 while Khoula Umer Khan of HEC won silver in 12:03 and Army’s Tameen Khan settled for bronze in 12:10.In the men’s 100m, Samiullah of Wapda won gold with a hamstring pulled a month prior, his triumph laced with private struggle. “I had to pay for all of my medical expenses on my own,” Samiullah, who finished in a modest time of 10:30, revealed to Dawn.
Army’s Usman Ali (10.40) and Rashid Riaz (10.45) bagged silver and bronze medals, respectively.
In the 3000m steeplechase, Talha Saleem spoke of a year’s singular focus. “I took no day off for six months,” he told Dawn, his gold medal a product of monastic sacrifice.
Their stories — of injury, doubt, isolation and financial strain — formed the hard ground of elite sport.
From the shot put circle, Nabeela Riaz, dominating the national circuit for four years, threw a personal best of 12.48m to claim another gold for Army.
But she lamented, while talking to Dawn, competing only “once or twice a year” — a champion from a small town of Sarai Alamgir in Gujrat district pleading for more stages to prove her might.
The day’s action ended with the pole vault in fading light as US-based Noreen Hussain, leaping for Army and for the image of a Pakistan she loves, took gold with a leap of 2.90 metres.
“Just the opportunity to compete in Pakistan when you are from here is quite fascinating,” she told Dawn.
ARMY ON TOP
Medals were clinched across the city on Monday with Pakistan Army strengthening their position at the top of the table with 46 golds to Wapda’s 14.
Army swept all golds on offer in the taekwondo poomsae event.
The men’s gold medals were secured by Aqdasullah Qadeer and Mohammad Sarmad Waheed (Under 30 Pair), Shahbaz Gul and Ibrar-ul-Haq (Over 30 Pair), and Aqdas, Haris Deedar, and Ahmad Shahzad (Under 30 Team). Ameer Hamza added an Over 17 freestyle gold.
On the women’s side, Naila and Zeena Sheraz won the Under 30 Pair, while Mehrun Nisa and Urooj Bashir dominated the Over 30 Pair. Other winners included Zymal Naqvi (Over 17 Freestyle), and the army’s mixed pairs also took home gold medals across different categories.
In the shooting competition, Pakistan Olympian Gulfam Joseph won gold along with Kaleemullah and Azhar Abbas in the 50m Pistol team event for Army. Pakistan Navy’s Shahrukh Khan took gold in the category’s individual event.
Army’s Mehr Khaliq, Zikra Shoukat and Captain Aqsa Shabbir won the gold medal in the 10m Air Rifle team category while Mehr took the individual honours.
In rugby, Wapda claimed both the men’s and women’s gold medals defeating Army 19-0 and Punjab 15-0 respectively.
The fencing competition at NED University saw Naeem from Punjab clinch the gold medal in the men’s Sabre event. Ali Ahmed from the Higher Education Commission (HEC) took home the silver, while Shoaib of Sindh and Baryal from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shared the bronze.
Wapda and Army booked a final clash in the men’s tennis team event.</p><small>2025-12-08 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/082349354dbc24a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959957/saudi-arabia-qatar-sign-high-speed-rail-deal-to-link-capitals' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia, Qatar sign high-speed rail deal to link capitals</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia and Qatar on Monday signed a deal to construct a high-speed rail connecting the Gulf countries’ capitals, marking the latest sign of improved ties between the two nations that were once deeply at odds.
According to a statement in the official Saudi press, the “high-speed electric passenger railway” would connect Riyadh and Doha. The Saudi cities of Al-Hofuf and Dammam are also expected to be on the network.
The train would reach speeds exceeding 300 kilometres per hour and the trip would take roughly two hours between the two capitals. A direct flight between the cities clocks in at around 90 minutes.
The project, set to be completed in six years, expects to serve 10 million passengers per year, the statement said.







The agreement was signed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani during the latter’s visit to Riyadh.
The deal is just the latest in a series of moves marking the dramatic improvement in ties between the Gulf countries in recent years.
Saudi Arabia and its allies, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, had cut all diplomatic and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017.
The four nations accused Doha of backing radical extremists and seeking closer ties with Saudi Arabia’s arch-rival Tehran — allegations that Qatar vehemently denied.
Relations were fully restored in January 2021 after a summit in the Saudi desert city of Al Ula.
Prince Mohammed visited Doha in December 2021 for the first time since the thaw in ties, as part of a regional Gulf tour.
Since then, leaders from the two monarchies have met regularly and joined forces to back diplomatic initiatives, including calls for a ceasefire in Gaza. Riyadh also threw its support behind Qatar following Israeli strikes on Doha over the summer.</p><small>2025-12-08 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08233853279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959954/pti-says-minus-imran-formula-a-recipe-for-political-turmoil' target='_blank'><strong>PTI says ‘minus-Imran’ formula a recipe for political turmoil</strong></a><br><p>As political tensions continue to escalate in the wake of a fiery press conference by the Pakistan Army’s spokesperson targeting former prime minister Imran Khan, the PTI parliamentary party on Monday said that excluding the party founder from politics would only weaken the political system.
After the joint parliamentary party meeting held in the federal capital, the PTI leaders discussed the recent political developments concerning the former ruling party and the ban on meetings with Imran.
The meeting was attended by PTI lawmakers from both houses of parliament, including party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Barrister Ali Zafar, Ali Muhammad Khan and MNA Shahid Kattak.
Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who is the PTI nominee for the National Assembly opposition leader slot, also participated.
Barrister Syed Ali Zafar told Dawn that the meeting discussed the current political situation and recent developments, including the unannounced ban on meetings with Imran.
He said the participants of the meeting were of the opinion that Imran Khan was not a security risk, as claimed by the government and the army spokesperson.
“Khan sahab is essential for Pakistan’s stability, democracy, and future. His continued exclusion only weakens the political system and deepens national uncertainty,” he said, adding that the opposition lawmakers were united and resolute on this issue.
“We will use every constitutional, legal and parliamentary forum to secure the release of our leader. The entire parliamentary party stands firmly behind Imran Khan,” he said.
According to Barrister Zafar, the participants of the meeting demanded that they must be allowed unrestricted access to meet the party founder in jail. They were of the view that denying elected representatives and their right to meet their leader was unconstitutional, undemocratic and unacceptable.
“The solitary confinement and isolation of Bushra Bibi is a grave injustice. Subjecting a woman who has no political role to mental torture violates fundamental human rights and goes against our cultural and moral values. Such treatment is unprecedented and deeply disturbing,” he said while sharing the details of the meeting.
Barrister Zafar added that the PTI parliamentary party will remain the strongest pillar of the ongoing movement.
“The party will continue leading the democratic and constitutional struggle for justice, political freedom, and the restoration of the people’s mandate,” he said.
It may be noted that political tensions have been increasing across the country, especially after the press conference of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, who claimed that Imran was promoting a narrative against the armed forces.
He also used disparaging remarks against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, prompting the PTI to seek an apology from the army spokesperson.
On the other hand, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar stated that negotiations would not be held with the PTI and in case the government agreed to talks, it would be held in parliament and without Imran Khan.
Last week, Barrister Gohar had extended an olive branch, saying there was a need to soften tones to break the political deadlock.</p><small>2025-12-08 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08213126487b1fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959951/pakistan-did-not-benefit-from-pti-project-aqeel-malik' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan did not benefit from PTI ‘project’: Aqeel Malik</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik on Monday stated that Pakistan did not benefit from the PTI “project”, arguing that it aimed to destroy the country.
In a blistering press conference on Friday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed PTI founder and ex-premier Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
The PTI emphatically deplored the “ridiculous” remarks by the military spokesperson, saying the party founder was “not a security threat” and lamented the weakening of democracy in the country following the passage of recent constitutional amendments.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, the minister highlighted that during its tenure, the PTI government “ran a campaign against the country, writing to the IMF and lobbying US politicians”.
“Has the PTI taken a single beneficial step for Pakistan?” Malik asked, further questioning what development projects are underway in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the party is running the provincial administration.
“When it comes to sovereignty and national security, we (PML-N) have never compromised,” he added. “There is a night and day difference between the policies of the PTI and the PML-N.”
Malik pointed out that Imran himself claimed, when he was in power, that the army chief was akin to the “father of the nation” and that nobody could speak out against him.
“Look at what Imran Khan is saying on Twitter,” he added, referring to posts against Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“I can say that the youth have introspected and found that countries cannot progress on hollow words, hollow promises and pure popularity,” Malik added.
“I am not denying that there are questions around the 2024 general elections, but did Nawaz Sharif write any letters to the IMF? Was he involved in foreign lobbying?”
Later, PTI Chief Whip in the National Assembly Amir Dogar joined the programme and was asked about allegations labeling Imran a “security threat” by senior political and military leadership.
“Who is (Information Minister) Atta Tarar to say these things about us?” Dogar replied. “He is a Form 47 politician who has only 16,000 votes, and now he’s lecturing the party of the country’s legitimate leader.”
“No power can stop Imran Khan. They cannot stop us from speaking or protesting. We have endured so much over the past three years. What more can they do to us?”
Dogar then highlighted how PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif gave interviews to Indian journalists and asked whether those would be forgotten.
In response to a question about the PTI founder being called a security threat, Dogar said, “This is unfortunate and has been going on for 75 years. Fatima Jinnah, the mother of the nation, was once declared a security risk by Ayub Khan.”
He also cited the examples of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman being deemed a security threat by Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto being declared a security threat by Ziaul Haq, stating that the country’s most popular leaders have been targeted throughout Pakistan’s history.
“Where did all these people — Yahya, Ayub Khan — go? Political figures return in some way or another, because ideas never die,” Dogar stated.
“Under this hybrid system, Pakistan’s future has been imprisoned. Read the Hamoodur Rahman Commission; the situation is similar.”
Imran’s social media ‘not under’ party’s control
When questioned about Imran’s social media accounts, Dogar noted that the account is not under the party’s control, nor is it under Imran’s.
“Even today, in a parliamentary committee meeting, we agreed that messages from Imran in jail should not be disseminated like a vlogger outside the prison gates,” he said. “The party realises that we need to do whatever we can to ensure the release of our leader and workers.”
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, while talking to Dawn, said that Dogar’s statement had been misunderstood.
“He meant that there were several young members in the social media team, but after the crackdown they left the country and are now operating their accounts on their own,” he said.
Responding to a question, he said that whenever a leader or family member meets Imran Khan, the message is written on a piece of paper and then sent abroad, after which it is tweeted as it is.
“The messages are sent directly abroad and then tweeted. They are not issued through the party’s media wing, so the media wing has nothing to do with them,” he added.</p><small>2025-12-08 18:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08212857f0e92cc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959949/psca-lodges-complaint-after-website-cloned-citizens-duped-into-paying-fake-e-challan-fines' target='_blank'><strong>PSCA lodges complaint after website cloned, citizens duped into paying fake e-challan fines</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) lodged a complaint with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) to track down and take legal action against unknown suspects who cloned the authority’s official website and sent fraudulent alerts to citizens, urging them to pay fines for pending e-challans.
Separately, it wrote to the Punjab Police to trace the mobile phone numbers of the suspects, who had created the fake website and disseminated the fraudulent link.
The PSCA took action when the link, containing fraudulent pending e-challans, was sent to citizens. The link urged recipients to visit the fake website and follow the steps to pay fines.
The authority said that the website and link were not legitimate and confirmed that it was a phishing scheme.


A collage of fraudulent text messages sent to citizens, urging them to pay traffic fines.

PSCA Managing Director Ahsan Younas told Dawn that scammers use the internet for online fraud and apply various tactics to deceive citizens for financial gain.
A team of experts conducted the inquiry and found that a man in Karachi had generated “the alert message with a voice note,” Younas said.
The PSCA then launched an “awareness campaign on a large scale” on social media and alerted citizens that the authority “sends e-challan alerts from the official number 8070” only, Younas added.
It also asked citizens to be careful and verify links via the official authority’s number to avoid online fraud.
A closer look at the contents of the messages revealed the use of the word “urgent,” which the official PSCA website or messages did not use, he said, adding that the domain name of the fake website was different from the original, gop.pk.
PSCA Chief Operating Officer Mustansar Feroz said an investigation found that the mobile number used by the scammer was registered in the name of a woman with no involvement in the fraud.
He added that the suspects acquired mobile phone numbers, SIMs and CNICs of citizens from vendors, saying that this was an alarming situation.
The request submitted to the NCCIA to launch the probe also included action against the scammers for damaging the reputation of the authority, Feroz said.</p><small>2025-12-08 17:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638195-cannot-rule-out-treason-case-against-pti-founder-pms-aide' target='_blank'><strong>Cannot rule out treason case against PTI founder: PM's aide</strong></a><br><p>

The JMA reported that the epicentre of the quake was registered off the coast of Aomori at a depth of 80 kilometres at 11:15pm local time (7:15pm PKT).
On Japan’s 1-7 scale of seismic intensity, the tremor registered as an “upper 6” in Aomori prefecture — a quake strong enough to make it impossible to keep standing or move without crawling.
In such tremors, most heavy furniture can collapse and wall tiles and windowpanes are damaged in many buildings.
Tsunami warnings were issued for the prefectures of Hokkaido, Aomori and Iwate, and tsunamis from 20 to 70 cm (7 to 27 inches) high were observed at several ports, JMA said.
Japanese public broadcaster NHK World reported that a tsunami warning had been issued 10 minutes later, urging citizens along the northeast coast to evacuate. Waves were estimated to reach a height of three metres.
There have been no reports of casualties, but NHK reported that “abnormalities at nuclear power plants and other facilities in various locations” are being examined.
No irregularities were reported at nuclear power plants in the region run by Tohoku Electric Power and Hokkaido Electric Power, the utilities said. Tohoku Electric initially said thousands of households had lost power, but later lowered that number to the hundreds.
East Japan Railway suspended some services in the area, but as of 9pm PKT, there was little information on major damage from NHK.
“There is a possibility that further powerful and stronger earthquakes could occur over the next several days,” a JMA official said at a briefing.
The yen weakened against major currencies after news of the tremor, before regaining some ground.
Japan is one of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries, with a tremor occurring at least every five minutes.
Located in the “Ring of Fire” of volcanoes and oceanic trenches partly encircling the Pacific Basin, Japan accounts for about 20 per cent of the world’s earthquakes of magnitude 6.0 or greater.
The northeastern region suffered one of the country’s deadliest earthquakes on March 11, 2011, when a 9.0-magnitude tremor struck under the ocean off the coast of the northern city of Sendai.
It was the most powerful ever recorded in Japan and set off a series of massive tsunamis that devastated a wide swathe of the Pacific coastline and killed nearly 20,000 people.
The 2011 tsunami also damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, leading to a series of explosions and meltdowns in the world’s worst nuclear disaster for 25 years.</p><small>2025-12-08 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/082011032884172.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959946/dumper-truck-kills-motorcyclist-in-north-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Dumper truck kills motorcyclist in North Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>In another fatal incident involving a heavy vehicle, a dumper of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board carrying garbage struck and killed a motorcycle rider in the Nagan Chowrangi area of Karachi on Monday, according to police.
New Karachi Station House Officer (SHO) Mohammed Saud said the deceased, Hameedur Rehman, was riding a motorcycle under the Nagan bridge when the dumper crushed him to death.
People gathered at the spot where the incident occurred, caught the dumper driver, Allah Rakha, and beat him until the police arrived. The police then took the accused into custody.
The body was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
The spot did not have closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to capture the incident, the SHO said and added that the incident occurred around 11:30 am.
Eyewitnesses, present at the scene, informed the police that the motorcyclist was driving on the wrong side of the road.
Rise in heavy vehicle accidents
In recent months, Karachi has witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles such as dumpers and water tankers. Nearly 500 people lost their lives and 4,879 were injured in 2024 in road accidents resulting from various reasons, from reckless driving to construction activities, hospital data showed.
On November 4, angered citizens set a dumper truck on fire in Karachi after it killed a man and injured his wife, resulting in some people opening fire on them.
On October 12, a reckless dumper driver smashed into six vehicles, including three ambulances of the Edhi Foundation, near Merewether Clock Tower, killing a man and injuring two others. The driver, who possessed a “fake” licence, was arrested.
On August 10, two siblings were killed and their father was injured when a dumper truck ran over them on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road near Lucky One Mall. A mob then set seven trucks on fire, which sparked protests from transporters.
August 15 recorded two accidents involving heavy vehicles, including one where a speeding water tanker ran over and killed a four-year-old boy in Orangi Town.
In another accident, a young couple lost their lives when a fast-moving dumper truck hit their motorcycle in the Sultanabad area on M.T. Khan Road.</p><small>2025-12-08 16:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638167-punjab-ig-places-province-on-high-alert-directs-sweep-and-combing-operations' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab IG places province on high alert, directs sweep and combing operations</strong></a><br><p>

Addressing a ceremony at GHQ, the newly-appointed CDF emphasised the need for a formal arrangement for tri-services integration and synergy and highlighted that the armed forces have to remain aligned with new aspects of warfare, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The CDF highlighted emerging spheres in warfare, such as cyberspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, outer space, information operations, artificial intelligence and quantum computing, which Pakistan needs to keep up with.

CDF Field Marshal Munir further highlighted that the multi-domain operations carried out during the brief war with India in May have now become a textbook example and case study for future warfare.
“While addressing the officers of the tri services, [the CDF] reiterated the extraordinary courage and conviction displayed by the complete Pakistani nation, particularly the professionalism of the valiant men and women of the Armed Forces of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq,” the ISPR’s statement read, adding that he paid homage to martyrs.
State broadcaster PTV News reported that according to the CDF, all three services of the armed forces would maintain their “internal autonomy and organisational structure”.
He also emphasised that multi-domain operations must be improved under the unified armed services, in light of evolving security threats.
“The establishment of the Defence Forces Headquarters is an essential step towards this change,” Field Marshal Munir stated. “Each service will maintain its individuality for its operational readiness, [while] the Defence Forces Headquarters will integrate and coordinate the operations of the services.”
The CDF then turned his attention to India and Afghanistan, saying that the former should not “fall prey to any misconception, as Pakistan’s response will be much more swift and severe”.
“A clear message has been given to the Taliban regime that they have no option but to choose between the khawarij mischief-makers or Pakistan,” he said of Kabul.
The CDF reiterated Pakistan’s stance as a peaceful nation but warned that nobody would be allowed to test Islamabad’s territorial integrity or sovereignty
“Let everyone know that the idea of Pakistan is invincible, and its protection is ensured by the firm resolve of faithful, brave soldiers and a united nation,” Field Marshal Munir stated.
According to the ISPR, in his closing remarks, the CDF envisaged the armed forces as a “culturally futuristic, combat-ready military machine that deters aggression and enjoys [the] full confidence of the nation”.







Guard of honour
Earlier today, Field Marshal Munir was presented with a guard of honour at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi.
Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief of the Air Staff of Pakistan Air Force Zaheer Ahmad Babar were also present at the ceremony.
According to state-broadcaster PTV, the army chief was presented with the guard of honour by contingents from all three armed forces, in recognition of his elevation to the position of CDF.







On Friday, the army chief was notified as the country’s first CDF, in what is considered the most sweeping restructuring of the military command since the 1970s.
The new arrangement consolidates operational, administrative and strategic authority in a single office established through amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution under the 27th Amendment.
The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, shall appoint the chief of the army staff, who will concurrently serve as the chief of defence forces.
The amendment also abolished the office of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC), dismantling the tri-service coordination system in place since 1976 and transferring joint command integration to the CDF.
To translate the constitutional overhaul into the military’s legal framework, the government amended the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) of 1952 in the wake of the 27th Amendment.
Sub-section (i) of PAA’s Article 8A now states that “for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces […], the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
It explains that upon the issuance of the notification for the first COAS-plus-CDF, the “existing tenure of the incumbent chief of the army staff shall be deemed to have recommenced from the date of such notification”.
Under sub-section (iii) of Article 8A, the “terms and conditions” of the COAS concurrently with the CDF shall be determined by the president on the prime minister’s advice.
Field Marshal Munir was appointed army chief on Nov 29, 2022, becoming the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
In November 2024, the government brought changes to the PAA, extending the tenure for all three services chiefs from three to five years, keeping the CJCSC’s tenure unchanged at three years. The same amendments allowed the services chiefs to be reappointed and/or their tenures to be extended for up to five years, instead of up to three years.
Therefore, in line with the restructuring under the 27th Amendment, the recent PAA changes allow the president, on the prime minister’s advice, to reappoint the COAS-plus-CDF for another five years, or extend his tenure by up to five years, creating legal space for him to retain his position till December 2035.</p><small>2025-12-08 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08135205a1c3200.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959918/indonesian-president-subianto-arrives-in-islamabad-on-2-day-maiden-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesian President Subianto arrives in Islamabad on 2-day maiden visit</strong></a><br><p>Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto arrived in Islamabad on Monday on a two-day official visit at the invitation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
According to state broadcaster PTV News, the Indonesian president was received by PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari upon his arrival at the Nur Khan airbase.







In a post on X, the PM wrote that he was honoured to host the Indonesian president and noted that Islamabad and Jakarta “are bound together by a shared history, deep cultural affinity and a friendship rooted in mutual respect and solidarity“.
“Looking forward to our meaningful engagements tomorrow as we work to further strengthen this enduring partnership,” he added.







According to PTV News, children dressed in traditional attire presented flowers to Subianto upon his arrival.
“On this occasion, the Indonesian president exchanged pleasantries with the president … and the prime minister,” the broadcaster reported. “Children holding the flags of both countries extended a warm welcome to the esteemed guests. The Indonesian president was also given a 21-gun salute.”
Earlier, state-run Radio Pakistan reported that Subianto will be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising key ministers and senior officials.
Yesterday, the Foreign Office (FO) said the Indonesian leader would be in Pakistan from December 8-9 to discuss a “wide-ranging agenda” with Pakistani leaders aimed at strengthening bilateral ties and “exploring new avenues of cooperation”.
According to the FO, this is the president’s first visit to Pakistan, as the last presidential visit was by ex-president Joko Widodo in 2018.
The FO also said that the visit carried added significance as it coincided with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Indonesia.
The statement said that during his stay, President Prabowo will hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz and meet President Asif Ali Zardari. Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir will also call on Prabowo, it added.
Talks are expected to cover advancing bilateral cooperation in “trade, investment, defence, health, IT, climate, education and culture, as well as enhancing collaboration at regional and global levels”. The statement also said that several memoranda of understanding are expected to be signed during the visit.
Pakistan and Indonesia maintain strong bilateral relations rooted in shared religion and culture, with both countries cooperating in trade, education, and health.
In July, Indonesia’s Defence Minister Lt Gen (retired) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin met with Shehbaz in Islamabad, where he expressed his country’s desire to boost defence ties with Pakistan and explore areas for possible collaboration, particularly in defence production.
In June, the two countries decided to increase cooperation in areas such as vaccine production in Pakistan, the establishment of medical institutions in Indonesia, pharmaceutical development and human resource exchange.</p><small>2025-12-08 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08145937ea6ce36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959934/amid-criticism-over-delay-in-opposition-leaders-appointment-na-secretariat-seeks-details-of-pti-leader-omar-ayubs-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Amid criticism over delay in opposition leader’s appointment, NA Secretariat seeks details of PTI leader Omar Ayub’s cases</strong></a><br><p>Amid mounting criticism over the delay in the opposition leader’s appointment, the National Assembly (NA) Secretariat has sent a letter to PTI Chief Whip Malik Aamir Dogar, seeking details about the status of cases concerning PTI’s Omar Ayub.
The letter says that the provision of the details in writing is necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.
Ayub, who had been the opposition leader in the Senate until his disqualification in August by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with his conviction in the May 9 cases, had challenged his de-seating by the electoral body in the Supreme Court.
The PTI had nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai for the role following Ayub’s disqualification, but his notification remains pending.
And while NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq has maintained regarding the delay in the appointment of a new opposition leader for the house that the matter is “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against it disqualification — the PTI leader has withdrawn his plea from the SC.
The letter written to Dogar, which is dated December 5, stated that the opposition had mentioned in Parliament that Ayub’s cases were not sub judice.







“However, this fact was not conveyed to the secretariat in writing,” the letter said, requesting that the current status of the cases in which the secretariat had been made a party be communicated to it in writing for the completion of the “prescribed process of the declaration of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly”.</p><small>2025-12-08 13:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638153-7-year-old-dies-in-south-waziristan-due-to-lack-of-facilities-in-govt-hospital' target='_blank'><strong>7-year-old dies in South Waziristan due to 'lack of facilities' in govt hospital</strong></a><br><p>

Informed sources told Dawn that in the petition, Bugti cited the precarious law and order situation in the provincial capital and the suspension of internet services as the reasons for postponing the Quetta Metropolitan Corporation (QMC) elections.
He also said people have migrated due to winters, affecting voter participation.
Earlier, the Balochistan government had requested the election commission to postpone the polls, citing similar reasons stated in today’s petition. The request was turned down.
In other districts of Balochistan, local government elections were held three years ago, and the current bodies’ term would expire in nine months, the sources said.
It is worth noting that the ECP completed all preparations for holding local body elections in Quetta, and the printing of ballot papers was currently underway.
On October 6, a bench of the Balochistan High Court (BHC) rejected constitutional petitions filed by numerous individuals regarding the postponement of the elections and directed the election commissioner of Balochistan to hold the local government elections as soon as possible.
In view of the BHC orders, the election commission had started preparation for holding elections in Quetta and announced the schedule for it on November 13.
Elections would be held in 172 union councils and 641 wards of the city, with 2,710 candidates contesting the elections in Quetta district.
The previous local bodies, elected in 2015, completed their tenure on January 27, 2019. Under the Elections Act 2017, local body elections should be held within 120 days after the expiry of the term. However, the polls were held in May 2022, more than three years after the expiry of the previous term.
The delay primarily resulted from a lack of consensus among political parties over proposed amendments to the Balochistan Local Government Act (BLGA), 2010, and issues concerning the delimitation of constituencies.
The LG elections in two major districts with sizeable urban populations in the province, Quetta and Lasbela, were delayed because of issues with the delimitation of wards. While the LG elections in Lasbela were held at the end of 2022, the elections in Quetta could not be held due to pending litigation in the BHC over the delimitation of wards in the district.</p><small>2025-12-08 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08152303633d949.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959936/punjab-transporters-call-off-wheel-jam-strike-after-talks-with-provincial-govt-acceptance-of-demands' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab transporters call off wheel-jam strike after talks with provincial govt, ‘acceptance of demands’</strong></a><br><p>Transporters called off a Punjab-wide strike on Monday after talks with the provincial government representatives, with one of the participants included in the negotiations confirming to Dawn that authorities had largely agreed to transporters’ demands.
The call for the strike today, which was also observed in Islamabad, was given by transporters’ bodies primarily in protest against a new traffic ordinance that significantly increased traffic fines.
To discuss the matter, talks were held between representatives from the Punjab government, who were led by the provincial transport minister, Bilal Akbar, and a delegation of the Mutahidda Transporters’ Association’s action committee.
After the meeting, action committee member Lala Yasir told Dawn that the transporters called off the strike after the government accepted their demands.
He said that apart from the revision of the Punjab Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Ordinance 2025, the transporters also demanded an end to the registration of first information reports against drivers and owners of heavy vehicles over even minor violations of traffic laws.
According to Yasir, the government agreed that no cases would be registered against or huge fines would be imposed on drivers and vehicle owners.
Moreover, he said, the government also agreed to form committees to  review and discuss the ordinance with transporters’ representatives, and subsequently make changes to the new law in light of recommendations by the representatives of transporter associations.
A meeting between the two sides has been scheduled for tomorrow as well, he said.
Earlier, Muttahida Transport Federation of Twin Cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Chairperson Raja Muhammad Riaz told Dawn that while negotiations were under way, “the government is not interested in resolving the matter and even attempted to divide the [transporters’] association”.
Partial suspension of public transport in twin cities
In Islamabad and Rawalpindi, operations of public transport remained partially suspended earlier today as transporters observed a wheel-jam strike.
At the day’s start, lesser than usual traffic was seen on the roads in the twins cities following the call for the strike. There were also reports of school van owners joining the strike and passengers facing difficulties at main bus stands.
Pirwadhai General Bus Stand, one of the main bus terminals in Rawalpindi, also saw less than usual activity and vehicles for inter-provincial travel were seen lining the bus bays.
While public transport on main roads largely remained suspended, Qingqi rickshaws, small vans and small loading vehicles were operating in Rawalpindi’s commercial areas, including Raja Bazaar, and link roads.
The Goods Transport Association had also joined the strike, but Regional Transport Authority Secretary Asad Shirazi claimed while speaking to Dawn that goods-carrying vehicles remained operational “despite threats from associations”.
The official said the government “will facilitate the vehicles that will remain on roads”.
On the other hand, there were reports of the supply of food and essential items getting affected due to the suspension of goods transport at Grand Trunk Road — a major north-south artery that traverses the country.</p><small>2025-12-08 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/081758383e732fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959939/the-overwhelming-reality-of-entering-the-workforce-as-a-fresh-graduate' target='_blank'><strong>The overwhelming reality of entering the workforce as a fresh graduate</strong></a><br><p>Your quarter-life crisis presents itself with you having the daunting task of deciding what you want to do for the rest of your life, whether it’s your personal life or your professional one.
The crisis worsens for students who have graduated or are about to graduate soon, as the time for them to enter the workforce draws nearer.
As the job market is highly unpredictable and competitive, this turns into a period of anxiety even for those who have their lives planned out and know exactly what they want to do.
Those without direction have another battle to fight. Both demographics often face the same dilemma, which is that the entry-level salaries offered in most jobs do not live up to the expectations of young graduates or soon-to-be graduates.
Of course, there’s the debacle of insufficient entry-level jobs being available in the first place, with most companies asking for candidates with prior work experience.
Entry-level jobs in various fields are also being replaced by the advent of artificial intelligence (AI). In the context of Bangladesh, this phenomenon is not particularly widespread yet. The more pressing problem for fresh graduates is finding an entry-level job that offers a livable wage.
From an employer’s perspective, it may make sense to offer a lower salary for those immediately starting at the workplace, as there’s generally a learning curve to every job.
Not to mention, it’s widely assumed that a fresh graduate in our society has some financial support from their families as they get on their own feet. However, this is not always the case. A lot of students move to cities for higher education as well as to seek employment, which creates an added expense of solo accommodation and day-to-day costs.
There’s a fair number of students who bear the obligation to financially support their families, which means the low salary offered is more difficult for them to make do with.
Due to the nature of the job market and low entry-level salaries, graduates often find themselves straying further away from their fields for better-paying jobs.

The job market for engineering graduates is extremely competitive, so they migrate to fields that have little relevance to their degrees.

Employers also find it more lucrative to hire people with technical knowledge for a supposedly non-technical position, further intensifying an already competitive field.
Some graduates even go as far as to juggle several jobs right out of university. Those who sign up for low-paying internships or full-time jobs in their relevant fields end up doing something else on the side, leading to quick burnout and very little time for themselves.
Some graduates often continue with their tuition gigs after graduating, which adds little experience of value to their résumés for future employment.
Not to mention, the negative effects of a daily 9-to-5 are debated as it is; adding another job exerts immense pressure on the mind and body, as the added commute and extra hours are strenuous. The human body needs sufficient rest to remain productive, so stacking several jobs on top of one another is rather counterintuitive.
Although the phrase “comparison is the thief of joy” has been drilled into us since childhood, we often cannot help but evaluate our own situation with that of those around us.

Discussions about entering the workforce, starting salaries, and employment benefits end up feeling rather depressing. Inadvertently or otherwise, it also creates anxiety amongst those less fortunate than their relatively successful peers.

After a four-year degree, we often feel the need for a break, but it also feels like we’ll lag behind if we choose to take it.
It’s important to remember, however, that it’s alright to move at your own pace. Finding your footing will take time, and regardless of what the outcome is, it’s crucial not to be overwhelmed by comparison or anxiety.

Police sources told Dawn that the body of Dr Warda Mushtaq was recovered from the nearby forests of Thandiyani. Her body has now been shifted to the hospital for an autopsy.
Police also arrested a friend of the deceased and her husband in relation to the case.
Mushtaq — a doctor at the Benazir Bhutto Shaheed hospital — had been missing since Thursday, prompting her colleagues and the leaders of the Provincial Doctors Association and Grand Health Alliance to stage a demonstration and boycott hospital duties.
They had announced that if she was not found by Monday, protests would be extended to hospitals across the province.
Following the news of the death, the hospital staff staged a protest and blocked the main Karakoram Highway (KKH) road from Fawara Chowk, assailing the police for “delayed action.”
FIR
As per the first information report (FIR), filed by her father under Section 365 (kidnapping or abducting) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), Mushtaq left the hospital with the wife of a well-known Abbottabad businessman and went to Jadoon Plaza, Mandian, within the jurisdiction of Mirpur Police Station, after which all contacts with her were lost.
The FIR further detailed that Mushtaq had given her friend 67 tolas of gold for safekeeping in 2023 and went to Dubai. However, due to a lack of accommodation, she returned and demanded the return of the gold from her; however, the suspect kept evading it.
Police have initiated action against the three suspects named in the FIR, arresting Mushtaq’s friend, her husband and the deceased’s driver.
Subsequently, the suspect filed a petition with the district police officer (DPO), stating that she had returned the 67 tolas of gold to Mushtaq the day she went missing.
She further alleged that Mushtaq had “borrowed Rs8.3 million, for which she gave me five cheques”, and the two parted ways.
“I have no contact with her and I have no information about her,” she said, adding that she came to know about the incident while she was at a wedding.”
The suspects alleged that “this was a conspiracy to defame her husband, who is a businessman.”
“DPO Abbottabad should conduct an impartial inquiry into this so that the real facts can come out,” she said.
KP governor orders probe
Expressing sympathy over the death of Mushtaq, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought a report into the incident.
In a statement issued today, he termed it a “serious and unforgettable incident, vowing to punish the perpetrators.“
“As the governor, I share the grief of the doctors’ community across the province and the family of the martyred doctor over the said incident,” Kundi was quoted as saying.</p><small>2025-12-08 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08144752af668c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959933/javelin-star-arshad-nadeem-rouses-crowd-wins-gold-at-national-games' target='_blank'><strong>Javelin star Arshad Nadeem rouses crowd, wins gold at National Games</strong></a><br><p>Arshad Nadeem was the man of the hour on Monday morning when he allowed the audience to be part of history as they witnessed him launch his javelin to claim gold at the National Games.
It was not lost on the 28-year-old that the crowd of a few hundred was delighted by his very presence at the PNS Karsaz ground, his throws the cherry on the top as they got to see an Olympic champion in action before their very own eyes.
A robust lineup of track and field events crescendoed with the start of the men’s javelin, headlined by Arshad. A dozen cameramen lined the javelin sector’s periphery to get the perfect shot of Arshad in action as the heat bore down on the synthetic rubber track, the sun climbing higher in the sky to signal the advent of afternoon.
The track reverberated with the soft thud of spikes and echoes of the commentators’ effusive praise for Pakistan’s sporting hero ahead of his first throw of 78.74m that, unsurprisingly, guaranteed him the lead.
“Yeh din Arshad ka hai (this day belongs to Arshad) because he’s the Olympic record holder, and we’re honoured to have him here,” the commentators said.
Praise and appreciation were meted out in equal measure for Yasir Sultan, silver medallist at the Islamic Solidarity Games last month and the closest athlete to potentially challenge Arshad for first place.
“Make videos, take photos, keep a digital memory of this moment — that Arshad Nadeem was here to compete and you witnessed greatness with your own eyes!” the commentator’s voice boomed through the speakers.
The injury-prone athlete was speculated to throw just once, but a sense of disappointment and a thirst for satisfaction was written on his face after two throws in the late 70s.
He wanted to breach the 80m mark — hardly a feat for him when his personal best stands at 92.97m — and he willed it into existence with his third and final throw of 81.81m as he pumped his fists in the air and a smile spread across his face.
Yasir’s lone throw of 70m was enough to secure silver and give Wapda a top-two podium finish as he avoided aggravating an injury, while Army’s Abrar Ali won bronze with a 67.68m throw.
Finishing in sixth place was Arshad’s younger brother Aleem, not quite the replica of the family jewel but perhaps a work in progress to reach that level of sporting excellence.
Arshad’s coach Salman Butt was giving him advice in between throws before pivoting back to Arshad with technical advice and motivation.
Arshad was showered with well-wishes and selfies and handshakes from the end of the event till the medal ceremony.
The international superstar looked just as pleased with the local stardom he radiates everywhere he goes, his very presence at an event marking it as historic.
“If this event were happening in any other South Asian country, people would be leaning out the windows to get a glimpse of his throw,” one of the commentators said.
“We’re thankful that the Olympic record holder is here competing among the younger players and inspiring the next generation. This day will be remembered for ages to come.”</p><small>2025-12-08 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08142038c3d37e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959564/urdus-battle-between-naskh-and-nastaleeq' target='_blank'><strong>URDU’S BATTLE BETWEEN NASKH AND NASTALEEQ</strong></a><br><p>Forty-five years ago, on December 6, 1980, Dr Ishtiaq Hussain Qureishi — then chairman of the National Language Authority (now the National Language Promotion Department) — announced the creation of a computerised Nastaleeq font for Urdu publication. Although it took another year to complete, revolutionising the Urdu publishing industry, this initiative was a crucial link in the centuries-long effort to create a Nastaleeq typeface that would soothe the eyes of Urdu readers.
THE HISTORY OF NASKH AND NASTALEEQ
Nastaleeq, developed in 14th century Iran from the fusion of Naskh and Taleeq, emerged primarily as a Persian calligraphic hand — celebrated for its graceful, hanging rhythm and flowing curves. Designed to express the aesthetic elegance of Persian poetry rather than textual efficiency, it slopes diagonally and relies on rounded, overlapping ligatures that enhance beauty but hinder mechanical regularity.
In contrast, one of the earliest Arabic scripts, rooted in the eighth century CE (second century AH), Naskh, with its balanced geometry, clear proportions and uniform line structure, offers superior readability and accuracy, making it the standard script for the Quran, technical and scholarly writings, and printed books. As explained by the art historian Sheila Blair her book Islamic Calligraphy, while Naskh served functional clarity, Nastaleeq embodied artistic refinement and calligraphic sophistication.
That’s why, even within the manuscript tradition, Nastaleeq, primarily a calligraphic style used for poetry, was not the preferred script for scholarly or technical writing — scholars consistently used Naskh for their treatises, commentaries and personal notes since the 8th century CE. Even today, in Iran, the birthplace of Nastaleeq, it remains mainly an artistic hand, while Naskh is employed for most printed materials, such as books, periodicals and newspapers.

What typeface should Urdu be printed in? The two most popular typefaces, Naskh and Nastaleeq, have competed across empires, technologies and political eras for social acceptance, culminating in a typographic legacy that still shapes how millions read Urdu today. But why did Pakistan adopt the Nastaleeq font for Urdu when Arabic and Persian chose Naskh?

In the Ottoman Empire, and later the Arab world too, Naskh has always been the typographic standard. Only in the Indian Subcontinent did Nastaleeq evolve into the standard script for general Urdu publication. As Blair demonstrates, in 16th century India, Nastaleeq was still used primarily for Persian poetry, art and imperial documents, whereas Naskh dominated in scholarly and technical writings.
Over time, however, Nastaleeq became integral to the visual identity of Urdu, symbolising its literary elegance and elite aesthetic, limiting Naskh to specific religious usage, such as for the Holy Quran and other Arabic religious literature. Since the earliest Urdu writings were primarily poetic — scholarly prose developed much later — readers already associated Urdu with the Nastaleeq form.

Colonial printing and linguistic policies further reinforced this distinct visual identity, separating Urdu typographically from both Arabic and Persian traditions. Yet, Nastaleeq’s very beauty and fluidity would later pose the greatest challenge. This challenge emerged with the establishment of the modern printing press in India, resulting in the Urdu publishing industry spending almost two centuries attempting to create a suitable Nastaleeq typeface.
Quoted by the London-based typographic academic Borna Izadpanah in his research paper ‘Simplifying Urdu’, according to a 1963 bulletin by The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco), “Urdu is probably the only important language in the world which still fights shy of type-printing.”
The emergence of the modern printing press in the 14th century replaced the handwritten manuscript tradition with mass-produced printed books. Not only did it provide an easier, more efficient way to mass-produce books, but it also significantly impacted culture, politics and education, ushering in a new intellectual era in human history.
In the East, specifically in Arabic, Persian and related languages, this technology was yet to be accepted. In the West, it became the primary method of publication. Even the first attempts to publish Arabic books were made there in the 16th century, starting with Kitab Salat as-Sawai — an Arabic Christian devotional work on prescribed daily prayers and supplications, traditionally recited at specific hours of the day and night, which was commissioned by Pope Julius II and printed in 1514 in Fano or Venice.

In the mid-20th century, Naskh typefaces were widely used in academic and governmental presses. In Pakistan, Naskh became the preferred style for official and scholarly publications. Early editions of the Urdu Encyclopaedia of Islam, the Urdu Lughat [Dictionary], and several other major works were printed in Naskh, valued for its clarity and precision. The Urdu press became a vital arena where the transition from handwritten Nastaleeq to mechanical Naskh type was tested and popularised.

The Holy Quran was the second complete Arabic book to be published in movable type press, titled Alcoranus Arabice. It was printed in Venice by Paganino Paganini and his son in 1537-38. In May 2017, I travelled to Venice to study the only known copy of this edition, which survived its complete disposal before distribution. There’s a very interesting story behind this edition and its destruction. Due to the publisher’s ignorance of Arabic and lack of expertise in Arabic script and diacritics, this edition was completely unreadable, and the excessive number of errors led to the disposal of the printed copies.

Some sources state that Ottoman or Church authorities confiscated the copies and destroyed all printed copies. But after studying the mentioned copy, it was evident to me that the errors and mistakes were the main reason behind this decision. This edition not only raised many apologetic concerns about this new technology within religious circles but also demonstrated that much more effort is required to produce a suitable typographic design for Arabic. Eventually, in the 17th century, a Naskh-based typography was designed for Arabic publication in Europe.
Developed and refined over time, this typeface was designed with readability and accuracy in mind, while preserving the distinctive characteristics of the Naskh. The letters, dots, diacritics and punctuation were clear, and the whole text printed in this type was very easy to read. It was used for a long time in various publications, including the Quran.
Parallel to the movable-type press, lithography printing technology was being widely used for Arabic, Persian and Urdu publications. This was a flat-surface printing method that used chemically treated stone or metal plates to transfer handwritten text or hand-drawn images on to paper. Although this was a quite easy and economical publication method, it required the books and text to be handwritten by scribes, making it time-consuming and slow.
COLONIALISM, INDIA AND FONTS
In the 18th century, India was becoming an important centre for printing and publishing. The East India Company (EIC) also established a modern printing press in Calcutta, known as the Honourable Company Press, to meet its publishing needs.
This significant press made Calcutta a major hub of printing and the book trade. According to Majid Jalise, a specialist in Persianate book and print culture, in September 1770, Warren Hastings, the governor of the Presidency of Fort William (Bengal), appointed the orientalist, translator and typographer Charles Wilkins as supervisor of the press.
During his service at the press, Wilkins developed the first Sanskrit and Nastaleeq typeface. This was the first successful attempt to develop a practical Nastaleeq type for modern printing. A volume of Persian and Arabic Works of Sa’dee (1795) printed by him in the Company’s press resides in my library. Its typeface beautifully illustrates the calligraphic nature of Nastaleeq, yet still falls short of fully capturing the script.
Jalise writes, “His Nastaleeq typeface was a success at the time, gaining popularity not only in India but also in Britain.” It was the first time that Nastaleeq met the composing desk of the modern printing press. His efforts made Nastaleeq so popular that, even in Egypt,Ottoman governor Muhammad Ali Pasha commissioned a Persian calligrapher to create a Nastaleeq typeface for the Bulaq press (the Bulaq/Amiri press is a very important and old printing press in Egypt, established by Muhammad Ali Pasha) — thus, the second, short-lived Nastaleeq typeface was created there.

Initially used for Persian, Wilkins’ typeface was employed to print Urdu for the first time in A Grammar of the Hindoostanee Language (1796). Akhlaq-i-Hindi (1803) was the first complete Urdu book published with this typeface. However, Wilkins found it challenging and impractical for publications, and it was soon replaced by a Naskh type. The second edition of Akhlaq-i-Hindi (1868) was published in Naskh type at the same press. Although other printing presses in India used this Nastaleeq type for their publications, the Company’s press didn’t use it for long.
In the 19th century, Nawab Ghaziuddin Haider, King of Awadh, established a movable-type printing press in Lucknow that also used a Naskh typeface. A major investment was made, and large volumes of Haft Qulzum, a Persian dictionary by the Nawab himself, were printed in this press. However, it failed to gain popularity. Consequently, not only did they discontinue using this technology, but they also printed the remaining volumes in lithographic Nastaleeq.
Likewise, Naskh was employed at Sir Syed Ahmed Khan’s press, but his press also later switched to lithography. Different volumes of Haft Qulzum and Sir Syed Ahmed Khan’s works are preserved in my grandfather’s collection, and I personally find the Naskh versions more appealing, easier to read and more admirable.
Major practical efforts were made in the 20th century to create a Nastaleeq typeface for Urdu, beginning with Abul Kalam Azad’s al-Hilal. This weekly journal was initially published with a Turkish Naskh typeface modified for Urdu but, according to the journal itself, it failed to capture readers’ interest. This journal then employed a hybrid printing style, printing some pages in Naskh typeface and others in Nastaleeq lithography.

However, Azad was eager to promote Urdu in modern printing solutions. On the front page of al-Hilal, an announcement was published for five consecutive months starting from August 5, 1927, titled, “Is type printing suitable for Urdu publication? We have to decide now.” This announcement stated that no language can progress without modern printing solutions. As an example, it referred to Arabic, Persian and Turkish, mentioning that the special Urdu typeface used in al-Hilal was the most suitable and advanced typeface designed for this language.
Azad asked a very crucial question: “If this type [Naskh] is suitable for Arabic, Persian and Turkish, why is it not suitable for Urdu?” He also requested that the readers send their opinions to the journal’s office. Readers’ feedback was published weekly, which ultimately demonstrated the popularity of the hybrid Naskh and lithography-based Nastaleeq publication. Notably, the Nastaleeq type received the lowest votes. According to the professor, scholar, writer and poet Dr. Tariq Aziz, in his book Urdu Rasm ul Khat Aur Type, the results of this survey demonstrated that readers were becoming accustomed to reading Urdu in Naskh typeface.
The most extensive efforts to create a Nastaleeq font for Urdu were carried out in Hyderabad Deccan. In the 1890s, the manager of the Government Press (Matba’a-i-Sarkar-i-‘Aliyah) decided to create a new typography from scratch, under the supervision of a master calligrapher who could design an accurate and correct typeface. A detailed report presented in 1895 describes all the technical issues involved.

The primary challenge in creating a Nastaleeq type was the specific ligatures, which necessitated the design of 472 metal type pieces for individual letters and each unique connection. Naturally, having such a large number of types was impractical, and arranging them was an impossible task for a composer. This font couldn’t even pass the trial phase. But the efforts didn’t end here.
Mir Osman Ali Khan, after ascending to the throne of Hyderabad Deccan, reinitiated the project.
Rooh-i-Japan (1927) by Sir Ross Masood — who was, at that time, employed by the Hyderabad state — was published with the newly designed Nastaleeq typeface, but it ultimately ended with an official statement: “The government regrets that the Nastaleeq typeface has not proven to be commercially viable.” It officially brought the project in the Deccan to an end.
However, in the following years, several Naskh-based fonts were designed in Hyderabad. Tariq Aziz has provided a detailed study of these fonts in his book.
PAKISTAN BUCKS THE TREND
With the spread of movable-type printing across the Subcontinent, Naskh gained popularity because its upright, regular form was better suited to mechanical typesetting than the cursive, overlapping Nastaleeq script. Lithographic and, later, offset printing, however, continued to reproduce handwritten Nastaleeq, preserving its dominance in Urdu literary publishing. In the mid-20th century, Naskh typefaces were widely used in academic and governmental presses.
In Pakistan, Naskh became the preferred style for official and scholarly publications. Early editions of the Urdu Encyclopaedia of Islam, the Urdu Lughat [Dictionary], and several other major works were printed in Naskh, valued for its clarity and precision. The Urdu press became a vital arena where the transition from handwritten Nastaleeq to mechanical Naskh type was tested and popularised.
Dawn Urdu (which began soon after Independence, but only ran for a few years) was the first newspaper in Pakistan to experiment with Naskh, but readers remained attached to Nastaleeq. In 1959, the Nawa-i-Waqt group again tested public preference by printing parts of its newspaper in Naskh. The results were unexpected: most respondents favoured Naskh. However, surprisingly, Nastaleeq dominates the publishing industry, despite at least two major public surveys indicating that readers prefer the Naskh over Nastaleeq.
According to a detailed report published in the Sind Quarterly (1982, No. 1), in 1964, the Naskh Committee was appointed by Gen Ayub Khan, then president of Pakistan, to introduce Naskh script for Urdu. The report notes the president’s argument that adopting the Naskh script for Urdu writing and printing would advance Pakistan’s progress and national solidarity, spare children the burden of learning an extra script and — since Naskh is used across the Arab world, Iran, South Asia, Indonesia and Malaya — strengthen Pakistan’s brotherly ties with all Muslim countries.

But S. Ghulam Mustafa Shah, editor of the Sind Quarterly and former federal minister of education, highlighted the ongoing Naskh-Nastaleeq conflict, writing, “Hundreds and thousands of rupees were spent on the work of this committee and on preparation to introduce Naskh script for Urdu. Where all that has gone, nobody knows. Intrigues have destroyed Urdu and its status as a national language. Urdu has to be the property of the people of Pakistan and not of those whose mother tongue is Urdu, if it is to grow to the status of national language.”
In this, he’s referring to the replacement of Naskh by the Nastaleeq font under the partial patronage of the government, ignoring the practicality of Naskh and the efforts and finances invested in the adoption of it as a standard font for Urdu.
By the late 20th century, printing technology had advanced, and computers were now being used for composing. It was the right time to accomplish the centuries-long dream of a Nastaleeq typeface. Ahmed Mirza Jameel and Matlubul Hassan Syed, well-known Pakistani publishers, decided to combine the latest technology with the ancient art of calligraphy to create a computerised font that could preserve the beauty and precision of Nastaleeq.
After extensive research, they visited Monotype International in London, which had already been producing Naskh metal types for Urdu. With the company’s technical expertise and the designing and the calligraphic work of these two pioneers, after 16 years of continuous work, a Nastaleeq font was successfully developed and named Noori Nastaleeq — after Mirza’s father, the celebrated calligrapher Mirza Noor Ahmed. This was in 1981.
The system used over 20,000 precisely designed and handwritten ligatures, an unprecedented technical feat that allowed the font to reproduce the fluid, diagonal composition of handwritten Nastaleeq for the first time in printing history.
This monumental achievement marked the conclusion of a journey that had begun in the mid-18th century and was celebrated as a milestone in the history of Urdu printing. The writer and poet Aqeel Abbas Jafri, in his article in the Pakistan Chronicle in December 1980, mentions Dr Qureishi’s announcement of the creation of the Noori Nastaleeq font. He adds that the Government of Pakistan supported this project by waiving the import duty on the first machines.
Syed Muhammad Ali Anjum, owner of Izhar Sons Lahore and a senior publisher, informed me that the government at the time issued directives to print schoolbooks using this new font. According to him, the first book published with this font was the newly introduced subject Mutaleya-i-Pakistan’s textbook at his father’s press. Jang Lahore became the first newspaper to adopt Noori Nastaleeq, followed soon by others, allowing the font to dominate the Urdu publishing industry in a remarkably short period.
The project not only overcame the long-standing technical challenges of Nastaleeq — its overlapping ligatures, variable baselines and complex kerning — but also bridged the gap between art and technology. In 1995, through an agreement between Concept Software Pvt Ltd and Monotype International, the font was incorporated into the Windows-based program InPage, making Nastaleeq accessible to a wider audience.
Entering the 21st century, with rapid technological advancements, the Nastaleeq font has continued to evolve through numerous enhancements and refinements. Today, multiple digital versions of Nastaleeq are available across all major platforms. However, it is crucial to confront the dilemma of prioritising visual elegance over readability, especially in light of the needs of the modern era and the expectations of future generations.
Thus, the question raised by Azad, Gen Ayub, Ghulam Mustafa Shah and many others remains relevant and unresolved: “If Naskh is suitable for Arabic, Persian and Turkish, why is it not suitable for Urdu?”

More than two million people — nearly 10 per cent of the population — have been affected by the disaster caused by Cyclone Ditwah, the worst on the island this century.
Sri Lanka is expecting further heavy monsoon rains on Monday, topping 50 millimetres in many places, including the worst-affected central region, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said. It has also issued warnings of further landslides.
The DMC has confirmed 627 deaths, with another 190 people unaccounted for since November 27, when intense rains brought on by Cyclone Ditwah triggered landslides and floods.
The disaster management agency warned residents to “take adequate precautions to minimise damage caused by temporary localised strong winds and lightning during thundershowers”.
Army chief Lasantha Rodrigo said 38,500 security personnel had been deployed to boost recovery and clean-up operations in flood-affected and landslide-hit areas, nearly doubling the inital deployment.
“Since the disaster, security forces have been able to rescue 31,116 people who were in distress,” Rodrigo said in a pre-recorded statement.
Army spokesman Waruna Gamage said additional troops were deployed as the rescue efforts turned into a recovery operation.
“We have almost doubled the deployment as we are now engaged in rebuilding roads, bridges and also helping with the clean-up of drinking water wells contaminated with floodwaters,” Gamage told AFP.
The tea-growing central region was the hardest hit, with 471 deaths reported, according to official data.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who has described the disaster as the most challenging faced by any Sri Lankan government, last week visited affected areas to monitor relief operations.
He also unveiled a recovery package offering 10 million rupees ($33,000) for victims to buy land in safer areas and rebuild.
The government will also offer livelihood support and cash assistance to replace kitchen utensils and bedding and to buy food.
It is not yet clear how much the relief package will cost the government, which is still emerging from its worst economic meltdown in 2022, when it ran out of foreign exchange to finance even the most essential imports.
Dissanayake has said the government cannot fund the reconstruction costs alone and has appealed for foreign assistance, including from the International Monetary Fund.
More than 75,000 homes have been damaged in the disaster, including nearly 5,000 that were completely destroyed. A senior official earlier estimated recovery and reconstruction costs could reach US$7 billion.</p><small>2025-12-08 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638068-cdf-field-marshal-asim-munir-receives-guard-of-honour-at-ghq' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's response will be 'more severe' next time, CDF warns India at GHQ ceremony</strong></a><br><p>

In remarks aired on the media, he also accused the opposition party of repeatedly criticising the army and its leadership for its own political gains.
Referring to arguments by the PTI that the army should not interfere in politics, Chaudhry said, “The army is not intervening in politics. You, in order to further your own politics or to come into power by riding on someone else’s shoulders, repeatedly try to drag the army and its head into politics.
“You direct unjustified and unnecessary criticism [at them]. You level allegations without any reason,” he said.
He said the army had been serving the country and recalled that it defeated a “big power in the world” recently — an apparent reference to the conflict between Pakistan and India in May.
The state minister further said that the army took pride in its martyrs, victories and in protecting Pakistan, “and you criticise it and its head for no reason”.
“For how long will the institution remain silent? Eventually, it had to respond. The PTI pushed them to respond,” he added.
“The army and its head showed patience and overlooked [the criticism] for a very long time. But every other day, the PTI founder in his tweets and messages, and others in press conferences after meeting Imran, would make unjustified accusations and criticise.”
The state minister also alleged that the PTI never criticised India’s aggression or condemned terrorists.
“Having a soft spot for those terrorists […] and directing all criticism toward Pakistan’s institutions, Pakistan’s army and its head, warrants an answer,” he asserted.“How long can it be ignored, how long can it be overlooked?”
He further stated that the government had invited the PTI to Parliament for talks multiple times. “But we are now embarrassed to have invited these types of people for talks, those who are not worthy of it.”
Chaudhry went on to allege that Imran “came into power by riding on someone else’s shoulders”. He further said that after that only a “mentally ill patient” would consider himself a “know-it-all” and “necessary” for the country. He further alleged that Imran had come into power in 2018 with the support of the military establishment.
“And since no one is supporting you today, you are levelling criticism in an effort to blackmail the army […] so that you can compel them into supporting your rise to power again,” Chaudhry alleged.
The state minister also questioned the PTI’s performance in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the last 13 years.
“Why will the people vote for you? Why will they bring you into power again? Those who couldn’t win the by-election in Haripur, how will they succeed in polls in Lahore, Faisalabad or the rest of Pakistan?
“It is because of this that you are taking out your anger and criticising one institution and its head. This will not be tolerated now,” Chaudhry added.
The state minister warned that those raising their voice against Pakistan, its institutions and their heads would now be silenced.
“Come put on a show outside Adiala (jail), and you will be told how the law is implemented,” he said, seemingly referring to PTI’s protests outside the prison for Imran’s visitation rights.
“It cannot be that you disturb peace […], speak the language of our enemy after meeting [with Imran at the jail], and it is all tolerated.”
He further warned that in case such a scene was created outside Adiala jail, “the prisoners in the jail would have to be shifted to a place where they can stay safe”.
The minister also alleged that the KP chief minister was changed in October because the previous one, Ali Amin Gandapur, had refused to obey Imran’s directives.
He also alleged that the new CM and the KP government were being used for efforts for a “jailbreak and riots” so that Imran could “escape his punishment”.
“This will not happen now. KP’s resources will be used for KP,” he said. He further said that a Peshawar High Court order, as well as the law and Constitution, stated that “you cannot use your resources for your politics”.
He ended his talk with a warning that the response to the PTI would now match the party’s actions. “And it is clear now that nothing that will be a source of anarchy in Pakistan will be tolerated. It will not be tolerated that unjustified criticism is directed toward institutions.”
The minister’s censure is the latest in a string of admonishments directed toward the PTI from the country’s politicians, who have been rallying behind the armed forces after a fiery press conference by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaurdhry on December 5.
The press conference, where the army spokesperson assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, followed the former prime minister’s latest outburst against the military leadership, delivered last week through his sister Uzma Khan during a jail visit after weeks of restricted access.</p><small>2025-12-08 08:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08125119e93bc45.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959926/punjab-ctd-says-12-suspected-terrorists-linked-to-raw-arrested-in-operations-in-lahore-faisalabad-and-bahawalpur' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CTD says 12 suspected terrorists ‘linked to RAW’ arrested in operations in Lahore, Faisalabad and Bahawalpur</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) on Monday said it had arrested 12 suspected terrorists allegedly working for the Indian intelligence agency Research Analysis Wing (RAW) in intelligence-based operations conducted in Lahore, Faisalabad, and Bahawalpur.
According to a statement issued by the CTD spokesperson, the arrests were made in collaboration with sensitive agencies. He said security personnel recovered photos, videos, weapons, and explosives from the suspects, preventing large-scale terrorism activities in the aforementioned cities.
He said the recovered material reportedly also included images and video recordings of sensitive locations, including a religious seminary.
He said the terrorists were planning to incite “fear and religious hatred” in the province and had plans to target “places of worship and other important sites”.
The CTD spokesperson said suspects identified as Sukhdeep Singh, Azmat, Faizan, Nabil, Abrar, Usman, and Sarfaraz were arrested in Lahore. Another suspect, Danish, was arrested in Faisalabad, while four others — identified as Rajab, Hashim, Saqib, and Arif — were arrested in Bahawalpur.
He said that arrests came after the CTD investigated a Facebook account allegedly being operated from India to coordinate terrorist activities.
All of these terrorists were being funded by the Indian agency RAW, the CTD spokesperson said.
“Seven improvised explosive devices, two detonators, 102 feet of safety fuse wire, explosives, weapons, mobile phones, and cash were recovered from the possession of the terrorists,” he added.
“Cases have been registered against the terrorists and further investigation is underway,” he said.
The CTD regularly carries out operations across Pakistan to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence.
In August, Sindh’s CTD had found the involvement of RAW in the target killing of a man in Badin district and arrested six suspects in the case, who were allegedly funded by RAW.
In June, four suspected Indian agents were arrested in a raid carried out in Karachi’s Quaidabad area.</p><small>2025-12-08 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/081023499dc43a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959916/thailand-launches-air-strikes-at-cambodia-as-border-tensions-reignite' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand launches air strikes at Cambodia as border tensions reignite</strong></a><br><p>Thailand has launched air strikes along its disputed border with Cambodia, the Thai military said on Monday, after both countries accused the other of breaching a ceasefire agreement brokered by US President Donald Trump.
At least one Thai soldier has been killed and four wounded in the fresh clashes that broke out around two areas in the easternmost province of Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand’s military said in a statement, after its troops came under Cambodian fire.
“The Thai side has now begun using aircraft to strike military targets in several areas,” the statement said.

 

Cambodia’s defence ministry said in a statement that the Thai military had launched dawn attacks on its forces at two locations, following days of provocative actions, and added that Cambodian troops had not retaliated.
Thailand’s army said Cambodia’s military had fired BM-21 rockets towards Thai civilian areas, adding there were no reports of casualties.
Meanwhile, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim urged Thailand and Cambodia to exercise restraint, warning the fighting risked undoing the careful work that went into a ceasefire he helped to broker.
“We urge both sides to exercise maximum restraint, maintain open channels of communication and make full use of the mechanisms in place,” Anwar, the chair of the regional bloc ASEAN, said in a post on X.







Ceasefire breakdown
The border dispute had erupted into a five-day conflict in July, before a ceasefire deal brokered by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Trump, who also witnessed the signing of an expanded peace agreement between the two countries in Kuala Lumpur in October.
At least 48 people were killed and an estimated 300,000 temporarily displaced during the July clashes, with the neighbours exchanging rockets and heavy artillery fire.
Following a landmine blast last month that maimed one of its soldiers, Thailand said it was halting the implementation of the ceasefire pact with Cambodia.
Cambodia’s influential former longtime leader Hun Sen, father of current premier Hun Manet, said Thailand’s military were “aggressors” seeking to provoke a retaliatory response and urged Cambodian forces to exercise restraint.
“The red line for responding has already been set. I urge commanders at all levels to educate all officers and soldiers accordingly,” Hun Sen said on Facebook, without elaborating.
In Thailand, more than 385,000 civilians across four border districts are being evacuated, with over 35,000 already housed in temporary shelters, the Thai military said.
Thailand and Cambodia have for more than a century contested sovereignty at undemarcated points along their 817km land border, first mapped in 1907 by France when it ruled Cambodia as a colony.
Simmering tension has occasionally exploded into skirmishes, such as a weeklong artillery exchange in 2011, despite attempts to peacefully resolve overlapping claims.</p><small>2025-12-08 07:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638036-12-suspected-terrorists-linked-to-indian-spy-agency-raw-arrested-in-punjab-raids-ctd' target='_blank'><strong>12 suspected terrorists linked to Indian spy agency RAW arrested in Punjab raids: CTD</strong></a><br><p>

Police on Sunday resorted to tear gas shelling to prevent participants of the rally from moving towards the Red Zone via Sharea Faisal and detained 45 people, 12 of whom were later released. According to the  police, participants of the rally attacked personnel, who then responded with baton-charging and tear gas shelling.
According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, a case has now been registered against 12 named individuals arrested at the scene and “300-400” unidentified individuals.
The case has been registered under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with deadly weapon), 324 (attempted murder), 186 (obstructing public servants), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant), 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).
The complainant, Inspector Abdul Majeed Abro, said that he and other police personnel were present near the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover on Sharae Faisal at 2:30pm on Sunday when a rally, consisting of around 300-400 people on motorcycles and cars, appeared from the direction of the airport, heading toward Saddar.
“Keeping in view the ban on gatherings due to the imposition of Section 144 in the province, police personnel attempted to stop the participants of the rally,” he said.
However, the participants of the rally blocked the main thoroughfare on both sides and began pelting police with stones while also opening fire, he said.
He further said that the participants of the rally also damaged cars that were passing by, including a rescue ambulance and a police mobile, adding that they were also shouting “anti-state” slogans.
“Subsequently, police personnel, with the help of officers present on the scene, fired tear gas at the participants to prevent them from damaging property,” he said.
Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar had taken strict notice of Sunday’s incident and ordered immediate action against those involved.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn on Sunday that law enforcers had asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”.
“They allegedly pelted stones at the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he had said, adding that this prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them.
When asked why the law enforcers had blocked the road at the FTC flyover, the DIG had said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the cultural day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intended to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal.
He had said that around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached Fawara Chowk/KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants.</p><small>2025-12-08 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08092626950453d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959873/indias-new-normal-doctrine-destabilises-nuclear-south-asia-ciss' target='_blank'><strong>India’s ‘new normal’ doctrine destabilises nuclear South Asia: CISS</strong></a><br><p>• Think tank says the narrative attempts to justify unilateral strikes• Terms Western belief in India as a counter to China flawed
ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad-based think tank on Sunday warned that India’s “new normal” military doctrine is a destabilising force in nuclear-armed South Asia, saying New Delhi’s posture risks triggering a serious escalation in any future crisis.
The assessment from the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS) came during a dialogue with Australian scholars and officials, the research institute said in a media statement.
Delegates from CISS argued that India’s narrative of a “New Normal” aims to normalise escalatory actions and justify unilateral military strikes under the guise of counterterrorism.
The security doctrine, central to India’s policy since 2019 and reasserted this year, signals a shift toward conventional military responses such as Operation Sindoor to alleged cross-border attacks, the think tank said.
The approach indicates India will not be constrained by Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent, a stance that directly challenges the region’s long-standing nuclear balance, according to the CISS assessment.
Risk of miscalculation
“Institutionalising assured military retaliation in a nuclearised region is inherently destabilising,” the CISS mentioned. The think tank argued that by leveraging its conventional military advantage for limited war strategies, New Delhi raises the risk of miscalculation.
Pakistani scholars at the dialogue questioned India’s logic of blaming Pakistan for every violent incident while facing more than two dozen separatist and insurgent movements on its own territory. Using such claims as a pretext for military strikes undermines crisis stability, they maintained.
The delegation said Pakistan’s true new normal “Full Spectrum Deterrence” continues to restrain India. They noted that Pakistan wou­ld be prepared to deliver a “Quid Pro Quo Plus” response to any future Indian military action, as it did during a confrontation in May 2025.
CISS also contended that Western support for India’s military modernisation is based on a flawed assumption that New Delhi will serve mainly as a counterweight to China. The think tank argued India’s enh­anced capabilities remain largely directed toward Pakistan.
Australian experts, in turn, outli­ned their country’s rationale for joi­ning alliances like AUKUS and the Quad.
The Australian delegation stressed that AUKUS is a trilateral partnership and there are no plans for expansion. While policy debates occasionally reference possible future members such as Norway, South Korea, Can­ada or India, they said such prospects remain limited. They also emphasised that the alliance adheres to nonproliferation standards fully aligned with IAEA safeguards.
Participants included Justin Burke of the Australian National Uni­versity’s National Security Col­lege; Mike Hughes of the Aust­r­alian Strategic Policy Institute; officials from the Australian High Com­m­i­ssion in Islamabad; and CISS Exe­cutive Director Ali Sarwar Naqvi.

According to sources close to the ruling family, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Punjab Chief Min­ister Maryam Nawaz and PML-N President Nawaz Sharif had a detailed discussion on the current political situation.
During the meeting, which lasted more than two hours, they reviewed the PTI’s likely strategy in the coming days and how the federal and Punjab governments could respond effectively.
The conversation also touched upon Imran Khan’s status within his party and whether the PTI leadership would continue relying on guidance from its incarcerated founder, or distance itself from him following the establishment’s strongest-ever reaction against the former prime minister.
Sources said the Sharifs also examined the establishment’s perspective on various political and economic measures being undertaken by the PML-N governments.
They added that Maryam Nawaz briefed her father and uncle on the recently prepared performance review of the Punjab cabinet, highlighting key shortcomings identified in the audit.
According to the sou­rces, the chief minister also expressed her intention to reshuffle her cabinet and induct new ministers to improve the government’s overall functioning.

ISLAMABAD: The government’s expenditure on civil administration and pension payouts has continually climbed over the last five years, with the first quarter of the current fiscal year seeing a double-digit increase despite a strict official austerity policy and an aggressive downsizing exercise.
Fiscal data released by the Ministry of Finance indicates a 13pc increase in ‘Running of the Civil Government’ expenditure in the first quarter, which runs from July to September. The costs rose to Rs161.2bn in the current fiscal year, compared to Rs142.5bn during the same period last year.
This rise in expenses comes as the government claims to be tightening its belt through significant staffing and structural reforms.
The increase is notable as the government abolished more than 150,000 posts last year and has been “rightsizing” various ministries, divisions and their subordinate departments through mergers and closures.
Additionally, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb anno­unced about a week ago that the government had abolished an additional 54,000 vacant posts across various departments, resulting in an annual saving of more than Rs56bn to the exchequer.
He added that the process of merging and restructuring several ministries and divisions was also underway as part of fiscal reforms.
The trend of rising costs is not new. Civil government expenses in the first quarter of last year saw an 8pc increase compared to the same period of FY24, which itself had posted a 29pc surge over FY23.
The data showed that the running of civil government expenses has jumped by almost 80pc since the first quarter of FY22 when the expenditure amounted to Rs89.5bn. The full-year bill for running the civil government had crossed Rs892bn.
Similarly, pension expenditures continue to climb. In the first quarter of the current year, pension payments amounted to Rs249.5bn, a 10pc increase over the Rs223bn spent in the comparable period of FY25.
A year earlier, pension payments had witnessed a 9pc increase. Over the past five years, pension expenditure has surged by almost 125pc, up from the Rs111bn reported for the first quarter of FY22. The total pension bill at the conclusion of the last fiscal year reached Rs911bn.
In contrast to the rigid and monthly due expenses of pensions and civil administration, the official data showed large var­iations in subsidy payments, which the government can postpone. These payments saw a six-time surge in the first quarter of the current year, reaching Rs120bn compared to Rs20bn last year.
The government had disbursed only Rs2.5bn for subsidies in the first quarter of FY24, while payments in the preceding two years were Rs93bn and Rs74bn, respectively. The subsidy bill last year reached Rs1.298 trillion.
On paper, the government has adhered to an austerity policy across all sectors since 2021, driven by stringent fiscal oversight mandated by successive IMF programmes.
In June, the government ann­ounced the continuation of austerity measures for FY26, which included a complete ban on the purchase of all types of vehicles, the procurement of machinery and equipment, and the creation of new posts throughout the federal government.
However, various ministries, divisions and entities kept on fi­n­d­ing ways to bypass such banks on one pretext or another.

These institutions have placed Pakistan and Bangladesh in the ‘high-risk’ category in the wake of tougher Home Office rules and rising concerns over alleged visa abuse. Lower-fee universities in particular are tightening enrolment to protect their licence to sponsor international students, given the sharply reduced tolerance for visa refusals. Visa refusal rates for Pakistani applicants currently stand at 18pc — much above the new 5pc threshold. Reports also show a surge in asylum claims lodged by students after they enter the UK on lawful visas. Pakistani nationals now account for one in 10 of all asylum applications, with over 5,800 switching from student visas alone — more than India and Bangladesh combined. Overall, nearly 10,000 Pakistanis last year entered on study, work or visitor visas before seeking asylum.
This trend reflects the economic, social and political pressures pushing Pakistanis to look for ways out. It also shows how the UK is responding to migration fears and is tightening migration routes as its own domestic politics becomes hyper focused on immigration. Hence, the latest move is not surprising. But it is disappointing for those who have legitimate academic goals. Many universities, now off-limits, charge lower fees than other institutions, so the blow is heaviest for students with fewer resources. Education advisers have rightly called the situation heartbreaking. Misuse of student visas by some should not become a barrier for all. Pakistan must engage with the UK to address concerns over recruitment practices and ensure that credible applicants are not unfairly punished. For now, students should diversify their plans, looking towards Europe or other UK universities. However, Britain’s message is clear: the study visa is not to be used as a backdoor to settlement. Pakistan must ensure its students are not caught in the fallout of others’ desperation.
