“The amount would be reflected in SBP’s foreign exchange reserves for the week ending on Dec 12,” the central bank said in a statement posted on social media platform X.







In a statement, the central bank shared that the IMF Executive Board had “approved disbursement of first tranche of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 154m under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).”
“Accordingly, SBP has received SDR 914m (equivalent to about $1.2bn) under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and RSF in value Dec 10 from the IMF,” it added.
It recalled that the “IMF Executive Board completed second review under the EFF in its meeting held on Dec 8, and approved disbursement of SDR 760m for Pakistan.”
On Monday, the IMF approved the fresh disbursement to Pakistan under its dual-track bailout — the 37-month EFF and the climate-focused RSF.
The decision came after the IMF Exec­utive Board convened in Washington.
The board had noted that Pakistan’s fiscal performance was strong, with a primary surplus of 1.3 per cent of GDP achieved in FY25, in line with programme targets.
It also observed that “inflation has increased, reflecting the impact of the floods on food prices, but this is expected to be temporary”.
In October, the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan on its loan programmes after extensive talks in Karachi, Islamabad and Washington from September 24 to October 8.
With this tranche, total disbursements to Pakistan under the EFF and RSF now stand at approximately $3.3bn, supporting both macroeconomic stabilisation and long-term structural reforms for climate resilience.
Earlier, in its latest projections for Pakistan, the lending body suggested that the immediate risk of economic free fall had eased, but cautioned that the country remained locked into a narrow stabilisation path marked by weak growth, heavy debt and limited relief for households.</p><small>2025-12-11 07:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11095044d870d1b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960488/pakistan-says-terrorism-emanating-from-afghan-soil-poses-gravest-threat-to-national-security-sovereignty' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan says terrorism emanating from Afghan soil poses ‘gravest threat’ to national security, sovereignty</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday that terrorism emanating from Afghan soil posed the “gravest threat” to the country’s national security and sovereignty.
Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad made the remarks while addressing a debate in New York on the situation in Afghanistan.
In his statement, he highlighted Islamabad’s concerns about security, humanitarian, and socio-economic challenges emerging from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Briefing the UNSC on Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, the ambassador said Pakistan had maintained consistent engagement with the Afghan Taliban, conducting high-level visits, facilitating humanitarian relief, supporting the transportation of goods, and announcing trade and transit concessions.
Despite these efforts, he said, threats persisted, creating mounting security challenges for Pakistan and the wider region.



“Afghanistan is once again a safe sanctuary for terrorist groups and proxies, with devastating consequences and mounting security challenges for its immediate neighbours, particularly Pakistan, and the region and beyond.”
He said Afghan authorities were failing to take concrete measures against terrorist groups, adding that Pakistan had witnessed a surge in militant attacks that were planned, financed and orchestrated using Afghan soil under their watch.
“Just this year alone, we have lost close to 1,200 lives to terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Since 2022, more than 214 Afghan terrorists, including suicide bombers, have been neutralised in Pakistan during counter-terror operations,” he said.
“Terrorism emanating from Afghan soil poses the gravest threat to Pakistan’s national security and sovereignty,” the envoy said, adding that terrorist groups, including the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Al-Qaeda, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), and the Majeed Brigade, enjoyed “safe haven” in the neighbouring country.
He said Pakistan had successfully thwarted multiple infiltration attempts by TTP and BLA terrorists from across Afghanistan, confiscating caches of military grade equipment left behind by international forces in Afghanistan.
“These efforts have had a human cost, with huge sacrifices by our valiant security forces and civilians,” he said.
“Elements within the Taliban rank and file are supporting these terrorist groups and allowing them safe passage to operate with impunity and free will. There is also credible evidence of collaboration among these terrorist groups through joint training, illicit weapons trade, refuge to terrorists, and coordinated attacks against Pakistan using the Afghan soil,” he said.
“And not surprisingly, one detractor in the region, opportunist, and spoiler, has moved fast to intensify its sponsorship of terrorist activity through material, technical and financial support, to terrorist groups and proxies active against Pakistan from Afghan soil,” he added, without taking any names.
Ambassador Ahmad also urged the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to strengthen efforts to prevent illicit arms trade and provide an objective assessment of border security, emphasising that cross-border terrorism was the primary issue behind border clashes between the two countries.
He also highlighted Pakistan’s efforts to engage with the Afghan Taliban, including recent talks held in Doha and Istanbul.
He expressed gratitude to the governments of Qatar and Türkiye for facilitating dialogue with the Afghan Taliban and called for concrete, verifiable action by them against terrorist groups.
He warned that failure to do so would result in Pakistan taking “all necessary defensive measures” to protect its citizens and sovereignty.
Ambassador Ahmad also highlighted Pakistan’s decades-long role in hosting Afghan refugees. He told the UNSC that millions of Afghans had been welcomed over the past four decades despite Pakistan’s own constraints.
“With conflict now ended, we expect that Afghans will now return to their country of origin in a dignified, phased and orderly manner,” he said. The envoy said Pakistan would continue to extend all possible assistance to the Afghans but also called on the international community to “shoulder its responsibility”.
He also noted Pakistan’s visa regime, saying that it allowed Afghans to enter the country legally for purposes such as education, health, business, and family visits. He highlighted that more than 536,000 medical visas have been issued since September 2023.
The envoy stressed that Pakistan sought a peaceful, stable, interconnected, and prosperous Afghanistan — one that was at peace with itself and its neighbours.
He cautioned that bilateral engagements should not be used by countries with negative agendas to destabilise the Pakistan–Afghanistan border or the wider region.
“No country desires peace and stability in Afghanistan more than Pakistan. No country has suffered from the consequences of decades of conflict more than Pakistan,” he said.
Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to work for peace in Afghanistan, emphasising that lasting stability could only be achieved through sincere dialogue with the Afghan Taliban, respect for international obligations, and strengthened regional cooperation.
He called upon the international community to remain engaged, provide humanitarian support, and assist in fostering a security environment conducive to long-term development and prosperity in Afghanistan and the region.
Recent reporting provides a stark backdrop to Pakistan’s warnings at the UNSC.
A report by US watchdog Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has confirmed that billions of dollars’ worth of American-supplied weapons, military equipment, and security infrastructure left behind during the 2021 US withdrawal now form the backbone of the Afghan Taliban’s security apparatus.
Parallel assessments by UN monitoring teams and investigative reporting by the Washington Post indicate that some of these weapons have already reached the TTP, strengthening a group responsible for escalating attacks inside Pakistan.
A UN panel also reported that the Taliban continue to provide logistical and operational support to the TTP, reinforcing Islamabad’s concerns about safe havens for terrorists and cross-border militancy.</p><small>2025-12-11 07:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11112238e5b313a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960492/health-minister-launches-last-nationwide-polio-campaign-of-2025-notes-declines-in-cases-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Health minister launches last nationwide polio campaign of 2025, notes declines in cases in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Health Minister Mustafa Kamal on Thursday launched the last nationwide polio campaign of 2025 aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children against the crippling disease, noting that the number of cases in the country had reduced in comparison to last year.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases, with the highest number of cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 19.
Launching the last polio campaign of the year — set to run from December 15 to December 2 — at a ceremony in Islamabad, the minister noted the decline in cases in comparison to 2024, saying, “We have succeeded in reducing polio cases in the country.”
He recalled that Pakistan had recorded 74 cases in 2024; however, this year the country only saw 30 cases.
The minister said that the virus was “present in more than half of the country,” including Peshawar, Karachi, and Lahore.
He stated that the government remained “determined to eliminate the virus in the country by year’s end and called on all parties to “play their part”.
Kamal noted that 19 out of 30 cases reported this year were from KP, out of which 16 were from the south of the province. He said that 200,000 children in south KP had not been immunised against polio due to the “law and order situation”.
The minister further said more than 400,000 polio workers would be involved in the latest campaign, calling on parents to cooperate with polio teams.
Kamal also called on scholars to play their role in polio campaigns. The minister also urged citizens to “not fall for any negative propaganda” against the drive.
He also called on elected representatives to “administer polio drops to people from their families and make a video to further encourage people”.
Anti-polio drive to be held from Dec 15-21
Meanwhile, the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) said that the polio campaign would be held from Dec 15-21, to vaccinate around 45.5m children.
In a statement, the body said, “More than 400,000 frontline polio workers will take part in the campaign”.
It said more than 23m children will be immunised in Punjab, over 16m in Sindh, more than 7.2m in KP and over 2.6m in Balochistan. In Islamabad, the campaign aims to vaccinate over 400,000 children.
The NEOC urged parents to cooperate with polio workers and ensure the vaccination of their children.
On October 21, a case of wild poliovirus was confirmed in KP’s Torghar, taking the tally of cases for this year to 30.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-12-11 07:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/111103430176930.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960489/fighting-rages-at-cambodia-thailand-border-ahead-of-expected-trump-call' target='_blank'><strong>Fighting rages at Cambodia-Thailand border ahead of expected Trump call</strong></a><br><p>Renewed fighting raged at the border of Cambodia and Thailand on Thursday, with combat heard near centuries-old temples, ahead of US President Donald Trump’s planned phone call to the two nations’ leaders.
At least 15 people, including Thai soldiers and Cambodian civilians, have been killed in the reignited border conflict, officials said.
More than half a million people, mostly in Thailand, have fled border areas near where jets, tanks and drones have waged battle.
The Southeast Asian nations dispute the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) frontier, where both sides claim a smattering of historic temples.
This week’s clashes are the deadliest since five days of fighting in July that killed dozens before a shaky truce was agreed, following intervention by Trump.
The US president said he expected to speak on Thursday with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia to demand a halt to their renewed clashes.
“I think I’m scheduled to speak to them tomorrow,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.
Both sides blame the other for reigniting the conflict, which has expanded to five provinces of both Thailand and Cambodia, according to an AFP tally of official accounts.
In Thailand’s northeast on Thursday morning, hundreds of evacuated families woke up inside a university building in Surin city that has been transformed into a shelter.
A few older women pound chilli paste while volunteers stir big pots of food.
Nearby, 61-year-old farmer Rat, who declined to give her last name, said she had to leave her home before she could plant a cassava crop this season, fleeing with her family of eight.
“I just want to go home and farm again,” she told AFP.
“Every time the fighting starts, it feels like life gets paused all over again.”
Cultural heritage
AFP journalists in Cambodia’s northwestern Oddar Meanchey province heard the blasts of incoming artillery from the direction of disputed temples since dawn on Wednesday.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said in a statement that Thai forces initiated an attack early on Thursday morning in the province, “shelling into Khnar Temple area”.
On the other side of the border, the Thai military announced an overnight curfew in parts of Sa Kaeo beginning Wednesday night.
The Thai army said on Wednesday that Cambodian forces fired rockets early that day that landed in the vicinity of the Phanom Dong Rak Hospital in Surin province — to the north of Sa Kaeo, and which was struck in the fighting in July.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said more than 101,000 people have been evacuated, while in Thailand, authorities said more than 400,000 civilians have taken shelter elsewhere.
The United States, China and Malaysia, as chair of the regional bloc ASEAN, brokered a ceasefire back in July.
In October, Trump backed a follow-on joint declaration, touting new trade deals with Thailand and Cambodia after they agreed to prolong their truce.
But Thailand suspended the agreement the following month.
The United Nations cultural agency called on Wednesday for “protection of the region’s cultural heritage in all its forms” amid the ongoing fighting.
“Unesco has communicated to all parties concerned the geographical coordinates of sites on the World Heritage List as well as those of national significance, in order to avoid any potential damage,” it said in a statement.
In 2008, military clashes between Thailand and Cambodia erupted over a patch of land next to the 900-year-old temple, located on the border.
Sporadic violence from 2008 to 2011 led to the deaths of two dozen people and displacement of tens of thousands.</p><small>2025-12-11 06:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638670-pti-told-no-more-tolerance-for-anti-army-campaigns' target='_blank'><strong>PTI told 'no more tolerance for anti-army campaigns'</strong></a><br><p>

Machado, who won the Nobel for challenging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s grip on power, did not arrive in Norway in time for Wednesday’s prize ceremony.
Her daughter collected the prestigious award on her behalf, and delivered a blistering acceptance speech in her stead.
The Venezuelan democracy campaigner made it to the Norwegian capital hours later, and went straight to see her family, Nobel Prize Committee Chair Jorgen Watne Frydnes said.
From the balcony of the Grand Hotel, Machado later greeted a crowd of jubilant supporters, who sang and shouted “libertad” (freedom), according to AFP journalists.







Machado, who has been living in hiding in Venezuela, was last seen in public on January 9, when she protested Maduro’s inauguration for his third term.
In her Nobel acceptance speech, the democracy campaigner urged her compatriots to keep fighting against Maduro’s “state terrorism”.
“What we Venezuelans can offer the world is the lesson forged through this long and difficult journey: that to have democracy, we must be willing to fight for freedom,” Machado said in a speech delivered by her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado.
It is unclear how Machado managed to leave Venezuela, or how she plans to eventually return.
She was warned by Caracas that she would be labelled a “fugitive” if she left the country.
“She risks being arrested if she returns, even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value,” said Benedicte Bull, a professor specialising in Latin America at the University of Oslo.
Machado’s previous refusal to leave the country had also boosted her political power.
“She is the undisputed leader of the opposition, but if she were to stay away in exile for a long time, I think that would change and she would gradually lose political influence,” Bull added.
‘State terrorism’
Her daughter assured the Nobel prize audience that her mother would return. “She wants to live in a free Venezuela, and she will never give up on that purpose,” Ana Corina Sosa Machado said.
Machado’s mother and three daughters, and some Latin American heads of state, including Argentine President Javier Milei, were at the prize-giving at Oslo’s City Hall.
In her acceptance speech, Machado denounced kidnappings and torture under Maduro’s tenure, calling them “crimes against humanity” and “state terrorism, deployed to bury the will of the people”.
Machado has been hailed for her fight for democracy, but also criticised for aligning herself with US President Donald Trump, to whom she has dedicated her Nobel.
The Oslo ceremony coincides with a large US military build-up in the Caribbean in recent weeks and deadly strikes on what Washington says are drug-smuggling boats.
Maduro, who came to power in 2013, insists the goal of the US operations — which Machado has said are justified — is to topple the government and seize Venezuela’s oil reserves
Nobel prize
Machado has accused Maduro of stealing Venezuela’s July 2024 election, from which she was banned — a claim backed by much of the international community.
The opposition claimed its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the election. He now lives in exile and was also in Oslo on Wednesday.
Multiple other Nobel Peace Prize-winners have been unable to collect their awards in person. Family members usually do so on their behalf, Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken explained this week.
The Nobel laureates in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics all received their prizes from Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf at a separate ceremony in Stockholm on Wednesday.
The prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and 11 million kronor ($1.2 million) — which is shared when several laureates are honoured in the same category.</p><small>2025-12-11 05:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638659-talk-about-us-not-politics-lahore-woman-interjects-during-bilawals-presser-from-rooftop' target='_blank'><strong>'Talk about us, not politics': Lahore woman interjects during Bilawal's presser from rooftop</strong></a><br><p>

One major reason is India’s lingering suspicion that the Saarc platform could be used by its smaller neighbours to join hands and push back or counter-balance India, the largest country in South Asia. That mindset has nearly always influenced India’s approach to regional cooperation under Saarc.
India’s apprehension about smaller states banding together against it does not stand to scrutiny. Had Germany continued with its suspicion of its peers in Europe, like France and the UK, the idea of the European Union would have never materialised. Had Indonesia tried to be hegemonic in East Asia, the ambition to make Asean the leading regional actor would have remained a pipe dream. The day the US loses complete faith in the United Nations, an organisation it had helped create as an essential element of the post-1945 world order, the UN could totally lose its relevance, as is beginning to happen now. In world politics, great power status comes with prodigious responsibilities. India can either lead Saarc, and with that the entire South Asia, to the next level of prosperity or relegate the organisation to the rubble of irrelevance, as is the case now.
Another reason why Saarc could not emerge as a force for the economic integration of South Asia is related to the lingering conflicts between India and other Saarc members, particularly Pakistan. In 2016, when it was Pakistan’s turn to host the Saarc summit in Islamabad, India not only boycotted the summit but also pressurised other countries to stay away, citing its concerns on terrorism. Ever since, India has sought to create new regional alignments minus Pakistan, such as Bimstech, BBIN, and IOR. However, these forums have also failed to deliver the expected levels of regional integration. India’s concern that its South Asian neighbours might bring up their respective bilateral disputes with India on the Saarc platform is exaggerated because the Saarc Charter prevents the raising of contentious political issues at Saarc meetings, and all member states had strictly followed this Charter requirement.
For their part, Saarc members, too, have an apprehension that India could use the forum to promote its hegemonic ambitions. The rhetoric in India of the creation of an ‘Akhand Bharat’ comprising the territories of nearly all Saarc members is an affront to the idea of regional cooperation based on the sovereign equality of all members. The mural map of a united India in its new parliament building evoked formal protest notes from Pakistan and Bangladesh. Importantly, the Saarc Charter calls upon member states to promote economic growth and collective self-reliance, while adhering to “principles of equality and non-interference”.

The idea of activating regional cooperation under Saarc is as sound today as it was in 1985.

The only time India felt at ease with the idea of regional integration was in early 2007 when the India-Pakistan peace process was in full swing and India’s then prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh extended his full support to the Saarc process. The 14th summit held in New Delhi in April 2007 took ground-breaking decisions, such as creating a food bank to address regional food emergencies, a regional university, promotion of multimodal transport connectivity, the rationalisation of tariffs, and visa liberalisation for students, journalists, and those seeking medical treatment in India.
Afghanistan was admitted as a member, and observer status was granted to China, Japan, the EU, South Korea, and the US. However, as soon as the peace process with Pakistan ran into trouble in 2008, India lost its interest in regional economic integration and also blocked any meaningful cooperation with observer states, particularly China.
Since 2014, when the last Saarc summit was held in Nepal, the organisation has not held any notable activity. Recently, some voices have arisen from Dhaka to activate Saarc. There is also growing talk of South Asian countries boosting their cooperation with China even if India is not ready to join in. On the sidelines of the UN General Assembly this year, the leadership of Pakistan and Bangladesh explored the possibility of reviving Saarc to help achieve shared development goals and overcome regional hurdles. The idea of activating regional cooperation under the ambit of Saarc remains as sound today as it was in 1985.
In a world that is increasingly becoming disorderly and anti-globalist, most countries are falling back on their respective regions for closer economic cooperation pegged to intra-regional connectivity. China has taken a lead through its Belt and Road Initiative, which has now connected over 150 countries of the world for mutual prosperity and development. In an article published recently in the edited book titled Rethinking India, the learned scholar Kishore Mahbubani of Singapore has urged India to learn from China to not shun regional connectivity and leverage adverse relationships to mutual advantage. If India were to heed to this advice, it could leverage the Saarc process for not only its own economic growth but also that of all countries of South Asia.

 

Encouragingly, Pakistan’s president and prime minister have both affirmed Pakistan’s commitment to the principles and objectives of the Saarc Charter and expressed Pakistan’s readiness to work with all willing states in our region to promote trade and energy linkages. This is a prudent approach. Together with Bangladesh, Pakistan must continue its efforts for a cooperative and inclusive regional order that can help unlock the true potential of South Asia as a region. Over the decades, substantial good work has been done under the ambit of Saarc, which must not be squandered. Saarc member states owe as much to their region, which is home to over two billion people, a quarter of the world’s population.

Published in Dawn, December 11th, 2025</p><small>2025-12-11 04:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/693a2fbfaf1cf.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960458/the-great-retreat' target='_blank'><strong>The Great Retreat</strong></a><br><p>THERE is a political battle underway in Pakistan and it is being fought on multiple fronts, with multiple strategies involving multiple players. At stake is the very future of politics in this country. And driving the whole affair is an economy that has wallowed in stagnation for too long now.
Start with the economy, then follow the ripples outward as they travel through the political system. Back in the summer of 2022 the economy was overheating, a process that had begun a year earlier and was admitted to by the PTI’s Shaukat Tarin in public remarks made in the second half of 2021. Inflation was skyrocketing and foreign exchange reserves had hit near default levels by June 2022. The air was thick with doomsday scenarios if Pakistan should stumble into what people were describing as a ‘Sri Lanka-type situation’. Turbo-charged anxiety was surging from the economy out into the wider society.
Pakistan pulled back from the brink in August 2022 with a last-minute Fund programme, but lost the thread once again when Ishaq Dar came in as finance minister and deviated from the programme’s requirements. Once again, the country veered towards a catastrophic default until yet another emergency Fund programme in July 2023 pulled it back one more time. Two last-minute rescues in one year must be a record.
Since July 2023, the economy has been stable, with inflation extinguished and foreign exchange reserves rising steadily, from less than one month of import cover to around two-and-a-half months by now. But there the good news ended. All through 2024 and 2025, the economy found a stable footing and the anxiety slowly drained out. But this came at a cost. With job creation halted and growth killed, the economy began to fill up with pressure of another kind: desperation.

There are too many players now, and not enough space in the game for all of them.

Stagnation can stabilise some parts of an economy, like prices and import demand. But stagnation also drives up desperation as owners of capital watch the value of their assets and cash flows plummet, as middle classes find their purchasing power burned away and the working poor find daily life turn into a grinding struggle since wages are the last to recover from episodes of high inflation in Pakistan.
The desperation is fuelled further by the state’s massive requirement for resources that grows during periods of stabilisation. Taxes rise, expenditures are cut and the central bank mops up all dollar liquidity the system can generate to build its foreign currency buffers. The demand for resources falls heavily on capital, as a demand for taxes, high interest rates and liquidity shortages in foreign currency markets start to grip economic policy. Periods of growth booms that usually precede such severe downturns are periods when capital enjoys outsize returns. Periods of bust occur when the state comes bearing the bill.

 

The churn in the political system mirrors these developments. The first fault line along which systemic stress develops is the civil vs military one. Both of these wings of the state feel the resource crunch hard during these times. The crunch comes from different directions. Servants of the state need to be compensated for their loss of purchasing power due to the inflationary fire. Continuing investments in state assets, from infrastructure to arms procurement and everything in between, need to be paid for. The civilians feel the heat from society because they are answerable to the electorate, so they search for ways to transfer state resources to their constituents.
The business community lobbies hard to reduce the burden the state places upon them during these periods. Taxes and interest rates are routinely in focus, but they also get creative in coming up with new ‘incentives’ for themselves. And along the way, they find ways to play one wing of the state against the other in an effort to advance their interests.
This is how desperation below feeds tension above. Mistrust, suspicion and disappointment among the ruling elites of the country grows. Perceptions take hold that the government has failed, that it is incompetent, that the ruling party is self-serving, and so on. As the ruling party tries to stave off these attacks, its focus on the ongoing stabilisation effort falters, and desperation for growth begins to assert itself.
Pakistan is going through this cycle one more time these days, but with some slight modifications. The centre has fallen to non-democratic forces as the hybrid experiment launched in 2018 has ramped up its presence and taken over more and more space in executive decision-making from 2024 onwards. The democratic forces have retreated to their fortresses in the provinces. Each of the major political parties in the country controls one province, whose revenue stream keeps them alive and in the game. And each has made that province their base of operations, to first secure their place within the system, and then launch their bid to retake what they believe is their rightful place in the centre. It’s what I call the ‘Great Retreat’.
Meanwhile, with stabilisation now well into its third year, the demand for resources in the centre is proving relentless and the non-democratic forces are in pursuit. They are being egged on by those who can only build a future in public life for themselves with the total erasure of the democratic forces from power. The demand to roll back the NFC Award and break up the provinces feeds on the tension bred along the civil-military fault line as economic stabilisation now begins to bite.
With no strategy on the horizon to break out of stabilisation mode, the system will increasingly turn on itself, and a reckoning of some sort will have to take place. There are too many players now, and not enough space in the game for all of them. Absent a major external bailout, the third year of economic stabilisation will see a rising arc of political instability in the country.

During a sitting chaired by Deputy Speaker Suriyya Bibi, the assembly witnessed ruckus and adjournment when the opposition PML-N’s woman lawmaker, Sobia Shahid, displayed a picture of Army Chief and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
The chair ordered security personnel to remove the picture. She censured Ms Shahid, saying the CDF represents the military and not her party.
“You should talk about your own performance as the lawmaker instead of displaying the CDF’s picture,” she observed before adjourning the sitting due to commotion.
Earlier, members of the ruling PTI complained that the country faced serious challenges like the poor law and order situation, financial stress and political instability. They insisted that that the country’s external issues could only be resolved once the “house is in order.”
Treasury MPA Mohammad Ajmal Khan said the recent presser by ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry against the PTI leadership, especially founder Imran Khan and CM Sohail Afridi, had angered the people of KP.
He said the military’s spokesman should not be speaking on controversial matters would aggravate the current political crisis in the country.
The lawmaker opposed the option of enforcing the Governor’s Rule in the province, warning it is no solution and will be unacceptable to residents. He said that the provincial assembly could help resolve issues among Mr Imran, the federal government and the security establishment.
Mr Khan also said once the “house was in order”, dialogue could be held with Afghanistan for lasting peace in the region.
Treasury MPA Humayun Khan said the legislature, the judiciary and the executive were main pillars of the state but an institution called itself the state that it never was.
He said that the military was raised and paid to protect the country’s borders.
Mr Khan came down hard on the military’s spokesman for making “insulting” remarks against the PTI founder and KP’s chief minister.
He said it was the Pakistan Air Force that did a great job in the May 8 conflict with India, so its chief should have been credited and made the Field Marshal.
The lawmaker said the creation of the CDS post should be reconsidered.
Member of the opposition PML-N Shahjahan Yousaf said the people were proud of the country’s armed forces for defeating a much larger adversary in the May clashes.
He said PTI members in the National Assembly should discuss the matters related to the Centre, while those in the KP Assembly should take up provincial issues.
Mr Yousaf said there was nothing wrong if all defence forces got united to defend the country.
He congratulated Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir on becoming the CDF.
Housing minister Dr Amjad Ali condemned the use of water cannons against the sisters of the PTI’s founder during their protest sit-in staged outside Adiala Jail to seek a meeting with their brother.
He said that a law and order situation was being deliberately created in the province. He wondered how an official, being paid by the government, could hold a political presser. The minister said the military’s spokesperson should hold more and more news conferences to increase Mr Imran’s popularity.
Meanwhile, the house was informed that the province lacked the facility to measure uranium levels in the drinking water supplied to Karak district.
“We do not have that testing facility. We recently sent a letter to the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority in this respect and will follow up and inform the house,” public health engineering minister Fazal Shakoor Khan informed lawmakers.
The minister’s statement came as PML-N member Farah Khan raised serious concerns about the rising number of blood and bone cancer patients as well as the high incidence of kidney failures due to the contaminated drinking water in the area.
In a question, she also asked whether any water filtration plant existed in the district, insisting that high-risk diseases in Karak were on the rise and the situation in the Shnawa Kudikhel area of the district had become alarming.

The move, which seeks not only to sideline what is arguably the country’s most popular political party and its leader but also disenfranchise the millions who voted for it in the last election, will erode the public’s trust in politics and politicians.
The resolution, sponsored by the PML-N, has framed its arguments in terms of national security, accusing both the PTI and the former prime minister of being “anti-state” and a “tool of the enemy state”.
The timing of the move is significant; it comes just days after the ISPR chief assailed the PTI leader, without naming him, for spreading an “anti-army narrative”, insisting that such rhetoric had moved beyond politics into the sphere of “national security”.

 

This is not the first time a party or politician has faced the prospect of political banishment. Pakistan’s history is replete with such instances. The infamous Public and Representative Offices (Disqualification) Act, enacted under prime minister Liaquat Ali Khan and Field Marshal Ayub Khan’s Elective Bodies Disqualification Order were two early pieces of ‘legislation’ that were used to disqualify political opponents from holding public offices for up to 15 years.
What followed was two decades of massive political instability, two military takeovers, and loss of the eastern wing. Sadly, the consequences of these controversial laws did not deter even an elected leader like Z.A. Bhutto from dissolving the NAP or jailing his opponents.

 

Today’s coalition partners — the PML-N and PPP — along with other parties too have suffered exile and persecution, allegations of being anti-state and mass disqualifications under generals Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf. Their resilience and comeback underscore the fact that attempts to ban legitimate political entities having public support never work. Even manufactured alliances like the IJI and later the king’s party PML-Q failed to deliver.
If heavy-handed tactics could not eliminate the PML-N and PPP, they are not likely to work against the PTI either. The proposal to exclude a legitimate political force, which dominated the last election despite electoral manipulation and was able to form a government in KP, from politics is a short-sighted manoeuvre driven by the PML-N’s desire to eliminate a strong political adversary in Punjab. Even by suggesting this essentially antidemocratic move, the PML-N has further damaged its democratic credentials.
Only voters, and not the state, should have the authority to consign a political party to the dustbin of history — through the ballot. The state — through the courts — has a right to ban a political entity only if it is involved in violent militancy. It is about time that the politicians understood the lessons of history.

A two-judge SHC bench headed by Chief Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput took up the appeal filed by acting PG Muntazir Mehdi and issued notices to Dr Mahrang and others for Dec 24.
The BYC leader, who is currently detained at the Quetta prison in connection with some other cases, had filed an acquittal application under Section 256-K of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) before the ATC-V and the judge had on Dec 3 allowed the application and acquitted her.
In the appeal filed on behalf of the state, the acting PG stated that the trial court misread evidence and allowed the acquittal application at the pre-trial stage.
He contended that the prosecution had apprised the ATC about the availability of sufficient evidence, and the same would be produced in court during the trial.
However, the trial court had exonerated the suspect even before the commencement of the trial, giving no opportunity to the prosecution to examine and produce evidence, he added.
According to the prosecution, a case was registered on the complaint of a local businessman in Landhi who told the police that he had been watching Dr Mahrang and her unidentified colleagues’ “anti-state campaign” on social media.

In its Asian Development Outlook December 2025, the Manila-based lending agency also revised the growth outlook for the South Asian Region upward for the current year.
“In the case of South Asia, growth forecasts for 2026 have been revised upward for Sri Lanka and Pakistan, respectively, due to increased public investment and a less-severe-than-anticipated impact of flooding,” it said in its latest report without actually saying where it expected Pakistan’s growth to settle for the year. In July, the ADB had set a 2026 growth forecast for Pakistan at 3pc and had kept it unchanged in its September update in the middle of flooding across Punjab’s agricultural heartland.

 

“The growth outlooks for Pakistan and Sri Lanka have improved for both 2025 and 2026”, it said, adding that the Government of Pakistan updated its estimate of GDP growth for FY25 to 3pc from a previously reported 2.7pc. “Despite disruptions that resulted from floods in June 2025, the economy grew 5.7pc in Q4FY25, and the country’s large-scale manufacturing expanded robustly in recent months in FY26”, it said.

Sees robust growth for South Asia for 2025 and 2026 despite challenges

Pakistan’s inflation for the first four months (July-October) of FY26 was 4.7pc, down from 8.7pc in the same period a year ago, the bank said, adding “after a sharp increase in the months immediately after the floods, prices of key food items have begun to stabilise”.
It forecast the growth in South Asia to remain robust, with the 2025 forecast revised upward to 6.5pc from 5.9pc, and the 2026 forecast maintained at 6pc. This is driven by upgrades to India’s outlook, based on robust domestic consumption growth. Sri Lanka’s forecasts for 2025 and 2026 are revised upward due to robust credit expansion, buoyant consumption, and improved investor confidence following rating upgrades.
In contrast, Bangladesh’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2026 projection was lowered due to weaker exports amid subdued global demand and supply disruptions, while the forecast for FY2025 remains unchanged. Pakistan’s FY2025 growth outlook was upgraded following a stronger-than-expected Q4, it said.
Growth forecasts for the remaining South Asian economies are retained, although Nepal faces lingering uncertainty in the aftermath of September’s civil unrest and the ongoing political transition.
India’s growth forecast for FY2025 (fiscal year ending March 2026) was revised to 7.2pc from 6.5pc in the September ADO, reflecting stronger third-quarter expansion as tax cuts supported consumption. Indian GDP grew faster than expected at 8.2pc in the second quarter of FY25. The 2026 forecast was kept unchanged at 6.5pc. The bank also raised its growth forecasts for economies in developing Asia and the Pacific for this year and next, amid stronger-than-expected exports and reduced trade uncertainty following the conclusion of several trade agreements with the United States.
Risks to the regional outlook include renewed trade tensions and financial market volatility, as well as geopolitical pressures and a worse-than-expected deterioration in the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) property market. China’s growth forecast for this year has been raised slightly to 4.8pc from 4.7pc, amid resilient exports and continued fiscal stimulus. The outlook for 2026 was kept unchanged at 4.3pc.Southeast Asia’s growth projection for this year was also upgraded by 0.2 percentage points to 4.5pc, reflecting a strong third quarter in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam.

Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar has forwarded two summaries through the Home Department to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for final approval.
He also proposed amendments to the Provincial Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965, for the rationalisation of Section 89-B, which makes it mandatory for drivers of motor cars, cabs, and transport vehicles to wear a fastened seat belt, by omitting the requirement of ‘notified roads’.
The move was taken as a major development in the wake of recent crackdown on the underage drivers, including students, and arrested many of them under criminal offences.

Changes to law proposed to introduce juvenile driving permit, make seat belts mandatory for all roads

The CM had taken notice of some disturbing viral video clips when several hand-cuffed students in school uniform were presented in courts and the reports that the police tarnished the careers of a large number of them by preparing their crime profile.
Giving some justifications for these amendments, the IGP pointed out that the existing regulatory gap resulted in unlicenced juvenile riding and associated safety risks, necessitating a need to introduce a juvenile driving permit for motorcycle riders aged 16 to 18 years.
“The amendment establishes a structured, lawful, and monitored framework enabling juveniles to operate motorcycles under prescribed conditions, thereby promoting responsible mobility, enhancing road safety, strengthening enforcement, and supporting the vision of a safe, modern, and inclusive youth mobility system,” reads one of the summary documents.
Global practices
The respective summaries were drafted and sent to the Punjab police chief by Lahore Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Athar Waheed who referred to some models/practices adopted by many advanced countries to address the serious issue of ‘the youth mobility on the roads’.
Mr Athar was of the opinion that the introduction of a formal juvenile driving permit would provide a structured, lawful and enforceable pathway for regulated youth mobility.
“A comparative review of international licensing standards shows that many jurisdictions, including India, Malaysia, New Zealand, several EU states, and the US, allow supervised or restricted motorcycle or learner permits between 16 and 17 years of age,” states the CTO.
About the background perspective, the police department says that no person is permitted to ride a motorcycle in any public place unless he/she attained the age of 18 years under the existing legal framework, specifically section 4 of the motor vehicle ordinance.
The absence of a clear statutory mechanism for regulating juvenile motorcycle riders aged 16 to 18 years had resulted in persistent enforcement challenges and an incre­asing number of unlicenced young riders on the roads.
The introduction of juvenile driving permit for juvenile motorcycle riders aged 16 to 18 years would address this regulatory gap besides providing a structured, legally recognised, and enforceable framework for youth mobility within this age bracket, as per the documents. Another primary objective of the proposed amendment was to allow individuals aged 16 to 18 years to legally ply motorcycles under regulated and clearly defined conditions.
The department also argued that section 89-B currently restricts mandatory seat belt use to “notified roads”, creating ambiguity and limiting enforcement, despite the fact that road-safety risks are present on all public roads across the province.
“To address this critical safety concern and ensure uniform compliance, it is proposed that the phrase ‘on notified roads’ be removed, making seat belt use compulsory on all public roads and strengthening protection for every road user,” reads the summary.

The proposal, laid out in a notice published on Tuesday in the Federal Register, would apply to visitors from 42 countries, including Britain, France, Australia and Japan, who do not need a visa to enter the United States.
Currently, those travellers only need to apply for a waiver known as the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA), which still requires them to provide certain personal details.
Under the proposed new rules, the collection of social media data would become a “mandatory” part of ESTA applications. Applicants would need to provide their social media histories from the last five years, according to the notice.
They would also have to submit other “high-value data fields” including phone numbers from the last five years, email addresses from the past decade, personal details of family members and biometric information.
The public has 60 days to comment on the proposal.

LONDON: British lawmakers on Wednesday urged their government to support self-determination for the disputed region of Ja­m­­mu and Kashmir, and called on it to press India on human rights.
However, a minister reaffirmed the UK’s long-standing policy on the decades-old dispute during a parliamentary debate by saying “we believe in diplomacy”, with a renewed push for bilateral talks between India and Pakistan.
The debate “Kashmir: Self-determination”, in Westminster Hall, saw several members of parliament calling for a more active British role, citing concerns from their large British-Kashmiri constituencies.

 

The session was led by Labour MP Imran Hussain, who described the situation as an urgent human rights issue.
For the people of [India-held] Kashmir, this is not a distant foreign-policy issue, Mr Hussain said.
“This is about families torn apart, homes bulldozed, voices sile­nced, human rights abused. The right to choose their own destiny has been denied for generations.”
He criticised India’s revocation of the region’s special status in 2019. “Since the removal of Articles 370 and 35A, we have seen communication blackouts, curfews, mass detentions and attempts to alter the demographics of the region,” he said.
He also referenced a 1948 United Nations resolution calling for a vote on the disputed territory’s future.
The promise of a free and fair plebiscite made in 1948 remains unfulfilled, Mr Hussain added.
Decades later, the international community and successive UK governments have failed to ensure that Kashmiris can exercise their right to self-determination, he added.
Other MPs echoed his concerns. Jim Shannon of Strangford highlighted the humanitarian situation in occupied Kashmir, highlighting “repressive policies” including the use of arbitrary detention, extrajudicial killings and other most serious abuses, including sexual abuse.
Gareth Snell of Labour from Stoke-on-Trent Central highlighted the large British-Kashmiri population and the enduring lack of political attention to the issue.
Labour MP Andy McDonald of Middlesbrough and Thornaby East raised concerns over reports of arbitrary detention, suppression of free speech and restrictions on journalists.
Responding for the government, Hamish Falconer, who is the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, emphasised that the UK’s position has not changed.
“It is for India and Pakistan to find a lasting resolut­­­ion to the situation in Kashmir, which must take into ac­­count the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” he said, stressing that both sides are friends. Mr Falconer also said the UK regularly raises human rights with both nations. “The UK takes human rights seriously,” he said. “We continue to raise concerns with both India and Pakistan regarding restrictions, the detention of political leaders, and the protection of minorities. We welcome any steps to lift remaining restrictions and release political detainees,” he added.
He also addressed the UK diaspora, saying the UK recognises the strength of feeling among the British-Kashmiri community and remains open to engagement with community representatives, adding, “I do not wish to take a view about whether a further reference to the United Nations is useful at this time, but it is critical in 2025 and into 2026 that there is dialogue between India and Pakistan. We have seen the extent of the pressure when dialogue breaks down.” While ministers acknowledged the plight of Kashmiris and the UK’s role in raising concerns, they stopped short of committing to any UK-led mediation or a UN-backed plebiscite.
The session marks the latest in a series of parliamentary debates on the disputed Himalayan region, including discussions in March 2025 and January 2021, reflecting the ongoing concern among MPs, constituents, and diaspora communities about human rights and political representation in the region.

The policy aims to facilitate litigants and improve efficiency in the top court amid complaints that petitioners, who have to travel long distances to reach the apex court, sometimes return empty-handed due to this practice. In some instances, their cases are taken up after inordinate delays following their de-listing.
A few years ago, a litigant who was suffering from cardiac problems visited Islamabad from Lahore to attend his case, but it was delisted and then fixed for hearing at a time when the court’s timing was already over.
When he came to attend to his case for the third time, the bench, which was supposed to hear the matter, simply adjourned it without assigning a reason or fixing a new date.

CJP Afridi vows to safeguard dignity, liberty, and equality of people

The Wednesday circular, however, said whenever cases are required to be delisted due to non-availability of the requisite bench or a judge, they shall, so far as practicable, be redistributed among available benches for hearing on the same day after 11:30am. If redistribution on the same day is not practicable, the cases will automatically be fixed for hearing in the following week.
The policy represents the apex court’s commitment to strengthening case management, enhancing judicial accessibility and promoting a litigant-friendly environment, the handout said.
International Human Rights Day
Meanwhile, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, in his message on International Human Rights Day, said the judiciary rene­wed its constitutional and moral commitment to safeguard the dignity, liberty, and equality of all people.
This day commemorates the ad­­option of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) — a transformative global pledge that continues to inspire national constitutions, public institutions, and development strategies, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
In an era of rapid social, economic and technological change, the judiciary of Pakistan remains firmly focused on strengthening the rule of law and ensuring that justice is accessible and responsive to the needs of every citizen, the message said.
The statement added that the ongoing reform initiatives aimed to modernise judicial processes, promote transparency and meaningfully reduce the barriers that prevent people, especially the marginalised, from securing their rights.
From improving court procedures and embracing technology to enhancing judicial training and strengthening institutional coordination, each step of reform reflects our commitment to a citizen-centric justice system — one that tre­­ats every individual with respect, ensures timely remedies, and uph­olds fairness without fear or favour.

RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: Politi­cal temperatures rose further on Wedne­sday, as Rawalpindi police sought a legal opinion on the question of registering an FIR against PTI leaders and supporters over a protest outside Adiala jail, even as the party moved a privilege motion in the National Assembly over alleged use of force against its workers, and voiced alarm at reports of Imran Khan’s possible transfer to another prison.
The PTI also joined other opposition parties in warning that efforts to “minus” the incarcerated former premier and clamp down on peaceful protest would only deepen the stand-off with the government and push the country towards greater political turmoil.

 

After entering a report in its daily police diary (roznamcha) on the PTI sit-in outside Adiala jail on the previous night, Rawalpindi police termed the demonstration a “violent protest by a political party with the intention of attacking Adiala jail” in a statement issued on Wednesday.
It noted that Section 144 was in force in the city and that it was the police’s respo­n­sibility to ensure its implementation.
A police spokesperson said Adiala jail was a sensitive and densely populated area where maintaining security and traffic order was crucial. He added that there was no visiting time at night and no one could be allowed to meet an inmate without a court order.
The spokesperson claimed that the po­lice had “shown extreme patience” du­r­ing the sit-in despite “attempts to vandalise and resist the police” by protesters.

 

“Members of the political party pelted stones and attacked the police, on which the law had to take its course. Water cannon had to be used, with extreme patience and strategy, to prevent malicious activity and an attack,” he said, adding that violation of the law would not be tolerated “under any circumstances” in such a sensitive area.
In a post on X at 3:58am, the party had claimed that authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM.
The party said Mr Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Niazi, along with party leaders and workers, had spent the entire day peacefully waiting outside the prison to exercise their “constitutional and legal right” to meet their incarcerated leader on a court-mandated visitation day.







“This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene.
A police source said a report on Tuesday night’s incident had already been recorded and could be converted into a formal FIR, in which the accused would be nominated and booked under the relevant sections of the law.
Privilege motion
On the other hand, PTI MNAs on Wednesday submitted a complaint for a “privilege motion” in the National Assembly against Rawalpindi police.
At a subsequent presser, opposition leaders claimed that PTI parliamentary leader Shahid Khattak’s “leg had been broken” in the melee.
The motion claimed that police had used force against PTI leaders and workers who were present outside the jail to express solidarity with the PTI founder imprisoned there.
The party also expressed grave concern over reports that the former prime minister might be transferred to another jail, calling such a move a blatant display of “fear, political desperation and weakness” on the part of the government.
The party said its founding chairman could neither be “minused” nor removed from the political arena, nor could his voice be sile­nced behind prison walls.
In a statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party condemned remarks by federal ministers suggesting that Mr Khan may be mov­ed to another facility, saying the government “continued to tremble at his very name” despite keeping him incarcerated for over two and a half years.
The party also condemned what it described as a police “assault” on Mr Khan’s sisters, female workers and party leaders outside Adiala Jail.
It said the episode once again exposed the “stark reality” that the incumbent government had abandoned “moral boundaries, constitutional principles and basic human values” in its use of force against political opponents.
War of words
Meanwhile, the war of words between the opposition and the ruling coalition continued on Wed­nesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”.
The tensions have particularly intensified in rec­ent days after the spok­esperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on Dec 6, in response to Imran Kha­n’s latest outburst against the military leadership.
Addressing a press conference, Mr Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance. All doors to talks are now closed.”
He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour and development”.
“We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what else can be done”.
‘Common sense’
Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament.
Among them, Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections.
“We did not stage a sit-in back then … We sat in parliament, believing that our voices would be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties would be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years. However, “at some point, common sense should prevail”, he said
Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.”
He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.
The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.”
“You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked.
Achakzai on dialogue
Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside parliament.
Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan. How can we negotiate without his permission?”
For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “nati­onal conference” on Dec 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited.
A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.”
Mr Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adiala jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”.
‘Dark period’
Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addressed a press conference, assailing the PTI and its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history.
“He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said.
“It is the same Khan who was willing to give Gen Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.”
“Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?” Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, in a press conference in Islamabad, called on overseas Pakist­anis to recognise the “venomous rhetoric” being spread by PTI.
“I want the overseas Pakistanis to identify and acknowledge these gro­ups,” Mr Chaudhry said. “I want my nation, my Pakistanis, to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong.”

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said Pakis­tan could not achieve sustainable economic development without the complete elimination of terro­rism, extremism and se­­­­ctaria­n­ism from the country.
Addressing the National Ulema Conference, the prime minister urged religious scholars to play a proactive role in discouraging sectarianism and promoting unity, harmony and brotherhood among all schools of thought. “Creating an atmosphere of national cohesion is esse­­ntial for ensuring the country’s prosperity and future progress,” he added.
The convention was attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Mi­­nister Ishaq Dar, Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, ministers, parliamentarians, and a large number of religious scholars from various schools of thoughts.
“With the blessings of Almighty Allah, Pakistan achieved a great victory in Marka-i-Haq against India,” the premier said, also lauding the professionalism and bravery of the armed forces.
‘Unwavering resolve’
He said Field Marshal Munir had led the war with courage and unwavering resolve, while all services — the army, air force and navy — contributed equally to the victory.
The world, he added, was acknowledging Pakis­tan’s performance, and Muslim countries were expressing pride over the historic victory. Despite this, he noted, certain elements continued to spread propaganda against the armed forces. Calling out the menace of terrorism, he said the Khawarij (a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) were carrying out attacks and targeting innocent citizens and security personnel.
He said the country’s po­litical and military lea­dership had worked tirelessly to steer the nation away from the risk of default.
The prime minister re­­affirmed the governm­e­nt’s resolve to place Pakistan on the path to economic prosperity. “By implementing austerity measures and working collectively, the nation can fulfill the dreams of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah,” he added.
‘Broadening vision’
Speaking at the event, CDF Field Marshal Munir urged the ulema to play their role in fostering na­­tional unity and broadening the vision of the pe­­o­p­­le, the state-run APP reported.
He added that in an Is­­lamic state, no one exc­ept the state could declare jihad.
Terming the defence ag­­reement with Saudi Arabia a historic development, the CDF said there was a deep connection between the Kingdom and Pakistan.
“Terrorism is not Pakistan’s way, but India’s practice. Pakistan does not strike the enemy from hiding; rather, it challenges and eliminates them openly,” he said.
Underscoring the impo­rtance of education, Field Marshal Munir said the pen became vulnerable to chaos in a nation, which abandoned knowledge.

The state-owned Bang­ladesh Sangbad Sangstha news agency quoted Dha­ka’s Foreign Adviser Md Touhid Hossain as saying: “It is possible for us (Bang­ladesh) strategically … (but) it is not possible for Nepal or Bhutan to form a grouping with Pakistan excluding India”.
His remarks are being interpreted as a response to a statement by Pakis­tan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar at the recent ‘Islamabad Conclave’, where he had said a trilateral initiative involving Bangladesh, China and Pakistan had begun and may expand to include countries within and beyond the region.
According to the Bang­ladeshi outlet, Mr Hossain said Mr Dar “has said something, and perhaps at some point this could see some progress”.
In August, Foreign Minister Dar visited Bangladesh for the first time in 13 years.
PM Shehbaz Sharif and Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus have also held a couple of cordial meetings in recent months.
There has been a thaw in ties between the two nations ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year.

The package includes Link–16 systems, cryptographic equipment, avionics updates, training, and comprehensive logistical support.
The DSCA letter makes clear the rationale for the sale, stating that it “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations.”
The proposed sale is also aimed at modernising Pakistan’s F-16 fleet and addressing operational safety concerns. The letter notes that it will “maintain Pakistan’s capability to meet current and future threats by updating and refurbishing its Block–52 and Mid Life Upgrade F–16 fleet.”
These updates will provide more “seamless integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force in combat operations, exercises, and training, and refurbishment will extend the aircraft life through 2040 while addressing critical flight safety concerns,” the letter adds.
The letter also emphasises Pakistan’s readiness to absorb the technology, stating that the country “has shown a commitment to maintaining its military forces and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” It also addresses regional concerns, asserting that “the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.”

 

Lockheed Martin Company of Fort Worth, Texas, will serve as the principal contractor for the sale. The US defence agency pointed out that “implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional US Government or contractor representatives to Pakistan” and that there will be “no adverse impact on US defence readiness as a result of this proposed sale.”
The total estimated value of the sale is $686 million, with major defence equipment valued at $37 million and other items at $649 million. The major defence equipment (MDE) component includes 92 Link–16 data link systems and six inert Mk–82 500-lb general purpose bomb bodies; the latter will have no explosive payload and will be used for weapons integration testing.
Link-16 is an advanced command, control, communications and intelligence system. It is a secure, real-time communication network that shares tactical data among allied forces and is used by US and allied Nato forces. The system is also resistant to electronic jamming from enemy air and ground assets.
“It provides the warfighter key theatre functions such as surveillance, identification, air control, weapons engagement coordination, and direction for all services and allied forces,” the letter read.
The rest of the deal consists of $649m worth of non-MDE equipment, including the AN/APQ–10C Simple Key Loaders and AN/APX–126 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe system — used to identify hostile and allied aircraft.
It also includes hardware and software modifications to support the Operational Flight Program and mandated avionics updates, as well as KY–58M and KIV–78 cryptographic appliqués, which are National Security Agency (NSA)-certified modules used in military aircraft and other tactical systems for secure communications and identification.
The equipment also covers additional secure communications, precision navigation and cryptographic devices, Joint Mission Planning Systems and support, Common Munitions Built-in-test Reprogramming Equipment, and ADU–981 missile adaptor units.
Other weapons integration, test and support equipment, spare and repair parts, software delivery and support, publications and technical documentation, full motion simulators, personnel training, and training equipment are also included.
The package will also provide Pakistan with US government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support services, studies and surveys, and other related elements of logistical and program support.
Pakistan had requested upgrades to its F-16 fleet in 2021 amid strained relations, but Washington delayed its response. The country is now less dependent on the F-16s, having acquired and jointly developed other platforms, which proved their worth during the May 2025 air war by inflicting significant damage on the Indian fleet.
“Pakistan still welcomes the US offer, as it will enhance the shelf life of its F-16s until 2040,” a diplomatic source said.
The DSCA letter, sent to the Speaker of the House and the chairmen of the relevant congressional committees, concludes that the sale “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States” while ensuring that Pakistan can continue to operate its F-16 fleet safely and effectively.</p><small>2025-12-11 02:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638635-ministry-alerts-public-to-fake-company-offering-jobs-in-saudi-arabia' target='_blank'><strong>Ministry alerts public to 'fake company' offering jobs in Saudi Arabia</strong></a><br><p>

But on Wednesday, the narrative splintered into two distinct, dazzling truths: one written in the chronometric perfection of chlorinated water, the other etched in the sun-baked sand of the long jump pit.
In the pool, a digital clock froze at a number never before seen in Pakistan: 29.99 seconds.
On the track, a measuring tape confirmed a distance of 5.52 metres, sealing a historic triple crown.
The fourth day of the competitions belonged to 19-year-old swimmer Hamza Asif, who shattered a time barrier and a 26-year-old Olympian who shattered expectations, proving that national sporting history can be made in parallel universes.
The sun played the role of spotlight over the swimming arena, its zenith aligning with the men’s 50m breaststroke final.
The audience was on its feet, phone cameras held horizontally. In lane six was Rayan Awan, the national record holder in the event.
The buzzer sounded. Seven swimmers flew off the blocks, emerging from shadow into liquid light. It was not Rayan, but Wapda’s Hamza who touched first.
After a wait of several seconds, a cluster of red numbers appeared. A voice screamed from the stands: “National record! National record!” Hamza had done the unthinkable — he became the first Pakistani to swim the event in under 30 seconds.
Rayan, in a gracious twist of fate, also improved his personal time (30.55) for silver. But this was Hamza’s moment.
Race-mates reached over lane lines to high-five the teenager, who trains at the University of Tennessee. His father was hugged tight by proud men; his mother bent down in prostration.
“My coach has worked hard on me, we’ve been training for this very event and I was expecting the record,” a remarkably composed Hamza, who would later top off his day with another gold in the 50m freestyle, told Dawn.
As the aquatic celebrations subsided, the searing Karachi sun refocused its attention on the track and field stadium.
Here, Faiqa Riaz, the Wapda sprinter and Pakistan’s representative at the Paris 2024 Olympics, was chasing a different kind of immortality.
She had already secured the 100m and 200m golds. Now, she stood at the long jump runway for her final attempt.
A brief, taut silence followed her leap. She locked eyes with the technical official.
The winning distance was announced. A yell of pure, unfiltered joy erupted.
Faiqa put her hands on her head, knowing the gold — and a historic third individual title — was hers. When the last competitor failed to match it, she collapsed into the arms of her coaches.
“I thought I had to settle for a silver today,” Faiqa confessed to Dawn. “But on my last attempt, I was like it’s do or die and I ran with my full strength for the jump.”
Her main target had always been the 100m, the event she trained for most intensely. The 200m and long jump were audacious, successful experiments.
Her triumph, however, is framed by the stark realities of Pakistani sport. Managing two distinct disciplines is a complex science.
“For jumps, training for explosive [power] I do with sprint. But run-up is the main issue… in sprint you need speed while in long jump you need more control with speed,” she explained, noting she doesn’t train specifically for jumps to protect her sprinting prowess.
THE SUPPORTING CAST
The day’s drama was not confined to these twin peaks. The penultimate day of the athletic meet began in the pre-dawn dark at Mazar-e-Quaid, with the marathoners setting off on their 42.195km odyssey, where Navy’s Shahbaz Masih claimed marathon gold in 2:25:23.6 — almost four minutes ahead of his nearest rival Wapda’s Sher Khan.
Elsewhere on the track and field of the NPT&SC, Army’s Mohammad Akhtar executed a perfectly timed final burst in the men’s 10,000m, roaring past Wapda’s Mohammad Irfan in the last 150 metres to claim gold.
The women’s 100m hurdles saw a thrilling mid-race shift, as Wapda’s Ghazala Ramzan edged ahead of her department-mate Amina Saeed to secure the top spot.
The men’s 4x100m relay provided a thrilling finale, with Wapda clinging to a razor-thin lead against a charging Army team in a photo finish.
The event, however, was marred by controversy as the Sindh team failed to field a squad, citing a lack of communication from their absent manager and grievances over unpaid daily allowances.
In the field, Uzma Azan (Wapda) added to her department’s gold haul in the hammer throw, while Army’s Waqas Akbar cruised to victory in a tactical men’s 1500m.
Over in the pool, 13-year-old Riah Mirza won her first national medal —gold— in the women’s 100m backstroke in 1:16.50, a personal record for the teenager.
Watching, with pride in her eyes, was her mother Shaan Kandawalla, who swam at the first national women’s championships 30 years ago.
“My mom’s my inspiration,” Riah said. “And she’s mine,” Shaan replied, kissing her forehead. “I hope she now gets a chance to swim internationally, which I never got a chance to do.”
The waves of victory kept coming. Jehanara Nabi and Ahmed Durrani (800m and 200m freestyle) added multiple individual golds for Army.
Mishael Hayat Ayub won Wapda’s first aquatics gold medal in the women’s 100m butterfly in 1:11.12.
Ayesha Zeeshan followed it up with a gold in 50m freestyle (28.69), while earlier in the day Hareem Malik won Sindh’s second gold in the 50m breaststroke, coming moderately close to breaking her own national record in the event.
Ali Mitha won Sindh’s first gold on the men’s side in 1:01.64 in 100m backstroke.
Army’s other individual gold was won by Syed Daniyal Hatim in the 100m butterfly, where he’s the record holder, with 57.72.
FOOTBALL FRACAS
Aside from the sporting glories, the men’s football event descended into a farce after a violent brawl during a heated semi-final clash between Army and Wapda at the KPT Sports Complex.
A heated exchange, after Army won 4-3, flared into a full-scale brawl, culminating in players allegedly forcing their way into the officials’ room and assaulting the referee. A detailed report is being prepared, with disciplinary action expected against both sides.
In judo, Pakistan Air Force (PAF) emerged as the leading force, with Mohammad Saleem (-50kg), Olympian Shah Hussain Shah (-110kg) and Sadaqat Ali (-66kg) all securing gold, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Syed Faisal Shah (-55kg) and Navy’s Akhas (-60kg) also topped their categories.
In the women’s events, PAF continued their strong showing through Naseema (-40kg) and Iram Shahzadi (-48kg), with Wapda’s Fozia Yasir (+70kg) and Navy’s Areeba Ameer (-44kg) claiming titles.
Taekwondo kyorugi saw Army dominate the mats, with Haroon (U-58kg), Arbaz Khan (U-68kg) and Ikhtasham-ul-Haq (U-87kg) winning the men’s titles, while Fateema (U-49kg) and Sarah (U-67kg) claimed gold for Army in the women’s events.
Badminton belonged emphatically to Wapda, who swept both the men’s and women’s team event finals.
In the men’s final, Wapda outclassed Army 3-1 with standout performances from Mohammad Ali Larosh and Irfan Saeed. The women’s final was even more one-sided, as Mahoor Shahzad led Wapda to a clinical 3-0 victory.
In softball, Pakistan Army edged Wapda 9-6 to secure the gold medal, while Wapda were crowned overall bodybuilding champions, claiming eight gold medals to continue their dominance in strength sports.
In tug of war, Pakistan Railways claimed gold in the men’s category, while Wapda secured the women’s title.
At the PNS Karsaz range, Navy’s shooters shone brightly. Hadiqa Iqbal took gold in the women’s 50m rifle event, while Navy swept the team category as well.
Abdul Qudoos also delivered gold in the 25m standard pistol, with the Navy team repeating that success. Army’s Colonel Farrukh Nadeem topped the individual trap event.
In wrestling, Wapda extended their grip on the medals table with gold medals for Hammad Butt (61kg) and Inayatullah (74kg), while Army’s Haider Ali delivered a strong performance to win the 86kg title.</p><small>2025-12-10 19:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10230525284de93.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960341/meta-services-will-suffer-slow-performance-for-36-hours-says-ptcl' target='_blank'><strong>Meta services will suffer slow performance for 36 hours, says PTCL</strong></a><br><p>In a strange development, the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) announced on Wednesday that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and other Meta services will experience slow performance for 36 hours starting after midnight on December 11.
The company stated in a customer advisory that due to maintenance activity from 1am on Thursday till 1pm on Friday, Meta services will face degradation as engineers carry out planned technical upgrades.
Meanwhile, an official representing PTCL said that, as the country’s key internet and backend service provider, the company has received user complaints about slower performance or intermittent outages of these services.
Meta has not provided any details regarding the nature of the maintenance or whether it would affect all regions uniformly.
The ‘Meta AI’ tool has disowned any maintenance notice and information regarding service degradation on Facebook, Instagram or other Meta services.
It added, “Meta (formerly Facebook) does perform scheduled maintenance, but check official Meta or Facebook Business channels for confirmation of specific dates and details”.
Incidentally, regarding the notice circulating on social media, ‘Meta AI’ said that it resembled a common tactic in phishing or scam messages that try to appear official.
The AI tool suggested looking for the announcement on Meta’s official status page or news releases, and be cautious about SMS instructions unrelated to the maintenance notice itself, especially those asking to text specific numbers to block messages.
Meta has said that maintenance is routinely conducted and such activities are needed to update backend systems, enhance security layers and improve service efficiency.</p><small>2025-12-10 19:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/102359472b733f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960338/pti-cannot-differentiate-between-anti-establishment-and-anti-army-politics-says-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>PTI cannot ‘differentiate between anti-establishment and anti-army politics,’ says Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Wednesday said the PTI cannot differentiate between “anti-establishment and anti-army” politics, highlighting that PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif always engaged in the former and not the latter.
Yesterday, the Punjab Assembly adopted a resolution to ban incarcerated PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his party for being “anti-state”.
Last week, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
“People hate the establishment, but they love Pakistan and its army. The PTI’s narrative against the army and its leadership is creating political damage for them and could cause the party irreparable harm,” said Sanaullah while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’.
He added that MQM founder Altaf Hussain’s hours-long speeches against the establishment continued for years, but once he said “Pakistan Murdabad” (death to Pakistan), his politics ended.
Referring to the martyrdom of army and officials in terrorism incidents, the PML-N leader said, “PTI delegation doesn’t attend funerals of martyrs and they don’t console their families”.
Their narrative on social media also “aligns with Indian media”, added the prime minister’s adviser.
“The appearance of PTI leaders on Indian media and interviews on it has caused them major political harm,” Sanaullah maintained.
However, PTI leader Barrister Ali Zafar disagreed with Sanaullah. “No Pakistani leader is anti-state. It is regrettable when people accuse someone of being so. However, it is easy to label anyone anti-state, and people have been labelled so in the past.”
In response to the interviews of Noreen Niazi and Aleema Khanum - Imran’s sisters - to separate Indian news channels, Zafar said, “I am no one’s spokesperson. There is no harm in giving one’s opinion to any news channel, but this is my personal opinion.”
“In my capacity, I might not opt to give an interview to any [Indian] news channel that generates anti-Pakistan news. But this doesn’t mean I condemn their [Imran’s sisters] choices. It is a personal choice.”
The PTI, earlier this week, stated that “further attempts to malign” party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan in a bid to diminish his popularity would only cause his popularity to rise with each narrative orchestrated against him.
The party presented its stance during a rally held at Peshawar’s Sports Complex, where its leadership was joined by its political ally, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP). Both parties expressed their solidarity with Imran as they took exception to the recent remarks made against him, urging that “those responsible be held to account” to prevent similar remarks in the future.</p><small>2025-12-10 19:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1016294163663c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960320/ppp-alleges-pml-n-pti-colluding-after-na-proceedings-end-early-during-ppp-led-agenda-item' target='_blank'><strong>PPP alleges PML-N, PTI ‘colluding’ after NA proceedings end early during PPP-led agenda item</strong></a><br><p>The PPP accused the PML-N of “colluding” with the PTI during National Assembly proceedings on Wednesday, after the speaker ended the session early when PTI’s Iqbal Afridi pointed out a “lack of quorum” ahead of an agenda item regarding the renaming of Islamabad International Airport.
The last item on the day’s agenda was a calling-attention notice from First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari and other PPP lawmakers, intended to draw the defence minister’s attention to the delay in naming the New Islamabad International Airport after former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in recognition of her services to democracy and the country.
However, as the day’s proceedings continued, presiding officer Ali Zahid, who belongs to the PML-N, ended the session abruptly during the question hour while PPP MNA Abdul Qadir Patel was speaking.
PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi pointed out the lack of quorum while Patel spoke, prompting the speaker to have the members counted.
“63 members are present, the house is not in order,” Zahid said, ending the session early.
With their mics switched off, PPP lawmakers staged a noisy protest on the floor of the house.
Addressing the media after the session’s abrupt end, PPP MNA Shazia Marri termed the move “a conspiracy” against the PPP, alleging that “it appeared as if the PML-N and PTI were colluding.”
“This reeks of a conspiracy […] the session ended at 11-11:15, not even an hour had passed, and we are now standing here holding a press conference.”
Addressing the media, she said, “Qadir Patel also went to the speaker and spoke to him,” she said, adding that “now that we are standing here with you, it does feel like a conspiracy and intentional”.
“PTI is already quite non-serious[…]however, we were not expecting this from PML-N,” the PPP leader lamented.
The PPP leader, in a veiled warning to the coalition partner, said that “given the state of the country, […] the PML-N ought to be more careful”.
“Meting out such treatment to a party that is mature and sensible is unacceptable,” she said.
Separately, Patel, while speaking to the media afterwards, alleged that PML-N leaders were “sitting in the lobby” while the quorum was called, also terming it a “well-thought-out conspiracy.”
“My question had not yet been completed during the question hour, so how was a member allowed to point out a lack of quorum?” he asked.
“If the location of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Airport has been changed, then why can the name not be changed?”
“Shaheed Benazir does not need any praise; these people are small-minded, and they will remain as such,” Patel said.
Patel vowed that, in case the government does not respond, “the party will decide its future course of action during its next meeting”.
‘Petty tactic’
Meanwhile, in a post on X, Aseefa expressed disappointment “at the behaviour of acting NA speaker,” terming the move a “petty tactic.”
“It has become a mockery to constantly suspend the session despite having quorum. Many had heard the speaker was given instructions to avoid my calling attention notice. A very petty tactic,” the first lady said.







The New Islamabad International Airport (IIAP) was inaugurated by then-prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on May 2, 2018.
In February this year, PPP leader and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor, Faisal Karim Kundi, in a letter to the prime minister, had requested that the airport be renamed to honour the former prime minister, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“Governor Kundi emphasised that the old Islamabad airport was originally named Benazir Bhutto International Airport on June 21, 2008, following her assassination in December 2007,” the report said.
“However, in April 2018, the Aviation Division renamed the newly constructed airport as New Islamabad International Airport, removing Bhutto’s name,” it added.</p><small>2025-12-10 17:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10214243b347aa8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960339/bilawal-says-ptis-extreme-politics-is-putting-the-party-in-jeopardy-opposes-ban' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal says PTI’s ‘extreme politics’ is ‘putting the party in jeopardy’, opposes ban</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday warned that a political party, in an apparent reference to the PTI, risks being banned due to its deliberate targeting of state institutions on social media, and urged it to “abandon such politics.”
A day earlier, the Punjab Assembly adopted a resolution to ban the incarcerated PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his party for being “anti-state”, following remarks by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, who assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric and stated that such narratives were now beyond politics and had become a “national security threat”.
Speaking to the media after visiting the residence of a late senior party worker in Lahore’s Baghbanpura neighbourhood, Bilawal said that the PTI is “targeting” the military leadership through social media and “concocting political conspiracies”.
“They attack institutions when Pakistan is passing through a critical phase,” he said. “I urge them to abandon these politics immediately. They have not only put their own party in jeopardy, but they have also left the political system and the people of Pakistan in a difficult spot.”
In response to a question about whether the PTI should be banned, the PPP chairman said that no political power wants conditions to become so bad that political voices are silenced.
“This will not be my preference or my choice, but what can I do when they continue to pursue extreme politics?” Bilawal asked. “Protest is your right, not entering and attacking military installations.”







The PPP chief also noted that amid a spike in terrorism, the PTI is attacking the institution combating militancy.
“We do not want a ban on any political party, but political forces must adopt a democratic attitude,” he said, adding that it was the government’s responsibility to provide political space to the opposition.
“They (PTI) are creating an environment in which bans could be imposed, what I want is irrelevant,” he said. “Someone needs to tell that man (Imran) to come to his senses and engage in politics. If he wants to do that, political doors will open, but if he wants to lead his party like an army, then he will be dealt with accordingly.”
Bilawal also demanded that the PTI focus on the problems of the people rather than “attacking our national heroes”.
“We will not stand silent while these people abuse our armed forces. We believe that this party is doing the work of the political antichrist,” Bilawal said.
He noted that the PTI’s behaviour amid a deteriorating security landscape in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa may even trigger discussions of governor’s rule, although he had not seen the KP governor’s statement on the matter.
“Governor’s rule is an extreme proposition, but if the political parties and leadership there (KP) weaken the nation and create conditions where it becomes difficult to fight terrorism, then we have the constitutional and legal obligation to impose it.
“The PPP is not demanding it, but the PTI’s actions and choices may lead to governor’s rule or a ban. Neither of those things are good.”
Referring to the brief war with India in May, the PPP chief claimed that Pakistan had responded firmly to Indian aggression, but noted that threats from New Delhi remain present, while terrorism emanating from Afghanistan is an alarming reality.
Bilawal stressed that internal challenges were also being addressed, and at such a time, “It is the responsibility of every patriotic citizen to stand with the country and its armed forces.”
Earlier in 2024, the federal government decided to ban the PTI and sought Article 6 proceedings against Imran, ex-president Dr Arif Alvi, and former National Assembly (NA) deputy speaker Qasim Suri.
The move appeared to be an attempt to prevent the PTI from becoming the single largest party in the NA, following the apex court’s ruling in the reserved seats case. However, the government did not follow through with the ban.
In October, the federal government approved a ban on the religiopolitical party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) under the anti-terrorism act (ATA) following violent protests.
However, banning political groups is not a new practice in Pakistan. It has followed the country across decades — from martial laws to seemingly democratic setups.</p><small>2025-12-10 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10202641b0ff78e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960334/uae-cracks-down-on-visa-abuse-with-new-penalties-for-sheltering-infiltrators' target='_blank'><strong>UAE cracks down on visa abuse with new penalties for ‘sheltering infiltrators’</strong></a><br><p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has introduced harsh penalties for residents sheltering or employing “infiltrators”, as the presence of unidentified or unregistered individuals can lead to security threats, UAE-based Gulf News reported.
The paper reported that harbouring or employing undocumented and illegal migrants carries significant risks, as “infiltrators may engage in illegal activities that threaten public security or help circumvent regulatory authorities”.
“Federal Law No 29 of 2021 on the Entry and Residence of Foreigners imposes strict penalties for this crime, setting fines starting from Dh100,000 and reaching up to Dh5 million in cases involving multiple offenders or organised networks, in addition to a minimum imprisonment term of two months,” Gulf News reported.
It added that legal liability extends to those who offer work, accommodation or support of any kind that enables them to stay in the country illegally.
Per the publication, Emirati law emphasises the importance of complying with the purpose for which a visa is issued — for tourism, work and others.
“Using a visa for purposes other than those intended — such as working while holding a visit or tourist visa — is considered a serious violation that disrupts public order and exposes the offender to legal accountability,” Gulf News reported, adding that this offence is punishable by a Dh10,000 fine.
The report added that enforcing immigration law extends beyond restrictions on entry and exit and covers the forgery of documents and “misuse” of residency credentials. Forgery, according to Gulf News, carries a punishment of 10 years’ imprisonment.
“These penalties reflect the state’s deep understanding of the dangers posed by individuals entering the UAE without completing legal procedures,” Gulf News reported.
“The presence of unidentified or unregistered individuals can lead to security threats that are difficult to detect, in addition to the risk of involvement in unlawful activities. Strict enforcement is therefore essential to ensuring societal stability and protecting both residents and citizens.”
On November 27, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry said that the UAE had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis.
The additional secretary made this revelation during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, further stating that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”.
“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” he warned.
The official said that currently, the UAE was only issuing visas to blue and diplomatic passport holders.</p><small>2025-12-10 15:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/102030001b419a0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960333/australia-begins-enforcing-world-first-teen-social-media-ban' target='_blank'><strong>Australia begins enforcing world-first teen social media ban</strong></a><br><p>Australia on Wednesday became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, blocking access in a move welcomed by many parents and child advocates but criticised by major technology companies and free-speech advocates.
Starting at midnight (1300 GMT on Tuesday), 10 of the largest platforms including TikTok, Alphabet’s YouTube and Meta’s Instagram and Facebook were ordered to block children or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($33 million) under the new law, which is being closely watched by regulators worldwide.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called it “a proud day” for families and cast the law as proof that policymakers can curb online harms that have outpaced traditional safeguards.
“This will make an enormous difference. It is one of the biggest social and cultural changes that our nation has faced,” Albanese told a news conference on Wednesday.
“It’s a profound reform which will continue to reverberate around the world.”
Read a book instead, PM tells youngsters
In a video message, Albanese urged children to “start a new sport, new instrument, or read that book that has been sitting there for some time on your shelf,” ahead of Australia’s summer school break starting later this month.
Some of those below the cut-off age of 16 were anxious about adjusting to life without social media, but others were less concerned.
“I’m not really that emotional about it,” said 14-year-old Claire Ni. “I’m kind of just, like, neutral.” Luna Dizon, 15, said she still had access to her TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat accounts, but worried about “culture shock” once the ban took full effect.
“I think eventually, without (social media), we’ll learn how to adapt to it,” she added.
Teenager signs off with ‘see you when I’m 16’
While the government has said the ban would not be perfect in its operation, about 200,000 accounts were deactivated by Wednesday on TikTok alone, with “hundreds of thousands” more to be blocked in the next few days.
Many of the estimated 1 million children affected by the legislation also posted goodbye messages on social media.
“No more social media … no more contact with the rest of the world,” one teen wrote on TikTok.
“#seeyouwhenim16,” said another.
Others said they would learn how to get round the ban.
“It’s just kind of pointless, we’re just going to create new ways to get on these platforms, so what’s the point,” said 14-year-old Claire Ni.
Ban has global implications
The rollout caps a year of debate over whether any country could practically stop children from using platforms embedded in daily life, and begins a live test for governments frustrated that social media firms have been slow to implement harm-reduction measures.
“I’m happy that they want to protect kids, and I’m happy that we have a chance to see how they do it and see if we can learn from them,” said European Union lawmaker Christel Schaldemose, who wants to see greater protection for the bloc’s children.
Albanese’s centre-left government proposed the landmark law citing research showing harms to mental health from the overuse of social media among young teens, including misinformation, bullying and harmful depictions of body image. Several countries from Denmark to New Zealand to Malaysia have signalled they may study or emulate Australia’s model.
At a school in the German city of Bonn, students spoke favourably of a ban.
“Social media is highly addictive and doesn’t really have any real advantages. I mean, there are advantages, such as being able to spread your opinion, but I think the disadvantages, especially the addiction, are much worse,” said 15-year-old pupil Arian Klaar.
Julie Inman Grant, the US-born eSafety Commissioner who is overseeing the ban, told Reuters on Wednesday a groundswell of American parents wanted similar measures.
“I hear from the parents and the activists and everyday people in America, ‘we wish we had an eSafety commissioner like you in America, we wish we had a government that was going to put tween and teen safety before technology profits,’” she said in an interview at her office in Sydney.
‘Not our choice’: X says will comply
Elon Musk’s X became the last of the 10 major platforms to take measures to cut off access to underage teens after publicly acknowledging on Wednesday that it would comply.
“It’s not our choice - it’s what the Australian law requires,” X said on its website.
Australia has said the initial list of covered platforms would change as new products emerge and young users migrate.
Companies have told Canberra they will deploy a mix of age inference - estimating a user’s age from their behaviour - and age estimation based on a selfie, alongside checks that could include uploaded identification documents.
For social media businesses, the implementation marks a new era of structural stagnation as user numbers flatline and time spent on platforms shrinks, studies show.
Platforms say they earn little from advertising to under-16s, but warn the ban disrupts a pipeline of future users. Just before the ban took effect, 86% of Australians aged eight to 15 used social media, the government said.</p><small>2025-12-10 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/10181844be9ac76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960329/collapse-of-two-buildings-in-moroccos-fez-kills-19' target='_blank'><strong>Collapse of two buildings in Morocco’s Fez kills 19</strong></a><br><p>Two four-storey buildings collapsed in the Moroccan city of Fez, killing at least 19 people, according to a provisional toll reported by the country’s official news agency on Wednesday.
“Sixteen other people were wounded, with varying degrees of severity,” the Maghreb Arabe Press (MAP) agency reported, adding that search operations were still ongoing to “save other people who may be buried under the rubble”.
The two adjacent structures, which housed eight families, collapsed overnight in the major northern city’s Al-Moustakbal neighbourhood, in the Al-Massira area, according to MAP.
Images from the pre-dawn scene showed first responders carrying a corpse in a grey body bag to waiting emergency vehicles, as residents gathered to watch the rescue efforts.
Other workers, using jackhammers and pickaxes, tried to dig through the rubble, occasionally assisted by mechanical excavators. Local authorities have indicated that the toll could rise in the coming hours.
MAP reported that safety officials had conducted “necessary preventative measures”, including securing the surrounding area and evacuating neighbouring buildings. The agency added that the injured were taken to Fez’s University Hospital Centre.

The accident was one of the deadliest of its kind in recent years. In February last year, five people died in the collapse of a house in Fez’s old city.
Nearly a decade ago, in 2016, there were two deadly building collapses within the span of a week. One was a home in the western city of Marrakech that killed two children, while the other was a four-storey building that killed four people and injured two dozen more.
In 2014, three buildings in the western city of Casablanca collapsed, killing 23 people.</p><small>2025-12-10 15:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1019520980c55a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960312/war-of-words-between-pti-and-ruling-coaltion-continues-pml-ns-ikhtiar-wali-says-things-have-reached-point-of-no-return' target='_blank'><strong>War of words between PTI and ruling coaltion continues; PML-N’s Ikhtiar Wali says ‘things have reached point of no return’</strong></a><br><p>The war of words between members of the PTI and ruling coalition continued on Wednesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”.
The tensions have particularly intensified in recent days after the spokesperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on December 6, in response to Imran’s latest outburst against the military leadership.
Politicians from various parties have rallied behind the armed forces since, chastising the PTI. Yesterday, the Punjab Assembly also adopted a resolution calling for a ban on Imran and his party, terming them “anti-state”.
‘Things have reached a point of no return’
Earlier today, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan said that “things have reached a point of no return”.
Addressing a press conference, Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance.”
“All doors to talks are now closed,” Wali said.
He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour, and development”.
“We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what [else] can be done”.
Wali alleged that “PTI, in its four years in power, had done nothing,” challenging the party to “show at least one university, hospital or dam” they built.
“It was a blessing from God that the Centre, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan have remained safe from the PTI’s dirty politics,” he remarked, warning that the government “will now set KP free as well.”
‘Common sense should prevail’
Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament.
Among them, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections.
“We did not stage a sit-in back then […] We sat in Parliament, believing that our voices will be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties will be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years.
But, he continued, “at some point, common sense should prevail”.
Seemingly referring to the bar on meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, he added: “If you keep parents in jail, […] how can the children sit together with you? And if you don’t understand this, then probably the public will make you understand.”
He again stressed that the use of force would not yield any results. “Common sense should prevail.”
Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.” In this connection, he also claimed that Imran had the support of at least 70 per cent people in the country.
“Don’t enrage the people of Pakistan,” he warned, adding that “we haven’t done anything in violation of the Constitution”.
He emphasised that meetings with Imran should be allowed, pointing out that the high court had also issued an order, directing that meetings with the former prime minister be permitted.
“If you create hurdles [in this regard], then we don’t know what your intentions are. But if you get a response from the other side, the country and democracy would suffer a loss,” he warned, adding that whether the government did not want the PTI to sit in Parliament.
He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.
The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.”
“You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked.
‘Meeting necessary for dialogue’
Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside Parliament.
Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan.
“How can we negotiate without his permission?”
Referring to the PTI’s sit-in outside the Adiala jail the previous night for Imran’s visitation rights and the alleged use of force by authorities to disperse the protesters, he said the leg of PTI parliamentary leader in the National Assembly Shahid Khattak “had been broken”.
He warned, “If the public rises, everything will burn down. Before destruction strikes, we should move towards dialogue.” And for that, he reiterated, meetings with the PTI founder should be allowed.
For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “national conference” on December 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited.
A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.“
Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adialia jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”.
Moreover, he demanded that merit should be considered in cases concerning Imran, further stating: “We are united; we will not be afraid.”
‘Dark period’
Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addresses a press conference, assailing the PTI its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history.
“He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said. “It is the same Khan who was willing to give General Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.”
“Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?”
The senior minister stressed that PTI’s narrative “hinged only on the release of Imran and the party coming back into power,” adding that “they did not care about the common people.”
PTI’s ‘venomous rhetoric should be recognised abroad’: Aun Chaudhry
Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, in a press conference in Islamabad, called on overseas Pakistanis to recognise the “venomous rhetoric” being spread by PTI.
“I want the overseas Pakistanis to identify and acknowledge these groups,” Chaudhry said.
“I want my nation, my Pakistanis, to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong,” he urged.
“Our country is progressing towards success, but this group is creating such an environment,” the minister said.
He continued: “It’s tweeting against the military leadership, sometimes against the government, who is getting it done? Who is the mastermind behind it? Whoever is behind it does not want peace in this country. They don’t want this country to progress.”
“Don’t you think about the martyred soldier and his orphaned kids? Don’t you pay heed that the soldier sacrifices his life and leaves his own kids as orphans so that other kids don’t become orphans? So that we can enjoy a sound sleep?” the minister questioned.
“We have a secure border and a secure future because our armed forces are backing us,” Chaudhry added.
