Earlier this week, the government promoted Gen Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his “strategic leadership and decisive role” in defeating India during the military confrontation between the two countries that ended with a US-mediated ceasefire.
Field marshal is the highest rank in armies modelled after the British Army. In Pakistan, it was awarded only once before, to General Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1959.
Speaking to reporters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail yesterday after meeting with incarcerated ex-premier Imran Khan, Gohar said: “A long time has passed. The PTI is a major party, Khan sahib is the most popular leader. We want these difficulties to end now.
“This is why I am saying that the [army chief] has gotten this new honour of field marshal. [We] have congratulated but after this new honour, there is an increased responsibility on him to play his role even more and make the situation better.”

Responding to a question, Gohar said that the PTI would issue a formal stance on the development. He added, “We have no strife with the military. Khan sahib also said yesterday that we stand with our armed forces and whoever is related to the armed forces will be uncontroversial.”
“Contacts have not been restored for now, but it is definitely our desire. Khan sahib has said that we never closed the door for talks with the establishment,” Gohar further said.
Gohar’s comments echoed those stated in a post on Imran’s X account, wherein the ex-PM said he was willing to speak to those who have power, in the best interest of the country.
Asked specifically about alleged intervention in politics, Gohar said, “We all say that the military should have no role in politics, […] and I say that whatever happens should be above politics.
“After all, it is a major institution. It has had an influence and remains, so I will request that whoever can play their role in making the situation better to do so,” the PTI leader added.
The elevation, first cleared by the federal cabinet and later communicated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to President Asif Ali Zardari, marks the first such promotion in over six decades.
 
 

The government also announced a second, open-ended extension in the tenure of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu, making him the first Pakistan Air Force head to receive two extensions.
Gohar also spoke about India, saying that “an air of war was still lingering”.
He termed that the Pakistani forces had secured an “amazing victory, which India could not have even imagined”. “In my opinion, this war was even more serious than the 1965 or 1971 wars, because both countries are now nuclear powers,” he highlighted.
However, he cautioned the nation to remain united and alert against India’s “another such attempt and nefarious intentions”.
Implications for military hierarchy
A Ministry of Defence notification said that Gen Munir’s promotion to field marshal had been made under Rule 199A of the Army Regulations (Rules) 1998.
The rules are classified, but according to a military source, the mentioned rule reads: “199-A. Promotion to field marshal. A general officer, whether serving or retired, may be promoted to the rank of field marshal by the federal government without regard to seniority or any specific appointment.”
However, experts noted the silence of the Constitution and the Pakistan Army Act on such an appointment.
 
 

While the rank does not grant additional operational authority, its conferral during a period of heightened regional tension carries strategic and political symbolism. It may also bolster Field Marshal Munir’s standing both within the military and in political circles, particularly amid ongoing internal instability and civil-military friction.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed, who previously headed the Senate defence committee, noted: “Field Marshal Asim Munir is now very much in the driving seat as the pivot of the power structure, more so, given the weakness and divisions amongst the civilian politicians. Even before May, which has become an inflection point for Pakistan, for India and for South Asia, all the mainstream political forces were convinced that the road to Islamabad lies through Rawalpindi.”
COAS Munir’s promotion is not expected to alter operational command but serves as a symbolic acknowledgement of his wartime leadership.
The global precedent supports this view. In India, Field Marshals Sam Manekshaw (1973) and K.M. Cariappa (1986) were promoted purely for ceremonial reasons, with no changes to the army’s structure. Similarly, in the United Kingdom and the United States, five-star titles have historically honoured extraordinary service during major wars without altering command frameworks.</p><small>2025-05-23 04:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23073951b0471f5.jpg?r=094316' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912760/army-chiefs-elevation-to-field-marshal-splits-pti' target='_blank'><strong>Army chief’s elevation to field marshal splits PTI</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: There appears to be a split in the PTI over Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir’s promotion to the rank of field marshal, as its interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan felicitated the newly appointed field marshal as opposed to the incarcerated party founder, Imran Khan, who criticised the government’s move.
If a message posted on his X handle is to be believed, Imran Khan criticised the promotion in his interaction with lawyers, family members, and journalists during a hearing in the Adiala Jail  courtroom on Wednesday. The tweet was posted on Thursday morning,  however. It may be noted that the PTI leader had also met his sisters and lawyers, including Salman Safdar and Usman Gill, on the jail premises on  Wednesday.
 






The former premier doesn’t have access to his X account and someone else posts on his behalf, but the PTI has never revealed the identity of Mr Khan’s social media handler.
The PTI founder said it would have been more app­ropriate if Gen Asim Munir had been declared ‘king’ as Pakistan was being run according to the ‘law of the jungle’. He quipped that in the law of the jungle, “there is only one king”.
The harsh stance taken by the former prime minister comes in contrast to his party leaders, particularly Gohar Ali Khan, who also met him in jail on Thursday. Barrister Gohar told a local news channel that Allah has given the honour to COAS Asim Munir and also entailed responsibility. “I request all to improve/normalise the situation of the country,” he said.
Dawn.com quoted him as saying that there would be a formal statement by the PTI on the development. “This is why I am saying that the [army chief] has gotten this new honour of field marshal. [We] have congratulated, but after this new honour, there is an increased responsibility on him to play his role even more and make the situation better,” he told reporters outside the jail as per Dawn.com.

“We have no strife with the military. Khan sahib also said yesterday that we stand with our armed forces and whoever is related to the armed forces will be uncontroversial,” he added.
PTI leader’s sister Aleema Khan criticised the interim chairman, Barrister Gohar, in her interaction with media persons, saying that he gave the statement felicitating the army chief in his personal capacity. The opinion of the party is not the opinion of Barrister Gohar, she added.
“We have given the statement of the founder of PTI yesterday,” she said, adding that Barrister Gohar could speak for the PTI in the presence of the party founder. The founder clearly said yesterday (Wednesday) that there was “a law of the jungle here, it would be better if the army chief gave himself the title of the king”, she added.
Earlier this week, the federal cabinet approved the promotion of COAS Asim Munir to the rank of field marshal for his leadership in the recent conflict with India known as ‘Marka-i-Haq’.
‘No deal’
A post on Mr Khan’s X account said the rumours regarding a deal were not correct, but he still invited the establishment for talks for the sake of the country.
The post added Mr Khan did not want any deal or relief.
It was “unfortunate that the law only applied to the weak in Pakistan and it was against the principles of democracy and the rule of law”.
The post also criticised the drone attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and directed the provincial government to register a protest with the federal government and make sure that it was not repeated. He said that the killing of people with drones cannot reduce terrorism.
It added that Pakistan made a lot of efforts to stop drone attacks by the United States, adding that bombs should not be dropped on own people.
As per the post, Mr Khan praised the role of armed forces, especially the air force, which thwarted Narendra Modi’s attempts to attack Pakistan and suggested they be ready for such actions in future.
Gandapur’s IMF warning
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur warned the federal government that it could reconsider its cooperation with the federal government over the IMF conditions if party leaders were not allowed to meet the incarcerated leader.
Speaking to media persons outside Adiala Jail after meeting Imran Khan, the CM said the PTI founding leader was willing to initiate dialogue “in the best interest of Pakistan”.
He said that if party leaders were denied access to Imran Khan, the PTI would reconsider its cooperation with the government, including on key issues like compliance with IMF conditions.
Meanwhile, the PTI spokesperson issued a statement, condemning the delays in scheduling bail hearings in the cases of the party’s founding chairman.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a statement on Thursday, flayed the regime for allegedly subjecting Imran Khan to harsh conditions.
“Such oppressive and sinister tactics are destined to fail, as (Imran) Khan’s spirit remains unbroken and resolute as the entire nation stands firmly behind its leader. PTI will not hold talks…because they (government) did not have legal, constitutional and moral authorities in this regard,” he claimed.
He emphasised that the government should not trust India and refrain from resuming dialogue until it renounces terrorism, restores the Indus Waters Treaty, and reinstates the constitutional status of occupied Kashmir.

• Govt seeks relief measures in budget; Fund reviewing proposals
ISLAMABAD: Amid week-long talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on next fiscal year’s budget, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fast-track institutional reforms and maintain macroeconomic stability.
During a meeting with an IMF delegation led by Regional Director for the Middle East and South Asia, Jihad Azour, the prime minister said the country was now firmly on the path of economic development after a period of recovery and stability.
“By the grace of Allah, Pakistan is now moving from economic stability towards sustainable growth,” PM Shehbaz said in an official statement.
He said the government’s top priority was to sustain macroeconomic gains and expedite comprehensive institutional reforms, crucial for long-term resilience.
The high-level meeting took place at the last leg of negotiations between an IMF staff mission and Pakistan’s economic team to finalise next year’s budget in line with commitments made as part of the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility. The IMF mission has been in formal engagements with authorities since May 14 and is slated to conclude the visit on Friday (May 23).
The Fund wants the initial achievements under the programme to move into the next phase without compromising programme objectives. Central to that phase include effective implementation of Agricultural Income Tax across provinces, tangible recoveries from the retail sector alongside expansion of the tax net, financial devolution, and greater contribution from provinces for national security.
The engagements are likely to continue virtually until the announcement of the federal and provincial budgets and their passage by parliament to ensure no lapses from agreed budgetary propositions.
Sources said Pakistan has proposed modest relief measures in the upcoming budget, including a slight reduction in super tax, incentives for the real estate sector and relief for the salaried class.
However, the IMF has yet to reach a conclusion and is still examining the viability of such measures in the context of revenue target and expenditures and possible recoveries from litigation cases.
During the meeting, also attended by ministers for finance, planning, and economic affairs, besides the finance secretary and the FBR chairman, the discussions focused on the implementation and progress of the ongoing IMF loan programme. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the economic reforms undertaken by the government and their accruing positive outcomes, the official statement said.
The IMF delegation acknowledged the progress made under the reform agenda and assured the prime minister of continued support from the Fund in the country’s efforts for economic stability and inclusive growth, the statement added.
PM meets WB team
Separately, the prime minister also met a World Bank delegation led by Managing Director of Operations Anna Bjerde on Thursday and assured her of the steadfast implementation of the economic reform programme necessary to build a solid and sustainable growth. He told the delegation that the government was taking practical steps to achieve maximum benefits from the World Bank’s development investment.
He hoped that the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework would bring more than $20bn in development investment to Pakistan and appreciated the World Bank’s assistance to the victims of the 2022 floods in Pakistan that had impacted millions of people, destroying livelihoods and properties.
Ms Bjerde said that the World Bank valued its historic partnership with the government of Pakistan for the development and prosperity of its people. She also expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz for his effective role in strengthening the partnership and implementing the Country Partnership Programme.
Also appreciating Pakistan’s recent exemplary economic performance and stability, she said that through its positive actions for macroeconomic stability, Pakistan had achieved the impossible and the bank looked forward to continued cooperation to achieve the positive outcomes of the Country Partnership Framework and uplift the Pakistani people for which policy continuity for sustainable and inclusive growth was necessary.

Even while leverage is slipping from its hands, the party remains in two minds about whether it ought to negotiate a way out or continue on its path of ‘resistance’. It believes that “it is in Pakistan’s interest” for the state to engage with the PTI, but has never really explained what it is willing to concede in return. It is also quite unjustified to demand that politics be reduced to a zero-sum game between PTI on one side and all other parties on the other. To top it off, Imran Khan continues to maintain a frustrating ambiguity about his position on negotiations, even with the establishment. His remarks to confidantes, which often make their way to social media, seem to consistently undermine the work his own party leaders have been doing to start a dialogue. This chaotic approach has taken a toll on the party. Over time, the urgency for a negotiated settlement has gradually subsided, and the ruling regime has used its position to manufacture various new means of ensuring its continuity in power. Meanwhile, the PTI has been able to make little headway towards its goals.
At some point, the party should have reconsidered whether its approach was the right one. While the government may be unpopular with the public, and its legitimacy may continue to remain in doubt, its legislative measures have now ensured that it would be difficult to dislodge it. Indeed, the country has paid, and continues to pay, a steep price for maintaining the status quo, and it is in the nation’s long-term interest that a political ceasefire is reached soon. Things must return to normal. Unfortunately, the appetite for ‘normalcy’ appears to be running out, and the ‘power is power’ doctrine has been gaining in force. But while it is still by and large the PTI that is on the losing end today, the backward slide does not bode well for Pakistani democracy in general. In the absence of defined rules of the game, the political class remains at the mercy of non-political forces and their agendas. It is better for the different parties to work out a modus vivendi based on fair principles and mutual respect than to resign themselves to playing second fiddle in policymaking and governance.

• House passes resolution urging govt to condemn India for suspending Indus Waters Treaty
ISLAMABAD: Days before presentation of the federal budget for the next fiscal year, the National Assembly on Thursday passed an IMF-dictated money bill through a supplementary agenda and without any debate.
The Off the Grid (Captive Power Plants) Levy Bill, 2025, aimed at providing legal justification for the grid levy imposed on the supply of natural gas or imported liquefied natural gas to industrial captive power plants (CPPs) as of March 7, was tabled by Minister for Petroleum Division Ali Pervaiz after the house suspended the rules.
The minister moved the motion for the passage of the bill soon after presentation of the report of the standing committee on petroleum by its chairman Mustafa Mehmood. The bill cleared all the required stages in just one day as the committee had also approved it in a meeting held minutes before start of the NA session.
The opposition challenged the ruling of the chair on the motion allowing the minister to present the bill for passage, but faced a 99-44 vote defeat after the headcount.
Earlier on May 17, the NA had passed the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2024.
According to an official handout, during the meeting of the NA Standing Committee on Petroleum on Thursday morning, the petroleum minister gave a detailed briefing on the bill, highlighting its significance as part of Pakistan’s commitments under the International Monetary Fund’s Extended Fund Facility.
He noted that while the phase-out of captive power generation had long been under consideration, its implementation had been delayed due to prolonged political and economic constraints.
The minister emphasised that transitioning industries from captive power systems to the national grid was intended to optimise surplus electricity generation, improve efficiency in the power sector, and relieve financial pressures on the economy.
The minister informed the committee that a comprehensive consultation process had been completed in drafting the bill and acknowledged the instrumental role played by the NA speaker in facilitating this process.
He assured the committee that the bill was aimed at serving public interest without disrupting industrial operations and that protections for the industrial sector had been incorporated. He also highlighted high electricity prices as a major concern and underscored the need to fulfill public demand through grid supply.
It may be recalled that the government had already enforced the law through an ordinance and in March it had notified an increase in gas rates for industrial CPPs by about 23pc and scale down temptation for a substantial cut in power rates to get the policy negotiations going with the IMF in March this year.
Since the ordinance was about to complete its constitutional life, it was necessary for the government to get its approval from the National Assembly. Since it was a money bill, it was not required to be passed by the Senate.
However, the Senate committee on finance, which was only required to give recommendations to the NA, approved it without making any recommendations on May 16.
Resolution
Besides this, the National Assembly also passed a unanimous resolution calling on the government to strongly condemn India’s unilateral decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), terming it a clear violation of the agreement and an “act of war.”
The resolution was presented by Minister for Water Resources Mueen Wattoo after a brief debate on the matter before the chair, Abdul Qadir Patel of the PPP, read out prorogation order of the president, thus announcing the end of the summer session which had begun on May 5.
In their speeches, the lawmakers criticised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for suspending the treaty and accused him of acting with a hostile mindset.
The lawmakers also condemned the school bus attack in Khuzdar, blaming India for supporting the attackers.
Earlier, the proceedings of the assembly remained suspended for few minutes during the Question Hour when PTI Iqbal Afridi pointed out lack of quorum.

• Senate panel slams India’s ‘provocative action’
NEW DELHI: Pakistan will not get water from rivers over which India has rights, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday, a month after a deadly attack in India-held Kashmir led New Delhi to suspend a key river water-sharing treaty between the neighbours.
The attorney general for Pakistan, in an interview with Reuters, responded that Islam­abad remained willing to discuss water sharing between the neighbours but said India must stick to the decades-old treaty.
The suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, was among a slew of measures announced by India against Pakistan last month after the April 22 Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people.
New Delhi had said the attack was backed by Pakistan, an accusation Islamabad den­ied and the nuclear-armed neig­hbours were involved in their worst military fighting in nearly three decades before agreeing to a ceasefire on May 10.
“Pakistan will have to pay a heavy price for every terrorist attack … Pakistan’s army will pay it, Pakistan’s economy will pay it,” Modi said at a public event in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, which borders Pakistan.
 
 

The Indus treaty provides water for 80 per cent of Pakistan’s farms from three rivers that flow from India but Pakistan’s finance minister said this month that its suspension was not going to have “any immediate impact”.
The AGP, Mansoor Usman Awan, told Reuters that Pakistan is “willing to talk about or to address anything”.
He said India had written to Pakistan in recent weeks, citing population growth and clean energy needs as reasons to modify the treaty. But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty.
The treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said.
“As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,” he added.
The ceasefire between the countries has largely held, with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar saying there is no exchange of fire currently and “there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly”.
“The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message…that if there are acts of the kind we saw on April 22, there will be a response, we will hit the terrorists,” Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS.
“If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,” he added.
Senate committee
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources on Thu­rs­day said India’s actions threatening Pakistan’s water security were “illegal”.
The committee members warned Pakistan would not tolerate such provocations.
The meeting, presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan, discussed the IWT in the light of India’s actions.
Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Mehar Ali Shah briefed the panel on the issue.
He said the treaty was a bilateral agreement between Pakistan and India and cannot be held in abeyance unilaterally.
The committee unanimously condemned India’s “unlawful and unilateral” declaration of holding the treaty 1960 in abeyance.
“This provocative action would lead to a dangerous escalation and direct threat to the water security, agricultural productivity and livelihoods of 250 million Pakistani citizens that cannot be tolerated by Pakistan”, said the committee in a unanimous statement.
It said the World Bank president had also recently endorsed that the international agreement could not be held in abeyance by one party and continued.
“The committee is of the view that the treaty remains in force and must be implemented in letter and spirit.”
The members vowed to “vigorously defend” Pakistan’s rights under the treaty at all international forums.
This treaty is critically important for Pakistan as a lower-riparian state whose food security and agricultural productivity depend on consistent access to these waters, especially given our increasing climate vulnerability and erratic monsoon cycles, the committee observed.
The committee also condemned India’s attack on the Neelum Jehlum project, calling the action “nothing less than water warfare and aggression”.
“India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty constitutes a red line for the people of Pakistan and the continued interference with Pakistan’s rightful water access under the treaty could threaten the recently established ceasefire between the two countries”, the panel asserted.
The meeting called upon the international community to take immediate notice of India’s aggression.
“We urge all responsible members of the global community to impress upon India, the importance of honoring its international obligations.”
The panel reaffirmed that Pakistan was committed to a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues with India, including the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.
However, Pakistan “will not compromise on existential water rights”.

“PIA has decided to operate a weekly flight from Lahore to Paris every Wednesday,” a spokesman for PIA said. “With the launch of this flight, three direct flights per week will become part of PIA’s operations.”
The new route is part of the airline’s broader strategy to extend its network to Europe and meet growing demand from the Pakistani diaspora in France and Pakistan, the spokesman said.
“This direct route to Paris addresses a long-standing demand from the Pakistani community, offering affordable fares and time savings,” the spokesman added.
Earlier this year, to mark the relaunch of PIA flights from Islamabad to Paris, the airline decorated a Boeing 777 aircraft with a model of the Eiffel Tower on its tail and the slogan “I Love Paris” on the nose. The aircraft was modified to meet European Union aviation standards.
PIA had also previously introduced a wireless in-flight entertainment system on the Islamabad-Paris route, allowing passengers to access entertainment on their personal devices.

Titled, ‘Action on Armed Violence’ (AOAV), the report notes that the casualties in 2024 represent a nine per cent decrease from 2023.  However, there was a 11 per cent increase in incidents compared to 218 in 2023. Pakistan was listed at seventh position among the 15 most affected countries and territories in 2024.
The majority of civilians harmed was attributed to non-state actors, who were reported responsible for 76pc of civilian casualties.  In particular, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) killed and injured 119 civilians in Pakistan last year.
 
 

The BLA is among the biggest non-state users of explosive weapons in 2024, and it was the reported perpetrator of 15pc civilian casualties, marking a 440pc increase from 22 incidents recorded in 2023. Unknown non-state actors accounted for 54pc of civilian casualties (423), down from 541 recorded civilian casualties in 2023.
All suicide bombings in the country were carried out by non-state actors, most notably, of the known non-state actors, were the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), who were responsible for 2pc of all 9 incidents, but 89pc (92) of civilian casualties resulting from suicide bombings. Unknown non-state actors accounted for 6pc (5) of incidents, and 11pc of civilian casualties.
Overall, 2024 saw the highest number of recorded incidents in Pakistan since 2014, and the second highest number of civilian casualties since 2018, and the second highest number of armed actor casualties since 2015.

Trump is furious at Harvard, which has produced 162 Nobel prize winners, for rejecting his demand that it submit to oversight on admissions and hiring over his claims that it is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and “woke” liberal ideology.
“Effective immediately, Harvard University’s Student and Exchange Visitor (Sevis) Programme certification is revoked,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in a letter to the Ivy League institution, referring to the main system by which foreign students are permitted to study in the United States.
Last month, Trump threatened to stop Harvard from enrolling foreign students if it did not agree to government demands that would put the private institution under outside political supervision.
“As I explained to you in my April letter, it is a privilege to enrol foreign students,” Noem wrote.
“All universities must comply with Department of Homeland Security requirements, including reporting requirements under the Student and Exchange Visitor Programme regulations, to maintain this privilege,” she said.
“As a result of your refusal to comply with multiple requests to provide the Department of Homeland Security pertinent information while perpetuating an unsafe campus environment that is hostile to Jewish students, promotes pro-Hamas sympathies, and employs racist ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ policies, you have lost this privilege.”
More than 27 per cent of Harvard’s enrollment was made up of foreign students in the 2024-25 academic year, according to university data.

Rescue 1122 Mardan spokesperson Mohammad Abbas Shah told Dawn.com that the incident took place on Wednesday and that a case was registered at Shahbaz Garhi police station on the complaint of the victim’s sister.
“Five suspects opened fire on the victims, Qubad Khan and his sons, in a field in the Gariala area of Mardan,” Shah said. “The victim and his young sons died at the scene, while women nearby were able to narrowly escape.”
He added that the suspects were able to flee the scene after the incident.
According to the police report, seen by Dawn.com, the suspects were charged under sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of a common object), 302 (punishment for murder) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Earlier this week, six people, including three women, lost their lives in an exchange of fire over a family feud in the Khatko Pul area of Peshawar, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.
Seven people were reported to have been shot in the exchange of fire between two families, six of whom died on the spot.
The deceased have been identified as Fazl Amin, Hazrat Amin, Ahmed, along with three women.

The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since the student-led revolt that ousted then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, with parties protesting on the streets over a string of demands.
The interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has promised democratic reforms and vowed polls will be held by June 2026 at the latest.
However, New York-based HRW said Yunus risked following the example of Hasina in clamping down on opponents.
“Instead of pursuing its pledge to reform the criminal justice system and bring accountability for serious abuses, the government … is attempting to suppress the rights of supporters of the deposed leader,” the rights group said in a statement.
HRW said the government had used “newly introduced powers under a draconian amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act” to suppress Hasina’s party.
Hasina’s government was blamed for extensive human rights abuses and protesters demanded that Yunus take action.
The government banned Hasina’s Awami League party on May 12 after days of protests outside Yunus’s house, pending the trial of Hasina and other key leaders.
Hasina, 77, fled to India and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.
“Imposing a ban on any speech or activity deemed supportive of a political party is an excessive restriction on fundamental freedoms that mirrors the previous government’s abusive clampdown on political opponents,” HRW said.
“Hasina’s government abused legal powers to silence political opponents, but using similar methods against the supporters of her Awami League party would also violate those same fundamental freedoms,” said HRW’s Meenakshi Ganguly.</p><small>2025-05-22 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22224251d8f46b0.jpg?r=224622' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912639/france-detains-55-men-in-child-sex-abuse-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>France detains 55 men in child sex abuse crackdown</strong></a><br><p>Fifty-five men, including a priest, a paramedic, and a music teacher, were arrested in France this week as part of an operation to dismantle a suspected paedophile ring operating via the Telegram messaging app, authorities said on Thursday.
The arrests took place in 42 departments over possession, distribution and regular viewing of pornography involving children “under the age of 10”, France’s OFMIN, which is tasked with preventing violence against minors, told AFP.
OFMIN issued the warrant that led to the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov in Paris in 2024, and he remains under formal investigation by French authorities over illegal content on the popular service.
The arrests of the 55 men aged 25 to 75, which followed a 10-month investigation, took place from Monday to Thursday.
The men exchanged messages on Telegram and were in contact with “extremely dangerous” child sex abusers who have been in prison since last summer, Quentin Bevan, head of OFMIN’s operational unit, told AFP.
The large-scale operation began last summer with the arrest of individuals suspected of abusing children and posting images on Telegram. The suspects are being investigated for human trafficking and face life imprisonment.
“It took 10 months of investigation to track down these child abusers,” Bevan said. “Ten months of undercover work involving thousands of exchanges, analysis and detection of paedophile images by a task force set up at the OFMIN.”
The suspects either have children or grandchildren, or come into contact with children at work. Some of the suspects boasted of abusing children while they slept, but now claim they did not actually commit any crimes, according to investigators.
‘Pedophile den’
In a separate case, Durov has been charged with several counts of failing to curb extremist content.
Investigators have confronted him with specific cases ranging from child abuse to drug trading, scams, arms sales and the hiring of hitmen.
The Russian-born entrepreneur has since announced steps appearing to bow to Paris’s demands.
While Bevan acknowledged progress in Telegram’s cooperation with investigators since Durov’s arrest, he said the platform was “barely fulfilling its legal obligations”.
He said that Telegram remains a “pedophile den” and a “platform of choice” for child abusers.
Telegram rejected the accusation in a statement on Thursday, saying that it “meets and exceeds its legal obligations to fight harmful content”.
The messaging platform has “always complied with EU law” and “consistently responded to all binding legal requests for years”, the company added.
Durov says Telegram has also sought to fight against child abuse for years.
In June 2024, France shut down the adult website Coco which was used to commit numerous sex crimes such as child sex abuse and rape.
After that, some perpetrators of child sex abuse are believed to have switched to Telegram, according to an investigator.</p><small>2025-05-22 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22212742d719f5f.jpg?r=212925' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912633/several-dead-as-plane-crashes-on-california-neighbourhood' target='_blank'><strong>Several dead as plane crashes on California neighbourhood</strong></a><br><p>Several people are feared dead after a small plane crashed into a California neighbourhood before dawn on Thursday, destroying homes and setting cars on fire.
At least 10 houses were burned or hit by debris that spread over a wide area, and cars on both sides of a street were set on fire when the Cessna 550 slammed into the ground in San Diego.
“There are more than one fatality that we found so far, but we’re waiting to get the registered numbers that were on the plane itself,” said San Diego’s Assistant Fire Department Chief Dan Eddy.
“When it hit the street, as the jet fuel went down, it took out every single car that was on both sides of the street,” he said, adding: “We have jet fuel all over the place.”
Footage of the immediate aftermath of the crash showed a line of burning fuel linking the flaming cars.
Eddy said “miraculously” no one on the ground had been killed or seriously hurt.
Daylight revealed what a close call it had been for some people, with images showing the roof of one home blackened and collapsing. Vehicles were twisted and charred, with one still burning.
“We have one car fire that just will not go out no matter what we put on it right now,” Eddy told reporters.
The accident happened in thick fog when the plane, which had come from Kansas, was nearing the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport.
The plane, which can carry up to eight people, went down around 3:45am (1145 GMT, 4:45pm PKT), according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), striking the Murphy Canyon neighbourhood.
The residential area it hit is largely military housing. San Diego is home to US Navy facilities, Marine Corps bases and Coast Guard stations.
Zane Baker, a high school senior who lives in the area, said police officers had gone door-to-door getting people out of their homes.
“I immediately just rushed to the front door, just looking outside, seeing what’s happening,” he told broadcaster KTLA. “I made sure all my siblings were awake and they were conscious and they were okay.”
Baker, who described himself as a “Navy rat” — the son of a servicemember — said scores of people had been evacuated from their homes, with many now milling around in confusion.
“The entirety of our parking lots and other areas are completely filled,” he said. “A lot of the entryways are blocked. People can’t get in or out. It’s a confusing mess.”
The accident came at a time of heightened tension in the skies above America, with a number of incidents rocking public confidence in flying.
Air traffic control outages have struck the busy Newark airport on the East Coast at least twice in recent weeks, and in January, there was a mid-air collision over Washington between a passenger plane and a military helicopter.
This month, two people who were onboard a small plane died when it crashed into a residential neighbourhood northwest of Los Angeles.</p><small>2025-05-22 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2219112938702db.jpg?r=191404' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912622/armys-top-brass-vows-to-stop-externally-sponsored-terrorists-from-destroying-national-peace-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Army’s top brass vows to stop ‘externally-sponsored terrorists’ from destroying national peace: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The armed forces have vowed to prevent the country’s peace being compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
A day earlier, at least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — were injured after a bomb targeted a school bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the vow was made during the 270th Corps Commander Conference (CCC) at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, chaired by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“A comprehensive review of the prevailing internal and external security environment was undertaken, with particular emphasis on the successful conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, a decisive chapter of Marka-i-Haq,” the statement read.
It was observed that “following its military failure in the wake of the Pahalgam incident, India so-called and self-claimed victim of terrorism, but actually a perpetrator of terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability, has upscaled the use of covert means, employing non-state actors to pursue its destabilisation agenda,” the ISPR said.
“The forum resolved that Pakistan will never allow its peace to be compromised by externally-sponsored terrorism. The Armed Forces, in close synergy with intelligence and law enforcement agencies, will pursue all proxies and facilitators of terrorism with unrelenting resolve.
“These hostile elements, trained and financed to incite chaos and fear, will be dismantled and decimated with the full force of national will and institutional strength.”
 
 

It further said that the nation will take “all measures necessary to safeguard its vital interests”.
The conference also deliberated on the regional environment in India-occupied Kashmir and along the working boundary with India, expressing “deep concern” over human rights violations committed by Indian forces against Kashmiris. The forum also congratulated COAS Munir on his promotion to the rank of field marshal.
“[The] forum underscored the urgent need for international attention and intervention to prevent further deterioration of peace and security in South Asia,” the statement read. “[The] forum reiterated full diplomatic, political, moral and humanitarian support for Kashmiri brothers and sisters and their just resistance for [the] right of self-determination.”
Additionally, the meeting paid tribute to the martyrs of Marka-i-Haq and reaffirmed that the “sacred blood of the shuhuda (martyrs)” would not go in vain, while also recognising the spirit and dynamic contributions of the youth and Pakistan’s “media and information warriors” for their role during the brief conflict.
 


A statement by the Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday claimed that the Khuzdar attack was carried out by “state-sponsored proxies of India (Fitna al Hindustan)” and added that “dastardly terrorist incidents” were being orchestrated through proxies in Balochistan and KP, “deliberately targeting civilians in a futile attempt to destabilise Pakistan”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on May 2.
President, PM present baton of field marshal to COAS Munir
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday presented Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Asim Munir with the baton of field marshal, formally marking the latter’s promotion to the highest rank in the military.
The rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — General Mohammad Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.
The federal cabinet on Tuesday approved the promotion of Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir to field marshal for his leadership in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and the period of conflict against India known as Marka-i-Haq. He was formally promoted to the position with immediate effect in a notification from the Ministry of Defence under “Rule 199-A of the Pakistan Army Regulations (Rules), 1998”.

The ceremony to confer the baton was held at the Presidency in Islamabad on Thursday, attended by the president, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and civilian and military officials.
After he and President Zardari conferred the baton to Field Marshal Munir, PM Shehbaz said during his address, “Today is a moment of profound national pride and historic importance for Pakistan. We salute our national heroes, COAS Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
“You have led our brave armed forces to a remarkable victory against an enemy caught in its own web of arrogance and hubris,” the PM said, addressing Munir.
“The aggressor was brought to its knees and taught a lesson. What transpired during those challenging days will not only be remembered for all times to come as an outstanding military victory but also as a moral and diplomatic triumph.”
The PM said that the field marshal “led our armed forces with great tenacity and indomitable resolve”. He thanked Munir for “his command during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and his resolute courage in safeguarding Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
“The nation was granted a most glorious victory, which we will remember for the rest of our lives,” he added. “He not only thwarted the nefarious designs of the adversary, but rewrote the history of warfare.”

President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces for defending “the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our motherland against unprovoked Indian aggression”.
“The entire nation is proud of all of you,” he said.
The president officially promoted Munir to the rank of field marshal and conferred the baton “in recognition of extraordinary services to Pakistan through the turbulent period and with full confidence in his command and character”.
“Your military career is forged with courage and defined by wisdom and commitment to lead with vision, strength and honour at the highest level of our armed forces,” Zardari said. “Throughout this week of Marka-i-Haq Field Marshal Asim displayed a pragmatic understanding of the need to avoid escalation.”</p><small>2025-05-22 17:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22211604a7e9923.jpg?r=211644' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912629/punjab-launches-awareness-campaign-on-childrens-safety' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab launches awareness campaign on children’s safety</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Home Department on Thursday launched a campaign to raise awareness about the safety of children.
According to the spokesperson of the home department, the campaign called ‘Safe Children, Safe Punjab’ was launched on the instructions of the Punjab Chief Minister.
The statement said, “The home department released the first episode of a special animation series to create awareness about ‘Good Touch, Bad Touch’.
“The campaign was launched to prevent incidents of sexual abuse of minors.”
The statement also said that the series introduced the characters named Haya and Bahadur, who educate children about “Good Touch and Bad Touch”, with a message for children stating, “We will not be afraid of those who touch us badly.”
Educating children about personal safety was the need of the hour, the statement said, adding that the series taught children about “appropriate and inappropriate physical behaviour in a positive way”.
With proper education and awareness, children can recognise and report inappropriate behaviour, it added.
It further said that parents and teachers must teach children how to report sexual abuse at home or outside.
The statement highlighted that children who face sexual abuse can be traumatised for life, saying, “It is the responsibility of the state to protect children and bring abusers to justice.”
The campaign will help protect children from abuse and sexual exploitation, it added.
According to the statement, the Punjab home secretary has directed the Child Protection and Welfare Bureau to conduct an awareness campaign for children.
The department had also written a letter to the Education Department to include ‘Good Touch, Bad Touch’ awareness in the curriculum.
The awareness campaign has been designed to keep future generations safe, the statement said, adding, “Be a part of this awareness campaign to keep your children safe.”
Earlier this month, a civil society report revealed that 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country in 2024. The children were most vulnerable to abuse in the age group of 11-15 years, in which more boys than girls were reported.
A 17-year-old girl died by suicide in April after she was allegedly raped and impregnated in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh.
On Tuesday, the police arrested four suspects involved in an alleged gang rape of a mentally-challenged minor in Lahore.</p><small>2025-05-22 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2220024382ca58f.jpg?r=234217' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912630/iran-says-will-hold-us-responsible-for-any-israeli-attack-on-its-nuclear-sites' target='_blank'><strong>Iran says will hold US responsible for any Israeli attack on its nuclear sites</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran would hold the United States responsible for any Israeli attack on its nuclear facilities, after US media reported that Israel was preparing for a strike.
The report came even as Iran and the United States were set to meet in Rome on Friday for a fifth round of Omani-mediated nuclear talks.
“We believe that in the event of any attack on the nuclear facilities of the Islamic Republic of Iran by the Zionist regime (Israel), the US government will also be involved and bear legal responsibility,” Araghchi said in a letter to the United Nations published on Thursday.
“Iran strongly warns against any adventurism by the Zionist regime and will respond decisively to any threat or unlawful act by this regime,” Araghchi added.
On Tuesday, CNN reported that Israel was making preparations to strike Iranian nuclear facilities.
The nuclear talks, which began on April 12, are the highest-level contact between the long-time foes since the United States in 2018 pulled out of a landmark deal between Iran and world powers, during President Donald Trump’s first term in office.
Israel, Iran’s sworn enemy, has been threatening to use force against Iranian nuclear sites since the talks began.
On Thursday, Ali Mohammad Naini, the spokesman for Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, warned of a “devastating” response in case of an Israeli attack.
“If the delusional Zionist regime commits a foolish act and launches an attack, it will definitely receive a devastating and decisive response in its small and vulnerable geography,” said Naini, according to the ISNA news agency.
Also on Thursday, a group of demonstrators gathered near the Fordow nuclear enrichment plant south of Tehran to voice their support for the country’s nuclear activities.
The crowd waved Iranian flags and chanted slogans such as “nuclear energy is our inalienable right” and “no compromise, no surrender, only confrontation with America”.
Iran does not recognise Israel and generally refers to it as the “Zionist regime”, and the two countries have fought a shadow war for years.
The two foes traded direct attacks last year for the first time, against the backdrop of soaring regional tensions triggered by the Gaza conflict.</p><small>2025-05-22 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/22190831f8e948b.jpg?r=191012' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912625/pakistans-new-climate-minister-on-water-justice-and-a-warming-world' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s new climate minister on water, justice and a warming world</strong></a><br><p>In sweltering Karachi, as tensions with India simmer over the Indus Waters Treaty, Musadik Masood Malik sips an Americano. Recently appointed as Pakistan’s federal minister for climate change and environmental coordination, Malik left his previous post overseeing the Ministry for Water Resources and Petroleum to take on what he describes as an urgent and daunting role. In one of his first interviews since the March 2025 reshuffle, he speaks exclusively to Dialogue Earth.
Malik leans forward to list what he sees as Pakistan’s most pressing environmental threats: “Air pollution and its economic toll on the people of Pakistan. Water pollution and access. And solid waste [management], whether methane or carbon dioxide. These are the three major challenges we face,” he says.
But it’s Pakistan’s melting glaciers that concern him most. Before arriving in Karachi, one of Senator Malik’s first official visits was to Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan’s northernmost region and home to some of the world’s largest glacial reserves outside the polar zones. He was there to see the initiatives taking place under a United Nations project which aims to reduce the risk of glacial lake outburst flooding (GLOF). The numbers, he says, speak for themselves: Pakistan is home to more than 13,000 glaciers, putting it on the frontlines of a warming world.
“As the population has increased, communities no longer live where their forefathers used to live. What if they’re in the path of these hazards?” he says.
Some 2,000 km from Gilgit-Baltistan, the minister faces an entirely different set of climate challenges in Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city and financial powerhouse. Chief among them is bridging the political gaps between the federation and the provinces, as well as navigating competing interprovincial interests.
A ‘theatre of disaster’?
Despite diplomatic pressure from India to block financial assistance, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) this month approved a new loan for Pakistan. In a statement, the IMF confirmed it had accepted the Pakistani government’s request for an arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), unlocking USD 1.4 billion to help the country respond to climate-related challenges.
While the funding represents a significant boost, Malik remains sceptical. “We still haven’t gotten over a lot of what happened during the 2022 floods. Commitments are made and they are not fulfilled,” he says. “Pledges were made for the Loss and Damage Fund, but was money put in that fund? Look at the quantum of commitments and then look at the drawdown, and the actual funding that has come about.”
He questions the entire global response mechanism: “Is it just the theatre of disaster, where we all get together and speak fantastic English and make great speeches?”
Recently, Pakistan urged relevant parties to expedite disbursements from the Loss and Damage Fund, as it continues to bear the brunt of extreme weather events and slow-onset climate impacts. “I don’t feel cynical,” says Malik. “What I’m doing right now is lobbying. And not just lobbying for Pakistan — though that is my first and foremost duty and responsibility. But I’m lobbying for the vulnerable; I’m lobbying for climate justice.”
The minister has been vocal at recent international forums, rallying for climate justice and the rights of developing countries, including at the Geneva climate summit, calling out what he sees as inequities in the global climate finance architecture. He criticises the disproportionate benefits going to a handful of countries. “What about the rest of the world?” he adds. “What about Pakistan?”
Water tensions
Domestically, one of the most heated environmental debates involves the controversial six canals project, in the Cholistan desert in southern Punjab. Water is a deeply political issue in Pakistan, where provinces have long contested their share of the Indus River system, which sustains the country’s agriculture-dependent economy. In this context, the six canals project, seen by some as a plan that would potentially reduce the water flow toward downstream Sindh province, has triggered fierce opposition. Sindh has expressed fears of reduced flows and decried a lack of consultation.
Malik defends the idea as potentially beneficial but stresses that trust and transparency between provinces are key. “The possible solution to protect the water rights for each province is to ensure a water telemetry system [to monitor usage] at every interdimensional junction so that every drop of water that flows is accounted for,” he says. Once that system is in place, he adds, provinces can be assured they are receiving their fair share of water “through science and technology and not through human intervention”.
 
 

However, public protests and rising interprovincial tensions have led authorities to pause the project until a consensus is reached. “We don’t want to do anything without the consent of provinces, and provinces should be consulted,” he says.
Malik reiterates his commitment to transparency and accountability in water governance moving forward. “There will be no unilateralism,” he says, adding that a robust telemetry system will ensure real-time water monitoring and equitable distribution.
The federal minister also stresses the importance of water productivity, an idea he believes is not given enough attention in Pakistan. “A 3 per cent improvement in water-use productivity for agriculture produces the same yield as 3 million acre-feet of flood irrigation,” he says. In other words: more crop per drop. The focus, he argues, should shift from expanding irrigation infrastructure to using existing water more efficiently.
When asked about the political flashpoint surrounding dam-building in Pakistan, Malik responds with a grin and a pun: “I’m not going to name the dam because I’d be damned if I did.”
Despite a recently announced ceasefire following renewed tensions and conflict between India and Pakistan, the future of the Indus Waters Treaty remains precarious. Following the Pahalgam attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, India announced a unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty — a move Pakistan has strongly rebuked. “If there is a disagreement, the first step is bilateral discussion among the Indus commissioners. If that doesn’t work, there are secondary mechanisms — neutral technical experts can be consulted,” he notes. “The last resort is the court of arbitration. And this has been working in this treaty. And if this treaty has no value, then no treaty in the world has value.”
Malik claims India has violated the treaty multiple times. “It is one of the binding conditions of the treaty that commissioners have to meet periodically. India has already violated this. They also do not share enough information or data that helps ascertain the water flow in this bilateral system,” he says. He adds that India’s calls to renegotiate the treaty’s terms predate the attack in Pahalgam. “This raises suspicions — was Pahalgam used as an excuse to violate the treaty?” he asks.
From regional tensions to global inaction, Malik circles back to the human cost of climate change — particularly for Pakistan’s most vulnerable. “We lose [access to] schools and health centres. Our girls and our women get affected disproportionately by these devastations,” he says.
Then, in a quieter moment, the minister reflects on a more innocent past. “When I was growing up, we would catch fireflies in our garden, put them in bottles and take them in dark rooms, but then we’d come out in the garden and let them loose, lest they die. We’d chase butterflies in the evenings. Where are the butterflies and fireflies? Who’s chasing them? Where are the green parrots and the bulbuls? Have you seen them recently?” He does not expect an answer.
For Malik, the aesthetic and cultural loss, triggered by a warming world, is just as profound as the physical damage. The minister laments the loss of poetry and folk songs that once paid homage to Pakistan’s natural world. “Floods and climate-induced disasters do not only cause material losses,” he says. “They also rob us of our culture.”

Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
In a post on X, the Saudi health ministry said that the kit was available in eight languages. “In all languages, we care about pilgrims’ health. Explore the health awareness kit to promote health and well-being among pilgrims,” the post said.
 






The multilingual kit contained essential information for pilgrims, such as: preventing heat-related illnesses and managing health in extreme conditions, required vaccinations (meningitis, Covid-19, polio and yellow fever), managing chronic diseases, and accessing free health services during Haj. It also included short videos, social media assets, and printable posters.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed the annual Haj agreement in January, which would see 179,210 Pakistani pilgrims perform Haj this year.
On Saturday, the Pakistan Haj Mission welcomed 38,229 pilgrims in Saudi Arabia (Madina and Makkah) under the government scheme since the start of the month-long pre-Haj flight operation on April 29.
 
 

The religious gathering has seen a high number of fatalities in recent years, with the number of deaths during last year’s Haj pilgrimage totalling 1,301 people. Saudi Arabia’s health minister had said that deaths were caused by pilgrims “walking long distances under direct sunlight without adequate shelter or comfort”.
At least 35 Pakistanis were reported to be among those who died during the pilgrimage in 2024.
Earlier this month, the government introduced additional facilities for pilgrims such as air-conditioned Mina tents, family-friendly accommodations, optimised luggage systems and high-quality transportation.
To safeguard the health and well-being of pilgrims, around 400 medical and paramedical officers would be deployed across dedicated healthcare facilities. These include one well-equipped hospital and nine dispensaries in Makkah, along with one hospital and two dispensaries in Madinah.</p><small>2025-05-22 14:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605689-army-top-brass-vows-to-decimate-india-backed-terrorist-proxies-with-full-force' target='_blank'><strong>Army top brass vows to decimate India-backed terrorist proxies with 'full force'</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting with the IMF delegation, led by the Fund’s Director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department Jihad Azourat the PM’s Office, took place as Pakistan gears up to present the budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 on June 2.
“Pakistan is now moving from economic stability toward sustainable growth,” the prime minister said, emphasising that the government’s top priority was not only to sustain macroeconomic gains but to expedite comprehensive institutional reforms, crucial for long-term resilience.
The meeting focused on discussions related to the implementation and progress of the ongoing IMF programme in Pakistan. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the economic reforms undertaken by the government and their accruing positive outcomes.
The IMF delegation acknowledged the progress under the reform agenda and assured of continued support to assist Pakistan’s efforts for economic stability and inclusive growth.
The meeting was also attended by key cabinet members including Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister for Planning, Development, and Reforms, Ahsan Iqbal, and senior officials.
The IMF earlier this month approved the immediate disbursement of about $1 billion to Pakistan under the ongoing Extended Fund Faci­li­ty (EFF) and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
In a statement, the IMF said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme supported by the EFF Arrangement.
“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR or special drawing rights 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),” it said.
It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.
“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP. Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.</p><small>2025-05-22 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/221038142f8d379.jpg?r=120200' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912572/bla-and-ttp-are-indian-proxies-govt-will-prove-indias-involvement-in-khuzdar-bus-attack-asif' target='_blank'><strong>BLA and TTP are Indian proxies, govt will prove India’s involvement in Khuzdar bus attack: Asif</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has said that two major terrorist groups operating in Pakistan were “Indian proxies”, adding that Islamabad will present “complete evidence” to prove New Delhi’s involvement in the attack on a school bus in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district that killed three children and injured several others.
At least six people, including three students, were slain while over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted the bus near Zero Point in Khuzdar on the Quetta-Karachi highway when it was on its way to drop the students at the Army Public School in Khuzdar Cantonment.
The condition of at least a dozen is said to be serious due to critical injuries, officials said, adding that at least 15 girl students were among the injured. Security forces vowed to “relentlessly pursue” the culprits of the attack as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir visited the injured in Quetta yesterday.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ late on Wednesday, Asif asserted there was evidence that the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) was working as an Indian proxy.
“We will present evidence of India’s involvement. We will corroborate whatever we have claimed,” he said.
 


“The relation between BLA and India is well-known as their leadership is in New Delhi. The allegation against us was unsubstantiated but BLA is fighting like an Indian proxy,” he added.
He was referring to the Pahalgam attack last month in occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, following which India, without evidence, had blamed Pakistan for backing the attackers.
Asif further said, “BLA and TTP are Indian proxies. They have nothing to do with religion or nationalism, India is financing them and they’re involved in bloodshed here.”
In reply to a question on dealing with the situation, the minister said that “Pakistan will strike with full force and there will be no leniency”, stressing that attacking non-combatants, including school children, was unacceptable.
Asif said Pakistan called for an investigation into the Pahalgam attack, which India didn’t agree to, adding that the world should be informed that the Narendra Modi-led regime was “very irresponsible for using a false incident as a pretext to wage a nuclear war”.
He said Pakistan “will not start nuclear confrontation but cannot stay silent if nuclear devices are thrown at us”.
“Pakistan showed restraint, but still India attacked our bases in the dark of the night,” he highlighted.
A day ago, the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), also said that “Indian terror proxies are being employed as a state tool by India to foment terrorism in Pakistan against soft targets such as innocent children and civilians”.
It noted that India had “failed” against Pakistan’s Operation Bunyanum Marsoos during the recent conflict, and its [proxies] were “being hunted [down] by military and law enforcement agencies”.
“Use of terrorism as a state policy by [the] Indian political government is abhorrent and reflective of their low morality and disregard of [sic] basic human norms,” the ISPR said.
“Planners, abettors and executors of this cowardly Indian-sponsored attack will be hunted down and brought to justice and [the] heinous face of India will be exposed in front of the entire world,” the military vowed.
 
 

On Monday, the ISPR said 12 terrorists of “Indian proxy” outfits were killed by security forces in separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said India was activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan. He had detailed the arrest of a Pakistani terror suspect allegedly trained by India as “irr­e­futable evidence” of state-sponsored terrorism directed by Ind­ian military personnel.
China, Pakistan and Afghanistan agree their soil won’t be used for cross-border terrorism: Dar
In a separate development, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that during the trilateral meeting between China, Pakistan and Afghanistan, all sides agreed that their soil would not be used for cross-border terrorism.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Dar discussed the possibility of increasing diplomatic engagement with Kabul, referring to a statement by Chinese counterpart Wang Yi. He said, “We will look into all these aspects. I fully support the idea that we should settle issues with all neighbours. The core principle should be that there should be no terrorism from other countries.”
He said that he had categorically stated the position that “we will not tolerate terrorism” during his visit to Afghanistan. “You should not allow use of your soil and we will not allow our soil,” he added, referring to his talks with Afghan Taliban leaders.
Dar also said, “The government has a clear resolve. We will deal with terrorism the same way we dealt in 2013 and 2018.
“The Chinese interest also lies in this. […] This was also discussed in the trilateral meeting,” the deputy premier said, referring to the recent moot in China.
 


The foreign minister further said that in his meeting with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, the latter offered condolences for the Pakistani lives lost during the recent conflict with India.
“He reaffirmed that Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and its dignity were very close to them [China],” Dar said.
Dar highlighted that China agreed the Kashmir issue should be resolved according to the UN resolutions, adding that Beijing, like Islamabad, believed that a major reason for the tension in the region was the Kashmir dispute.
Indian High Commission staff member declared persona non grata
Separately, the Foreign Office said that a staff member of the High Commission of India in Islamabad was declared persona non grata for “engaging in activities inconsistent with his privileged status”.
“The concerned official has been directed to leave Pakistan within 24 hours,” FO said in a post on X in the early hours of Thursday.
The FO added that the Indian Chargé d’Affaires was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey the decision.
“It was stressed that none of the diplomats or staff members of the Indian High Commission should misuse their privileges and status in any manner,” FO said.
 






The decision came after India yesterday declared a Pakistani official persona non grata for engaging in activities not consistent with his official status in the country and asked him to leave India within 24 hours.
A statement from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs said: “Charge d’Affaires, Pakistan High Commission, was issued a demarche to this effect today. He was asked to strictly ensure that none of the Pakistani diplomats or officials in India misuse their privileges and status in any manner.”</p><small>2025-05-22 12:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605675-sindh-govt-announces-summer-vacation-for-schools' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt announces summer vacation dates for schools</strong></a><br><p>

US President Donald Trump quickly condemned the attack, saying, “These horrible DC killings, based obviously on anti-Semitism, must end, now!”
“Hatred and radicalism have no place in the USA,” he added on social media.
 






Gunfire broke out on the sidewalk outside the Capital Jewish Museum in the centre of Washington as the venue held a social event for young professionals and diplomatic staff.
The victims were a young couple who planned to get married, the Israeli ambassador said.
A video clip circulating on social media showed a young bearded man in a jacket and white shirt shouting “free, free Palestine” as he was led away by police.
Police confirmed the suspected shooter walked into the museum after the shooting and had been detained.
“We believe the shooting was committed by a single suspect who is now in custody,” Washington Police Chief Pamela Smith told reporters.
“Prior to the shooting, the suspect was observed pacing back and forth outside of the museum. He approached a group of four people, produced a handgun and opened fire.
“After the shooting, the suspect then entered the museum and was detained by event security.”
She said the handcuffed suspect identified where he had discarded the weapon and chanted “Free, free Palestine”. Police identified him as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered enhanced security measures at Israeli diplomatic missions worldwide after the incident.
“I have instructed to enhance security arrangements at Israeli missions around the world and to increase protection for state representatives,” he said.
“We are witnessing the terrible price of anti-Semitism and the wild incitement against the State of Israel.”
“I am devastated by the scenes in Washington,” Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement.
“This is a despicable act of hatred, of anti-Semitism, which has claimed the lives of two young employees of the Israeli embassy.
“America and Israel will stand united in defence of our people and our shared values. Terror and hate will not break us.”
‘Unspeakable act of violence’
Danny Danon, Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, said, “Harming diplomats and the Jewish community is crossing a red line.
“Israel will continue to act resolutely to protect its citizens and representatives — everywhere in the world.”
The targeted event appeared to be a reception hosted by the American Jewish Committee (AJC) for Jewish young professionals and the Washington diplomatic community.
The evening was “dedicated to fostering unity and celebrating Jewish heritage,” with an invitation to the event saying the location would be “shared upon registration”.
“American Jewish Committee (AJC) can confirm that we hosted an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC this evening,” AJC CEO Ted Deutch said in a statement.
“We are devastated that an unspeakable act of violence took place outside the venue… Our attention and our hearts are solely with those who were harmed and their families.”
 
 

The museum is in downtown Washington, close to the US Capitol and just 1.6 kilometres from the White House.
Police Chief Smith said officers responded to multiple calls of a shooting near the museum at around 9pm on Wednesday evening (6am Thursday).
First responders found a man and a woman unconscious and not breathing.
Despite life-saving efforts, both were pronounced dead.
Engagement
Israeli Ambassador to the United States Yechiel Leiter told reporters the young staffers were a couple “about to be engaged”.
“The young man purchased a ring this week with the intention of proposing to his girlfriend next week in Jerusalem,” Leiter said.
He added that he spoke to Trump by telephone, with the president assuring that the United States will “do everything it can possibly do to fight and end anti-Semitism.”

“We’ll stand together tall and firm, and we will confront this moral depravity without fear and with determination,” Leiter said.
Emergency vehicles remained at the scene in the morning after police taped off the area.
“We’re going to stand together as a community in the coming days and weeks to send the clear message that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism,” Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters.
“The horrific incident is going to frighten a lot of people in our city, and in our country. I want to be clear that we will not tolerate this violence or hate.”</p><small>2025-05-22 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605665-senators-denounce-khuzdar-carnage-demand-justice-for-slain-schoolchildren' target='_blank'><strong>Senators denounce Khuzdar school bus bombing, demand justice for slain children</strong></a><br><p>

The Yomiuri Shimbun daily and Jiji Press reported that police found about 3,000 videos and images of him sexually assaulting around 50 women in his taxi or his home.
Last year, the man “got a woman, then in her 20s, to take sleeping pills which caused her to lose consciousness, took her to his home and committed an indecent act, which he filmed,” a Tokyo police spokesman told AFP.
Police arrested the 54-year-old on Wednesday on “suspicion of non-consensual sexual intercourse and violation of the law on punishment of filming of sexual parts,” he added without elaborating further.
Traces of sleeping pills were detected in her hair, according to media reports.
The footage recovered on the man’s phone and other devices dated back to 2008, the reports said.
Media also said that he was arrested last October on suspicion of drugging another woman and robbing her of 40,000 yen ($280).
He was later released before being taken into custody again in December for alleged indecent assault, the reports said.</p><small>2025-05-22 09:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605652-another-student-injured-in-khuzdar-school-bus-attack-dies' target='_blank'><strong>Another student succumbs to injuries sustained in Khuzdar bus attack</strong></a><br><p>

Exports witnessed significant growth to Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, spurred by recent changes in the regional political landscape. However, trade with these countries continues to face considerable challenges, largely due to unfavourable government policies.
Despite this positive development in exports, the overall trade gap with regional countries widened, primarily due to increased imports from China, India and Bangladesh during the period under review.
In FY24, the trade deficit with these countries stood at $9.506bn, up 49pc from $6.382bn in the preceding year.

Export gains to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka offset by soaring imports

Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw a hefty growth in July-April FY25. Still, exports to other countries, especially China, continued to decline during the period, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — rose 2.37pc to $3.743bn in July-April FY25 from $3.656bn over the same period last year.
Contrary to this, imports surged 23.84pc to $13.530bn in 10MFY25 from $10.925bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 23.87pc to $13.191bn in 10MFY25 from $10.649bn over the same period last year. In FY24, imports from China stood at $13.506bn, up by 39.78pc from $9.662bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh.
Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 11.65pc to $2.070bn in 10MFY25 from $2.343bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.

Due to the incident, a traffic jam was witnessed on the slip roads, which created problems for the residents, while the site was cordoned off by the authorities. According to the district administration officials, gas accumulated in the pipeline caused the explosion. They said that the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) officials were informed about the incident and asked to check the reason behind it.
District Emergency Officer Sibghatullah told Dawn that Rescue 1122 received a call about the explosion in the sewer line and rushed to the site. He said that two people were injured in the first gas explosion and four people were injured in the second explosion. He said the injured were moved to Holy Family Hospital, where their condition was termed stable.
Meanwhile, the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited officials checked the area and said the sewer pipeline exploded because there was no gas leakage in the SNGPL pipelines. “It is strange that the two explosions occurred on a road which was reconstructed last year. We suspect that the civic agency possibly used substandard material,” said Muhammad Fareed, a shopkeeper.
A resident Nasir Ali hoped that the relevant department would fill the ditch soon because it was causing problems for the people, especially the schoolchildren. He said that the civic bodies needed to excavate the entire portion to check the status of the utility lines.
Wasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf told Dawn the explosion did not occur in Wasa’s sewer line. He said that the drain was not a part of Wasa’s designated tributaries of Leh Nullah scheduled for one-time cleaning. He said that twin explosions occurred in front of Sunrise Bakery, E-Block, Satellite Town. The affected drain had no ventilating opening or manholes except for a single grating in front of the bakery, leading to gas accumulation.
He said that the explosion caused significant damage, such as the dismantling of the inlet gratings, damage to the concrete slabs, and displacement of the asphaltic layer on the adjacent road.
He advised the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation to remodel the drain to ensure proper gas ventilation and install manholes (ventilating openings) at regular intervals, not more than 20 metres apart, to mitigate the possible gas build-up.

In a statement, the commission issued a prediction regarding the sighting of the crescent moon for the month of Zilhaj 1446 AH, “based on scientific analysis, astronomical data, and modern observational techniques.”
It said according to astronomical models, the birth of the new moon for Zilhaj will occur on May 27, 2025, at 8:02pm PST.
The scientific analysis for May 27, 2025 (29 Ziqa’ad) in Pakistan indicates the age of the moon at sunset will be approximately 11 hours and 34 minutes, it mentioned.
“Even under the most optimal weather conditions, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country is extremely low, as there will only be a 37-minute interval between sunset and moonset,” it added.
The commission said 1st Zilhaj is expected to fall on May 29. Therefore, Eidul Azha will be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.
It added that the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee holds the final authority to confirm the moon’s sighting based on eyewitness testimonies and weather conditions.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><small>2025-05-22 08:24</small></div><hr>
