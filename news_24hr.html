The closure of roads slowed down the movement of traffic on several arteries affected by the move, causing inconvenience for commuters.
Police barred several protesters, including activist Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Junior, from reaching the press club — a move that KPC President and journalist Fazil Jamili called a violation of the fundamental right to peaceful assembly.
“The siege of the Karachi Press Club today is a blatant assault on democratic freedoms. By cordoning off the KPC and barring citizens, including Zulfiqar Bhutto Jr., from protesting the sentencing of Imaan Mazari, authorities are violating the fundamental right to peaceful assembly,” he posted on social media platform X.







Lawyer and human rights activist Jibran Nasir posted on social media platform X that “all roads leading to the KPC have been blocked by placing containers and parking buses. The state wants to deny journalists, advocates and civil society the right to protest and expose the sham trial and conviction of Advocates Imaan Mazaari and Hadi Ali Chattha”.







Journalist Sameer Mandhro, in a similar post, said “police [have] blocked all routes leading to the Karachi Press Club”.
“The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, journalists, lawyers, and civil society activists are protesting against the Peca Act and the sentence awarded to Imaan Mazari,” he added.







Meanwhile, Zulfikar Bhutto Junior, the son of late politician Murtaza Bhutto, staged a sit-in at the KPC Roundabout when he was stopped from reaching the press club.
Speaking to the media there, he said that police were not even allowing them to protest on the pavements.
“We are being deprived of fundamental human rights. I want to participate in the protest, but participation in the protest has become a crime,” he said.

 


On Mazari and Chattha’s sentencing, he said, “They were convicted over just a tweet. My father faced similar treatment by the police.”
Activist Sheema Kermani was also among the protesters staging a sit-in at the KPC Roundabout.
Meanwhile, roads around Zainab Market and the roundabout near the Arts Council of Pakistan remained blocked. Some of the routes were reopened and the sit-in ended at around 6:45pm when Zulfikar Bhutto Junior and others were allowed to go to the KPC. Later, all blocked routes were opened by around 9pm.
As for Zulfikar Bhutto Junior, he again spoke to the media at the KPC, saying that there were no restrictions on protest in a democracy.
“Only thieves are happy in this country, and I am talking about those thieves who hold posts and are sitting in Islamabad,” he commented.
Imaan and Hadi’s conviction
A sessions court sentenced lawyers Mazari and Chattha to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case linked to social media posts on Saturday, sparking outrage among rights groups, opposition parties, and other segments of society.
They were sentenced a day after being arrested in Islamabad, which was also denounced by rights bodies, politicians, and journalists, who stressed their right to a fair trial.
Amnesty International noted the “lack of adherence to due process” and said these were “retaliatory cases aimed solely at silencing Mazari and Chattha for their human rights work and dissent”.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan also condemned the arrests, terming the case a “tool to harass, intimidate and ultimately muzzle dissent”.</p><small>2026-01-26 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/26231613e862e12.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969159/president-zardari-arrives-in-uae-for-4-day-official-visit' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari arrives in UAE for 4-day official visit</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Monday night arrived in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for a four-day official visit.
According to a handout from the Presidency, the president was received by UAE Justice Minister Abdullah bin Sultan bin Awad Al Nuaimi at Zayed International Airport in Abu Dhabi.
It said that First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi were accompanying the president on the trip, adding that Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE Shafqat Ali Khan was also present on the occasion.







Shortly after arriving, he held a meeting with the UAE justice minister at the presidential flight terminal at the airport.







A statement released by the Foreign Office earlier in the day said that the president, accompanied by a high-level delegation, will undertake the visit from January 26 to 29.
“During the visit, the president will hold high-level meetings with the UAE’s leadership to review the full spectrum of bilateral ties, especially on the domains of trade and economic people-to-people ties,” the statement said.







The discussion will also focus on regional and international issues of mutual interest, the FO added.
It highlighted that Zardari’s trip, which follows the brief visit of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Pakistan last month, “reflects the deep brotherly ties between the two nations and reaffirms commitment to transforming the strong friendship between Pakistan and the UAE into a mutually rewarding partnership”.
During the UAE president’s first official visit to Pakistan on December 26, the leadership of the two countries had held “substantive talks” focused on further strengthening the longstanding bilateral relations.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Al Nahyan also met in Rahim Yar Khan on December 30, where they both discussed ways to enhance cooperation in a wide range of sectors.
On January 13, the two countries agreed to sign a formal agreement on “pre-immigration clearance” for Pakistani nationals visiting the Gulf country.</p><small>2026-01-26 18:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2622571434034e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969198/us-deploys-aircraft-carrier-to-middle-eastern-waters-as-iran-warns-against-attack' target='_blank'><strong>US deploys aircraft carrier to Middle Eastern waters as Iran warns against attack</strong></a><br><p>A US naval strike group led by an aircraft carrier has deployed to Middle Eastern waters, the United States said on Monday, as Tehran warned it was ready to hit back at any American attack launched in response to a crackdown on anti-government protests.
The protests started in late December, driven by economic grievances, but turned into a mass movement against the Islamic Republic, with huge street demonstrations for several days from January 8.
But rights groups have accused authorities of quelling the movement with unprecedented violence, shooting into crowds of protesters under the cover of an internet shutdown that has now lasted 18 days — the longest Iran has ever imposed.
US President Donald Trump has previously threatened to step in, saying last week that Washington was sending a “massive fleet” to the region “just in case”.
The deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group dramatically boosts American firepower in the region.
The United States backed and briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against Iran in June, and while Trump last week appeared to step back from his threats of new military intervention, he has never ruled the option out.
The Lincoln’s strike group has arrived in the region, US Central Command said in a post on X, adding the ships were “currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability”.







‘Regret-inducing response’
Iran’s foreign ministry warned on Monday of a “comprehensive and regret-inducing response to any aggression”.
Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said Iran was “confident in its own capabilities”.
In apparent reference to the Lincoln, he added: “The arrival of such a battleship is not going to affect Iran’s determination and seriousness to defend the Iranian nation.”
Meanwhile, a new anti-US billboard has appeared in the central Enghelab Square in Tehran that appears to show an American aircraft carrier being destroyed.
“If you sow the wind, you will reap the whirlwind,” its English-language caption reads.
State news agency IRNA quoted the commander of the Iranian navy Shahram Irani, as saying on Monday: “Iran’s naval power is not merely defensive but also acts as an anchor of stability in the region.”
In Lebanon, Hezbollah organised a rally in support of the Islamic Republic featuring an address by its leader, Naim Qassem, who warned, “a war on Iran this time will ignite the region”.
Iran’s Gulf neighbour, the United Arab Emirates, which hosts a US airbase, said it would not allow attacks on Iran to be launched from its territory.</p><small>2026-01-26 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647359-in-letter-to-pm-cm-afridi-warns-delay-in-funds-pushing-kp-into-fiscal-governance-crises' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to PM, CM Afridi warns delay in funds pushing KP into ‘fiscal, governance crises'</strong></a><br><p>

An order issued by the office of South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza stated that the five-member team was constituted for the “arrest of involved accused person(s) and impartial investigation” into the case.
“The investigation team shall make all-out and diligent efforts to arrest the accused person(s) by utilising all available resources,” read the notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
In a first information report (FIR) of the incident, dated January 23, the Karachi police said the fire was an “outcome of negligence and carelessness”.
The case was registered against unknown persons as the police have not nominated anyone in the case.
The special team will comprise the Garden Sub-divisional police officer (SDPO), the Kharadar investigation deputy superintendent of police (DSP), the head of the Garden Central Investigation Cell, the station house officer of Nabi Bux police station — where the FIR was registered — and an investigation officer of the case.
The team was allowed to co-opt any officer/official from the South Zone police if it wanted “help to solve the case”.
“Daily progress report shall be submitted to this office without fail,” DIG Raza ordered.

 

The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins. Only 23 of the deceased have been identified so far.
After nine days of scouring through the rubble to locate remains of the dead and missing, the search operation concluded on Sunday, DIG Raza told Dawn.
Subsequently, he added, Gul Plaza has been sealed.
Temporary restrictions on the M.A. Jinnah Road have been removed, and workers of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) were seen installing green construction mesh on the plaza.
Forensic experts from Lahore join probe
Meanwhile, a team of forensic experts from Lahore has joined the Karachi police to probe the Gul Plaza blaze. According to the South DIG, experts from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency visited the gutted shopping centre and collected samples.
Meanwhile, Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the search and rescue operation was completed, adding that the building had been handed back to the district administration.
The relevant experts would likely assess the structure of the building and subsequently, the building would be demolished, he added, expecting it to take place on Tuesday.
Khan said they had marked the gutted building with three different colours: green showing nothing was recovered from the spot, red showing recovery of bodies and yellow indicating the recovery of goods and valuables.
The rescue spokesperson explained that they would conduct a “final” search tonight on the insistence of shopkeepers and plaza management, as there were many shops in the basement which were intact or partially damaged.
Khan said valuables and goods would be removed and handed over to traders in the presence of district administration officials and plaza management tonight.
Inquiry committee to ‘consider all aspects’: CM Murad
Separately, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah asserted that whoever will be found responsible by the inquiry will be punished, noting that “more than 80 lives have been lost”.
“I will not take the name of anyone right now. Once the inquiry is over, it will come forward after that,” he said while speaking to the media.
“We have mistakes; I admit it,” the chief minister acknowledged, noting that even audits conducted in Islamabad were found unsatisfactory.
Asked about the possibility of the incident being a case of arson, the chief minister referred to the inquiry committee formed and stressed that it would “consider all aspects”.
The Sindh CM pointed out that anyone who had any “facts” to share could approach the committee. “If we are responsible, we will accept punishment.”
However, he cautioned that all those “saying such things will also be held accountable”.

 

Asked about the reported inadequate water supply during the rescue operation, the chief minister acknowledged, “We have fire brigades but they are not enough.”
Pinning the blame on “legacy issues” and “old laws”, Murad noted that multiple departments — the KMC, Rescue 1122, the Sindh Integrated Emergency & Health Services, and the Home Department (which conducts fire audits) — were all involved in the same matter.
The Sindh CM announced that all such departments will be merged and work was underway for the required legislation.
During his media talk, Murad recalled the compensation announced for those affected — Rs10 million for the families of each deceased person and Rs5m for each shop-occupant.
He further stated that with the help of Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), the Sindh government would compensate the financial losses suffered by the businesses, including the cost of their destroyed stock.
“Within a month, we’ll reimburse the shopkeepers for their inventory losses.



Responding to a question about the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) demand to make Karachi a part of the “federal territory”, the Sindh CM said it was not an appropriate time for such discussions in the wake of the tragic incident.
“We are ready for every debate, [but] I would not like to,” he said.
“I am not asking you not to talk about this tragedy or about bringing improvement. But do not go towards such discussions that have no logic,” the chief minister stressed.
Upon a reporter asking a question about the Sindh governor’s criticism of the provincial government, CM Murad reiterated that the media was encouraged to give constructive criticism about the incident but asked journalists “not to add fuel to the fire”.
He also warned there would be “no compromise” on the implementation of fire safety measures for the buildings under his audit plan. As part of its province-wide fire safety audit, the Sindh government has identified a total of 2,368 buildings across the province for the initial phase.
According to data presented in Sunday’s meeting, Sukkur tops the list with 898 buildings identified for the fire safety audit, Karachi has 562, Hyderabad has 540, Shaheed Benazirabad has 171, Larkana has 143, and Mirpurkhas has 54 buildings identified.

 

CM Murad declared, “An audit will be conducted of every [major] building, and we will start from the building which has more footfall.”
He said the implementation of this process has started, with 20 different “targets” given to the building owners.
The Sindh CM detailed that the targets included some “very necessary stuff that could be completed within a week”, such as installing alarms and portable fire extinguishers, clearing spaces so people know the exit, properly marking the exits, and having back-up lights in case of power failure.
The specifics of such requirements will be outlined on the day of the audit, the chief minister said.
CM Murad went on to add that buildings could be given some additional time if they completed “10 to 13” of the requirements within a week from the audit.
However, he warned, a building would be sealed if no work had been initiated after a week.
“There will be no compromise on that,” the chief minister said, seeking the cooperation of business chambers and associations.
“Finally, within six months, they will be required to complete fire safety and disaster safety measures,” he added.
Urging the owners of commercial buildings and industries, the Sindh CM asserted, “We all must resolve collectively that such an incident does not occur again.”</p><small>2026-01-26 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/26215427d6a705f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969196/ahead-of-basant-punjab-govt-bans-kites-bearing-images-of-political-parties-flags' target='_blank'><strong>Ahead of Basant, Punjab govt bans kites bearing images of political parties’ flags</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: With the festival of Basant drawing closer, the Punjab government on Monday imposed a ban on the manufacturing and use of kites bearing images of any political party’s flag for 30 days.
In the notification seen by Dawn, the Punjab Home Department notified the imposition of Section 144 prohibiting the purchase and use of kites bearing images of any person, holy scripture, religious place, country’s flag or that of a political party in an effort to “avoid any discrimination or disruption of public order”.
The department said that it had been reported that to disrupt the festival, miscreants may use images of holy scripture, religious places and flags of countries and political parties.
“Only plain, uni-coloured or multi-coloured kites (i.e. gudda or patang) shall be allowed during kite flying in the district of Lahore from February 6 to 8,” the department said.
It asserted that the government had permitted kite flying solely for “recreation and festivity”, while banning “the manufacturing, trade, transport, storage, sale, purchase” of kites bearing pictures, flags and places for 30 days from Monday onwards.
Basant is making a comeback after 18 years, with the festival set to be celebrated in Lahore from February 6 to 8. The festival will coincide with a nationwide protest announced by the opposition on Feb 8.
Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules 2025, the Punjab government has prohibited flying kites with metallic wire, nylon cord or strings coated with glass or other sharp materials, along with the manufacturing, transport, storage and sale of kites and hazardous strings.
The violators could face three to five years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs2 million, while those manufacturing or selling banned materials may be punished with five to seven years in jail and fines up to Rs5 million.
On Friday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had finalised all preparations for the three-day Basant festival, urging people to celebrate it in a safe manner.
Announcing strict safety measures, the chief minister said a comprehensive Basant safety plan had been finalised to prevent accidents associated with kite flying.
“Lahore has been divided into Red, Yellow and Green zones, and only cotton kite string made of nine threads will be allowed. Nylon and metallic strings are strictly banned, with violators facing up to five-year jail terms and fines up to Rs5 million,” she said and added that illegal kite flying, other than the notified dates, would invite imprisonment and fines, while parents and guardians would be held responsible for underage or illegal kite flying.</p><small>2026-01-26 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/262055101dd7800.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969192/kp-cm-pens-letter-to-pm-shehbaz-over-centres-persistent-failure-to-release-constitutionally-guaranteed-funds' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM pens letter to PM Shehbaz over Centre’s ‘persistent failure to release constitutionally guaranteed’ funds</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif over what he dubbed the Centre’s “persistent failure” to release “constitutionally guaranteed” funds, demanding the “full and unconditional” release of all outstanding federal dues.
Since becoming the provincial chief executive in October last year, Afridi has repeatedly accused the federal government of stalling the release of funds allocated for KP, particularly those committed for the merged districts under the National Finance Commission (NFC).
In a fresh call for the release of funds, the KP CM said: “I am compelled to place on record the deep and mounting concern of the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa regarding the persistent failure to release constitutionally guaranteed federal transfers.”
This failure, he added, “has now translated into an acute fiscal and governance crisis for the province”.







Afridi underscored that KP’s budget for fiscal year 2025-26 was framed and approved “strictly on the basis of clear constitutional entitlements”, including net hydel profit, oil and gas royalties, post-merger NFC shares, and regular monthly releases under the NFC.
“These were not discretionary assumptions but binding fiscal obligations,” he emphasised, adding that “contrary to these commitments, actual releases have consistently fallen short of budgeted levels”.
Moreover, “of even greater concern is the withholding of routine monthly NFC transfers, a practice that finds no sanction in the Constitution and strikes at the core of cooperative federalism”, he said.
The KP CM maintained that his province was entitled to receive Rs658.4 billion under the NFC, but it had received just Rs604bn so far, leading to a shortfall of Rs54.4bn.
“This is not an accounting variance; it represents a material breach that has directly impaired cash management, disrupted budget execution, and constrained service delivery across critical sectors of governance,” he asserted.
He added, “The impact is most stark in the merged districts, where development, stabilisation, and state consolidation are acknowledged national priorities. Despite a provincial allocation of Rs292bn, federal releases amount to only Rs56bn thus far.
“This severe and continuing gap has undermined the provision of essential public services and development interventions in these historically marginalised areas, eroding the objectives of the merger and weakening national cohesion.”
The KP CM also highlighted that these fiscal constraints were unfolding at a time when the province remained on the frontline of counter-terrorism, while simultaneously shouldering extraordinary and unavoidable expenditures arising from flood response and rehabilitation, as well as the management and support of temporarily displaced persons.
“These are national responsibilities; however, the financial burden continues to be borne disproportionately and unsustainably by the province,” he said.
In view of the above, he said, the KP government expected “immediate corrective action by the federal government, including the full and unconditional release of all outstanding federal dues, particularly routine monthly NFC transfers, net hydel profit, oil and gas royalties, and allocations for the merged districts, strictly in accordance with constitutional provisions and agreed fiscal arrangements”.
“Any further delay will only compound the province’s fiscal stress and weaken governance capacity at a critical juncture,” he warned, telling the premier that given the seriousness of the matter, it warranted his “urgent and personal attention”.</p><small>2026-01-26 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/26170723a344556.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969177/t20-world-cup-naqvi-briefs-pm-shehbaz-on-icc-matter-says-final-decision-to-come-by-friday-or-monday' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: Naqvi briefs PM Shehbaz on ‘ICC matter’, says final decision to come by Friday or Monday</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Monday said that he briefed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the “International Cricket Council (ICC) matter”, saying that a “final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday”.
According to a handout by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Naqvi had called on the premier in Islamabad earlier today.
“During the meeting, he briefed the prime minister on the recent situation regarding ICC T20 World Cup and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB),” the handout said.







Subsequently, Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), stated that he had a “productive” meeting with PM Shehbaz.
“[I] briefed him on the ICC matter, and he directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table. It was agreed that the final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday,” the post read.







The development comes as questions have been raised about Pakistan’s participation in the tournament following the ICC’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland.
Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland on Saturday, which is scheduled to begin next month, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
The governing ICC rejected Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.
Hours before the ICC had announced its decision, Naqvi had said that Bangladesh was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.
At the time, he had said that Pakistan’s participation was still not confirmed. “The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi had said.
Meanwhile, the International Cricketers’ Association said on Sunday that the absence of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup was a sad moment for the game and should serve as a call for stakeholders to work towards uniting the sport, not dividing it.
“The withdrawal of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup, and resulting absence of a valued cricketing nation from cricket’s pinnacle international T20 event, is a sad moment for our sport, the Bangladesh players and fans, and one that requires deep reflection,” World Cricketers’ Association (WCA) Chief Executive Tom Moffat had said in a statement.</p><small>2026-01-26 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2620164343c1426.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969191/saudi-arabia-wants-strong-positive-relationship-with-uae-fm' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia wants ‘strong, positive’ relationship with UAE: FM</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia said it hoped to have “strong, positive” ties with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the kingdom’s foreign minister said on Monday, but stressed that future relations were contingent on Abu Dhabi’s complete withdrawal from Yemen.
During a press conference in Warsaw, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan said Riyadh was “always keen” to have a “strong, positive relationship with the UAE”.
“The UAE has now decided to leave Yemen, and I think if that indeed is the case and the UAE has completely left the issue of Yemen, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia will take responsibility,” he added.
“I think that will be the building block for making sure that the relationship with the UAE continues strong and continues to serve the interests not just of both countries but the region,” he said.
A public row had erupted between the two countries over Yemen after UAE-backed separatists seized swathes of land late last year, including areas along the Saudi border, infuriating Riyadh.
Last month, the UAE had moved to de-escalate tensions with Saudi Arabia by announcing the immediate withdrawal of its remaining forces from Yemen, after the kingdom carried out airstrikes on the Mukalla port and supported a call for UAE forces to leave within 24 hours.
The withdrawal followed a spike in diplomatic tensions, precipitated by Saudi airstrikes on the port and accusations that two UAE ships had delivered weapons to separatist forces.</p><small>2026-01-26 15:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647322-pakistan-launches-shikra-system-for-real-time-passport-tracking' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan launches 'Shikra' system for real-time passport tracking</strong></a><br><p>

The remarks came as a TTAP delegation called on Imaan’s mother Shireen Mazari to “express solidarity” with the jailed couple, according to post by the party on X.







The video accompanying the post showed TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokar and the PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan included in the delegation.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, PTI’s Gohar condemned the couple’s arrest, their trial and how “due process was violated”.
“We have always been and will always remain opponents of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca). Voices cannot be suppressed. Nations cannot be suppressed by suppressing voices,” he said,
“We condemn this judgment. We met her family and mother. They said that they have no contact with her (Imaan),” Gohar said, drawing a parallel between how PTI founder Imran Khan was also not being allowed to meet his family.
Gohar said that such verdicts led to lawlessness, where people turn to “vigilante justice” and take the law into their own hands.
“We hope that the chief justice of Pakistan will take action on this case and other related cases in which speech is prohibited and people’s rights are violated,” he said, expressing the hope that justice would prevail.
“We demand that their (Imaan and Hadi) cases be fixed [for hearing], their convictions be reversed and their sentences be suspended,” he added. “We are hopeful that the chief justice will act on this,” he said.
In his remarks, Khokar said that the TTAP condemned Imaan and Hadi’s arrest and their denial of Constitutional rights, namely the right to a fair trial and freedom of expression.
“Without mincing words, today, dictatorship has been imposed in Pakistan,” he asserted.
“If anyone believes that Pakistan is a democracy or under a hybrid system, then they must correct themselves,” he said.
“The decisions being made by the courts are an effort to make Pakistan like North Korea or Egypt,” he emphasised.
“But those who want to make this country like North Korea or Egypt should know that resistance and the struggle for democratic rights define Pakistan’s history,” he said, adding that even dictators eventually lost power.
He said that the reality of the system imposed on the people after the February 8, 2024 general elections was now before the people.
“The reality is that there are no longer critical voices in the country; that anyone voicing criticism or demanding their rights will be silenced. Such a situation is unacceptable for us,” he stated.
Khokhar said the TTAP alliance would stage a protest on February 8, saying that the alliance would do everything in its power for the people of Pakistan.
He also expressed the hope that people within the system and the judiciary who had a “conscience” would oppose such acts as this would not cause harm to a single person, but to the whole of Pakistan.
Responding to a question, Gohar stated that the PTI had not taken back its Feb 8 protest call nor had it received any call from the government to do so.
“Only [Imran] Khan sahib can take back his own call,” he replied. “On Feb 8, we request that everyone close their shops, perform a wheel-jam and record their protest. There are no second thoughts about it.”
On Saturday, Imaan and Hadi were sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in a case linked to social media posts, sparking outrage among rights groups, opposition parties, and other segments of society.
The written order by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka stated that the “prosecution has been able to prove its case against both the accused” under sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyberterrorism), 26-A (false and fake information) of Peca.
Under Section 9 of Peca, both were sentenced to five years of rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs5 million each, with an additional year in default. For Section 10, they were each handed 10 years’ rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs30m, with two more years in default. Under Section 26-A, they received two years’ rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs1m each, with six months’ additional jail time in case of non-payment.</p><small>2026-01-26 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2618012275e3a3e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969182/mna-noor-alam-khan-says-bureaucrats-should-also-be-barred-from-holding-dual-nationality' target='_blank'><strong>MNA Noor Alam Khan says bureaucrats should also be barred from holding dual nationality</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) MNA Noor Alam Khan on Monday called for barring bureaucrats from holding dual nationality.
Presently, Article 63 (1)(c) of the Constitution states: “A person shall be disqualified from being elected or chosen as, and from being, a member of the Majlis-i-Shoora (Parliament), if he ceases to be a citizen of Pakistan, or acquires the citizenship of a foreign state.”
On the other hand, bureaucrats can be dual nationals. But, amendments have been proposed to the Civil Servants Act for a restriction on bureaucrats’ dual nationality.
The matter came under discussion on Monday during a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Cabinet Secretariat, where the Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill, 2024 — which was moved by Khan — was taken up.
The bill, seen by Dawn, says: “This private bill seeks amendment in Section 5 of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 with a view to lay down an enabling provision so that a civil servant holding dual nationality or citizenship of any foreign country shall not be entitled for appointment.”
Along similar lines, Khan said during the standing committee’s meeting that bureaucrats should be barred from holding dual nationality. “And if this does not happen, parliamentarians should also be allowed to have dual citizenship,” he said.
Without making any specific mentions, PPP MNA Agha Rafiullah recalled that parliamentarians had been promptly unseated following a Supreme Court decision in a dual nationality case in the past.
Cabinet Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal recommended that the cases of bureaucrats who possessed dual citizenship by birth should be reviewed, and if not, then judges should also be covered in the bill.
Khan, however, expressed his reservation on the suggestion to review these cases instead of ending the dual citizenship of the individuals concerned.
He said that “there is no dual national in the armed forces”.
“If dual nationality is to be allowed, then parliamentarians and military personnel should also be given this right,” he added.
For his part, Committee Chairman Ibrar Ahmed said the number of bureaucrats having dual citizenship by birth should be shared.
Bureaucracy and judiciary, too, should not have individuals having dual nationality, he said.
PML-N MNA Tahira Aurangzeb said her daughter, Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, had to let go of her Australian citizenship to contest elections.
Eventually, six of the seven committee members voted in favour of the bill and against bureaucrats’ dual citizenship.
However, Committee Chairman Ahmed advised voting on it again at a meeting scheduled for February 16.
He said a report on the matter would be sent to the prime minister and that the voting on the matter could be held again, taking stock of the premier’s view on the matter.
The meeting ended with the committee members agreeing to the chairman’s recommendation.</p><small>2026-01-26 15:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647336-canterbury-university-student-acted-as-hitman-and-controller-in-attacks-on-shahzad-akbar-adil-raja' target='_blank'><strong>Canterbury University student acted as ‘hitman and controller' in attacks on Shahzad Akbar, Adil Raja</strong></a><br><p>

The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins. Efforts to scour through the debris for the remains of the dead are still underway.
In a press release, Daraz said it was mobilising platform and ecosystem support for the affected traders by providing “onboarding, storage solutions, marketing enablement, and dedicated incubation over the next three months”.
“Daraz Pakistan, under its Daraz Cares arm, has announced a dedicated support initiative for sellers impacted by the recent fire at Gul Plaza in Karachi, aimed at helping affected businesses regain stability and continue serving customers across Pakistan,” the press release said.
“Through this initiative, Daraz Pakistan will launch a dedicated segment and page on its platform (app and desktop) for sellers impacted by the incident, helping customers discover and support their businesses as they rebuild,” it added.
Daraz said it would facilitate onboarding impacted sellers and provide targeted training to help them restart operations online with ease. It added that it would also provide warehouse space for traders requiring storage for existing or incoming inventory and offer subsidised delivery.
“In addition, Daraz Pakistan will extend free on-site and digital marketing support by leveraging its owned assets to help affected sellers gain reach and momentum,” the press release added.
“A dedicated incubation and support track will also be introduced to provide hands-on guidance and continued assistance to impacted businesses as they stabilise over time.”
The press release stated that support would continue over the next three months to help affected traders recover and sustain their businesses through the upcoming Ramazan and Eid season.
The press release recognised Gul Plaza’s important role as a business hub and how it aided the entrepreneurs powering commerce in the country.
“Over the last decade of Daraz in Pakistan, the marketplace has also been an important part of Daraz’s broader seller ecosystem, supporting a wide network of direct and indirect sellers, including home-based entrepreneurs who procure from there and deliver products to customers nationwide,” the company stated.
“For many families and small businesses, the incident has not only disrupted trade but also placed livelihoods and working routines under immense strain,” the press release added.
Daraz Managing Director Ehsan Saya was quoted as saying, “Gul Plaza has never been just a marketplace; it has been a place of livelihoods, relationships, and decades of hard work.
“Many of the sellers connected to it were among the earliest to bring their businesses onto Daraz and learn how to serve customers far beyond Karachi.”
Calling the Gul Plaza blaze “heartbreaking”, Saya said that the company’s focus was on standing with these entrepreneurs “in a way that is practical and compassionate” and to use Daraz’s reach to help them rebuild and move forward.
In the press release, Daraz encouraged affected traders and sellers to register and share their details to establish a connection with the relevant support track. They were urged to register on their website or through their usual Daraz Seller Support channels.
“Daraz Pakistan’s thoughts remain with everyone affected by the tragedy, including families who have suffered loss and those awaiting news,” the press release concluded.</p><small>2026-01-26 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/26182326b080762.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969185/indonesia-receives-first-rafale-advanced-fighter-jets-from-france-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia receives first Rafale advanced fighter jets from France, official says</strong></a><br><p>Indonesia has received three Rafale fighter jets from France in the first deliveries from a multi-billion dollar defence deal between the two countries, a defence ministry official told Reuters on Monday, marking a major upgrade to the country’s ageing military hardware.
Jakarta, France’s main arms client in Southeast Asia, has placed orders for as many as 42 Rafales, built by Dassault Aviation, as well as French frigates and submarines, as the archipelago steps up defence spending under President Prabowo Subianto, a former special forces commander.
“The aircraft have been handed over and are ready for use by the Indonesian Air Force, Defence Ministry spokesperson Rico Ricardo Sirait said in a message in response to a Reuters query — the first confirmation that Indonesia has possession of the advanced military aircraft after striking an $8 billion deal with France in 2022 and expanding it last year.







Sirait said the three aircraft arrived on Friday and were stationed at Roesmin Nurjadin Air Base in Pekanbaru, located on the western island of Sumatra.
More jets are expected to arrive later this year, he added without elaborating on how many.
Indonesia has been one of the biggest players on the international fighter jet market as it looks to upgrade its aircraft, setting aside big budgets for defence spending.
It has been considering a number of options alongside the Rafales, including China’s J-10 fighter jets and US-made F-15EX jets.
For the longer term, it has also signed a contract to buy 48 KAAN fighter jets from Turkey, a fifth-generation aircraft powered by General Electric F-110 engines that are also used in fourth-generation Lockheed Martin F-16 jets.</p><small>2026-01-26 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647315-roads-around-karachi-press-club-choked-by-protest-over-iman-hadi-conviction' target='_blank'><strong>Roads around Karachi Press Club choked by protest over Imaan, Hadi conviction</strong></a><br><p>

A boy falls, scrapes his knee, and starts to cry. Before the pain is addressed, the correction arrives: “Boys don’t cry.”
Sometimes it’s said gently, sometimes sharply, often jokingly. Rarely is it questioned. Yet, according to child and adolescent psychiatrists, this single sentence can quietly shape a child’s emotional, cognitive, and social development in ways that last a lifetime.
Dr Helal Uddin Ahmed, Professor of Child, Adolescent and Family Psychiatry at Faridpur Medical College, explains that childhood development is never just physical. “We usually give importance to physical growth,” he says, “But emotional, cognitive, and social development are equally important.” When one is disrupted, the others do not remain untouched.
Emotional suppression starts early
From a psychiatric perspective, emotional development depends on one simple but crucial skill: recognising emotions and responding to them appropriately.
“A child needs to understand which feeling is sadness, which is fear, which is joy,” Dr Ahmed explains. “If they feel sad, they should cry. If they feel pain, they should cry.” The problem begins when that natural response is blocked.
When a boy is told that crying is ‘girly’ or weak, he learns to suppress his emotions rather than process them. “At that moment,” Dr Ahmed elaborates, “his emotional development is hindered, and along with it, his emotional intelligence is hampered.”
This doesn’t mean the emotion disappears. It simply goes underground. Over time, suppressed feelings accumulate as unresolved stress. As neuroscience confirms, the brain learns emotional regulation through use. When boys are discouraged from naming or expressing emotions, the brain doesn’t develop the pathways needed to manage them healthily.
When emotions turn into aggression
One of the most visible consequences of this suppression is anger. Dr Ahmed notes a clear pattern in his clinical work: “Boys who couldn’t express emotions in childhood often have those emotions turn into aggression in adult life.”
Because they were never taught how to express sadness, fear, or vulnerability, these emotions reappear in distorted forms. “They get angry easily, speak dismissively, sometimes resort to physical violence,” he says.
This aggression shows up across personal, family, social, and professional spaces. What looks like a “temper problem” in adulthood is often a childhood lesson left unfinished.
The hidden impact on how boys see the world
The damage doesn’t stop at emotional health, according to Dr Ahmed.

Repeated phrases like “Why are you crying like a girl?” shape a boy’s thinking patterns. “A sense of masculinity develops where women are seen as weak. As a result, mutual respect for women does not develop properly.”

This is where emotional suppression intersects with cognitive development. The child’s understanding of gender, strength, and empathy becomes distorted.
“His cognitive development gets hindered,” Dr Ahmed says plainly. These errors in thinking then affect social behaviour. The boy may mock others for showing grief, belittle emotional responses, or fail to empathise in situations that demand it.
In a society already struggling with intolerance and public anger, these patterns matter. Emotional illiteracy doesn’t remain personal; it becomes cultural.
From suppression to depression
As these boys grow older, another risk emerges: depression and anxiety. “When cognitive errors form and social development is hindered,” Dr Ahmed explains, “Interpersonal relationships start to deteriorate.”
Unable to understand himself or practise self-compassion, the individual’s self-esteem erodes. Frustration builds. “A frustrated person becomes aggressive,” he says, referring to the frustration–aggression hypothesis. When that frustration persists, it often turns inward. “That long-term frustration takes the form of depression, and one of the primary symptoms of depression is anxiety.”
This explains why many South Asian men struggle silently. They may not recognise sadness as sadness. They may only feel restlessness, anger, or exhaustion.
Can the damage be undone?
The answer, thankfully, is not hopeless. Dr Ahmed stresses that recovery is possible, though not absolute. Psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), and Transactional Analysis can help individuals identify and correct distorted thinking patterns.
“For someone whose emotional development was hindered in childhood, a 100 per cent turnaround may not be possible,” he says honestly. “But it is possible to overcome depression, manage difficulties, and lead a quality life.”
The earlier the intervention, the better the outcome.
A message to parents and caregivers
Dr Ahmed’s advice to parents is direct and urgent. “A single word, a single tone, even a non-verbal gesture can influence a child’s emotional and cognitive development,” he says.
He emphasises two things above all. First, recognise that development is not just physical. Emotional and social growth are equally vital. Second, allow children — especially boys — to express emotions freely and appropriately. “They must be allowed to express their emotions correctly,” he says, “so they can grow into acceptable people in the outer world.”
Letting boys cry does not weaken them. It equips them. Strength is not the absence of feeling; it is the ability to understand and manage feeling without fear or shame. If we want a future generation of men who are emotionally steady, respectful, and resilient, we need to start by changing the sentences we say today, especially the ones we’ve repeated without thinking.
Sometimes, the most radical act of care is simply allowing a boy to cry and saying, “It’s okay.”

FM Than Swe arrived in Islamabad on a four-day official visit on the night of January 24. The Foreign Office (FO) had said the visit “aims to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries”.
Addressing a joint press conference alongside Than Swe, Dar said, “Our discussions were very productive and comprehensive.”
He highlighted that the Burmese FM’s visit reflected the “importance that both countries attach to revitalising and strengthening Pakistan-Myanmar relationship”.







Noting that their meeting went for over an hour, Dar said the discussions covered the “full spectrum of bilateral relations”.
“We also exchanged views on regional peace and security and agreed that all […] issues should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy,” the deputy prime minister added.
He stressed that both countries had historic bonds, adding, “Building on this positive foundation, we agreed to work closely to expand cooperation in all party areas.”
Dar stated that the two leaders undertook a “comprehensive review of bilateral cooperation, including political, commercial, trade and cultural areas, as well as people-to-people exchanges”.
“Both sides noted the significant untapped potential for cooperation and underscored the importance of advancing engagement through sustained, structured and results-oriented initiatives,” he added.
The foreign minister detailed that they agreed to enhance cooperation in capacity-building, development and humanitarian areas.
“The two sides also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation, to facilitate consular assistance to each other’s nationals, particularly the […] victims of scamming gangs,” Dar said, adding that the countries agreed to maintain close coordination through relevant channels to ensure “collective cooperation”.







Dar said he and Than Swe emphasised the importance of further intensifying people-to-people exchanges, closer cooperation through academic linkages, youth engagement, and cultural initiatives.
The deputy premier briefed the visiting dignitary on Pakistan’s “rich Buddhist heritage and highlighted the potential of religious tourism as a means to strengthen cultural ties and promote greater connectivity between our people”.
“Pakistan supports a peaceful, stable and prosperous Myanmar. We are confident that Myanmar can play a very positive role in creating regional reconciliation, shared prosperity and development for all,” Dar said.
He revealed that after their meeting, Islamabad and Naypyidaw signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on political consultations between the foreign offices of the two countries.
“This institutional mechanism will facilitate regular engagement and sustained dialogue on bilateral, regional and international issues,” the foreign minister explained.







In a subsequent statement following their meeting, the FO highlighted that the visit provided an “opportunity for comprehensive discussions on the entire spectrum of Pakistan-Myanmar relations”.
“The two sides reviewed the state of bilateral ties and exchanged views on regional peace and security, as well as other matters of mutual interest,” the statement said, adding that both also discussed ways to “further strengthen cooperation in trade and economic engagement”.
Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for a “peaceful, stable, and prosperous Myanmar and reiterated Pakistan’s principled position in favour of national reconciliation in Myanmar”.







FM Than Swe invites Pakistani investors to Myanmar
In his remarks, FM Than Swe highlighted that Pakistan and Myanmar have historically maintained “a very good, friendly relationship”.
“We had many, many good and fruitful discussions, very openly and frankly,” he said.
Highlighting Myanmar’s proximity to Southeast Asia, Than Swe said, “We are the centre of the biggest market of the world. That’s why we would like to invite Pakistani investors and business people to come, see and study the opportunity for cooperation between the two countries.”
The foreign minister stressed the need to enhance “all sectoral cooperation in the future”, including in trade, business, investments, military-to-military, as well as cultural and scientific areas.
“I believe that our meeting today will pave the way for our future cooperation,” Than Swe said.
Besides economic cooperation, he expressed Myanmar’s desire to sign MoUs for the promotion of trade and investments. The minister emphasised the importance of facilitating the business community.
He also took note of the rich heritage both Pakistan and Myanmar have, pointing out possibilities for tourism opportunities between the two nations.

 

During his address, FM Than Swe recalled an interaction between Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and Myanmar’s founder Gen Aung San at the time of the latter’s independence.
While the minister acknowledged that Myanmar faced “some kind of conflicts and challenges”, he asserted that no foreign citizens were killed in the past five years.
“That’s why I’d like to ask you to come and see and to try to find opportunities for investment and trade,” he added.
Pakistan hopes Myanmar polls will ‘contribute to stability’
According to a statement by Myanmar’s foreign ministry, Than Swe is also scheduled to hold meetings with other high-ranking officials.
Earlier in the day, Dar welcomed Than Swe at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he highlighted the “longstanding friendship and cooperation” between the two countries.







Dar noted that there had “been a gap” in high-level exchanges, as the last visit from Myanmar’s leadership was in May 2015, while from Pakistan’s side, then-president Asif Ali Zardari had paid a visit in 2012.
“Pakistan remains committed to further strengthening our bilateral cooperation in areas of mutual interest through sustained, structured engagement and practical, result-oriented initiatives,” said Dar.

 

He further stated that Pakistan “sincerely desires peace, stability and prosperity for Myanmar and hopes that the forthcoming general elections will contribute to stability, development and inclusive governance”.
Voting in Myanmar’s month-long election concluded on Sunday, with pro-military Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) on course for a landslide victory in the polls.
Noting that bilateral ties between Islamabad and Naypyidaw were “rooted in history and mutual respect”, Dar pointed out that their ambassador was the first to present his credentials to the founder of Pakistan following the country’s independence.
“Our two countries have enjoyed cordial and friendly relations. Pakistan greatly values this partnership and remains keen to further enhance the cooperation across a wide range of mutually beneficial fields,” FM Dar said.
On his part, FM Than Swe said he was “delighted” to visit Islamabad and appreciated the “valuable invitation and hospitality” accorded to him.
Expressing Myanmar’s desire to enhance bilateral and multilateral cooperation, he said, “Before I left my country, I met with many ministers to seek opportunities on how to work together […] They have a keen interest.
“We do believe that this meeting will pave the way for our future cooperation,” the dignitary said.
He further noted that both Pakistan and Myanmar had remained as part of “one country under the British colony for more than one century”.
“They closely fought the war for independence [against] the British. Since that time, all successive governments of Myanmar have maintained cordial and friendly relations with Pakistan</p><small>2026-01-26 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647310-punjab-revokes-permission-to-keep-pet-lions' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab revokes permission to keep pet lions</strong></a><br><p>

The total volume was 449.8 million shares at a value of Rs43.56 billion.
The market fell to its lowest point at 3:28pm PKT, hitting an intraday low of 188,268.38 points. This rally was on account of investors positioning for a further cut in the policy rate based on easing inflation, rising foreign exchange reserves, and a stable rupee.
After the markets closed, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its key policy rate at 10.5 per cent on Monday during its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting.
Brokerage house Topline Securities noted that this “came as a surprise” as a majority of their participants were expecting a rate cut.

Brokerage house Topline Securities noted that this “came as a surprise” as a majority of their participants were expecting a rate cut.
According to the Monetary Policy Statement released by the State Bank, while headline inflation was 5.6pc in December 2025, core inflation steadied around a higher level of 7.4pc.
The external current account posted a deficit of $244 million in December 2025, leading to a $1.2 billion deficit during the first half of FY2026. Weak exports were driven by a sharp drop in food exports, particularly rice, while high-value-added (HVA) textile exports remained resilient. However, sustained growth in workers’ remittances and ICT services helped in containing the current account deficit.
As a result of this, the MPC noted that inflation and the current account were broadly unchanged, while the outlook for economic growth had improved. Based on this, the committee believed it prudent to hold the policy rate unchanged at the current level to ensure price stability and sustainable economic growth.







Since its last meeting, the committee noted that real GDP growth was provisionally reported at 3.7pc year on year for the first quarter of the FY2026, led by the industry and agriculture sectors. Auto sales, domestic cement dispatches, Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) sales (excluding furnace oil), fertiliser off-take, and imports of machinery and intermediate goods recorded notable growth, suggesting sustained domestic demand.
Large-scale manufacturing (LSM) posted growth of 8pc year on year and 10.4 pc year on year in October and November 2025, raising LSM growth to 6pc during July-November FY2026, according to the committee’s findings. Their findings also posted that the latest information in agriculture pointed to encouraging prospects for the wheat crop. These favourable developments in the commodity-producing sectors were expected to provide further energy to the services sector.
The MPC noted that this improved upon earlier estimates of GDP growth, now projecting it in the range of 3.75-4.75pc for FY2026, expecting this momentum to strengthen further in FY2027, supported by the earlier reduction in the policy rate.
They also noted that consumer and business confidence improved, and inflation expectations of these stakeholders eased. Furthermore, the State Bank’s forex reserves surpassed the end-December target, reaching $16.1 billion as of January 16, led by SBP’s ongoing forex purchases.
Looking forward, the MPC noted that the continued uptick in worker remittances and supportive global commodity prices are expected to contain the current account in the range of 0 to 1 pc of the GDP in FY2026. Based on this and official inflows, the SBP’s forex reserves were expected to surpass $18 billion by June 2026 and rise further in FY2027, nearing the 3-month import cover benchmark. However, the committee noted that this outcome was susceptible to some major risks from global trade fragmentation and geopolitical uncertainty.
FBR tax revenues grew by only 9.5pc, well below last year’s pace of 26pc and the annual target, resulting in a shortfall of Rs329 billion. This implied a steep revenue acceleration would be needed in the second half of FY2026. Contained expenditures, particularly lower interest payments, had helped improve the overall fiscal balance and support the full-year fiscal deficit target.
This implied a steep revenue acceleration would be needed in the second half of the year. Contained expenditures, particularly lower interest payments, had helped improve the overall fiscal balance and support the full-year fiscal deficit target. However, achieving the annual primary surplus target remained challenging, underscoring the need for sustained fiscal consolidation and discipline for the economy to grow on a sustainable basis.
Since the last MPC meeting, broad money grew to 16.3 percent by early January, driven by stronger private sector credit and government borrowing.
Private credit expanded by Rs578 billion during FY2026 (till January 9), with textiles, wholesale and retail trade, chemicals, and consumer financing leading.
The State Bank has decided to lower the average cash reserve requirement from 6.0 percent to 5.0 percent to support credit growth.
The committee also noted that the IMF had slightly upgraded Pakistan’s global growth forecast for FY2026, while highlighting risks from elevated global tariff uncertainty and volatile commodity prices.
Due to these developments, the MPC maintained the real policy rate to stabilize inflation within the target range of 5 to 7pc over the medium term. The committee also emphasised the need for a coordinated and prudent monetary and fiscal policy mix, along with structural reforms to enhance productivity, to increase exports, and achieve high growth on a sustainable basis.
During the last MPC meeting, the central bank revised its benchmark rate to 10.5 per cent, a 50-basis-point reduction, noting that inflation remained within the 5-7 per cent target range on average during July-November of the 2026 fiscal year, though it said core inflation proved relatively sticky.
In a poll by Reuters, analysts expected another 50- to 100-basis-point reduction in the monetary policy rate today, bringing the rate to 9.5 or 10 per cent, owing to easing inflation, rising foreign exchange reserves, and a relatively stable rupee.
Ahead of the rate cut announcement, belief had been strengthened by the government’s reduction of cut-off yields across most tenors to single digits for the first time in four years on January 21.
Local businessmen were looking for a steeper decline in the interest rate to restore investor confidence in the economy.
During the last rate cut, the business community expressed their dismay at the 50 basis point cut, with the president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce expressing that “such a token adjustment falls far short of what is urgently required to revive Pakistan’s fragile economy and restore business confidence.”

The violence has put new pressure and scrutiny on US President Donald Trump’s aggressive deportation campaign, which has drawn demonstrators onto the streets of the Midwestern city.
“I think it was completely senseless, it was murder,” said the young woman, who did not want to give her last name.
Federal agents shot to death 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti, claiming he intended to harm them during a confrontation on Saturday.
However, a video shared widely on social media and verified by US media showed Pretti never drawing a weapon, with agents firing at him seconds after he was sprayed in the face with a chemical irritant and thrown to the ground.

 

“I think the way that the government is bringing ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) in to take away our neighbours and to pull families apart is completely inhumane. And if we don’t speak out for them, then other people won’t,” she added during the protest on Sunday.
Pretti was killed less than three weeks after another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good, was shot dead by an ICE agent — on a street just over a mile (1.6 kilometres) away.
Trump and his officials quickly defended the officer who fired the shots, who has neither been suspended nor charged.
‘This is America’
Coleen Fitzgerald, a 73-year-old retired construction worker, attended the protest wearing a clown costume and multi-colored wig and wig to mock the Trump administration.
“We started to have ICE people come up there, and they’re coming into our restaurant,s and they’re going to people’s homes, and they’re taking them,” she told AFP.
“We can’t live like this. This is America. We’re supposed to be free, and they’re trying to take that away.”
Fitzgerald brandished a homemade sign, “Hire clowns, expect a circus”, against a backdrop of demonstrators chanting “our streets” and “ICE out now”.
Thousands of federal immigration agents have been deployed for weeks to Minneapolis, after media reports on alleged fraud by Somali immigrants — which Trump has seized upon.
The Democratic-led city has one of the highest concentrations of Somali immigrants in the United States.
The area around Pretti’s killing was marked off Sunday by yellow caution tape with police cars parked across the road.
At a makeshift memorial near the site of the shooting, demonstrators gathered after the march to lay flowers and candles.
Locals wearing hats and coats huddled around a sea of bouquets. Some knelt despite the icy ground, with temperatures falling as low as -4F (-20C).
“Stop killing us,” “Enough is enough. ICE out,” and “Alex should be here” were among the slogans written on signs posted around the site.</p><small>2026-01-26 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/261633163c1a5ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969173/eu-opens-probe-into-musks-grok-over-sexual-ai-deepfakes' target='_blank'><strong>EU opens probe into Musk’s Grok over sexual AI deepfakes</strong></a><br><p>The European Union (EU) on Monday hit Elon Musk’s social media platform X with an investigation over AI chatbot Grok’s generation of sexualised deepfake images of women and minors, in the latest step of an international backlash against the tool.
Grok faces an outcry after it emerged that users could sexualise images of women and children using simple text prompts such as “put her in a bikini” or “remove her clothes”.
“In Europe, we will not tolerate unthinkable behaviour, such as digital undressing of women and children,” said European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.
“It is simple — we will not hand over consent and child protection to tech companies to violate and monetise.
The harm caused by illegal images is very real,” she said in a statement to AFP.
EU tech commissioner Henna Virkkunen said the probe would “determine whether X has met its legal obligations” under the bloc’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which is designed to police internet giants.
She said the rights of women and children in the EU should not be “collateral damage” of X’s services.
Brussels said it was investigating whether X had properly mitigated “risks related to the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, such as manipulated sexually explicit images, including content that may amount to child sexual abuse material”.
Three million images
According to research published on Thursday by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), a nonprofit watchdog, Grok generated an estimated three million sexualised images of women and children in a matter of days.
As part of the new probe, the EU said it was widening an existing investigation into X aimed at tackling the spread of illegal content and information manipulation.
Musk’s social media platform, formerly known as Twitter, has been the target of an investigation since December 2023 under the EU’s digital content rules.
Brussels slapped a 120 million euro ($140 million) fine on X in December for violating the transparency obligations of the DSA, triggering angry reactions from US President Donald Trump’s administration.
The breaches included the deceptive design of its “blue checkmark” for supposedly verified accounts and the failure to provide access to public data for researchers.
The EU has insisted it will enforce its rules despite pressure from Washington.
The dispute over tech regulation comes as the bloc has grappled with the Trump administration on multiple other fronts — from the Ukraine war to trade to Greenland.</p><small>2026-01-26 11:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/260947437a9cdbc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969084/india-afraid-peace-board-may-try-to-resolve-kashmir' target='_blank'><strong>India afraid peace board may try to ‘resolve Kashmir’</strong></a><br><p>• Diplomats, press divided over New Delhi’s perceived reluctance to join Trump-led body• Given his propensity to paint himself as a global peacemaker, The Hindu warns US president may offer to mediate Kashmir dispute
DESPITE being invited to join the ‘Board of Peace’ by President Donald Trump, India has yet to formally get involved in the process.
Conspicuous by its absence from the Davos ceremony where 20 world leaders — including Trump and Pakistan’s PM Shehbaz Sharif — signed the board’s charter, some in India are viewing New Delhi’s reluctance through the lens of the Kashmir dispute.
President Trump says the board’s goal is to make the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza permanent and oversee an interim government in the Palestinian territory.
“This is not just for America, but for the whole world. I think we can spread it to other places. Like we did successfully in Gaza,” he had said at the time.
But there seems to be concern among some circles that if India signs up for the board — which Trump envisions as a future replacement for the United Nations — it may open up the disputed territory of held Kashmir to broader international or American scrutiny.
Although Trump has repeatedly offered to mediate on the Kashmir issue, especially in the wake of the May 2025 flare-up between the two South Asian rivals, New Delhi has firmly opposed all such overtures thus far.
According to a BBC Hindi report, the ‘Board of Peace’ is being formed at a time when the US is withdrawing from several UN organisations, raising the question of whether the board aims to render the world body irrelevant.
There is also a concern among some circles that the board will only strengthen a unipolar world, a system currently dominated by the US.
In a recent editorial on the issue, The Hindu newspaper painted Pakistan’s decision to join the board as “a warning signal to India”.
The newspaper attributed its alarm to the US president’s propensity to playing the ‘peacemaker’, having already claimed to have solved multiple regional and global conflicts during his first year in office.
“…[I]f Trump decides to include the Kashmir dispute in [his] peace plans, the Peace Board will try to resolve it. Once it joins the board, it will also be difficult for India to object to the deployment of its troops in the international peacekeeping force,” the editorial noted.
Former Indian ambassador to the United Nations, Syed Akbaruddin, recently wrote in the Times of India that the Security Council resolution has determined the term of this board is until Dec 31, 2027, and that it is obliged to report to the Security Council every six months.
This is done to ensure that this temporary arrangement does not turn into a permanent global model, he noted, adding that by contrast, Trump’s peace plan seems to have no set term and “could be used outside Gaza as well”.
He said that some UN officials are also indicating that this framework can be applied to other conflict areas.
But Ranjit Roy, who was India’s ambassador to Nepal and Vietnam, believes that it won’t be easy for New Delhi to take a decision on Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’.
“India’s dilemma has increased. Whether India accepts it or rejects it, it will have an impact. I think the risks of joining the Peace Board are high. First of all, Trump is its chairman and it seems pointless to expect justice from his transactional approach,” BBC Hindi quoted him as saying.
“It is not clear whether each country will have the same status in this,” said Roy.
“Just like in the UN General Assembly, each country has only one vote. When the Security Council approved it, it was limited to Gaza, but now that there have been changes, it could extend beyond Gaza.”
The editorial in The Hindu argued that “the rift in US-India relations and the delicate situation of trade talks may also be reasons for not rejecting Trump’s invitation at this stage. Doing so could incur Trump’s displeasure, as in the case of the French president.”

All three, including the capital’s former police chief, Habibur Rahman, were tried in absentia, and their whereabouts are not known.
The verdict comes ahead of elections on February 12, the first in the South Asian country of 170 million people since Hasina’s overthrow in August 2024.
Five other ex-police officers were sentenced to varying terms.
The case concerned the killing of six protesters in Dhaka on August 5, 2024, the day Hasina fled to India as protesters stormed her palace.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.

 

“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder read to the court in Dhaka.
The court heard how Rahman sent messages to police units ordering the use of lethal force to crush the protests.
Chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said he was satisfied with the verdict against the three men, although he wanted tougher sentences for the five others found guilty who were handed prison terms.
“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told the reporters after the verdict.
In November, the same court also sentenced Hasina — who remains in hiding in India — to death for crimes against humanity. She refused to attend the trial and denies the charges.
In that case, former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal was also sentenced to death in absentia after being found guilty of crimes against humanity.
Ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who was in court and had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.</p><small>2026-01-26 10:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/261430550c35c10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969166/gold-zips-past-5100-to-another-high-on-safe-haven-rush' target='_blank'><strong>Gold zips past $5,100 to another high on safe-haven rush</strong></a><br><p>Gold surged to a record high above $5,100 an ounce on Monday, extending a historic rally as investors piled into the safe-haven asset amid rising geopolitical uncertainties.
Spot gold was up 2.2 per cent at $5,089.78 per ounce by 6:56am GMT, after earlier touching an all-time high of $5,110.50. US gold futures for February delivery also gained the same amount to $5,086.30 per ounce.
The metal soared 64pc in 2025, its biggest annual gain since 1979, driven by safe-haven demand, US monetary policy easing, robust central bank purchases including China’s fourteenth straight month of buying in December, and record inflows into exchange-traded funds.
Prices have set consecutive record peaks over the past week and have already risen more than 18pc this year.
The latest catalyst “is effectively this crisis of confidence in the US administration and US assets, that was set off by some of the erratic decision-making from the Trump administration last week”, said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com.
US President Donald Trump abruptly stepped back on Wednesday from threats to impose tariffs on European allies as leverage to seize Greenland.
Over the weekend, he said he would impose a 100pc tariff on Canada if it followed through on a trade deal with China.
He has also threatened to hit French wines and champagnes with 200pc tariffs, in an apparent effort to pressure French President Emmanuel Macron into joining his Board of Peace initiative. Some observers fear the board could undermine the United Nations’ role as the main global platform for conflict resolution, though Trump has said it will work with the UN.
“This Trump administration has caused a permanent rupture in the way things are done, and so now everyone’s kind of running to gold as the only alternative,” Rodda added.
Meanwhile, a rising yen dragged the dollar broadly lower on Monday, with markets on alert for possible intervention in the yen and investors cutting dollar positions ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting.
A weaker dollar makes greenback-priced gold more affordable for holders of other currencies.
Analysts expect gold prices to climb further toward $6,000 this year on mounting global tensions as well as strong central-bank and retail demand.
“We expect further upside (for gold). Our current forecast suggests that prices will peak at around $5,500 later this year,” said Philip Newman, director at Metals Focus.
“Periodic pullbacks are likely as investors take profits, but we expect each correction to be short-lived and met with strong buying interest,” Newman added.
Spot silver advanced 4.8pc to $107.903, after hitting a record of $109.44. Spot platinum climbed 3.4pc to $2,861.91 per ounce, after hitting a record high of $2,891.6 earlier in the session, while spot palladium was 2.5pc higher at $2,060.70, having touched a more than three-year high.
Silver climbed above the $100 mark for the first time on Friday, building on its 147pc rise last year as retail-investor flows and momentum-driven buying compounded a prolonged spell of tightness in physical markets for the metal.</p><small>2026-01-26 10:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2613025303a291d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969161/cold-wave-continues-to-grip-country-as-another-western-disturbance-rolls-in-nwfc' target='_blank'><strong>Cold wave continues to grip country as another western disturbance rolls in: NWFC</strong></a><br><p>The country remained in the grip of a cold wave on Monday, with the National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC) saying that a new western disturbance is likely to persist in upper Pakistan until Tuesday.
The NWFC, in its daily forecast, warned of traffic disruption due to heavy snowfall, causing road closures and slippery conditions in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galiyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli, Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Noshki, Harnai and Zhob.
It added that there was a risk of landslides and avalanches in the mountainous areas of upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
“Tourists are advised to remain extra cautious and avoid unnecessary travelling during the forecast period,” it said.
The NWFC forecast rain, wind, thunderstorms and snowfall in Balochistan, KP, Kashmir and GB on Monday.
According to the forecast, heavy rain and moderate-to-heavy snowfall is also likely at isolated places in south and northeast Balochistan, Kashmir and upper KP, while rain, wind, thunderstorms and snowfall is also expected at isolated places in southern Punjab and upper Sindh.
It added that rain, wind and thunderstorms were likely in Islamabad as well as upper and central Punjab in the evening and night hours of Monday.
On Tuesday, according to the NWFC, rain and snowfall with thunderstorms and strong winds are expected in upper KP, Kashmir, GB and upper Punjab. Heavy rain and moderate-to-heavy snowfall is also likely in isolated parts of Kashmir and upper KP, it said.
“Cold and dry weather is likely in other parts of the country,” the forecast added.

 

The past 24 hours saw cold and dry weather in most parts of the country, with rain and snowfall in northeastern and western Balochistan and upper KP.
The lowest minimum temperature recorded today (as of 10:30am) was -12 degrees Celsius in Leh, followed by -08°C in Kalam and Ziarat.
Relief operations in Orakzai, Kurram
The Pakistan Army carried out relief operations in KP’s Orakzai and Kurram districts amidst heavy rains and snowfall, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Monday.
During heavy snowfall in Orakzai, the army “cleared blocked roads on an emergency basis”, it said.
Meanwhile, in Kurram, which was also severely affected by the snowfall, the Pakistan Army swiftly launched a rescue operation and restored an eight-kilometre road using heavy machinery, the outlet reported.
It said that Manato Sadda road had been completely blocked by heavy snowfall, stranding numerous vehicles.
“Pakistan Army conducted a prompt operation, safely evacuating passengers and vehicles to secure locations,” Radio Pakistan said.
PDMA put on high alert in Balochistan
Meanwhile, Balochistan’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) was put on high alert as rain and snowfall continue to affect parts of the province, state-run APP reported.
It quoted Director of Relief Operations at PDMA Mir Attaullah Mengal as saying that the disaster management authority’s teams had been “fully mobilised since the onset of snowfall and rainfall”. He further said that operations to clear the snow were being carried out even at nights to “prevent road blockages and minimise inconvenience for the public”.
“Timely and effective measures have enabled PDMA to keep all major highways operational despite severe weather conditions. Uninterrupted traffic flow and public safety remain [our] top priorities,” the official said.
He urged the people, particularly travellers and tourists, to avoid unnecessary travel, adopt precautionary measures and cooperate with PDMA and district administration teams to prevent accidents.
“The PDMA has been put on high alert across the province in view of the possibility of further snowfall and adverse weather conditions. The chief minister has directed relevant authorities to submit hourly situation reports while closely monitoring evolving conditions,” Mengal added.
He said that the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre would remain operational 24 hours in the given situation, “performing coordination, monitoring, tracking, and reporting duties, while ensuring the timely provision and effective management of relief resources”.
The director said that during the previous spell of snowfall, the PDMA had “successfully prevented” the closure of major highways and rescued several stranded individuals and vehicles. He added that the PDMA was working in coordination with district administrations and taking all possible measures to deal with any untoward situation.
The APP report further stated that PDMA personnel and machinery had been kept on standby under the supervision of the authority’s director general on the directives of Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and the provincial chief secretary, Shakeel Qadir Khan.
Cold weather predicted for Karachi: PMD
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), in its three-day weather forecast for the Karachi division, predicted partly cloudy weather with chances of light rain in Sukkur, Larkana, Kambar Shahdadkot, Jacobabad and Dadu districts today under the influence of the westerly wave.
It added that partly cloudy and cold/very cold weather were likely to prevail over most of Sindh.
The PMD predicted a high of 21-23°C and a low of 11.5°C today, with 46 per cent humidity during the daytime dropping to 15-25pc in the evening and a northeast/easterly wind.
Cold and dry weather is expected for both Tuesday and Wednesday, with relatively similar temperatures: highs of 21-23°C and 22-24°C and lows of 9-11°C and 10-12°C, respectively.
While the humidity on Tuesday is forecast to remain around 45-55pc, dipping to 20-30pc in the evening, Wednesday will see a higher humidity level of 60-70pc in the daytime and 40-50pc in the evening.
A northeasterly wind on Tuesday will turn northwest/westerly, while a northeast/easterly wind on Wednesday is predicted to turn west/southwesterly.</p><small>2026-01-26 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/261429557fe1be6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969167/israel-agrees-to-reopen-rafah-crossing-only-for-gaza-pedestrians' target='_blank'><strong>Israel agrees to reopen Rafah crossing only for Gaza pedestrians</strong></a><br><p>Israel said on Monday it would only allow pedestrians to travel through the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt as part of its “limited reopening” once it has recovered the remains of the last captive in the Palestinian territory.
Reopening Rafah, a vital entry point for aid into Gaza, forms part of a truce framework announced by US President Donald Trump in October, but the crossing has remained closed since Israeli forces took control of it during the conflict in the besieged Palestinian territory.
Visiting US envoys had reportedly pressed Israeli officials to reopen the crossing during talks in Jerusalem over the weekend.
World leaders and aid agencies have repeatedly pushed for more humanitarian convoys to be able to access Gaza, which has been left devastated by more than two years of bombardment and depends on the inflow of essential medical equipment, food and other supplies.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said on Monday that Israel had agreed to a reopening “for pedestrian passage only, subject to a full Israeli inspection mechanism”.
The move would depend on “the return of all living hostages and a 100 per cent effort by Hamas to locate and return all deceased hostages”, it said on X.







It remained unclear whether the reopening would allow medical patients to leave Gaza for treatment in Egypt or other countries.
The Israeli military said it was searching a cemetery in the Gaza Strip on Sunday for the remains of the last captive, Ran Gvili.
“Upon completion of this operation, and in accordance with what has been agreed upon with the US, Israel will open the Rafah Crossing,” said Netanyahu’s office.
The announcement came after Gaza’s newly appointed administrator, Ali Shaath, said the crossing would open “in both directions” this week.
“For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate, it is a lifeline and a symbol of opportunity,” Shaath said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.
Israeli media had also reported that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner had urged Netanyahu to reopen Rafah during their Jerusalem talks.
Before the conflict erupted in October 2023, Rafah had been the only gateway connecting Gazans to the outside world and enabling international humanitarian aid to enter the territory, home to 2.2 million people living under Israeli blockade.
Last captive
A spokesman for Hamas’s Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida, said on Sunday that the group had “provided mediators with all the details and information in our possession regarding the location of the captive’s body”, referring to Gvili.
Obeida added that “the enemy (Israel) is currently searching one of the sites based on information transmitted by the Al-Qassam Brigades”.
Except for Gvili, all of the 251 people taken captive have been returned, whether living or dead.
A non-commissioned officer in the Israeli police’s elite Yassam unit, Gvili was killed in action on the day of the attack and his body was taken to Gaza.
The first phase of the US-backed ceasefire deal had stipulated that Hamas hand over all the captives in Gaza.
Gvili’s family has expressed strong opposition to launching the second phase of the plan, which includes reopening Rafah, before they have received his remains.
“First and foremost, Ran must be brought home,” his family said in a statement on Sunday.
The Gaza war flattened much of Gaza, a territory that was already suffering severely from previous rounds of fighting and from an Israeli blockade imposed since 2007.
The two-year conflict between Israel and Hamas has left at least 71,657 Palestinians dead in Gaza, according to the territory’s health ministry, figures considered reliable by the United Nations.</p><small>2026-01-26 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/261314448e55ab0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969162/lawyers-stage-protest-outside-ihc-observe-strike-after-sentencing-of-imaan-and-hadi' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers stage protest outside IHC, observe strike after sentencing of Imaan and Hadi</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Lawyers staged a protest on Monday at the main gate of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the arrest and sentencing of lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, in the controversial social media posts case.
The protest was led by IHC Bar President Syed Wajid Ali Gilani.
Senior lawyer Babar Awan and a large number of advocates from the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC), High Court Bar and District Bar also participated in the protest. They carried banners reading “Justice for Lawyers” and raised slogans against the police.
Addressing the gathering, Awan said that “state and police terrorism” was being carried out against lawyers, adding that such actions were harmful for society.
Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA), IBC and Islamabad District Bar jointly announced a strike. However, lawyers appeared in the high court only in urgent matters.
Due to the protest, strict security arrangements were made in and around the IHC, with a heavy police contingent deployed and armoured vehicles stationed outside the court premises.
The issue of the strike also came up during the hearing of a civil case before Chief Justice Sarfaraz Dogar. Advocate Qaiser Abbas Gondal informed the court that the bar had called for a strike due to the arrest of lawyers.
When the chief justice asked which lawyers had been arrested, Gondal replied that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha had been taken into custody. The chief justice then asked whether they were considered lawyers. No reply was given.
CJ Dogar observed that if the bar considered them lawyers, their representatives could convey their position in chambers.
Due to the lawyers’ strike, proceedings in several cases were affected.
In a separate statement, IHCBA Secretary Manzoor Jajja said lawyers were requested not to appear in court as part of the strike. He announced that lawyers would proceed to the district courts in a convoy and later gather again to record their protest.
On Saturday, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka sentenced Imaan and Hadi to a total of 17 years in prison on multiple charges in the case.
The case pertaining to controversial social media posts stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad.
The NCCIA complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.</p><small>2026-01-26 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647246-gul-plaza-to-be-sealed-today-as-demolition-operation-begins' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza to be sealed today as process operation begins</strong></a><br><p>

The nuclear-armed Asian neighbours share a 3,800 km border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s.
Ties between the countries were shaken by a 2020 clash in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died in hand-to-hand combat. After that, the Himalayan border was heavily militarised by both sides.
Both countries began improving ties last year after staging a series of high-level bilateral visits.
Direct flights resumed in 2025 as both countries stepped up trade and investment flows against the backdrop of US President Donald Trump’s combative foreign policy.</p><small>2026-01-26 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2609095868151fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969144/winter-storm-grips-much-of-us-in-snow-ice-arctic-cold' target='_blank'><strong>Winter storm grips much of US in snow, ice, Arctic cold</strong></a><br><p>A powerful winter storm spread a paralyzing mix of heavy snow, sleet and freezing rain from the Ohio Valley and mid-South to New England on Sunday, compounded by bitter, Arctic cold gripping much of the US east of the Rockies.
Winter storm warnings were posted for most of the eastern third of the United States covering 118 million people, as the deep freeze strained energy supplies in some areas, and the National Weather Service predicted widespread, prolonged travel disruptions.







An estimated 157 million Americans were warned to bundle up against cold ranging from sub-zero temperatures along the Canadian border to below-freezing as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.
The Arctic blast was accompanied by gusty conditions that sent wind-chill conditions a measure of how cold it feels based on the rate of heat loss from the body plunging as low as minus 50 degrees Fahrenheit in the northern Plains.
Deep snow, thick ice
Some of the heaviest snowfall, up to one foot or more since the storm developed on Friday, was measured on Sunday in parts of Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania.New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had mobilized National Guard troops in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley to assist with the state’s emergency storm response.

The onslaught of snow, ice and winds hit air travel especially hard, with major carriers forced to cancel more than 11,000 U.S. flights scheduled for Sunday, according to an industry tracking service FlightAware.com.Ronald Reagan National Airport, located in northern Virginia just across the Potomac River from Washington, was effectively closed altogether.
Airports serving other major metropolitan areas, including New York, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina, had at least 80% of their Sunday flights canceled, FlightAware data showed.Power outages were widespread across the South, where freezing rain deposited layers of ice up to an inch thick, toppling tree limbs and transmission lines.







More than 1 million homes and businesses in eight states from Texas to the Carolinas were without electricity at the height of the storm on Sunday, according to utility data posted online. Tennessee bore the greatest brunt of energy cuts, accounting for about a third of all the outages. More than 800,000 electricity customers remained without power as of 0229 GMT, according to PowerOutage.us.
Federal, state governments declare emergencies
In parts of the mid-Atlantic, heavy snow early in the day gave way to sleet and freezing rain, adding to treacherous driving conditions and making it more difficult for street crews to safely clear road surfaces.

Heavy ice was reported by the weather service to be accumulating across the interior sections of the Eastern seaboard as far south as Atlanta, as the low-pressure system driving the storm moved through the Appalachian Mountains.
Calling the storm “historic,” President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations for a dozen states, mostly in the mid-South. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia declared weather emergencies on Saturday.
The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorizing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.
On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorize grid operator PJM Interconnection to run “specified resources” in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits.
While the storm system was expected to drift away from the East Coast into the Atlantic on Monday, more Arctic air was forecast to rush in behind it, prolonging bitter cold, icy conditions over the next few days, the weather service said.
“The situation with this storm is pretty unique, just because it’s going to stay cold for a period of time,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on the “Fox News Sunday Briefing” program. “This ice that has fallen will keep those (power) lines heavy, even if they haven’t gone down immediately.”</p><small>2026-01-26 05:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647213-pakistani-citizen-returns-home-after-25-years-in-indian-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani citizen returns home after 25 years in Indian jail</strong></a><br><p>
