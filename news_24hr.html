Police said Kulsoom, 43, and her daughter Maryam, 11, were stabbed and killed by her husband, Samiullah. South DIG Syed Asad Raza said the double murder appeared to be an “honour” killing.
The suspect was arrested, and the knife used in the double homicide was also recovered and seized.
Police registered a case against the suspect on the complaint of the victim’s brother Faisal Khan.
Raza said the suspect stabbed and injured his wife and daughter in their home located near Noorani Masjid. The victims were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where they were pronounced dead.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
Man shot dead, other hurt
A man was shot dead while another was wounded in Lyari on Friday.
Chakiwara SHO Sajid Dharejo said two men were shot at and wounded in Bihar Colony. They were taken to the trauma centre of Civil Hospital Karachi, where Ahmed Wali, 40, expired during treatment, while Kamran Husain, 28, was admitted for treatment. He sustained a bullet wound on his leg, and his condition was out of danger.
The police suspected a personal enmity behind the incident.
However, Dharejo said the police would register a First Information Report (FIR) of the incident once the relatives approach it, to initiate formal proceedings and ascertain the motive and identity of the killers.</p><small>2025-12-06 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/06161130c36f6f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959553/qatar-pm-says-gaza-truce-incomplete-without-full-withdrawal-by-israel' target='_blank'><strong>Qatar PM says Gaza truce incomplete without ‘full withdrawal’ by Israel</strong></a><br><p>The nearly two-month-old ceasefire in the Gaza Strip will not be complete until Israeli troops withdraw from the Palestinian territory under a peace plan backed by Washington and the United Nations, mediator Qatar’s prime minister said on Saturday.
“Now we are at the critical moment … A ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of the Israeli forces, [and] there is stability back in Gaza,” Qatari premier Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told the Doha Forum, an annual diplomatic conference in the Gulf state’s capital.

 

Qatar, alongside the United States and Egypt, helped secure the long-elusive truce in Gaza, which came into effect on October 10 and has mostly halted two years of fighting between Israel and Hamas.
Under a second phase of the deal, which has yet to begin, Israel is to withdraw from its positions in the territory, an interim authority is to take over governance, and an international stabilisation force (ISF) is to be deployed.
Arab and Muslim nations have been hesitant to participate in the new stabilisation force, which could end up fighting Palestinians.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, also speaking at the forum, said talks on the force were ongoing and critical questions remained as to its command structure and which countries would contribute.
But its first goal, Fidan said, “should be to separate Palestinians from the Israelis”.
“This should be our main objective. Then we can address the other remaining issues,” he added.
Hamas is also supposed to disarm under the 20-point plan first outlined by US President Donald Trump, with members who decommission their weapons allowed to leave Gaza. The group has repeatedly rejected the proposition.
‘Lasting solution’
Turkiye has indicated it wants to take part in the stabilisation force, but its efforts are viewed unfavourably in Israel, which considers Ankara too close to Hamas.
“I think the only viable way to finish this war is to engage faithfully and forcefully in peace talks,” Fidan said.
Sheikh Mohammed said Qatar and fellow truce guarantors Turkiye, Egypt and the US were “getting together in order to force the way forward for the next phase” of the deal.
“And this next phase is just also temporary from our perspective,” he said.
“If we are … just resolving what happened in the last two years, it’s not enough,” he continued, calling for a “lasting solution that provides justice for both people”.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty met with the Qatari prime minister on the sidelines of the forum to discuss the ceasefire, Cairo said on Saturday.
“The meeting addressed developments on the ground in the Gaza Strip, with both officials stressing the importance of continuing efforts to implement the Sharm El-Sheikh peace agreement,” the foreign ministry statement said, referring to the Red Sea resort town where the October deal was inked.
Egypt has announced plans to train 5,000 police officers for Gaza and is among the countries considered possible contributors of troops to the stabilisation force.</p><small>2025-12-06 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637760-ministers-back-ispr-dgs-fiery-presser-amid-ptis-criticism' target='_blank'><strong>'Free to respond with full force': Ministers defend ISPR DG's 'guarded' language</strong></a><br><p>

IndiGo has cancelled thousands of flights this week due to a shortage of pilots after it failed to plan adequately for new rules limiting pilots’ work hours.
The government responded on Friday, announcing special relief for the carrier and the operation of additional trains to help clear the backlog.
The Delhi airport posted on X on Saturday that flight operations were steadily resuming, but cancellations remained rife elsewhere.







‘Waiting for my luggage’
With IndiGo’s spate of cancellations, fares rose on flights operated by other airlines on popular routes. The government said it was capping fares to maintain pricing discipline, without disclosing details of the caps.
The Civil Aviation Ministry said it would “continue to closely monitor fare levels through real-time data and active coordination with airlines”.
Fares were last capped during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
The flight cancellations are the biggest crisis ever for 20-year-old IndiGo, which has an over 60 per cent market share in the world’s most-populous country and has prided itself on on-time performance while luring passengers with lower fares.
IndiGo acknowledges failing to plan properly for the November 1 deadline to implement the stricter rules on night flying and weekly rest for pilots.
On Friday, more than 1,000 IndiGo flights were cancelled. After the government announced the exemptions to the rules for IndiGo, the airline said it could return to normal operations between December 10 and 15.
On Saturday, IndiGo cancelled 124 flights in Bengaluru, 109 in Mumbai, 86 in New Delhi and 66 in Hyderabad, airport sources told Reuters.
The disruptions have upended weddings in India as many families and guests were stranded at airports.
Hundreds of passengers gathered outside Bengaluru and Mumbai airports on Saturday, some unaware of the cancellations, according to Reuters witnesses.
Satish Konde had to catch a connecting flight from Mumbai to the western city of Nagpur and had checked in before being told it was cancelled.
“I am waiting for my luggage to be returned,” he said.
Pilots call exemption ‘selective dispensation’
The new pilot rest and duty rules capped the number of night landings to two from six and restricted the maximum number of hours a pilot can fly in the night to 10 hours.
For now, IndiGo has been exempted from both measures until February 10.
The new rules also said that if a pilot takes a personal leave that cannot be not counted in calculating his weekly rest period of 48 hours.
That restriction too has been put on hold for all airlines, given the IndiGo crisis.
That has upset pilot labour groups, who told the government that safety must not be compromised to make up for IndiGo’s poor planning, the head of the Federation of Indian Pilots, C.S. Randhawa, told Reuters.
The Airline Pilots Association of India objected on Friday, calling the relief for IndiGo “selective dispensation”.
The norms “exist solely to safeguard human life,” the association said in a letter to the government.
Other major Indian airlines, including Air India and Akasa, have not had to cancel flights due to the new rules.</p><small>2025-12-06 10:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637746-nawaz-buried-slogan-driven-politics-with-development-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Nawaz 'buried slogan-driven politics' with development: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

On Friday, Lt Gen Chaudhry — without once naming Imran — called the former premier “a mentally ill person”, “a narcissist” and “a security risk”, while stressing it was for the government to decide how to deal with him. He had accused him and his party of pushing a narrative designed to undermine the armed forces and destabilise the state.
In response, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali had expressed “disappointment” over the comments, stating that “PTI’s narrative has never been, nor will it ever be, anti-state”.
Speaking to the media in Sialkot, Asif recalled that Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition, insisting that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman.
“When they were in power, I remember, he (Imran) would engage in theatrics and sometimes don a dupatta to mimic leaders. He did that for Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who is with him today. He would also use derogatory language for women,” Asif said, adding that the incarcerated leader continued to do the same via statements made on his X account.
“If DG ISPR has given a reaction, I believe it is a guarded reaction,” he said.
The minister assailed the PTI for engaging in activities that were reflective of an “anti-state” narrative. He lamented that the party leadership did not “acknowledge” the sacrifices of the armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
“I have attended the funerals of many martyrs … I have never seen someone from the PTI there,” the defence minister said, urging the party to “speak in favour of martyrs and not terrorists”.
“Do not attempt to hold dialogue with terrorists or take a soft stance with them,” Asif warned, telling the PTI that “when you continue to adopt such an approach, this is exactly the kind of language that will be used against you”.
Asif was of the view that while the military’s spokesman was “still careful with his words, I, however, have the liberty to give you a hard-hitting answer”.
Referring to interviews given by Imran’s sisters to Indian media, Asif assailed the party for “engaging with the enemy”.
“How can they call themselves Pakistanis and patriots?” he questioned.
The defence minister further said that the PTI’s “sole ideology was to gain power”, alleging that they had no “allegiance to Pakistan”.
Referring to the May conflict with India, Asif pointed said, “All our neighbours expressed their sympathies on the martyrdom of our soldiers … they stood with us shoulder to shoulder during the war, but internally this one party here did not play any role in confronting the enemy.”
“The PTI leader has something to say about everything; why did he not say anything during the conflict for our soldiers and armed forces?” he asked.
“Even during times of war, they continued to criticise the armed forces leadership … how can such people now say that the DG ISPR should not have said this or that.
“He has every right to say it,” Asif emphasised.
In a warning to the party, the defence minister said: “Do your politics, hold protests, but do not threaten the sovereignty and honour of Pakistan.”
In his response to the military spokesperson’s comments yesterday, Barrister Gohar had said, “It is regrettable when state institutions and political figures label each other as mentally ill or perceive each other as threats.”
He had also reaffirmed the party’s commitment to the country in his remarks, dismissing allegations of PTI spreading an “anti-state” narrative.
“Pakistan belongs to us, and so does the army; we have demonstrated this in practice and will continue to do so.”
He had urged that the conduct of “certain non-stakeholders”, without specifying who he was referring to, should not become a cause of tension between PTI and the institutions.
Barrister Gohar had said Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were incarcerated, and the overall situation would improve if permission were granted for meetings with them.
“The country cannot afford tension and chaos,” Gohar had said.</p><small>2025-12-06 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637738-justice-zafar-ahmed-rajput-sworn-in-as-shc-cj' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput sworn in as SHC CJ</strong></a><br><p>

Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah had resigned from the Supreme Court on November 13, hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari. Shah had assailed the amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan” while Minallah said he had sworn to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”.
Meanwhile, Lahore High Court’s Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza had tendered his resignation two days later, saying: “After the 27th Amendment in the Constitution, I am not inclined as a matter of principle and in good conscience to continue as a judge.”
In a statement printed in Dawn on Saturday, 60 citizens and lawyers issued a statement saying: “We mourn presently, not at the resignations of Justices Shah, Minallah and Mirza — they have permanently etched their names on the short list of national heroes who prized principles over expediency — but at the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the high courts of Pakistan, and the entinguishment of the last embers of an independent judiciary.”
The statement included the names of lawyers Abid S. Zuberi, Jibran Nasir, Imaan Mazari, Asad Rahim, Sardar Latif Khosa, Salman Akram Raja, Zainab Janjua, Faisal Siddiqui and Salahuddin Ahmed.
Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar was also included in the list.
The statement said that Mansoor “undisputedly ranks among the finest jurists ever produced by Pakistan”.
“He stood entirely peerless in his zeal for judicial reform and his vision to drag the creaking edifice of the Pakistan judiciary into the 21st century and transform it into an instrument for speedy justice for the common litigant,” it said.
“It is our judiciary’s and our nation’s misfortune that we have chosen to sacrifice him at the altar of short-term political expediency and the desire for personal advancement of others,” the statement said.
It went on to say that Minallah had been a consistent voice for the weak and disempowered, for the families of missing persons, for journalists muzzled by the state, for the opposition “tormented by the government of the day and for judges hounded by intelligence agencies”.
“He was one of the few judges possessed with sufficient self-awareness to be able to cast a critical eye on the judicial history of Pakistan,” it said.
“To be lauded by those on the receiving end of power and criticised by those wielding it, is a distinction for the conscientious constitutional judge,” the statement said.
It also noted his contribution to transforming the Islamabad High Court as a “citadel of judicial independence”.
Talking about Mirza, the statement said that he left behind an enduring example of a judge who “refused to let fundamental rights become casualties of turbulent times and became an anchor of constitutional steadiness”.
“In his decisiveness and integrity, he neither courted controversy nor shied away from difficult decisions,” it said.
“By choosing judicial defiance over judicial silence, he ensured that when history is written, his name will stand firmly on the side of constitutional courage as the only high court judge who resigned in protest against the pseudo 27th Constitutional Amendment,” it said.
The statement said that it was ironic that the judges were castigated by the “wielders of power, not for their own sin but for earlier sins of those whom they resisted”.
“Their fault lay in the steadfastness of their ‘no’ when others were willing to say ‘yes’,” it said.
“Their decision to preserve their constitutional oath and honour over office and privilege: to speak out instead of silently acquiescing to regression masquerading as reform; to stand instead of kneeling — is a spark to the conscience of a nation,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-06 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0612511834243fa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959540/hong-kong-fire-echoes-of-loss-below-burnt-towers' target='_blank'><strong>Hong Kong fire: Echoes of loss below burnt towers</strong></a><br><p>More than a week after flames tore through Hong Kong’s Wang Fuk Court estate, killing at least 159 people, the city remains shrouded in grief and a search for answers.
The blaze that engulfed seven high-rise towers and took nearly two days to extinguish, is the deadliest fire in an apartment complex in recent history, eclipsing London’s Grenfell Tower inferno of 2017.
Many of the estate’s 4,600 residents, reeling from shock and loss, wandered for days near the disaster site in parks, squares and community centres, while volunteers rushed to help the needy and mourners flocked to pay tribute to the dead.
A family home gone
How the fire started in the housing estate in Tai Po district on the afternoon of November 26 has not been established.
The entire complex was being renovated and by the time firefighters arrived, the blaze had spread upward and then jumped from tower to tower as scaffolding mesh wrapped around the buildings fanned the flames, authorities have said.
Fire alarms were also not working properly and many of the residents on higher floors became trapped by the smoke and heat.

Mr and Mrs Leung, who had lived in the estate for decades and raised their now adult daughters there, returned to their home to find it ablaze.
“I stood there watching as one block after another went up in flames, my legs felt so weak I could hardly stand,” said Mrs Leung, 71.
“I still don’t understand how the fire could spread so fiercely … It was terrifying.”
The couple did not want to be further identified.
They said they counted themselves lucky to be safe, but mourn their airy two-bedroom flat looking out over low hills, where Mr Leung often lounged on his sofa or tended to pot plants.
The Leungs, along with many other displaced residents, congregated around a small park next to the estate in the days after the disaster, a clutch of benches and a pavilion that was soon transformed into a memorial site as people left thousands of handwritten condolence messages and flower tributes.
Searching for a son
David Ho, 75, rested on a bench in that park as he tried to come to terms with the realisation that his son and ex-wife, who lived on the 16th floor of the tower where the fire started, did not make it out. They were among 31 people listed as missing.
“He liked running. He was always going overseas to take part in races. Always training,” Ho said of his son, 39-year-old Ho Wing-cheung.
He showed a picture on his phone of an athletic man in a black Adidas vest and shorts competing in a race in Japan.
After finishing a chicken-rice lunchbox, Ho got up and walked towards the train station, bound for his small flat on an outlying island where he now lives alone.
The charred monoliths, darker than the other buildings around them, loomed behind him, visible for miles around.
Police say 140 of the 159 known dead have been identified and they were aged between one and 97.
Some bodies, found on stairwells and rooftops, have been reduced to ash, authorities said, making identification difficult.

Enduring image of grief
J Wong, the son of a 71-year-old retiree who was captured in a photograph that went viral, has spent the past week trying to confirm the fate of his mother who was home at the time and is also listed among the missing.
One recent errand was to obtain his mother’s dental records to potentially assist with identification later.
Both father and son roam the disaster area daily, including a community centre where people are shown photos of victims.
“(There are) 40 years of memories here, from the day he (my father) got married. At that time, Tai Po was still a farm. And the train here was a traditional steam one,” the younger Wong said.
“I want to take this chance to tell everyone who has been affected. No matter if you’ve lost your families or close friends, let’s try to give ourselves some hope. Don’t give up.”

Help from home and abroad
The disaster has united Hong Kong residents.
As soon as news spread of the blaze, many flocked to an open plaza near the memorial park, bringing supplies such as clothes, blankets, food and drink for those in need.
University student Crystal Ho, 22, was one of those who volunteered to help, feeling compelled to act.
“That pain … no matter how much we do, it feels like we can never truly carry their suffering.”
Around one in three of all residents in the complex were above the age of 65, often cared for by foreign domestic helpers from the Philippines and Indonesia.
After the fire, many could be seen shuffling around the area with walking sticks or pushed in wheelchairs by their helpers.
The tragedy has spotlighted the enduring role of the city’s hundreds of thousands of foreign helpers, who often live with their employers in cramped spaces and earn modest wages in one of the world’s most expensive cities.

Never again
It also comes after a tumultuous period in Hong Kong, including mass pro-democracy protests in 2019 and a national security crackdown that has silenced dissent.
Police have arrested 21 people in a criminal investigation into the tragedy. The city’s leader has also promised a judge-led review of oversight of renovations.
Wary of public anger spiralling, authorities in the Chinese-ruled city have detained and questioned a number of activists seeking greater government accountability and transparency. But undercurrents of defiance remain.
“This is not an ordinary disaster, this is a systemic disaster,” read one message placed among the mounds of flowers, folded paper cranes and notes wishing peace to the victims.
The Leungs say they echo the hope for justice, so that something like this is never repeated.
“The government must pay attention so disasters like this never happen again, leaving people like us with no one to turn to. I just hope that … no one else has to suffer the same pain,” said Mrs Leung.

According to a press release, the development projects are aimed at fostering economic growth in the province.
“Investing in education, health, and agricultural mechanisation will play a transformative role in driving the growth of Punjab, a vital pillar of Pakistan’s economy,“ ADB Country Director for Pakistan Emma Fan was quoted as saying.
“These strategic investments will modernise agriculture, enhance human capital, and significantly improve livelihoods for millions of people across Punjab,” she said.
According to the handout, a $120m concessional loan and $4m grant have been allocated for the Punjab Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Agriculture Mechanisation Project to accelerate the province’s transition to modern, disaster-resilient, and low-carbon agriculture practices, benefiting 220,000 rural farm households.
“The project will help mechanise farming and provide alternative livelihoods for agricultural workers, including through boosting the knowledge and skills of 15,000 women. It will introduce a new financing model for farm mechanisation service providers to equip small-scale farmers with advanced machinery,” the ADB said.
The Bank also approved $107m for the Responsive, Ready, and Resilient Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Secondary Education in Punjab Programme.
“This includes a $7m grant from ADB’s Asian Development Fund and a $100m loan from ADB’s ordinary concessional capital resources. The results-based programme aims to modernise secondary education by enhancing inclusive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education across Punjab. The project, implemented by the Punjab School Education Department, will improve access to quality education for students across the province,” it said.
Further, the ADB approved a $150m concessional loan for the Punjab Nursing and Health Workforce Reform Programme to enhance nursing education, develop disaster-resilient training facilities, and strengthen health workforce governance in Punjab.
It noted that Pakistan faced a shortage of qualified nurses while the global demand for trained nurses was growing.
“Modernising the nursing sector will meet national and international demands. The results-based programme will focus on upgrading nursing curricula, expanding faculty development initiatives, and implementing a digital human resource management information system to align workforce planning with healthcare service needs. By expanding the pool of qualified nurses, predominantly women, the program will improve health service delivery across the province,” it said.
It said that key components of the nursing programme included the establishment of three centres of excellence in Lahore, Multan, and Rawalpindi.
“These centres will feature state-of-the-art simulation laboratories, digital learning platforms, and gender-responsive hostels, addressing Punjab’s demand for skilled healthcare workforce capable of meeting growing local needs and employment opportunities abroad,” it said.
Last month, the ADB had approved loans totalling $330m to Pakistan for the country’s Second Power Transmission Strengthening Project.</p><small>2025-12-06 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/061215276378c48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959542/9-terrorists-killed-in-2-intelligence-based-operations-in-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>9 terrorists killed in 2 intelligence-based operations in KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday that nine terrorists were killed in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Tank and Lakki Marwat districts.
In a statement, the military’s media wing said nine khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khawarij were killed on December 5.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It said an IBO was conducted in Tank on the reported presence of terrorists. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
In a separate IBO conducted in Lakki Marwat, “two more khawarij were effectively neutralised by security forces”.
ISPR said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain terrorists.
According to the military’s media wing, the eliminated terrorists “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area,” the statement said.
ISPR added that a counter terrorism campaign under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of “foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the operations. According to a statement posted by state broadcaster PTV on X, he said that security forces were making big gains against terrorism under Azm-i-Istehkam.
“The nation stands with security forces against terrorism. We are determined to root out terrorism from the country,” he said.







President Asif Ali Zardari commended the “courage and timely action” of the security forces in “thwarting the heinous intentions of the terrorists,” PTV reported.
He stressed that “the nation’s resolve to eliminate terrorists will continue to stay intact until the menace is rooted out”.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also lauded the efforts of the security forces, stating that “security forces neutralised the militants with remarkable efficiency,” the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
He also praised their professionalism, courage, and the swift action taken. He noted that the “timely operations thwarted major threats and demonstrated the exceptional skill and commitment of Pakistan’s security personnel”.
“The nation takes pride in the bravery and professionalism of its soldiers,” he was quoted as saying. “Security forces remain fully determined to restore and maintain lasting peace in KP,” the minister added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Earlier this week, security forces killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in KP’s North Waziristan district.</p><small>2025-12-06 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/060913020520918.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959529/imfs-executive-board-to-meet-on-dec-8-to-approve-disbursement-of-12bn-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>IMF’s Executive Board to meet on Dec 8 to approve disbursement of $1.2bn to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board will meet on December 8 (Monday) to approve $1.2 billion in loans to Pakistan.
The IMF had reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan on its loan programmes in October after extensive talks were held in Karachi, Islamabad and Washington from September 24 to October 8.
The agreement still requires approval from IMF’s Executive Board before funds can be released.
If approved, it would unlock about $1.2bn in fresh financing for the country; roughly $1 billion under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and another $200 million under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
The IMF confirmed the date of the meeting in a brief announcement on Friday. The official calendar posted on the IMF website also showed the Executive Board would review Pakistan’s loan programmes.
Negotiations between Islamabad and the lending agency, led by IMF mission chief Iva Petrova, had focused on Pakistan’s fiscal performance, monetary stance, structural reforms and progress on climate-related commitments.
In its earlier assessment, the IMF noted that Pakistan had made “strong progress” in fiscal consolidation, reducing inflation and strengthening external buffers. It also acknowledged the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) continued tight monetary policy, which has played a key role in anchoring inflation expectations.
Structural reforms — especially those related to state-owned enterprises, energy-sector viability, competition and public-service delivery — were cited as areas where the authorities had demonstrated continued commitment.
The Fund also pointed to advances under the RSF-supported climate agenda, including efforts to enhance resilience to natural disasters, strengthen water-resource management and improve the country’s climate-information systems.
These reforms have taken on greater urgency following recent floods that caused widespread damage to agriculture, infrastructure and livelihoods.
Approval of the reviews is widely expected to bolster investor confidence at a critical moment, as Pakistan continues to stabilise its economy amid external pressures and the lingering effects of flood damage.
Islamabad has been under sustained pressure to maintain fiscal discipline, accelerate energy-sector reforms and continue revenue-mobilisation measures to ensure longer-term stability.
The IMF has warned, however, that risks remain elevated. The economic outlook has been tempered by flood-related losses, and the Fund has emphasised that monetary policy must remain “appropriately tight and data-dependent” to keep inflation within the SBP’s target range.
It has also stressed the need for steady implementation of reforms to strengthen competition, enhance productivity, improve public services and reduce persistent vulnerabilities in the energy sector.
If the Board grants its approval on December 8, Pakistan could receive the disbursement as early as the following day.
Officials in Islamabad hope the inflow will reinforce external buffers, support economic recovery and signal continued international confidence in the government’s reform agenda.
Key report released ahead of meeting
Ahead of the meeting, the IMF had released its long-awaited Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), in which it highlighted persistent corruption challenges in Pakistan driven by systemic weaknesses across state institutions and demanded immediate initiation of a 15-point reform agenda to improve transparency, fairness and integrity.
The report, publication of which is a precondition for the IMF Executive Board’s approval of the loan programmes, estimated that Pakistan could boost economic growth by about 5 to 6.5 per cent over five years if it implements a package of governance reforms beginning within the next three to six months.
The report led to criticism of the government, and opposition parties called for a probe into the “worst financial scandal of Pakistan’s history”.
However, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated last week that the report was “not criticism” but a “catalyst for accelerating long-overdue reforms”.
He maintained that the report acknowledged significant progress in sectors including taxation and governance, and that many of its priority recommendations were “already work in progress”.
The finance minister further said the government was committed to implementing the remaining recommendations as part of broader institutional reforms essential to sustaining Pakistan’s economic turnaround.</p><small>2025-12-06 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637747-karachi-court-sentences-man-to-39-years-for-raping-12-year-old-girl' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi court sentences man to 39 years for raping 12-year-old girl</strong></a><br><p>

The government has confirmed 607 deaths, with another 214 people missing and feared dead, in what President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has called the country’s most challenging natural disaster.
More than two million people — nearly 10 per cent of the population — have been affected.
Survivors will be offered up to 10 million rupees ($33,000) to buy land in a safer location and build a new house, the finance ministry said in a statement late on Friday.
The government is also offering one million rupees as compensation for each person killed or permanently disabled.

 

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said more than 71,000 homes were damaged, including nearly 5,000 that were completely destroyed by last week’s floods and landslides.
Around 150,000 people remain in state-run shelters, down from a peak of 225,000.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it was considering Sri Lanka’s request for an additional $200 million, on top of the $347 million tranche the country was already due to receive this month.
“The IMF remains closely engaged with the Sri Lankan authorities during this challenging period, and is committed to supporting the country as it undertakes urgent efforts to recover, rebuild and promote resilience for the future,” the Washington-based lender said late on Friday.
Cyclone Ditwah devastated swathes of Sri Lanka as it was emerging from its worst economic crisis in 2022, following a four-year, $2.9 billion bailout loan from the IMF agreed in early 2023.
Dissanayake told parliament on Friday that Sri Lanka’s economy had made a significant recovery, but was not strong enough to withstand the latest shock alone.
Meanwhile, the DMC said more rain was expected in many parts of the country, including the worst-affected central region, triggering fears of more landslides.
That has hampered clean-up operations.
However, residents evacuated from the landslide-prone central hills have been told not to return immediately to their homes, even if they were unaffected by the slips.
A fresh landslide alert was issued on Friday for areas not covered by previous warnings.</p><small>2025-12-06 06:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/061047390d3d7f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959533/us-vaccine-panel-upends-hepatitis-b-advice-in-latest-trump-era-shift' target='_blank'><strong>US vaccine panel upends hepatitis B advice in latest Trump-era shift</strong></a><br><p>An advisory panel appointed by President Donald Trump’s vaccine-sceptic health secretary voted on Friday to stop recommending that all newborns in the United States receive a hepatitis B vaccine.
The move to end the decades-old recommendation is the panel’s latest contentious about-face on vaccine policy since its overhaul by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this year.
US health authorities previously recommended that all babies, not just those born to mothers believed to have hepatitis B, receive the first of three vaccine doses just after birth.
The approach aimed, in part, to prevent transfers from mothers who unknowingly had hepatitis B or had falsely tested negative, and had virtually eradicated infections of the potentially deadly liver disease among young people in the country.
After delaying the vote by a day, the panel on Friday passed its new recommendation for “individual-based decision-making,” in consultation with a health care provider, when children are born to mothers testing negatively for the disease.
The decision to vaccinate at birth should “consider vaccine benefits, vaccine risks, and infection risks”.
Trump hailed the move as “a very good decision” on his Truth Social platform.







But the new recommendation was immediately condemned by several medical groups, who noted widespread shortcomings in US maternal health screening as well as the possibility of infections from others.
“This irresponsible and purposely misleading guidance will lead to more hepatitis B infections in infants and children,” American Academy of Pediatrics President Susan J. Kressly said in a statement.
The vote was 8–3.
Trump-appointed officials at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are expected to formally adopt the recommendations at a later date.
The panel also voted to recommend that babies who are not vaccinated at birth wait at least two months to get the initial dose, and that blood tests be done to measure antibodies before a second dose.
Panel overhaul
After becoming health secretary, Kennedy sacked every member of the once-staid Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP), replacing them with figures whose vaccine-sceptic views track more closely with his own.
It has since set to work on reviewing prior recommendations — already tweaking advice on Covid-19 and measles jabs.
Medical experts fear the push could further contribute to declining vaccination rates in the United States.
The panel on Friday also began a broader review of the childhood vaccination schedule, and sparked further controversy by allowing testimony from lawyer Aaron Siri, a close Kennedy associate known for spreading unfounded theories on the subject.
While Trump vocally supports Kennedy’s policies, some in the Republican Party have pushed back, notably Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy.
Cassidy, a medical doctor, condemned the ACIP decision, noting the original recommendation was never “a mandate” to get the jab.
CDC officials “should not sign these new recommendations and instead retain the current, evidence-based approach,” he said on X.







Cassidy’s expression of alarm, like his prior statements against Kennedy, provoked criticism after he provided the key vote to confirm the health secretary in February.
‘Do no harm’
The United States had urged universal vaccination at birth against hepatitis B since 1991, advice also recommended by China, Australia and the World Health Organisation.
But several ACIP members argued that Friday’s decision would align the United States with other economically developed countries such as France and Britain.
The repercussions of the ACIP’s vaccine recommendations are broad because federal guidelines often dictate whether vaccines are paid for by health insurance companies in the United States, where a vaccine can cost hundreds of dollars.
But the committee’s influence is waning amid withering criticism from the US scientific and medical community, with Democratic-led states announcing they will no longer follow its recommendations.
Ahead of the vote, Cody Meissner, one of the few dissenting voices on the advisory committee, urged his colleagues not to change the current recommendations.
“Do no harm is a moral imperative. We are doing harm by changing this wording,” he warned.</p><small>2025-12-06 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0609541207b54e8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959410/kp-cabinet-decides-to-withdraw-politically-motivated-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>KP cabinet decides to withdraw ‘politically motivated’ May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet on Friday decided to withdraw what it called “politically motivated violence cases registered on May 9 and 10 without credible evidence.”
The cabinet met with Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in the chair and ministers, chief secretary and administrative secretaries in attendance, according to an official statement.
It added that the participants took key decisions regarding the distribution formula for reserved seats in medical and dental colleges for students from merged tribal districts, the new proposed posting and transfer policy, the committee report on action in aid of civil powers law, matters related to wheat stock and procurement, the May 9 and 10 violence cases, the formation of the KP Sugarcane and Sugar Beet Board, additional funding for development schemes and other public welfare initiatives.
The cabinet decided that “politically-motivated” May 9 and 10 cases registered without credible evidence would be withdrawn. However, it offered no details.

Sends new posting, transfer policy to its panel for review

It referred the matter regarding the award of medical and dental colleges reserved seats after the bifurcation of South Waziristan district to its relevant committee for deliberation and recommendations to be laid in the next meeting.
Similarly, the new proposed posting and transfer policy was sent to the relevant cabinet panel for review.
The cabinet approved the nomination of mill representatives for the KP Sugarcane and Sugar Beet Control Board for 2025-26.
A detailed briefing was also given on wheat stocks, inter-provincial movement and future strategy. The previously notified committee was authorised to take necessary steps for additional wheat procurement as and when required.
The cabinet also approved financial assistance for the treatment of two patients undergoing kidney and bone marrow transplants. Approval was granted for the release of funds under the District Development Plan and District Development Initiatives to ensure timely completion of projects.
Besides, a special grant of Rs150 million was also approved for the counter-terrorism department.
The forum endorsed the implementation of the recommendations of the committee tasked with proposing measures following the repeal of the action in aid of civil powers law.
It also decided to refer the inquiry into the Radio Pakistan Peshawar attack case to a special committee of the provincial assembly for deliberation and recommendations.
Mr Afridi, who chaired the meeting via video link, issued policy guidelines for strengthening good governance, transparency and the use of modern technology in official affairs.
He said that the provincial government had already provided a clear roadmap for good governance and was actively promoting transparency and digitalisation across all departments.
Directing officials to prioritise online participation in official meetings, Mr Afridi said the approach would not only save time but would also result in significant reduction in government expenditure.
He condemned the recent press conference by federal ministers and declared it an inhuman, immoral and unconstitutional act.
The chief minister said that such behaviour was equivalent to deliberately provoking people and destabilising the situation.
He complained that leader of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan and his wife were being subjected to solitary confinement in jail.
“Imran Khan is a leader of the entire nation, while his wife is an apolitical and modest woman, so their mistreatment is unacceptable,” he said.
The chief minister said to ensure institutional transparency and merit, all recruitment in provincial government departments, autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies would be strictly conducted through the Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency.
He said that no recruitment would be made through any private testing agency.
Referring to the recent meeting of the National Finance Commission, Mr Afridi said that his government vehemently presented Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s case about constitutional right to resources and received support from all participants.
He pointed out that the continued denial of the due Rs1.375 trillion share of the merged tribal districts in the NFC Award over the last several years was a grave injustice to residents.
The chief minister expressed concern over the 55-day closure of the Torkham border and said truck drivers as well as the travellers, especially women, children and the elderly, were severely affected.
He directed the administration of Khyber district to immediately ensure provision of food, shelter and all essential facilities to those people.
Mr Afridi also ordered the provision of bulletproof vehicles on a priority basis to civil officers, especially the district administration, and said all hurdles to the procurement process should be removed without delay.

Israel announced on Wednesday it would unilaterally open the Rafah crossing to allow residents to flee the Gaza Strip, a move swiftly rejected by Egypt as Cairo insisted on lifting the blockade in both directions to relieve the besieged Palestinian territory.
Egypt refused to facilitate what critics fear is the forced displacement of Palestinians, insisting on adherence to the terms of the United States-brokered peace plan, which mandates full humanitarian access.
The Rafah crossing, the only vital artery to the outside world for the residents of Gaza not controlled directly by Israel, has been shuttered for months, strangling the flow of life-saving aid.
The foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar expressed concern over the use of the Rafah crossing to expel Palestinians.
“The Ministers underscore their absolute rejection of any attempts to expel the Palestinian people from their land and stress the necessity of the full adherence to the plan proposed by US President Donald Trump, including its provisions on keeping the Rafah Crossing open in both directions, ensuring the freedom of movement for the population, and refraining from compelling any resident of the Gaza Strip to leave, rather to create the right conditions for them to stay on their land and participate in building their homeland, within a comprehensive vision aimed at restoring stability and improving their humanitarian conditions,” the statement read.







The FMs also underscored the need to fully sustain the ceasefire and ensure the unrestricted entry of humanitarian assistance into the Gaza Strip. They urged early recovery and reconstruction efforts and to create the conditions necessary for the Palestinian Authority to resume its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip.
The top diplomats of the Muslim countries also emphasised the importance of fully implementing the “Trump Plan” without delay or obstruction, “in order to achieve security and peace, and to consolidate the foundations of regional stability”.
“In this regard, the Ministers underscore the need to fully sustain the ceasefire, alleviate civilian suffering, ensure the unrestricted entry of humanitarian assistance into the Gaza Strip, initiate early recovery and reconstruction efforts, and create the conditions necessary for the Palestinian Authority to resume its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip thereby laying the groundwork for a new phase of security and stability in the region,” added the statement.
The ministers also reaffirmed their countries’ commitment to working closely with the United States and all relevant regional and international parties to ensure the full implementation of UNSCR 2803 and other UN Security Council resolutions. They emphasised the importance of creating conducive conditions for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace based on international legitimacy and the two-state solution.
The ministers underscored that this should lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state along the lines of June 4, 1967, including the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Dar speaks with Saudi counterpart
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar slammed Israel’s restriction on the Rafah border crossing to allow only the exit of Gaza residents, calling it a “clear violation” of the peace plan that finally brought an end to the fighting.
The Foreign Office (FO) said FM Dar held a phone call with Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan today and discussed regional developments, particularly Gaza.
“FM strongly condemned Israel’s unilateral plan to restrict the Rafah crossing for the exit only of Gaza residents, a clear violation of the peace plan and a move that undermines humanitarian access.
“Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring unfettered aid to Gaza and advancing coordinated efforts toward lasting peace,” the FO said.







Negotiations on the next stage of the Gaza ceasefire continue without significant progress at a moment when the truce appears particularly fragile, AFP reported on Thursday.
The first phase included a withdrawal of Israeli forces on October 10 to a line that still gave them military control of over half of Gaza, the release of all prisoners, living or dead, held by Hamas or its allies, and an increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.
Though all living prisoners were released on October 13, one body is still said to be in Gaza.
For now, the Israeli government demands that the last hostage’s remains are returned before any talks begin on the second phase via mediating countries: US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye.
Egypt will also host a conference on Gaza’s reconstruction that will focus on the territory’s humanitarian needs, but no date has yet been set.
The process seems to be stuck mainly due to the Trump plan’s grey areas.</p><small>2025-12-06 04:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0608580097d250d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959440/city-council-panel-rejects-all-govt-findings-in-childs-manhole-death-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>City Council panel rejects all govt findings in child’s manhole death in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The City Council’s Water and Sewerage Committee on Friday rejected all reports on the death of three-year-old Ibrahim presented by the officials of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) and TransKarachi.
The little boy fell into an open manhole near NIPA earlier this week and died.
The Water and Sewerage Committee, led by Leader of Opposition in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin, also criticised what was described as a pattern of “irresponsibility and indifference” of senior municipal officials responsible for handling the case.
The meeting called by the committee was attended by representatives from TransKarachi and the KWSC, but the municipal commissioner, despite being formally asked to provide essential details about the incident, neither appeared nor sent a representative.
After the meeting, the members of the committee visited the site of the incident where Saifuddin while talking to media said that the absence of the municipal commissioner reflected a “clear lack of seriousness from the KMC administration and the mayor’s office” especially given the gravity of the incident.
“Throughout the meeting, the departments attempted to distance themselves from responsibility,” he said.
“The officials from TransKarachi and the water board continued to hold each other accountable rather than presenting factual assessments. The KWSC’s initial report, which asserts that the storm-water drain involved in the incident does not fall under its jurisdiction, was categorically rejected by the committee for being incomplete and unsatisfactory.”
He said that although several officers had been suspended, the action seemed to be an attempt to pacify the public outrage rather than addressing the root cause of the tragedy.
“Four days have passed and the authorities still cannot determine who is responsible for leaving the manhole open. This is unacceptable,” he said, adding that such confusion exposed severe administrative gaps.

Reworking the NFC Award by fiat rather than political consensus is a part of this misplaced effort. This is a mistake that history will neither forget nor forgive.
Ever since the seventh NFC Award came into effect in 2010, it has been characterised in conventional wisdom, either mistakenly or disingenuously, as the real reason for the country’s slide towards fiscal ‘insolvency’. Has the said award been solely responsible for sinking Pakistan’s public finances? This false conclusion is the result of simplistic reductionism and is not borne out by facts.

 

A clinical, dispassionate and thorough analysis of Pakistan’s public finances since 2010 reveals the following facts and underlying trends, most of which are not touched upon in the discourse. Instead, a lazy consensus has developed blaming the seventh NFC Award for the start of the country’s fiscal troubles. As this article will illustrate, this position is not supported by the evidence.
Pakistan’s public finances are under water due to four proximate factors. One, perennial low revenue mobilisation. Two, lack of fiscal discipline on the expenditure side. Third, Covid-19. Fourth, the shock introduced by the rapid slide in the rupee since 2018, especially the large devaluations in 2019 and 2023, combined with the steep hike in the policy rate since. None of these are directly related to the seventh NFC Award per se, or are factors that could not have been anticipated and accommodated with better governance.
Firstly, Pakistan’s public finances have been in deep water since the late 1980s. Profligate spending and chronic low mobilisation of revenue led to persistently high fiscal deficits, resulting in public debt touching around 535 per cent of revenue by 2000. This led to the need for debt relief under the Paris Club in 2001. By 2008, the fiscal deficit had once again shot up to 7.6pc of GDP.

The NFC Award’s real failure is not its formula but the misgovernance of the ruling elite.

While the fiscal deficit did receive an impetus in the first few years after the seventh NFC Award went into effect, a result of the centre continuing to pay for substantial provincial expenditures despite the passage of the 18th Amendment, it was contained from 2014 onwards. Despite the need for additional fiscal resources, the centre made no serious effort to raise tax revenue, with FBR’s tax effort remaining underwhelming. The tax-GDP ratio remained flat-lined at around 10pc of GDP.
In spite of the weak tax effort, growth in federal revenues roughly matched the annual increase in debt servicing from 2012 till 2018. As a result, the ratio of debt servicing to net federal revenue (after provincial transfers) was on a declining path in this period.

 

The real shocks to Pakistan’s public finances have come from 2019 onwards. First of these was the impact of the massive rupee devaluation combined with the steep increase in the policy rate by SBP since then. The rupee has lost 63pc of its value against the US dollar since 2017. Cumulatively, the twin shocks have added Rs23.1 trillion to the public debt stock between 2018 and 2025, accounting for a full 48pc of the increase in public debt over this period. Rather than provincial transfers, the sharp fall in the rupee combined with the skyrocketing of the SBP policy rate have strained public finances. A compounding factor occurred in 2020 and 2021, with the government responding to the Covid-19 shock with a fiscal stimulus amounting to over 4.9pc of GDP.
Together with a perennial revenue mobilisation failure, Pakistan faces a public spending crisis. Nothing illustrates the spending misgovernance as much as the utilisation of the additional resources transferred to the provinces under the seventh NFC Award. Cumulatively, Rs40.4tr has been transferred to the provinces since 2010, ostensibly for education, health services, etc, and yet, the number of children out of school has increased exponentially instead of declining, health outcomes are not better, and nearly every social and development indicator in Pakistan has worsened.
The combined public budget for 2024-25 starkly demonstrates this governance failure. Total government expenditure (federal and provinces combined) amounted to Rs24tr. After paying interest, salaries and pensions, and for defence, an amount of Rs 12.6tr (or $45 billion) was available for discretionary spending. Not enough money for the impact on the lives of citizens to be visible? Where has the money gone? The recently released IMF Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment provides an answer with relation to the corruption of the ruling elite. (Interestingly, to support the political project underway in the country since 2022, a sharp increase in low-efficiency, high-leakage and misdirected public spending has occurred under the watch of the very same IMF).
In summary, the seventh NFC Award is at best a compounding factor but not a proximate cause. Pakistan’s weak public finances predate the award, and multiple governments since have failed to respond adequately by stepping up fiscal effort or introducing guardrails for public expenditure. The real failure is a failure of governance of the ruling elite — unwilling to tax themselves or their constituents, and unwilling to spend the country’s resources on meeting its challenges. This predatory mindset is independent of the nature of the NFC Award.
Having said this, it is also important to recognise that instruments of redistribution of resources, such as NFC Awards, should necessarily be the result of political processes. They should inherently be democratic in nature. In federations such as Pakistan, the NFC Award anchors the project of federalism itself. Hence, technocratic proposals to roll-back the vertical distribution formula, are relics of non-democratic set-ups and thinking — and must be resisted.
The real issue is not how the resources are distributed, but how they are raised and where they are spent. Redistributing the federal divisible pool from mis-spending provinces to a mis-spending centre will not address Pakistan’s fiscal woes.

Sources confirmed that shifting of FCC record to the FSC building will begin today (Saturday), though it may take several days to fully transfer files, systems and administrative units.
IHC Bar President Syed Wajid Ali Gillani and Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja held multiple meetings with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to convey their concerns.
The law minister had recently said that a decision regarding relocation would be made only after consulting lawyers’ bodies.

Once keen on retaining the prized Constitution Avenue premises of the Islamabad High Court, the newly formed court will begin the process of shifting its record today

Initially, the FCC was supposed to establish its offices at the FSC. However, stiff resistance from the Shariat Court judges forced the newly-formed court to commence operations from the IHC building instead. Following the oath-taking ceremony of the FCC judges at the IHC earlier last month, the new court was temporarily allotted several courtrooms. The FCC administration then began seriously considering keeping the same building permanently — a move that caused unease within the high court.
Amid speculations about a possible relocation, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar visited the old G-10 building last week to evaluate its suitability.
Justice Dogar inspected various sections of the renovated facility, including the Chief Justice Block, and reviewed the pace and quality of repair work. The district judiciary briefed him on administrative matters, ongoing upgrades, and the heavy workload of the family courts operating there.
Officials said the chief justice’s visit was aimed at determining whether the old structure — surrounded by workshops, car washes, low-cost eateries and shops — could feasibly accommodate the daily traffic, staff and litigants of a constitutional court.
Plans to shift the IHC back to its old pre­mises have created a clear divide among lawyers. While the District Bar Association supports the proposal, the IHC Bar Association strongly opposes it, arguing that the G-10 building — which currently handles a heavy docket of family matters — lacks the infrastructure needed for the high court’s expanded operations.
Before the IHC’s shift to Constitution Avenue a few years ago, the record room held around 65,000 files. Today, that number has swelled to over 200,000, with pending cases rising from around 10,000 to 18,000. Lawyers maintain that relocating to a smaller, outdated facility would cripple judicial efficiency.
The ongoing tug-of-war over the Const­itution Avenue premises resembles “a joint family squeezed into an ancestral home,” with each side citing space shortages and competing needs.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had reportedly finalised the FSC building as the FCC’s permanent home days before the 27th Amendment was tabled in parliament. Under the plan, the four FSC judges — who have a relatively small backlog of 56 petitions — were to be shifted to the IHC’s third floor, where four new courtrooms were being prepared by the CDA.
To facilitate temporary operations, the IHC administration allotted seven courtrooms to the FCC. However, after senior staff — many drawn from the SC — assumed duties, space shortages became more evident. The FCC chief justice was accommodated in Courtroom No. 2, previously used by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, a move that reportedly caused discomfort within the high court.

An official statement said the two sides signed Project Readiness Financing (PRFs) papers for the Karachi-Rohri section of ML-1, Quetta Bus Rapid Transit and Balochistan Water Resources Development Sector – Additional financing.
Under these commitments, ADB would provide $10m to prepare project documentation for the $2bn ML-1 section, $3.8m for the $125m Quetta BRT, and $48m for Balochistan Water Resources Development.
At the signing ceremony, Secretary of Economic Affairs Humair Karim welcomed ADB’s support for these critical projects, which are aimed at significantly contributing to Pakistan’s long-term and sustainable economic growth, addressing the vital urban infrastructure needs of Quetta city, and enhancing agricultural productivity in Balochistan Province. He called upon the Ministry of Railways and the Government of Balochistan to utilise the financing in a timely and effective manner to ensure successful implementation.
ADB’s country director, Ms Emma Fan, appreciated the federal government’s strong commitment to these projects and noted that the Railways Improvement Project PRF was a key step toward railways modernisation.
The Central Development Working Party had last month approved the Rs1.24bn ($3.8m) ADB financing for a feasibility study, design, and procurement standards and documentation.
Also, last month, the federal government announced that it had secured a $2bn financing package from ADB to commence the Karachi-Rohri segment of the Karachi-Peshawar mainline (ML-1) next year, aiming to complete it before December 2028 to facilitate transportation from the multi-billion-dollar Reko Diq Copper and Gold Project.
Likewise, the ADB had last month approved $48m loan for the Balochistan Water project to support the completion of critical project components, including the Churi Infiltration Gallery subproject, development of the Siri Toi Dam command area, and watershed management activities, which were previously delayed due to budgetary constraints. These components are considered vital for enhancing irrigation efficiency, promoting sustainable water use, and mitigating soil erosion caused by floods.
Because of inherent project implementation challenges, the government has started raising international financing to avoid project delays and cost overruns. The ADB’s PRFs are normally intended to support project preparation before formal offtake, by identifying various components and activities during the implementation stage.
For example, the ML-1 PRF enables the ADB and Pakistan’s relevant agencies to work closely to improve implementation readiness and the timely processing of subsequent major loans needed for project execution. PRFs are also used for reform and institutional capacity-building activities to support sustainability, including the development of business plans, compliance with international financial reporting standards, digitisation, and consulting services.
According to the ADB, PRF is a fast and flexible modality that funds activities for project preparation, such as detailed engineering design, capacity building, limited project startup support, and project design pilot testing. Such work ensures high project readiness and minimises startup delays during the initial phase of project implementation.

NEW DELHI: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded two days of talks on Friday with a series of agreements to fortify their economic and political ties, though both had their eyes fixed on what lies ahead in their tense encounters with the West.
From the Russian perspective, the two leaders have laid the groundwork for boosting the economic partnership between the traditional allies, with the countries signing a series of pacts to raise bilateral trade to $100 billion by 2030.
After summit-level talks on Friday, Russia and India signed a dozen memoranda spanning infrastructure, energy, pharma and media sectors.
“Under Prime Minister Modi’s leadership, India is pursuing an independent sovereign policy, and it attains great results in the economy,” Putin said, adding that Russia is seeking “multifaceted relations” with India in various sectors.
“It is a matter of happiness that my acquaintance with you is more than 25 years old,” Modi told Putin. The Indian leader added that the biggest strength between the two countries “is mutual trust.”
Modi expressed confidence that the countries could meet their $100 billion trade target before 2030.
Russia on its side pledged to ensure uninterrupted energy supplies to India. The catch is how? India has signalled to drastically cut down on its oil imports from Russia under US pressure.
On the other hand, Putin has exuded confidence in recent comments about the impending peaceful end of the Ukraine war, which could entirely change the business climate.
The pressure from the West to stymie the visit was reflected in an editorial the India-based ambassadors of Germany, France and UK wrote in Indian newspapers, which was disparaging of Putin’s alleged push against ending the war soon.
Not to be left behind in the propaganda contest, Putin officially launched the RT India news channel in New Delhi, which he said will give “millions of Indian citizens the opportunity to know more about the reality of Russia.”







The strength of personal relations between the two leaders has been evident throughout the two-day visit, an RT analysis said. It started with Modi’s “remarkable welcome for Putin on the red carpet on Thursday and their brief drive in a Toyota SUV”.
The visit is also thought to have included discussions on collaboration in the defence and space sectors, as well as talks on the joint production of Sukhoi Su-57 fighter jets.
In a clip released to Indian TV channels, Putin was seen as telling Modi that Russia was working with the US and other partners towards a peaceful settlement of his war in Ukraine.
“India is not neutral — India has a position, and that position is for peace,” Modi told the Russian president as they opened their talks in New Delhi on Friday.
“We support every effort for peace, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with every initiative taken for peace,” he said. In response, Putin thanked Modi for his attention and efforts aimed at resolving the war.
“We had the opportunity — and you gave me that opportunity — to speak in detail about what is happening on the Ukrainian track and about the steps we are taking jointly with some other partners, including the United States, toward a possible peaceful settlement of this crisis,” Putin said.
The Russian president highlighted the joint areas of cooperation between Moscow and New Delhi.
India has been under scrutiny from European and US officials for its purchase of Russian oil since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022.
India has continued to buy discounted Russian oil, despite warnings from Washington that this is partly keeping Moscow’s revenues afloat to fund the Ukraine war.
US President Donald Trump has imposed additional 25 per cent tariffs on Indian imports, raising the total duties to 50 per cent in retaliation.
“New areas are emerging — high technologies, joint work in aviation, space, and artificial intelligence. We have a very trusting relationship in the field of military-technical cooperation, and we intend to move forward in all these areas,” Putin said.
Meanwhile, Moscow will tap into New Delhi’s expertise by establishing a major pharmaceutical plant in Russia’s Kaluga region in collaboration with India. The facility will produce high-quality anti-cancer drugs, according to Russian reports.
India is known as the pharmacy of the world. The South Asian nation makes 60 per cent of the world’s vaccines, supplies over 20pc of global generic medicines, and accounts for 60pc of Africa’s generics.
The 23rd Russia-India Summit coincided with a US push for a Ukraine peace deal while seeking global cooperation. The visit by Putin is also a test for New Delhi’s efforts to balance relations with Moscow and Washington as the nearly four-year war in Ukraine grinds on.
Putin last visited India in 2021. Modi was in Moscow last year, and the two leaders briefly met in September in China during a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit.

ISLAMABAD: The government said on Friday it was considering a “time-bound amn­esty” for cryptocurrency traders, as local banks raised risk and compliance concerns amid more than $250 billion in annual crypto trading reportedly conducted by Pakistani users.
Officials floated the idea at a high-level consultative meeting after a top global cryptocurrency exchange argued that virtual assets could boost Pakistan’s GDP.
“These virtual assets should be considered as part of liquid money supply (M-1) … virtual assets collateralisation will help increase M-1” because these are highly visible and dependable, a Binance team member told the meeting, co-chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Pakistan Virtual Assets Regu­latory Authority (PVARA) Chairman Bilal Bin Saqib.







The meeting had been arranged to discuss and advance work on Pakistan’s National Digital Asset Framework, an official statement said, adding that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor also attended, along with presidents and executives of the country’s leading commercial banks and senior leaders from Binance, including Global CEO Richard Teng.
The meeting examined sovereign debt tokenisation to enhance liquidity, widen investor access and position Pakistan as a regional frontrunner in compliant blockchain-based financial instruments.
The meeting also “outlined principles for a practical taxation and compliance framework, including shifting primary oversight to licensed exchanges, designing a gradual capital gains structure to promote stability and considering a time-bound amnesty to encourage users to move assets onto regulated platforms”, the statement said.

 

Sources told Dawn that the Binance team reported that about 17.5 million Pakistanis were currently registered traders of Binance, including 4m active traders. They jointly hold around $5bn in virtual assets with Binance alone, with annual trading turnover of around $250bn.
Pakistani users with other crypto companies are not part of this. Binance had more than 300m active users, mostly in 22 countries.
“This unlocks $5bn of assets that Pakistani users are now able to invest back into economy in Pakistani rupees,” a Binance official said, adding that “banks could also make withdrawals of stablecoins”.
Binance will determine maximum existing loan liability to the bank through Application Programming Interface (API) used for automated trading, “vastly reducing Pakistani users’ default rates”, the official claimed.
Banks raise concerns
The local banks raised questions about security risks and global experiences to safeguard stakeholders’ — banks and customers — interest, including in terms of money laundering issues.
They were told that Binance could help address those concerns through its experiences in other countries as real-time reporting of any individual users’ virtual assets and balances was traceable and visible.
In addition, the SBP’s participation would allow Pakistani banks to determine borrowing capacity and to hold recognised US dollar assets on the Binance platform, hence increasing Pakistan’s asset base and overall volumes to the Pakistan economy.
“Banks can lend confidently based on visible and verified assets,” a Binance official was quoted as assuring local bank representatives.
The banks were told that SDCs — a term used for “shadow cash” — were usable assets for bank credits and loans, and Pakistan would be able to attract billions of US dollars by providing a new avenue for remittances on top of roughly $38bn sent annually through conventional routes by overseas Pakistanis.
The officials said US infrastructure development funds, USAID and US Treasury-linked credits could further drive dollar flows into Pakistan and “boost GDP and economic growth”, despite inherent challenges.
PVARA Chairman Bilal Bin Saqib, who recently stepped down as special assistant to the prime minister on blockchain and cryptocurrency because of a conflict of interest with his regulatory role, declined to comment on the meeting.
An official statement, however, said he stressed the “importance of viewing digital assets as critical financial infrastructure with significant potential to support financial inclusion, expand access to services for the unbanked and create new opportunities for banks through innovative products, expanded deposits and new customer segments”.
The statement said the meeting reviewed Pakistan’s next steps towards building a secure, well-regulated and innovation-driven digital asset ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on responsible operationalisation of on-and-off-ramp infrastructure, enhanced compliance standards, improved market transparency and stronger integration of regulated financial institutions.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to establishing a robust and forward-looking regulatory environment that supports technological innovation while safeguarding national economic interests.
He called for close coordination between government agencies, licensed global exchanges and domestic banks for modernising the payments landscape, improving financial inclusion and aligning national systems with international standards.
The statement said the participants reviewed opportunities to modernise Pakistan’s digital payments landscape, noting that blockchain-based systems could significantly reduce costs from the country’s $38bn annual remittance flows.
They emphasised the need to build local talent pipelines to meet rising global demand for blockchain and Web3 skills, creating high-value employment opportunities for Pakistani youth.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s role in arranging a peace deal between India and Pakistan received a mention in the White House’s National Security Strategy (NSS) released on Friday, even as the document largely focuses on China.
The mention carries particular significance because the NSS is a formal statement of the administration’s policy priorities and global assessment. Highlighting Trump’s diplomacy in South Asia underscores Washington’s intention to boost its influence in the region and lends credibility to his intervention claims.
“President Trump has cemented his legacy as the President of Peace. In addition to the remarkable success achieved during his first term with the historic Abraham Accords, President Trump has leveraged his deal-making ability to secure unprecedented peace in eight conflicts throughout the world over the course of just eight months of his second term,” the strategy states.
“He negotiated peace between Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the DRC and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and ended the war in Gaza with all living hostages returned to their families.”

 

Trump has repeatedly cited claims that five to seven “brand new, beautiful” planes were shot down during the May conflict between Pakistan and India. In recent comments, he said that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.
While the actual number of losses remains disputed, his remarks have bolstered Pakistan’s version of events and strengthened its diplomatic position. India, however, rejects Trump’s claims, maintaining that it ended the brief air war independently and disputing reports of any Pakistani shoot-downs.
The document also pledges to end “the cynical manipulation of our immigration system to build up voting blocs loyal to foreign interests within our country” and highlights the administration’s recent steps to curb immigration, measures announced this week.
To counter China’s growing influence, the strategy stresses closer engagement with India and other allies. Washington is urged to strengthen commercial and security ties with New Delhi, including through quadrilateral cooperation with Australia and Japan. India is also included among the global partners with whom the US needs to coordinate on strategic priorities, including critical minerals in Africa.
On security, the NSS warns that control of the South China Sea by a hostile power could allow tolls or arbitrary closure of vital shipping lanes. Addressing this challenge will require greater cooperation with affected nations, including India and Japan.
The strategy acknowledged that “conflict continues to shape the Middle East,” but suggested the situation is “less severe than headlines suggest”. It noted that Iran has been weakened by Israeli actions and by President Trump’s June 2025 Operation Midnight Hammer, which curtailed Iran’s nuclear programme.
The document said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “remains thorny”, but added that thanks to the ceasefire and release of prisoners President Trump negotiated, “progress toward a more permanent peace has been made”. It also recognised that “Syria remains a potential challenge, but with American, Arab, Israeli, and Turkish support, it may stabilise and reassume its rightful place as an integral and positive player in the region”.
Turning to Europe, the strategy expressed strong support for the “growing influence of patriotic European parties”, emphasising that a strong Europe is needed to work with the United States to prevent any adversary from dominating the continent. It linked unchecked migration to Europe’s economic challenges, warning of “the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure”.
The paper cautioned that within a few decades, some Nato members could become majority non-European and called for “cultivating resistance” to address this potential demographic shift.
The Trump administration also reaffirmed that there would be no expansion of Nato, the transatlantic alliance in which the United States plays a central role, a stance that undercuts Ukraine’s hopes as it continues to face the Russian invasion.

ISLAMABAD: After a fiery speech in the Senate by a PTI-backed lawmaker, deploring the absence of rule of law and an unannounced ban on meetings with incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, the ruling party once again held out an olive branch to the PTI, reassuring it that all issues could be resolved through dialogue.
Speaking in the upper house of parliament on Friday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Poli­tical and Public Affairs Rana Sana­ullah said the PTI had always rejected the path of negotiations, even though all issues could be reso­lved through dialogue rather than deadlock.
He said the government was ready to hold a dialogue with the opposition to take the country forward, but the PTI leadership remained unwilling.
The remarks came after PTI Senator Mashal Yousafzai chided two ministers over the claim that VVIP facilities were available to Imran Khan in jail. She demanded that a committee of the House along with local and foreign media visit Adiala jail to see the facilities for themselves.

 

Without naming the military establishment, the adviser to the premier said, “Those who they want [to have] dialogue [with] are not ready for talks with them.”
According to prison rules, the PML-N leader said, jail meetings meant to incite violence could not be allowed.
“The law and jail rules do not permit a convict or under-trial prisoner to create law and order situation in the country while sitting behind bars.”
Referring to repeated offers made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for talks with the opposition and his desire for a charter of Pakistan’s stability, the PML-N leader said both sides should sit together, confront each other’s viewpoint and reach a consensus. “We are ready to discuss all issues to find out a solution. You can start talks from wherever you want,” he remarked.

 

Earlier, Senator Yousafzai alleged that her party supremo and his spouse were illegally put behind bars and being subjected to inhumane treatment.
She rejected the government claim that VVIP facilities were provided to Mr Khan in Adiala jail. She asked the chair to form a house committee, headed by Rana Sanaullah, so that they visit the jail along with media persons to witness what kind of facilities were being available to the incarcerated leader.
“Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were being denied meetings with their family members,” she said while deploring the public announcement by a minister about “banning all meetings” with him. She wondered how such a decision could be taken about the country’s most popular leader whereas jail meetings with an Indian spy were facilitated. She said the Constitution, law and human rights had become a joke. Referring to the allegations levelled against her by PML-N member Khalil Tahir Sandhu in a talk show, the senator maintained that there was no practice of selling party tickets to contest elections in PTI.
FBR messages
A highlight of the day’s proceedings was an alarm raised by Senator Asad Qasim over the issue of text messages being sent to filers by the FBR containing bank balance and transacted amounts that he noted was a clear breach of the financial privacy and data protection.
Speaking on a calling attention notice, the PTI senator said the SMS were a breach of Section 216 of the Income Tax Ordinance, which prohibits sharing or exposing taxpayer’s data besides violation of the right to privacy guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution. In response, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry confirmed that the FBR had sent messages to filers seeking them to match their bank accounts with their income tax returns. He, however, said messages had been sent to the particular individuals on “detection of discrepancies”. He insisted that the move was not a breach of trust and privacy, and in line with Sections 165-A and 175-A of the ordinance.
However, Mr Qasim insisted that the FBR could only collect data but not broadcast it without taxpayer’s consent. He said due process involving issuance of notice must be followed.
PPP Senator Shahadat Awan, who was chairing the session, said a similar matter was pending before Senate’s standing committee on interior and proposed that the matter be referred to the panel. He noted that Senator Qasim could also raise his point there to which Mr Chaudhry agreed.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar also defended the FBR’s powers under tax regulation framework. He said the mechanism to track suspicious transactions under anti-money laundering was similar to this. He initially expressed reservations over the practice of referring every matter to the committees and insisted there was no need to send the matter for further probe, but later agreed that it be referred to the finance committee, headed by Saleem Mandviwala, which the chair did.
The Senate also passed the “The National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority Bill, 2025”. The bill, moved by the law minister, is aimed at establishing the National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority.

Pakistani and Afghan officials accused each other of instigating the flare-up.
Pakistani officials said that Afghan forces had fired mortar shells on the Badani area.

 

But Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid claimed it was Pakistan that launched an attack on Spin Boldak, alleging that their forces were responding.
Official sources said that Pakistani forces retaliated against the Afghan aggression and returned fire.
There were also reports of fighting on the Chaman-Kandahar highway, but these could not be immediately verified.
A senior official in Quetta confirmed on the condition of anonymity that the exchange of fire started at around 10pm and continued till late night.
The medical superintendent of Chaman district hospital, Muhammad Owais, said that three injured, including a woman, were brought to the medical facility.
There was neither any official word from the Inter-Services Public Relations, nor from the Foreign Office by the time of going to press.

Industry representatives warn that the ongoing blockade at Torkham and Chaman is crippling pharmaceutical supplies to Afg­hanistan, spoiling temperature-sensitive drugs, and exposing Pakistan to massive commercial losses at a time when exporters cannot afford another shock.
They argue that Afg­h­anistan remains Pakistan’s largest overland trading partner and the main transit route for onward access to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kaz­a­khstan. Each shutdown cuts Pakistan off from these landlocked economies, disrupts regional connectivity projects, and undermines multilateral investments tied to the Pakistan-Uzbekistan-Afghanistan railway and other corridor initiatives.
“The closures are now so frequent that they have become a structural threat, forcing countries investing in this route to consider more predictable alternatives. For Pakistan’s pharmaceutical sector, the impact is already severe,” said Tauqeer ul Haq of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA).
“Almost all exports to Afghanistan have stopped, and containers carrying antibiotics, insulin, vacci­nes, cardiovascular dru­gs, and other essential medicines are stuck at border crossings, dry ports, and warehouses. The delays have pushed local manufacturers toward irreversible financial losses. In one case, a single firm has products worth Rs850 million stranded at Torkham and Chaman, while more than fifty companies face similar setbacks.”

In a blistering press conference earlier today, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
The majority of the DG ISPR’s 90-minute press conference focused on criticising Imran, the party and its government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“This is the time for everyone to acknowledge one another, make space for each other and eliminate the lack of trust. I appeal to all pro-democracy forces to play their role in reducing tensions,” said PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar in a post on X, reacting to the military spokesperson’s remarks.
Gohar said he had always held hope that tensions would ease and relations would improve, but expressed that he was “disappointed” by the press conference held by DG ISPR.
“The defence of the country is paramount. PTI’s narrative has never been, nor will it ever be, anti-state. It is regrettable when state institutions and political figures label each other as mentally ill or perceive each other as threats. Pakistan belongs to us, and so does the army; we have demonstrated this in practice and will continue to do so.”
He further urged that the conduct of “certain non-stakeholders”, without specifying who he was referring to, should not become a cause of tension between PTI and the institutions.
Barrister Gohar said Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were incarcerated and the overall situation would improve if permission were granted for meetings with them.
“The country cannot afford tension and chaos,” Gohar concluded.







On a different note, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “A troubled response is not a political strategy.”







Meanwhile, Shahid Khattak, Imran’s nominee for the parliamentary leader in the National Assembly, said insulting remarks against KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi were an “insult to the entire Pakhtun nation and the tribal people”.

At the beginning of his press conference in Rawalpindi, he talked about a “creeping national security threat” that had become necessary for the military to address.
“That threat emanates from a delusional mindset of a delusional person who has become captive to his own ego, thinking that his wishes are bigger than those of the state of Pakistan,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said, in an apparent reference to incarcerated PTI founder, Imran Khan.
“His ego, his wishes, and frustrations have grown to such an extent that he thinks that the world would cease to exist without him.”
The DG ISPR added that it would be “a bit strange to see it coming from me, but the narrative that person is pushing is no more about politics now but has become a matter of national security.”
According to Lt Gen Chaudhry, it was “very important” for the military’s media wing to clarify, remove all ambiguities and doubts, and say what needs to be said. “We need to understand how this narrative is working, and unfortunately, how it is working in deep collusion with external actors.”



He continued: “To understand that, first, I will set the stage by repeating something that the armed forces have been saying again and again, that we are the armed forces of Pakistan, we don’t represent any ethnicity, don’t represent any language, religious inclination, political thought or school of thought. We have people from all areas of Pakistan, all religions, all sects, all languages, and all political views, but we put all that aside once we wear this uniform.
“That is our pride, that is our honour; we strive, we die daily not for some language, area or political viewpoint. We strive and die on a daily basis for the people of Pakistan, for the integrity of Pakistan. And that we say very clearly, and we also don’t come from the elite class of Pakistan, we belong to the middle, lower-middle, and the poor socio-economic classes; we do not carry the flag of any political actor, class or elitism; This is your armed forces, and we are absolutely clear about the character of the armed forces of Pakistan, starting from a soldier all the way up to his field marshal,” he said.The DG ISPR added that if someone attacked the armed forces and its leadership for the sake of their ego, delusional mindset and narcissistic way of thinking, “then we will also come and fight bare-knuckle, there should be no doubt about that,” he said.“That is why we request again and again, you must be doing your politics. We respect all political parties and personalities, but please keep your politics away from the armed forces of Pakistan; don’t drag us into it. We don’t want to be part of your politics. That is why we need to communicate a few things clearly.”
Lt Gen Chaudhry then pointed out ways in which Imran’s rhetoric was harming the armed forces.
“First, no one can be allowed to create fissures between the people and the armed forces of Pakistan. Why? Because this is the only armed force that you have. You don’t have a choice; this country doesn’t have any other armed forces. You can have an opinion or observation about the forces, and if that could be a constructive observation or criticism, you are most welcome to do that. But that doesn’t allow you to instigate or provoke the people of Pakistan against the army and try to create a gap between the two.”
He said that it was the armed forces that were standing between the Hindutva mindset in India and their hegemonic design, and the people of Pakistan.
“It is these armed forces that are standing between the khawarij, terrorists, fitna al-khawarij, fitna al-Hindustan operating from Afghanistan and the people, and we also know for a fact that every country has an army. It is a famous saying that there will always be an army in a country, but if it is not yours, it will be your enemy’s. So, the one who attacks their own army and its leadership, is he trying to create space for someone else’s army? What is his design? Why is he trying to do that?
“We are clear, and the people of Pakistan are clear that this cannot happen, because they understand, we understand, that you can fool some of the people all the time,” he said.
Continuing to assail the PTI founder, the DG ISPR said that whenever someone meets “this person”, he keeps aside the law, Constitution and rules and plays the narrative against the state of Pakistan, especially the armed forces of Pakistan and its leadership.
“Tell me, under which law, rules and Constitution can this be allowed? Which politics in Pakistan allows you to go and meet a convict, and a narrative is continuously built from there against their own country’s armed forces? Which constitutional provision allows this?” Lt Gen Chaudhry questioned, referring to PTI’s demand to allow them to meet Imran at Adiala Jail, where he’s been imprisoned since 2023.
“You talk about Article 17 of the Constitution and freedom of expression, it clearly says that freedom of expression and political activity are permitted, subject to reasonable restrictions. Under reasonable restrictions, nothing can be allowed that will be against the security and integrity of the state.
“Article 19 says freedom of expression is allowed, it absolutely is, but such freedom of expression cannot be allowed that goes against the security, integrity and defence of Pakistan. Is it written [in the Constitution] or not? So, under which law, constitution, or rules, when you meet a convict, he spins a narrative against the army and its leadership? This is beyond our understanding.”
Citing some examples, the DG ISPR recalled how Imran had been “spinning this narrative by trying to stop remittances to Pakistan so that the country defaults.”
“He then writes a letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), asking it not to enter into any agreement with the country so that the state could default. He then resorts to civil disobedience, doesn’t pay electricity bills, so that anarchy is spread in the country. Let me give you another example from a few days ago: He (Imran) tells his followers to target the leadership of the army — the army which stood against an economy and an armed forces eight times bigger than it during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and Marka-i-Haq. And doing so, they gained respect for the nation.”
He then questioned who would actually benefit from such a narrative, adding that anyone living in Pakistan could not have such an agenda against the country.
“That agenda can only come from someone in Delhi. Someone sitting there and guiding that — who wishes that this army, which is your armour against kharjis and terrorists, sacrificing their lives — stops doing it. This agenda and narrative cannot come from elsewhere,” he said.
It is also worth mentioning that while he did not mention Imran’s name throughout the presser, he showed a video clip containing Imran’s anti-army tweets to prove his point.
Pointing out to certain social media accounts, the DG ISPR asked, “From where are these accounts run? No one knows. And when the party [PTI] is asked about where the accounts are run from, they say they don’t know it either, but they completely own the narrative that is being spread through these accounts.”
Calling Imran a “mental patient”, the DG ISPR recalled how a tweet was posted on Imran’s X account two days ago, which went viral within minutes.
“A lot of unnamed, troll accounts are involved in making the post viral. These accounts are being operated from outside Pakistan. They carry forward this narrative, but they originate from this mental patient’s post”.
He said that the Indian media and the accounts linked to the Indian-intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) were making the posts viral.
“The Indian media is reporting against your army chief with such happiness. Who is providing this narrative to them? They air this narrative for hours. Why are they spending so much money on spreading the narrative of this delusional mindset of this narcissist? There is one reason, because he is speaking against the army and its chief. He is talking about creating a rift between the Pakistani army and the public.”
The head of the military’s media wing added that Afghan social media, being “facilitators of the khawarij”, was also involved in spreading Imran’s anti-army rhetoric.
“Why wouldn’t they do it? Because someone here is saying things about the Pakistan army and its leadership, then why will they not do it? They all operate simultaneously, and then the international media picks up such news, too. It is a collusion because they have the same purpose and the same enemy, i.e. the Pakistan Army and its leadership.”
Referring to Imran’s harsh comments against PTI members who attended a function at the National Defence University (NDU) in Islamabad and terming them as traitors, the DG ISPR said: “By that logic, he is also saying that anyone in the ISPR and army is also a traitor, because they too went to NDU, he believes anyone who even is linked [to the army] is a traitor.”
Continuing to assail the PTI founder, the DG ISPR said: “I will again repeat that you can fool some of the people all the time, you can fool all of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.”
He said the time had come “for an end” to the PTI’s “political trickery”.
The military spokesperson also slammed the persistent speculation over the issue of the notification for the chief of defence forces and questioned the “obsession” with the army.
He questioned why the PTI continued to talk about the army instead of the governance of its government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and its performance against terrorism.
“Please grow up. Talk about real issues.”
The military spokesperson also criticised the PTI for its policy and stance on the issues of terrorism, Afghanistan and the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
“Tell me, can the state’s security be sublet? Is appeasement a security policy?”
The DG ISPR quipped that if Kabul or New Delhi would be the ones to ensure Pakistan’s security.
“The world knows that security is only granted by standing tall against the evil, the aggressor, there is no other way … had appeasement granted security, Libya and Gaza wouldn’t be in the situation that they are in today.
“We know that without this state, we neither have any identity, nor any worth, nor any politics, that is why we are ready to sacrifice our lives every day, because we are absolutely clear
“Similarly, we are also clear that anyone’s person and politics cannot be above the state for us.”
The DG ISPR also wondered why the PTI and its founder called for talks with terrorists.
“Firstly, he is a mental patient. Apart from that, there are two more reasons. One, there is a terror crime nexus … there is political patronage and terrorists provide them with protection. The terrorists act against law enforcers, FC personnel, security forces and anyone who stands against them. There is a huge economic interest and there is a political reason also … the only story that comes out of KP is security … there is a narrative of the army being behind terrorism so that no one questions them about governance in the province where they have been in power for the past 12-13 years.”
He said even more could be found if one looked for them.
“It is clear to us that what is happening, why it is happening and why it is being carried out. We need to tell that this business of lies and deception will not continue anymore in Pakistan. This cannot be allowed.”
DG Chaudhry said that if anyone thought their person and politics were bigger than the country’s security, they would be wrong to do so.
“The Pakistan Army is standing and will keep on standing. We are not going anywhere. We have taken an oath for the protection of this state.”
The military spokesperson also criticised the KP chief minister and said no one talked about the province’s governance from the PTI but kept focusing on the army.
“If the barking dog barks, don’t pay attention to it.”
Questioned about a ban on the PTI, the military spokesperson said: “The state is above the army. It is all wise. It is their decision. What they do and why they do. You need to ask them. … We are not politicians … the state has much more vision and clarity.”
The DG ISPR was also asked about the imposition of governor’s rule in KP and said it had nothing to do with the army, adding that the government had to decide on the matter.
He said it was for the government, Parliament and all stakeholders to decide the future course of the province.
Headquarters of chief of defence forces
The DG ISPR congratulated the nation on the chief of defence forces (CDF) headquarters beginning its work today, stating that it was one of the most important steps towards providing the requisite synergy and jointness for military operations in the country.
“This was debated a lot in the media, and we understand that the character of warfare has changed — now there are multidomain operations taking place. It’s no more just land, sea and air; it’s in space, it’s in cyberspace, it is the informational domain, it’s intelligence-based, and war is fought in multiple domains,” he told reporters.
“The wars have become violent, short and intense, so to get efficiency, efficacy and economy of effort in that, the CDF headquarters was a long-awaited essential requirement, and it’s not only in Pakistan, but there are more than a dozen countries, almost more than 70 countries, where synergetic headquarters of the chief of defence are available,” he said.
The chief of the military’s media wing added that the CDF headquarters had been established on the directives and orders of the parliament; therefore, it was a “monumental and great day for the national security of Pakistan”.</p><small>2025-12-05 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05190058e626ac6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957932/advice-auntie-agni' target='_blank'><strong>ADVICE: AUNTIE AGNI</strong></a><br><p>Dear Auntie,I am currently facing a hugely confusing situation. I like a guy and we plan to get married soon, but my mother doesn’t like him a lot because he doesn’t earn enough.
Another issue is that, while we get along well, both of us have a dominant nature. This often results in arguments which, at times, result in shouting encounters, followed by long spells of virtually no communication between us. Sometimes, when we’re having these arguments, my mother often overhears and tries to convince me to leave him for good.
I am scared that, even though I like him, what if we split up after getting married? Then my family may not support me and I will be left on my own to deal with the situation.
Auntie, please advise what I should do. I don’t want to leave him but, at the same time, I am scared of the repercussions if things turn ugly. It’s pertinent to mention that he has a stable career with a sound future, and I am also a working girl though, once we’re married, I want him to be the primary breadwinner.Regards,Confused Girl

‘Should I Risk Marriage Without My Family’s Support?’

Dear Confused Girl,Let’s keep this super simple. You are trying to make a lifelong decision while standing in the middle of chaos.
The most important thing to know is that your fights matter. Frequent shouting matches and long silences are red flags. Before talking marriage, the two of you need to learn how to argue, without hurting each other. If both of you are domineering personalities, then you both need to learn compromise and communication. If he isn’t willing to work on this with you now, it will not magically happen after you get married.
The second important thing is your mother’s concerns about his income. Yes, income isn’t everything, but it also isn’t nothing. Financial stress destroys relationships. You both need a realistic plan for finances, especially since you want him to be the main breadwinner.
Thirdly, never marry someone out of fear, such as the fear of losing him or the fear of facing your family if it ends. Marry because the relationship feels right and, most importantly, is respectful. Trust me, respect is more important than love in a marriage.
What you should do right now is simple. Tell him you want to work on communication together. You want calmer disagreements, better boundaries with families and a financial plan. See what he says. His response will tell you more than anything else.
And please remember: your family should never “disown” you for a marriage decision. But you also shouldn’t put yourself in a situation where you’ll need rescuing later.
Take your time and think this through before moving forward.
Disclaimer: If you or someone you know is in crisis and/or feeling suicidal, please go to your nearest emergency room and seek medical help immediately.
