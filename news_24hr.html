“Three people have died and six sustained injuries; none of them are serious and all are out of danger,” YB Khurania, director general of police in the state of Odisha, told Reuters.
The incident occurred at dawn as thousands of Hindu devotees gathered at an annual chariot festival in Puri, said a senior administrative officer told Reuters. He asked not to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
Stampedes occur routinely during large Hindu gatherings in the world’s most-populous country, as huge crowds gather in tight spaces, often ignoring safety protocols.
In January, at least 39 people were killed in a pre-dawn stampede during the Maha Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj, northern India.</p><small>2025-06-29 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29122350646fe09.jpg?r=122354' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920992/12th-body-swept-away-in-swat-river-flash-flood-recovered-from-charsadda' target='_blank'><strong>12th body swept away in Swat River flash flood recovered from Charsadda</strong></a><br><p>The body of a child who was swept away in the Swat River on Friday has been recovered from Charsadda, rescue officials said on Sunday, making this the 12th body recovered from the incident.
At least 19 people have been killed and six others injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid heavy rains and the consequent flash floods and landslides, according to data from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
KP Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Bilal Faizi said the child’s body was recovered from Charsadda and shifted to a hospital.
“He will be shifted to his native area in an ambulance,” Faizi said.
“One person remains missing and a search operation is underway.”
According to Faizi, a total of 17 people were reported missing on Friday when torrential flash floods triggered by heavy rains affected several areas in Swat and Malakand divisions.
Four people were rescued, while 11 bodies had been recovered. Today, a 12th body was recovered, leaving one person who remains missing.
Separately, the body of a young man who drowned in a flooded river in Lower Dir two days ago has been recovered in Charsadda, according to Faizi.
“The rescue team had been conducting continuous search operations for the past two days, after which the body was found,” Faizi said.
More rains, floods expected across KP in next 24-48 hours
More rain is expected in the next 24-48 hours across most districts of KP, according to a statement from KP PDMA.
Flooding is expected in Swat, Chitral, Abbotabad, Mansehra, Peshawar, Bannu and Waziristan. An increase in the water level is expected in Swat River and Panjokra River and its tributaries, PDMA said.
Low-level flooding is expected in the Kabul River over the next 48 hours.
“Land sliding and flooding in local rivers and canals is likely in mountainous areas. PDMA has issued alerts to district administrations to take precautionary  measures,” the statement said.
Rescue 1122 and other relief teams have been directed to utilise all available resources.
PDMA has directed local administration to control traffic at sensitive places and highways, as well as direct travelers on national highways and provincial highways to take precaution. It was also directed that alternative routes be made for traffic flow.
“Ensure the cleanliness of rivers and drains and drainage systems to avoid urban flooding,” PDMA said.
The public was requested to take shelter in safe places during wind, hail and thunderstorms, while institutions were directed to disseminate weather alerts in local languages.
Farmers were directed to harvest crops early and store them in safe places, while cattle farmers were directed to protect their livestock.
“PDMA’s Emergency Operations Center is fully functional. The public should report any untoward incident to 1700,” the statement said.

There were no immediate reports of casualties from the shallow quake, which USGS reported had occurred at around 3:30am with the epicentre almost 60 kilometres north-northeast of Barkhan city of Balochistan.
Senior levies officer Tuqeer Shah told Dawn.com that the Earthquake hit vast areas of Rara Shaim, Kingri and others.
According to initial reports, at least three people, including a couple, were injured in the Rara Shaim area of Barkhan after the roof of their house sustained damage. Over half a dozen houses have been damaged, while cracks have appeared in many others in Rara Shaim.
Shah added that the injured have been admitted to the hospital, while teams have been sent to the impacted areas to see the scope of the damage.
Pakistan straddles the boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, making the country susceptible to earthquakes.
The region can be challenging to navigate during crisis situations — in 2015, a 7.5-magnitude quake in Pakistan and Afghanistan killed almost 400 people across rugged terrain that impeded relief efforts.
The country was also hit by a 7.6-magnitude quake in 2005 that killed more than 73,000 people and left about 3.5 million homeless, mainly in Azad Kashmir.
Balochistan saw a quake in 2021 that killed at least 20 people and left more than 10 injured, with landslides hampering initial rescue efforts in the remote mountainous district of Harnai.</p><small>2025-06-29 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29115737e896b55.png?r=115837' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920986/71-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-tehrans-evin-prison-iranian-judiciary-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>71 killed in Israeli strike on Tehran’s Evin prison: Iranian judiciary spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s attack on the Evin prison in Iran’s capital, Tehran on June 23 killed 71 people, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said on Sunday.
At the end of an air war with Iran, Israel struck Tehran’s jail for political prisoners, in a demonstration that it was expanding its targets beyond military, civilian and nuclear sites to aim at symbols of Iran’s ruling system. According to Iranian health ministry figures, 610 people were killed on the Iranian side in the 12-day war, 13 of them children and 49 women, before a ceasefire went into effect last week.
“In the attack on Evin prison, 71 people were martyred, including administrative staff, youth doing their military service, detainees, family members of detainees who were visiting them and neighbours who lived in the prison’s vicinity,” Jahangir said in remarks carried on the judiciary’s news outlet Mizan.
 
 

Jahangir had previously said that part of Evin prison’s administrative building had been damaged in the attack, and people were killed and injured. The judiciary added that the remaining detainees had been transferred to other prisons in Tehran province.
Evin prison holds a number of foreign nationals, including two French citizens detained for three years.
“The strike targeting Evin prison in Tehran, put our citizens Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris in danger. It is unacceptable,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had said on social media X after the attack.

On Friday, the bench overturned the Supreme Court’s earlier judgement in the reserved seats case, effectively foreclosing the possibility of correcting the imbalance created by the ECP’s controversial decisions during the conduct of the last general election.
Holding the Sunni Ittehad Council ineligible for reserved seats, the bench has paved the way for these to be divided among other parties. Consequently, the ruling coalition will control more than two-thirds of the National Assembly, solidifying its grip on power. An unfortunate precedent has been set, however.
The efforts of a high-powered Supreme Court bench to restore political rights, which were denied as a consequence of the ‘bat symbol’ judgement, have been undone by a fresh set of judges. Many will criticise the ruling for focusing too narrowly on technicalities while overlooking the broader constitutional and political context.
 
 

There is much that continues to be unpacked about why and how the reserved seats became an issue, and the judiciary’s role in precipitating the electoral crisis that led to this point will long be debated.
Still, in their judgement in the original case, even the Supreme Court judges who had disagreed with the majority verdict had conceded that the ECP acted illegally when it blocked a major political party from contesting the elections as a single entity and forced its candidates to run as independents.
But even though the illegality of this action was well established, the Commission circumvented the law once again by refusing to execute the restorative measures ordered.
One would have expected the ECP to be chastised for its conduct, but instead, the Constitutional Bench — whose formation and constitution are perceived as having been enabled by stakeholders who directly benefited from the ECP’s wrongful actions — has now granted legal cover to this misconduct. Questions will be raised.
With the government now having enough lawmakers on its benches to do as it pleases, the elected representatives can breathe easy. Those not aligned to the ruling coalition no longer need to worry about harassment, threats and abductions whenever the Constitution needs to be rewritten, as was seen in the passage of the 26th Amendment.
It also seems worth recalling some of the warnings from that time, which, in retrospect, seem to have been justified. The Constitutional Bench, one of the amendment’s most visible by-products, has, since its inception, endorsed military trials for civilians, executive interference in judicial appointments, and, most recently, the perversion of the electoral process. With the balance of power becoming ever more skewed, the Pakistani people should worry about being sidelined from their right to have a say in their own destiny.

In the mid-19th century, the concept of the ‘Muslim Ummah’ found immediate traction among the Muslims of South Asia. According to the historian Mubarak Ali, the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid I actively promoted a policy of pan-Islamism, in an attempt to strengthen the Ottoman Empire and bolster the empire’s standing against European powers.
Ali wrote that one of the reasons this idea became popular among most South Asian Muslims was that, after the decline of over 500 years of Muslim rule in India, Muslims suddenly became conscious of their minority status in the region. Some Muslim scholars tried to come to terms with the rise of European colonialism by shaping a reformist variant of Islam as a way to adapt to Western modernity. This then evolved into becoming a demand for a Muslim-majority nation-state in the region.
The concept of the nation-state had been evolving in Europe from the 18th century. By the early 20th century, it had become one of the most powerful ideas in the world. It was a geographical idea about territory with well-defined borders within which populations that shared cultural, political and economic ideals and interests resided.
In the late 1930s, Muslims of India warmed up to this idea. Led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, they looked to create a modern Muslim-majority nation-state (Pakistan), where they would be able navigate their own destiny without any interference from the “Brahmin Hindu hegemony”, which Jinnah’s party feared India would become after the departure of British colonialists.

As globalisation frays the fabric of civic nationalism, nation-states from India to Russia are embracing an older identity model — the civilisation-state

As opposed to a nation-state, what the 19th century Ottoman Sultan was offering was a ‘civilisation- state.’ A civilisation-state is a political entity that identifies itself with a continuous cultural or historical civilisation. So, the Sultan was proposing a broader Muslim state built on shared civilisational traits.
During the post-colonial era, when empires had all but crumbled and the West had raced ahead in the fields of politics, economics and science, the idea of the civilisation-state looked cumbersome and regressive. The idea of the nation-state seemed more suitable to the post-colonial order. But these states had to accept certain universalities to be accepted in the community of nation-states. These universalities included human rights, democracy, freedom of religion, international laws etc.
The concept of the nation-state was largely based on ‘civic nationalism’ and pluralism, even though nation-states founded on a particular faith or ethnicity were tolerated as long as they accepted the universalities.
 


The concept of civilisation-state is not new as such, but the term is. It was coined in the 1990s with the emergence of ‘globalisation’. Increased interconnectedness and interdependence between nations began to weaken traditional boundaries and the authority of the nation-state. According to the American scholar Francis Fukuyama, globalisation led to a decline in national identity, diminishing the power of the nation-state. The rise of populism in the last 15 years or so is often seen as a reaction against globalisation and against the consequential decline of nationalism and/or national identities.
The bid to secure these resulted in radical (right wing) nationalism, but it rejects the pluralism and the universalities that were inherent in the idea of the nation-state. This radical nationalism then began to mutate, becoming a ‘civilisational nationalism’ that looks to create civilisation-states. In most cases, it is the already existing nation-states that are seeking to change their ideological disposition in this regard.
Russia is an example. After the demise of Soviet communism and of the Soviet Union itself, the civilisation-state is a recurring theme in the rhetoric and political discourse of Russia’s long-time ruler Vladimir Putin. He insists that Russia is not just a nation-state but a unique civilisation with its own historical, cultural and spiritual identity, separate from ‘Western civilisation.’
India is another example. The government of Narendra Modi, which came to power in 2014, has increasingly described India as a civilisation-state because, apparently, it predates colonial rule and Muslim invasions. Emphasis is put on the centuries-long practice of Hinduism, which dates back to the Bronze Age. Modi’s perception of India as a civilisation-state is therefore at odds with the secular and diverse nature of Indian society, enshrined in the Indian constitution. This has led to the ‘othering’ of minority groups, especially Muslims.
Turkiye under Recep Tayyip Erdogan (since 2001) has been positioning itself as a civilisation-state, undercutting the Turkish nationalism/republicanism first established by the founder of modern Turkiye, Kamal Ataturk. Erdogan defines Turkey’s identity and foreign policy as rooted in its long history and cultural heritage, encompassing various empires and civilisations that have existed on Anatolian soil — especially the Ottomans.
Iran too sees itself as a civilisation-state or as the continuation of an ancient civilisation, despite it being an Islamist theocracy since 1979. China also explains itself more than just a nation-state. It sees itself as a civilisation with a continuous cultural identity that spans millennia.
Interestingly, far-right parties and populists in the United States, and in many European countries too, have started to call their nation-states as civilisation-states, despite the fact that Europe is the birthplace of the idea of the nation-state. However, like in India, the emphasis in this regard in these regions also is more on ‘nativism’. In this case, white nativism. This marginalises non-white groups.
Pakistan has experimented with two competing narratives to add elements of the civilisation-state to its nationalism. The first sees the country as a continuation of ancient civilisations that emerged on the banks of the River Indus. The other sees the country as an outcome of the initial spread of Islam from the confines of Arabia.
According to the British political philosopher Christopher Coker, more and more governments and movements have been using the currency of civilisation for their policy ends. He wrote, “At the level of consciousness, political regimes are tapping into more primal identities.”
Coker spoke of ‘Mythopoeia’ — the process of making myths. According to him, “Mythopoeia took place in the West and in the East. Two opposing forces, cosmopolitanism and nativism, now confront each other, revealing how the imagination can shape identities in bizarre ways and how intellectuals in cahoots with a political class can hoodwink both themselves and others.”
The civilisation-state can be understood as a tool for a state that wants to legitimise the power of a particular kind of political system. Its overarching theme is the rejection of the aforementioned universalities and the insulation of societies from the influence of other civilisations. Civilisation-state may have a broader meaning, but its intent is largely myopic.

Lawmakers voted 51-49 to open debate on the 940-page megabill, with two of Trump’s fellow Republicans joining Democrats to oppose the legislation that would fund the president’s top immigration, border, tax-cut and military priorities.
Trump on social media hailed the “great victory” for his “great, big, beautiful bill”.
 


After hours of delay, during which Republican leaders and Vice President JD Vance worked behind closed doors to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the measure, Democrats demanded that the megabill first be read aloud in the chamber — a task that could delay the start of the debate until Sunday afternoon.
Democrats say the bill’s tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of social programs for lower-income Americans.
“Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical bill, released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don’t realise what’s in it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor.
“Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish,” he said.
Once the bill has been read, lawmakers will begin up to 20 hours of debate on the legislation. That will be followed by a marathon amendment session, known as a “vote-a-rama,” before the Senate votes on passage. Lawmakers said they hoped to complete work on the bill on Monday.
 
 

Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Rand Paul voted against opening debate, a move that seemed for a time to be in danger of failing.
Trump attacked Tillis, who opposed the bill’s cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for lower-income Americans, which he said would be devastating for his native North Carolina. Tillis is up for reelection next year.
“Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against ‘Senator Thom’ Tillis. I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks,” the president posted.
Paul opposed the legislation because it would raise the federal borrowing limit on the $36.2 trillion US debt by an additional $5tr.
“Did Rand Paul Vote ‘NO’ again tonight? What’s wrong with this guy???” Trump said on social media.
In limbo
Saturday’s vote was in limbo for hours as Vance, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other top Republicans sought to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the legislation. It was not clear what deals, if any, were struck to win over their support.
Hardline Republican Senators Rick Scott, Mike Lee and Cynthia Lummis, who want deeper cuts in federal spending, voted to support the bill in the end. Another hardliner, Senator Ron Johnson, initially voted no but flipped his vote and backed the legislation.
Trump was monitoring the vote from the Oval Office late into the night, a senior White House official said.
The megabill would extend the 2017 tax cuts that were Trump’s main legislative achievement during his first term as president, cut other taxes and boost spending on the military and border security.
The nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee released an analysis projecting that the Senate bill’s tax provisions would reduce government revenue by $4.5tr over the next decade, increasing the $36.2tr US government debt.
The White House said this month the legislation would reduce the annual deficit by $1.4tr.
The world’s richest person, Elon Musk, also took a swipe at the bill, which would end tax breaks for the electric vehicles that his automaker Tesla manufactures.
Calling the bill “utterly insane and destructive,” he risked reigniting a feud with Trump that raged earlier this month, before Musk backed down from his rhetoric.
“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” Musk wrote in a post on his social media platform X.
Medicaid changes
Republicans from states with large rural populations have opposed a reduction in state tax revenue for Medicaid providers, including rural hospitals. The newly released legislation would delay that reduction and would include $25 billion to support rural Medicaid providers from 2028 to 2032.
The legislation would raise the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes to $40,000 with an annual 1pc inflation adjustment through 2029, after which it would fall back to the current $10,000. The bill would also phase the cap down for those earning more than $500,000 a year.
That is a major concern of House Republicans from coastal states, including New York, New Jersey and California, who play an important role in keeping the party’s narrow House majority.
Republicans are using a legislative manoeuvre to bypass the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation in the 100-member chamber.
Democrats will focus their firepower with amendments aimed at reversing Republican spending cuts to programs that provide government-backed healthcare to the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as food aid to low-income families.
The bill also would raise the Treasury Department’s debt ceiling by trillions of dollars to stave off a potentially disastrous default on the nation’s debt in the coming months.
If the Senate passes the bill, it will then return to the House of Representatives for final passage before Trump can sign it into law. The House passed its version of the bill last month.</p><small>2025-06-29 06:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611490-tunisian-girl-set-to-be-repatriated-after-social-media-love-marriage-ends-in-divorce' target='_blank'><strong>Tunisian girl set to be repatriated after social media love marriage ends in divorce</strong></a><br><p>

PROLOGUE
Following a US attack on Iran’s three nuclear sites and a series of bizarre postings on Truth Social by US President Donald Trump the next day, the 12-day war between Iran and Israel, started by the latter, has ended with a ceasefire on June 24. Questions abound, beginning with what this war was about in terms of its politico-strategic objectives, whether they have been met or the seeds of another have been sown by this one.
A few facts need to be flagged before we proceed further. The Israeli attacks, as also the US attack on Iran, were illegal under several provisions of International Law. Two, statements by the European governments and the European Union that Israel has the right to self-defence, are not only disingenuous, they are downright perfidious. Three, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under its current Director-General, the Argentinian diplomat Rafael Grossi, has proved to be devious, acting as a political, not a technical body, to make a case against Iran.
This is also proven by any lack of condemnation of US-Israeli actions by Grossi, who has merely shown “concern” over the attacks. All these points can be treated in detail but they are beyond the scope of this article.
 
 

We are too close to the event at this point to know granular details, but on the basis of broad constants, I intend to analyse US and Israeli actions, Israel’s long-term strategy of regime change in Iran, Pakistan’s concerns with reference to instability in Iran and Iran’s options going forward.
WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME?
Trump started the negotiation process with Iran but also gave a 60-day deadline. Negotiations don’t work with pre-conditioned deadlines, but that’s Trump’s modus operandi. ‘You gotta do this or else.’ Sometimes it works; other times it doesn’t, as it didn’t with North Korea in his first term in office, or with Russia in this term.

Following Israel’s unprovoked aggression against Iran, the brief but brutal war that followed and the American attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities, Ejaz Haider unpacks what ramifications this has for regional peace and security, for global nuclear non-proliferation and especially for Pakistan…

Iran wanted to return to some form of the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, an agreement that would (a) bring sanctions to an end, giving it economic relief while (b) keeping its enrichment programme on track and monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This wasn’t acceptable to Trump. He wanted a rollback: zero enrichment. This was the sticking point on which every round made shipwreck.
 
 

Wilfully or otherwise, the policy was designed to fail. The demand, meant to have an anchoring effect, was not a negotiating point for Iran. It was a non-starter. Iran is a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Article IV of the treaty is silent over whether non-nuclear weapon states can enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium, the two technologies used to produce reactor fuel as well as fissile materials used in nuclear weapons, depending on the levels of enrichment. But it does give states the inalienable right… to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This cannot be done without mastering the enrichment process.
This is why, like other non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS), Iran interprets Article IV as inclusive of uranium enrichment and maintains that it will not give up its right to enrich under any nuclear agreement.
Iran’s enrichment red line is grounded in several factors: it wants to be treated as other non-nuclear NPT member states; two, it has an ambitious civil nuclear programme for which it needs enriched uranium (currently, it imports 20 percent of its enriched uranium from Russia’s state-run nuclear company, Rosatom); three, given its relations with the US, Iran does not trust supply from foreign sources, which can be stopped; four, it wants the capability as a lever against the US; five, while it has a 2003 fatwa [religious decree] against nuclear weapons, there’s enough evidence to suggest that it wants to have the capability to enrich uranium to weapons-grade level, which is different from actually making a bomb.
The last point is important and is key to the question of why Iran was found in violation of its NPT safeguard provisions in 2003, which led to closer scrutiny of its programme and for which reason the IAEA reported it in 2006 to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) for non-compliance with its safeguards agreement.
The Security Council then passed a series of resolutions requiring Iran to cooperate with the agency and suspend certain nuclear activities, including its uranium enrichment programme. The requirement for enrichment suspension was intended to push Iran to negotiate over its nuclear programme and was superseded in 2015, when the Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 2231, which endorsed the nuclear deal known as the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action].
Trump walked out of the deal in 2018 and applied a “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran. US President Joe Biden tried to get back to the JCPOA but it didn’t work because Iran demanded that the US lift sanctions as a precondition for Tehran to return to the talks.
This time too, enrichment has become the bone of contention. This is why, by most evidence, Trump okayed an Israeli attack on Iran just two days before the sixth round of talks in Muscat on June 15. The 60-day deadline ended on June 12, the same day Grossi choreographed a vote in the IAEA Board of Governors, and the Israeli attack came the next day.
After the Israeli attack, Trump came on record to say that he had given a 60-day deadline and “they [Iran] know what happened on the 61st day. Iran should now return to the table.” When pressed further, Trump said that Iran was stonewalling the process. Yet, until the Israeli attack, Trump had not spoken about Iran’s filibustering or that the sixth round had been called off because talks weren’t going anywhere.

Corollary: Trump let Israel attack Iran because he thought that decapitation and degradation would help bring Iran back to the table and make it more amenable to his original ask — no enrichment. Instead, Iran walked off, saying it won’t negotiate while being under attack.
For Israel, the nod was heaven-sent. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s 30-year-old desire was fulfilled. This was the chance to pull America in and make it go all the way — not just destroying Iran’s nuclear programme but affecting regime change through a longer campaign of inflicting pain on Iran.
 
 

When Trump decided to order a hit on Iran’s facilities and became a direct belligerent, Netanyahu was ecstatic. But he misread Trump. Trump ordered the attack to end the war, not prolong it. He wasn’t thinking of a long campaign and certainly not of regime change. He was squaring off his persona of a tough guy with someone looking for peace.
This is where Israel and the US diverge. Israel wants to create chaos; the US, leaving aside the issue of double standards or the probity of its approach, wants a stable but definitively non-nuclear Iran.

Pakistan is only tangentially involved in this conflict but it has to study the way the geopolitical game is being played and how its second- and third-order effects could impact it. Instability in Iran would negatively affect Pakistan’s security through ethno-sectarian conflicts and complicate the delicate balance Pakistan has to maintain in its relations between the Arab/Gulf states and Iran. The diplomatic challenge is exacerbated by Pakistan’s economic weaknesses, which necessitate its closer cooperation with the Gulf states and also with the US.

WHAT NOW?
We don’t know if this war and ceasefire will fulfil Trump’s politico-strategic objective — ie Iran’s return to the table and acceptance of Trump’s opening demand: no enrichment. We will return to this when discussing Iran’s choices. From Israel’s point of view, the job remains unfinished. Israel’s politico-strategic objective is not just the destruction of Iran’s nuclear capability — assuming that can be done — but changing Iran. And changing Iran means regime change — assuming that can be done.
From Israel’s perspective, that is the only way to safeguard Israel from Iran’s forward defence policy, what Israel calls a “ring of fire” around it. Having taken care of the inner circle (Egypt, Jordan and now Lebanon and Syria) and the outer circle (Iraq and Libya), Israel’s last problem is Iran.
The war on Gaza allowed it space to degrade Hamas, Hezbollah and Bashar al-Assad’s regime. But there’s still some distance to go and a strategic victory, from Israel’s perspective, requires finishing off Iran as currently constituted. Whether that can be done is a separate debate. But first let’s see, hypothetically, what Israel wants.
WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN IRAN?
Destroying Iran’s nuclear capability is neither here nor there. It’s not a single item that can be bombed out. It is not just the infrastructure nor just the processes of fuel cycles. It is essentially the knowledge that Iran has, knowledge that encompasses many disciplines in hard sciences. It can’t be destroyed, though it can be set back by killing scientists and engineers, through cyber attacks and by direct attack.
The real prize is regime change. Israel has made no bones about that. It would like to use ethno-linguistic fault-lines — Baloch, Kurds, Ahvazis — as also the disenchanted youth to bring down the regime, especially if Israel can deliver severe decapitating blows to it.
As multiple scholars have noted, many of Iranian origin, the regime is not popular, to put it mildly. The details of the growing resentment are many and beyond the scope of this article. Briefly, however, the regime, led by the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), have managed to thwart all attempts at what historian Crane Brinton calls a “Thermidorian Reaction”, a term the academic Vali Nasr also uses in his latest book, Iran’s Grand Strategy: A Political History, and which essentially means a deradicalisation and the establishment of a more moderate and conservative order.
Since Iran’s second constitution in 1989, efforts by reformist presidents such as Akbar Hashmi Rafsanjani, Mohammad Khatami and Hassan Rouhani to moderate the revolutionary zeal, bring in economic reforms and open to the West have been stymied by the hardliners. It wasn’t a linear process, but I make a broader point without getting into brief periods when Ali Khamanei gave some leeway to the reformists for immediate pragmatic reasons.
The essential point is that the hardliners have continued to control the state and are the deep state. Similarly, Rafsanjani’s and Khatami’s economic reforms, including privatisation, were co-opted and subverted by the IRGC, which now runs the largest business enterprises in the country and also subcontracts companies in the private sector, effectively controlling the state.
This has expanded the size of the black market economy and, according to Nasr, proliferated “networks of businesspeople, influential politicians, and institutions dominated by current and former IRGC commanders, aggravating corruption and income inequality on an unprecedented scale.” But this is not all. A highly educated but frustrated middle class that wants socio-political freedoms is another internal fault-line. This is what Israel wants to target and exploit.
Regime change, as we have seen with previous efforts in the Middle East, is a very tricky process, leading to costly failures, chaos and much bloodletting. For the purposes of this discussion, however, it could, in theory, result in two scenarios, though each of those scenarios can have many sub-scenarios: civil strife, or an orchestrated regime that’s pro-Israel and the US, essentially a return to the monarch Mohammad Reza Pahlavi’s time.
 

A firefighter calls out to his colleagues after an Israeli attack on a residential compound in Tehran, Iran on June 13, 2025: Trump let Israel attack Iran because he thought that decapitation and degradation would help bring Iran back to the table — instead, Iran walked off, saying it won’t negotiate while being under attack | AP

A civil strife is easier to achieve than installing a regime because disruptions are more prone to internal discord than a smooth transition to another system. Strife could also force Iran to lose any external focus. As happens in such situations, groups will fight each other — that fight could go on or it could get resolved in favour of the group that emerges as the strongest and establishes control. Or the country could become another Libya, Sudan or Myanmar. It’s just not possible to predict these trajectories, since nothing one can base one’s analysis on would remain stable. The big question? What would happen to the nuclear capability?
The second scenario — an orchestrated regime that’s pro-Israel and pro-US — can actually be two scenarios: a puppet government, such as the one the US installed in Afghanistan in 2001, or the one it has in Syria. Before such a government becomes too unpopular, which it would, Israel could goad the US into putting together a coalition, boots/inspectors on the ground to completely, physically destroy Iran’s nuclear capability.
The second possibility in this same scenario could be that, while the current regime falls, it makes way for a more nationalist government. Having gone through the shock of external aggression, they could naturally build on certain legacy capabilities.
We have seen this process before. It leads to strife, not peace and rebuilding. It also begets unintended consequences that can defeat the original objective of such reengineering, because human affairs are not an engineering problem. But strife does serve one Israeli purpose: a weak state that can be regularly attacked to degrade its military capabilities.
This was on display immediately after Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham took control of Syria in December 2024. Israel mounted one of the largest air campaigns in its history to systematically target and destroy all military capability of Syria and is also in physical control of Syrian territory in the buffer zone. Something akin to that for Iran would be eminently in the interest of Israel.
RAMIFICATIONS FOR PAKISTAN
Now let’s come to what all this means for Pakistan.
For Pakistan, any disruption of the current socio-political structures in Iran through external shocks will be a troubling development. Geographic contiguity means it would create uncertainties that could increase security threats. A civil strife could spill over into Balochistan with economic and security ramifications. A pro-Israel government, if one could be installed, would mean Pakistan facing security and intelligence threats in the east (existing) and southwest (potential).
These are real concerns and cannot be dismissed lightly. Pakistan does not have the capacity to actively thwart external shocks to Iran, but it needs to be prepared for the worst-case scenarios while trying whatever it can at the diplomatic level to mitigate the situation.
This is also important because the current ceasefire does not resolve the issues that started this war or which underpin Iran’s long term politico-strategic objectives: regime survival, diminishing the US influence in the Middle East and the destruction of Israel’s military capabilities. In effect, this is a direct clash between two different visions for the Middle East: that of the US and Israel, and that of Iran.
Pakistan is only tangentially involved in this conflict but it has to study the way the geopolitical game is being played and how its second- and third-order effects could impact it. Instability in Iran would negatively affect Pakistan’s security through ethno-sectarian conflicts and complicate the delicate balance Pakistan has to maintain in its relations between the Arab/Gulf states and Iran.
The diplomatic challenge is exacerbated by Pakistan’s economic weaknesses, which necessitate its closer cooperation with the Gulf states and also with the US. Pakistan’s close relations with Turkiye and Azerbaijan, important in many respects, also require very deft handling because of Iran’s troubled relations with Turkiye, and especially Azerbaijan.
Instability on the south-western border would also result in operational overstretch for Pakistan. Balochistan is already restive. Iran losing control over its Sistan-Baluchistan region could mean ungoverned spaces for Pakistani Baloch groups fighting the state. Given Pakistan’s meagre resources, it has to find a balance between force employment on the western and south-western borders and in the east, the major threat.
Ungoverned territories around the world, especially when there is internal strife, also result in drugs and weapons smuggling, the inflow of refugees, and easy movement across the borders of militant groups. This is not peculiar to a particular area but a constant across borders where one or two or three contiguous states face internal strife and loss of central governmental control. In all such cases, sovereignty, the basic tenet of a state, is lost even as the state in physical terms remains.
This witches’ cauldron also invites hostile intelligence agencies like harmful bacteria. If there is one lesson of Israeli offensives against Hezbollah, Syria and Iran, it is the high degree of intelligence tradecraft on display, both in terms of human intelligence and technical means.
It would be naïveté at its most naive for anyone to think that an unstable or fractured Iran would not invite Israeli intelligence operations or that such operations would remain confined to Iran. Given the close strategic cooperation between Israel and India, it will be a given for Israel to help India foment trouble for Pakistan in the west. In fact, it should be considered a foregone conclusion.
Alex Vatanka, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC, in his 2017 book Iran and Pakistan: Security, Diplomacy and American Influence, explores Iran-Pakistan relations in some detail. Iran was the first country to recognise Pakistan and the Shah of Iran was the first head of state to visit Pakistan. At one point in the 1950s, the Shah even proposed a confederation between Pakistan and Iran.
Relations have been somewhat fraught since the 1979 Islamic Revolution because of sectarian tensions and Iran’s closeness to India but, in recent years, the two sides have established mechanisms for border security, trade, counterterrorism cooperation and the management of refugees. Iran has also been distancing from India as the latter has gone into a close embrace with Israel.
IRAN’S OBJECTIVES
In the immediate context, Iran’s central objective was and remains to find reprieve. Its forward defence strategy has taken a beating and its own military capabilities have been damaged. The supposed internal cohesion of the IRGC has been badly compromised through Israeli intelligence penetration.
Given this, Iran needs to recoup. But recuperation requires peace. Iran’s standard policy was the strategy of the indirect approach, to use military theorist Liddell Hart’s term. In other words, no direct engagement with Israel. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh’s July 2024 assassination in Tehran put Iran in a terrible bind: if Iran confronted Israel directly, it would violate its longstanding policy; if it didn’t, it would betray weakness. A guest had been murdered on Iran’s watch in Tehran. That called for action.
 
 

The next Israeli move was worse: Hezbollah Secretary-General Hasan Nasrallah and multiple other militia leaders were assassinated September 2024 onwards. Iran’s hand was again forced. This time, Israel retaliated more pointedly, not just attacking but also probing Iran’s capabilities. Simultaneously, it prepared and planned for a sustained attack, something it has been planning for nearly 15 years.
Put another way, Israel got Iran exactly where it wanted Iran: escalate or show restraint. Escalation would beget more pain; restraint would not offset attacks but show weakness.
Will Iran get the peace it needs to recoup? That depends on Trump’s next move. Would he lower the opening price in any other round of talks? If not, would Iran bite? If it doesn’t, are we back to the possibility of resumption of hostilities?
These questions remain unanswered thus far but two factors are important: since the 1979 Revolution, the central concern for the regime is survival. Iran’s nuclear and missile programmes are grounded in that tenet. But now it might have to make some kind of compromise on nuclear enrichment for the regime to survive. Another issue is Iran’s economic woes. For the regime to remain stable, it needs to provide for the people. The middle class has shrunk from over 40 per cent to about 30 per cent. And this is just one data point.
 
 

In the three essentials, regime preservation, nuclear enrichment and sanctions relief, Iran will likely have to give up, at least for now, on nuclear enrichment. That will help safeguard its nuclear infrastructure, knowledge, capabilities and bring economic relief.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
In the longer run, however, because the immediate often blinds us to the longer trajectory, US actions have not been lost on either Iran or many other states that already find that security will be increasingly scarce for them in the changing geopolitical climate. These states would do everything to acquire capabilities — including nuclear weapons — to ensure survival.
One repercussion would be further cracks in a cracked non-proliferation regime. Worryingly, these developments come at a time when (a) there is an increasing trust deficit among states and (b) emerging technologies and diffusion and commodification of existing technologies are increasing the prospect of conflicts.
The philosopher Thomas Hobbes famously described the state of nature as bellum omnium contra omnes [the war of all against all]. That necessitated laws and balancing rights with duties. In the past eight decades, the US, leading the so-called ‘free world’ after WWII, developed international institutions that, despite the Cold War, even co-opted rivals through a shared acceptance of a post-war security architecture.
The threat of mutual annihilation and spread of nuclear weapons brought the bitterest rivals to work together to create a legal, coercive and normative framework against non-proliferation. There are many other examples of such cooperation. Superpowers often flouted international law provisions but legal-normative condemnation and fear of the other’s power kept them largely in check.
That architecture appears to be unravelling. While perhaps a case can be made for such unravelling, especially by those who were not the beneficiaries of that system, the fact remains that great disruptions bring great uncertainties.
Periods of transition are always fraught. And the absence of law makes the exercise of raw power even more likely. History has witnessed those periods as also attempts to bring peace to end bloodletting and chaos. This time, however, is different because our capability to generate violence has reached the point where we can destroy the planet many times over.
Normally, this should be the very reason for cooperation. But in a twist on the Greek parable, the foxes will continue to play while the big hedgehog idea, to save humans from humans, would likely just dissipate.

The FIRs were lodged on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Riaz Ahmed of Okanwala police and the suspects were booked under sections 295-A and 298-C of the PPC and section 11 of Peca.
According to reports, a resident of Haseeb Town allegedly posted blasphemous content from his social media account, which subsequently went viral within the local community.
The content reportedly contained inflammatory sectarian comments, inciting discord among the residents of surrounding rural areas.
In the other incident, a resident of village 105/12-L was accused of sharing a video containing sectarian content and using hate speech against religious sects. Police claimed his mobile phone contained a video attacking revered religious figures.
Police started investigation but so far no arrest has been made in the cases.
BOOKED: A district and sessions judge booked ASI Maqsood Ahmed, a reader and two constables of the Yousafwala police for illegally detaining a citizen.
As per details, Shahid Ali, a resident of village 83/D Pakpattan, was returning home after a medical check-up when he was arrested by ASI Maqsood Ahmed near Ada Jahan Khan on June 22. The police officials also took two mobile phones and Rs10,000 cash from Shahid. His father, Abass Ali, inquired about the arrest but the police failed to satisfy him.
Later, his father filed a writ petition under section 491 in the court of D&SJ, Sahiwal. The court sent a ballif to Yousafwala police station and found that Shahid had been arrested in an old robbery case under section 288 of the PPC.
The judge found the case to be fake and also found the police record faulty and booked the officials under section 342 of the PPC and 155-C of Police Order for illegally detaining Shahid Ali. No arrest has been made so far by the police.

According to officials, a 17-year-old student reportedly suddenly developed fever, body aches and vomiting on June 25. A day later, he was admitted to the Aga Khan University Hospital where he tested positive for the deadly infection. On June 27, his condition deteriorated and he was shifted to ventilator support.
The patient had no history of swimming, the officials said and added that apparently he contracted the infection through the contaminated, or non-chlorinated, tap water.
According to experts, lack of filtration and chlorination of potable water is a major source of Naegleria’s infection. Besides, city’s water distribution system is faulty, allowing seepage of sewage in the domestic water supply lines, which in turn gets contaminated and causes harmful diseases.
Karachi recorded this year’s first death from Naegleria fowleri in March. The woman victim was a resident of Gulshan-i-Iqbal and died at a private hospital in Karachi on Feb 23.
Commonly known as “brain-eating amoeba”, Naegleria fowleri is responsible for the disease called Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM). The infection is fatal in 98 per cent of the cases.
A free-living amoeba, Naegleria, is commonly found in warm fresh water (such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil. Only its one species, Naegleria fowleri, infects people. The germ cannot survive in cool, clean and chlorinated water.
It infects people when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose. This typically happens when people go swimming, diving, or when they put their heads under fresh water, like in lakes and rivers.
The amoeba then travels up the nose to the brain where it destroys the brain tissues and causes the PAM.
The first symptoms of the PAM usually start about five days after infection that may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Later symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, seizures, hallucinations, and coma.
After symptoms start, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within five days.

Information collected by this scribe about the excessive use of ecstasy pills and ice by local youth unfolds a horrifying situation as the drug is now considered an essential ‘ingredient’ in social gatherings like weddings, engagements and other festive or recreational ceremonies owing to its easy availability throughout Khyber.
Locals said that a majority of youth had gone out of the control of their parents or other family members as those two ‘lethal’ drugs were easily available in designated shops, kiosks, private houses and hujras and even outside educational institutions and sports grounds where those could be supplied through motorcycles or young carriers by using mobile phone service in all the three tehsils of Khyber.
Ghafoor Shah, a social activist in Landi Kotal, said that local drug addicts invented their own names for different types of ecstasy pills like Firoun, Trump, Kabaiga, Silver and Local, depending upon the ‘efficacy’ of those drugs.

Experts say effects of these drugs include hallucination, memory loss and psychosis

He said that such pills were openly offered to users during different types of parties at varying prices while reluctant or refusing youngsters were then ‘administered’ those pills either in a cool drink or green tea to make them addicts.
Ayaz Khan, a resident of Jamrud, told this scribe that initially parents were not aware about the negative effects of those drugs and ignored warnings by close relatives about addiction of their sons to ice and ecstasy pills but now they were mostly helpless to prevent such addicts from use of drugs.
Dr Feroz Shah, a health expert, was equally apprehensive about the spiralling use and sale of such lethal drugs and cautioned about serious health complications as their long term implications.
He said that excessive use of ecstasy pills mainly affected the central nervous system with short term or immediate effects such as increase in heartbeat, fast breathing and an addict becoming more alert, awake for a long time and talkative and in highly joyous mode.
“These are the signs and effects of these highly addictive pills, which attract most of our unemployed and depressed youth towards it with little or no knowledge of their worst side effects on their health,” he said.
He said that being highly addictive, long term effects of ecstasy pills could include depression, hallucination, memory loss, psychosis and other related mental issues among young users.
Dr Feroz Shah argued that most of addicts themselves or their relatives did not report those matters to doctors for possible treatment or therapy for fear of social stigma and lack of awareness about possible rehabilitation of addicts.
Sources said that absence of a specialist psychiatrist at the district headquarters hospital was hampering psychological treatment of such addicts as medical professionals contended that so far no proper medicine was discovered for treatment of such patients, except psychiatric counselling.
With Khyber police regularly claiming seizure of varying quantities of different types of illegal drugs, sources at Wazir Dhand market in Jamrud alleged that the illegal business was ‘thriving’ unhindered as police accepted ‘monthly’ from drug dealers.
They said that big time drug dealers ‘deputed’ their touts at different convenient points in the vicinity of Wazir Dhand market, situated on the border with Peshawar, to provide ice and ecstasy pills to interested buyers after issuing them a token for easy identification.
They said that currently Wazir Dhand market was considered the main ‘repository’ of illegal drugs including heroin, charas, ice and ecstasy pills with local police in complete knowledge of the daily ‘wheeling and dealing’ by dealers.
Replying to Dawn queries about the rise in use and sale of these drugs, DPO Rae Mazhar Iqbal claimed police seized huge quantity of drugs. He said that the menace could be wiped out with collective efforts.

Israel’s chief patron-financier-arms supplier and ally, the United States, which jumped into the hostilities for a few hours on the final day, also made claims about obliterating Tehran’s alleged nuclear weapons programme.
But surely everyone could not have won the same war. So let’s first assess the two military machines widely acknowledged as being among the most lethal that there could be. First, the one that has dominated the Middle East over the past several decades and extended its land grab and occupation from Palestine to Syria to the West Bank every single day: it is feared by all its neighbours and their neighbours in the region.
Several weeks before it struck Iran, Israel hosted the former Shah of Iran’s son, Reza Pahalvi, and welcomed him with a gusto usually reserved for heads of state. Reza Pahalvi is not recognised as a major political force in Iranian politics and society.
Then, when Israel attacked Iran without a declaration of war and executed its decapitation strategy, slicing off the top layer of Iran’s military (including the Islamic Republic Guards Corps, better known in the West by its acronym IRGC), and nearly a dozen top nuclear scientists along with their families, Reza Shah became hyperactive on social media, calling on Iranians to rise in rebellion against their ‘regime’.
Israel also attacked Iran’s nuclear facilities, including enrichment plants at Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan, besides military targets. This was to create a chain reaction triggering a collapse in Iran. But its psychopathic prime minister was soon to realise that all the stealth and hi-tech intelligence that went into his ‘shock’ strike failed to produce the desired results.

Where Iran is concerned, the fact that it survived to fight another day is a win in itself.

Netanyahu’s goals in attacking Iran were clear. First, his genocidal regime was coming under increasing international pressure to stop its ethnic cleansing in Gaza. Its military machine was killing besieged Palestinians by the hundreds every week by bombing, unleashing missiles, and directly firing at unarmed civilians in Gaza while simultaneously inflicting starvation on them. He needed a diversion. It was momentary. How else would you describe a 12-day ‘distraction’ from an ongoing war on mostly unarmed, starving civilians for 20 months?
 
 

Second, and most ideally, if a regime change proved difficult (turned out it was impossible) despite activating Reza Pahalvi, then a regime collapse would suffice – with a state of civil war in the country and minority ethnicities/nations such as the Kurds and possibly the Baloch, to name just two, carving out autonomous zones in the northwest and southeast, respectively, to then serve as a launching pad to challenge those at the helm in Tehran.
The hope that Iranians would pour into the streets and a weakened government would be unable to contain the multitudes evaporated soon enough. The external aggression seemed to unite Iranians. Many who have suffered imprisonment and indignities at the hands of Iran’s theocratic government took to social media to denounce the Israeli aggression.
The third, and the most significant, goal was to suck the US into the war, because, notwithstanding his bravado, Netanyahu knew the limits of his military tools given the formidable underground nuclear facilities of Iran — some say up to 100 metres in cases.
Less than 24 hours after Israel killed the military leadership, it became clear a succession plan was in place and all the vacant positions were quickly filled. Tehran, which was under relentless air attacks after the destruction of its air defence system, starting firing missiles at Israel. Many, including this columnist, thought this was token defiance. But every day, newer and more lethal missiles started landing in Tel Avis, Haifa, Ashdod and Beersheba, to mention just a few. Soon, Israel’s reputedly impenetrable ‘Iron Dome’ was leaking missiles like a sieve.
Israelis, who have rarely been at the receiving end of devastation, apart from small Russian-made rockets fired by Hezbollah in its heyday, started to see their intel centre, defence ministry, military AI hubs, iconic scientific research buildings, power generation plants, airports, and seaport hit by lethal missile warheads. Even residential blocks were not spared.
 
 

Trump defied his anti-war MAGA support base, but only just. He called on the US Air Force to attack Iran’s Fordow nuclear site, buried deep under mountains, with 30,000-pound ‘bunker buster’ bombs. He then sued for peace after a seemingly scripted and largely ineffective retaliatory missile attack on an American base in Qatar. Israel which, many experts said, was running low on anti-missile missiles asked the US to initiate steps to secure a ceasefire.
Early US intelligence assessments and independent analyses suggest reversible damage to Iran’s nuclear sites and not the ‘totally obliterated’ claim that Trump made. But, I guess, he too needed a win and cessation of hostilities before he’d have to commit more US forces, including ground forces. And that was something his MAGA supporters would have shredded him for.
As for Iran, the fact that it survived to fight another day is a win in itself. There are suggestions some sort of a Gaza peace deal is being worked out to calm things down further. If that materialises and does not create ‘Trump’s Gaza Rivera’, that would be huge. The killing in Gaza must stop.
Over the medium to long term, many analysts see this ceasefire as a breather during which both sides will regroup, rearm and prepare for the next round. Israel will still have vital US support, and that of America’s European minions. The Nato summit underlined the nature of the US-Europe relationship.
Iran will do well to draw the right lessons from the fate of its Axis of Resistance allies — Hezbollah in Lebanon and Bashar al-Assad in Syria: how Israel can degrade military capability in the first instance and effect regime change in the second.
Whatever the long term may hold, for now, Iran’s theocratic government, which can turn on oppression at home at the drop of a hat, has come to represent the many defiant aspirations of oppressed peoples around the world.

Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in Israel on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust - all of which he denies. The trial began in 2020 and involves three criminal cases.
“It is INSANITY doing what the out-of-control prosecutors are doing to Bibi Netanyahu,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that the judicial process was going to interfere with Netanyahu’s ability to conduct talks with Palestinian militants Hamas, and Iran.
Trump’s second post over the course of a few days defending Netanyahu and calling for the cancellation of the trial went a step further to tie Israel’s legal action to US aid.
“The United States of America spends Billions of Dollar [sic] a year, far more than on any other Nation, protecting and supporting Israel. We are not going to stand for this,” Trump said.
Netanyahu “right now” was in the process of negotiating a deal with Hamas, Trump said, without giving further details. On Friday, the Republican president told reporters that he believes a ceasefire is close.
Hamas has said it is willing to free remaining hostages in Gaza under any deal to end the war, while Israel says it can only end if Hamas is disarmed and dismantled. Hamas refuses to lay down its arms.
Interest in resolving the Gaza conflict has heightened in the wake of the U.S. and Israeli bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities. A ceasefire to the 12-day Israel-Iran conflict went into effect early this week.</p><small>2025-06-29 03:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29105816592aab4.jpg?r=105829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920917/swat-victims-funeral-held-in-daska' target='_blank'><strong>Swat victims funeral held in Daska</strong></a><br><p>NAROWAL:Funeral prayers for nine members of a family who drowned in the Swat River were offered in Daska, Sialkot, on Sunday.

On May 2, India imposed a ban on ships carrying goods originating from or destined for Pakistan, barring them from entering Indian ports or transiting through Indian territory. The move followed military aggression under ‘Operation Sindoor’ launched on May 7, which ended within four days due to Pakistan’s forceful retaliation.
While India initially sought to hurt Pakistan’s trade flows, the outcome fell short of expectations. Shipping companies reportedly adapted by separating cargo bound for and from Pakistan, thereby avoiding dependence on Indian ports.
Importers, however, said the Indian ban has resulted in longer shipping times and higher freight charges.
“Mother vessels are not coming to Pakistan due to this Indian action, which delays our imports by 30 to 50 days,” said Javed Bilwani, President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He added that importers are now relying on feeder vessels, which raises costs.

Shipping delays push up costs, but exporters report minimal impact on overall trade

Exporters also reported a spike in shipping and insurance costs following the Indian aggression. However, they said the overall impact on exports remains minimal.
“There is no significant impact on exports after the Indian aggression, except for a rise in insurance costs. Shipping charges had already gone up even before the escalation,” said Aamir Aziz, an exporter of textile made-ups.
Pakistan’s exports are heavily reliant on imported inputs for value addition. With the government maintaining tight controls on imports to conserve foreign exchange, any disruption in supply chains has broader economic implications.
However, Pakistan Ship’s Agents Association Secretary General Syed Tahir Hussain dismissed claims that mother vessels have stopped calling at Pakistani ports.
“You can see mother vessels at Karachi and Port Qasim,” he said. “Feeder vessels are also sufficient to handle Pakistan’s trade volume, as they can carry between 6,000 and 8,000 containers — well above the current level of our exports and imports.”
Trade with India
Formal trade relations between Pakistan and India have remained frozen since 2019. Bilateral trade declined from $2.41bn in 2018 to $1.2bn in 2024. Pakistan’s exports to India decreased from $547.5 million in 2019 to just $480,000 in 2024.
Nevertheless, unofficial trade is thriving. Al Jazeera, quoting the India-based Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), reported last month that unofficial Indian exports to Pakistan are estimated at $10bn per year.
This parallel trade has been facilitated through alternate routes, including ports in Dubai (UAE), Colombo (Sri Lanka), and Singapore.
India’s exports include pharmaceuticals, petroleum products, plastics, rubber, organic chemicals, dyes, vegetables, spices, coffee, tea, dairy items, and cereals. Pakistan’s key exports to India consist of copper, glassware, organic chemicals, sulphur, fruits and nuts, and certain oilseeds.

The appeal was filed on Saturday, two days before the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s (JCP) meeting to appoint chief justices to at least three high courts on July 1.
In its judgement anno­unced on June 19, the Supreme Court’s Const­itutional Bench, had held by a majority of 3-2 that the transfer of three judges to IHC from Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan high cou­rts was within the framework of the Constitution.
The Constitutional
Ben­ch had also partially sent the matter to the president to determine seniority amongst judges, based on their service records.
Now, IHC’s justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz, who originally challenged the transfers, have filed an intra-court appeal (ICA) against the June 19 judgement.
The ICA, jointly moved by senior counsel Muneer A. Malik and Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, urged the court to set aside the order in the interest of justice.
While the appeal is heard, the Supreme Court should grant an interim relief against the judgment, the applicants pleaded.
The five judges have requested the Supreme Court not to consider justices Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Muhammad Asif as judges of IHC until they take fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194 Justice Dogar is also the acting chief justice of IHC.
The appeal contended that Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010 only provides for the appointment of judges to the IHC from other provinces but makes no reference to transfers.
 
 

The appeal contended that the June 19 order impermissibly reads in “permanent” in Article 200(1) and (2) of the Constitution when no such language was contained in the provision.
The appeal pleaded that the constitutional bench had misunderstood the provisions of Article 200 by reading sub-article (1) in isolation from other provisions of the article by not holding that transfers envisioned in Article 200(1) were only for a temporary and time-specified period.
The order also failed to interpret of articles 200 and 175A, without scuttling and undermining the powers of JCP under Article 175A of the Constitution, the appeal argued adding the independence of judiciary does not allow bestowing onto the executive a much more expansive power than what the text of Article 200 and the foundational principles of constitutional law can bear.
The concept of federalism also mandates that the provincial authority’s role in the permanent filling of vacancies of judges must not be usurped, it added.
The June 19 judgment had partially remanded the matter to the president to determine the seniority after examining the service record of the transferred judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether these transfers were permanent or temporary.
The powers of the president under Article 200(1) are two distinct provisions dealing with different situations and niceties and neither do they overlap nor override each other, the verdict explained, adding the transfer by the president by means of Article 200 cannot be construed as a fresh appointment, the judgment had held adding the powers of transfer conferred to the president by the framers of the Constitution cannot be questioned on the ground that if the posts were vacant in IHC then why they were not filled up by JCP through fresh appointments.

• Accuse ‘establishment-backed elements’ of taking advantage of situation
• Vow to hold joint press conference to dispel impression of rift
ISLAMABAD: The recent dec­ision of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on the reserved seats has dealt a serious blow to the opposition Pak­istan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), which is already emb­roiled in numerous challenges, including internal disunity.
Background briefings revealed a complete lack of trust among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding Imran Khan’s messages.
Despite having doubts about loyalties, the party leaders, however, were found united in their support for Imran Khan’s leadership, hoping that the issues would be resolved once Mr Khan was freed from jail.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, considered a close confidant of Mr Khan, had initially declared that he would not get the budget passed from the provincial assembly without consulting Imran Khan.
However, the swift and somewhat hasty passage of the KP budget without his meeting with Mr Khan further exposed fissures within the party ranks, as evident from statements of various PTI leaders and members, who questioned each other’s loyalty to the incarcerated party boss.
 
 

The statement by Aleema Khan, Imran Khan’s sister, about a “minus-Imran” formula sparked a heated debate within political and journalistic circles, as well as within the PTI, with some party leaders questioning the decision-making process.
Many senior party members believed that the party was facing a crisis-like situation due to a “communication gap” and the leadership’s failure to hold regular meetings with the jailed leader.
Another senior leader suggested that Aleema Khan’s statement was emotional and provided an opportunity for Maryam Nawaz to criticise the party.
Communication gap
According to prominent PTI leader Asad Qaiser, all the issues were due to a communication gap as the political leadership had no contact with Imran Khan.
“We remain unaware if the party’s patron-in-chief has really said it or not,” said Mr Qaiser, who served as the National Assembly speaker under the PTI government.
Mr Qaiser said that presently, only lawyers had been meeting with Mr Khan, and each of them had their own interpretation. He also mentioned the sisters of Mr Khan, claiming that they simply conveyed the message as they  heard. “I have no doubt but every person can understand the message as per his/her understanding,” he said.
During his conversation with Dawn, Mr Qaiser, without naming anyone, stated that some of the “friends of the PTI” were also responsible for the impression regarding rift within the party.
The former speaker said that they had decided that all the party leaders would hold a joint press conference in which they would give a clear message that “there is no rift within the party”.
Another senior leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, also endorsed Mr Qaiser’s view, stating that the major issue was that the leadership was not being allowed to meet Mr Khan.
“The lack of communication has been triggering the confusion. Moreover, there can be differences of opinion within political parties and no one can stop it,” the PTI leader said.
He also dubbed the reports about internal rifts in the party as part of “a disinformation campaign”.
“We have conducted an inquiry and reached a conclusion that there are five persons who have been running at least 25 social media accounts which are being used to create a negative impression about the PTI,” he claimed.
He admitted that there was frustration among the leaders and workers due to the “ongoing state oppression” and crackdown on the party for the last three years as well as the possible convictions of some party members and activists in the May 9 and Nov 26 cases.
‘Establishment-backed elements’
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said some of the “establishment-backed elements” were taking advantage of the situation caused by miscommunication within the party.
“There are some paid people who have been criticising the party. However, we have decided to address the communication gap,” said Mr Akram.
“We have decided to hold physical meetings, instead of Zoom [virtual]meetings, to avoid chances of wrong interpretations,” he said.
Mr Akram termed the consensus over the leadership of Mr Khan a “positive sign”, stating that everyone in the party knew that “they cannot survive without the founding chairman”.
He emphasised that the party was united behind Mr Khan’s leadership and acknowledged that rifts within parties were normal.
“Rifts within parties are quite normal, as I have heard old PPP and new PPP, Zardari group and Bilawal group, Hamza group and Maryam group, and the rift between Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif,” he said in an effort to downplay the situation being faced by his party.
Fawad Chaudhry, former information minister in the PTI government, attributes the issues to the party’s lack of experienced leadership.
“Those taking decisions have limited experience, and the grouping in KP started in 2011,” he said, suggesting the formation of a committee to meet opposition parties and launch a movement to secure Mr Khan’s release.

He said this during a meeting with the airline’s chief executive, Air Vice Marshal Amir Hayat, who requested fresh diplomatic support to remove the long-running flight ban.
Mr Hayat appreciated the foreign minister’s continued support in helping to remove the ban on PIA flights to various countries.
He noted that compliance work begun under the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition government of 2022-23 enabled both PIA and the Civil Aviation Aut­hority (CAA) to satisfy Inte­rnational Civil Avia­tion Organisation aud­itors, paving the way for the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to lift its own suspension in November 2024.
Flights to the UK and Europe were halted in June 2020 after then aviation minister told parliament that roughly one-third of the country’s com­m­ercial pilots held “dubious” licences — a statement made in the aftermath of the May 22, 2020, crash of Flight PK8303 in Karachi, which claimed 97 lives.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority suspended PIA’s operating permit on June 30 that year, mirroring EASA’s action a day earlier.
 
 
;

Regulators cited systemic failures in licensing oversight and airline safety management. The grounding deprived PIA of one of its most lucrative long-haul markets and cost nearly 40 billion a year in lost revenue, according to government records presented in parliament.
After three years of remedial work — ranging from re-validation of pilot credentials to overhauling safety protocols — EASA reinstated PIA’s Third-Country Operator authorisation on Nov 29, 2024.
Earlier this year, the carrier resumed flights to Paris and plans to add further European destinations this summer.
Power sector meeting
In a separate development, Mr Dar reaffirmed the government’s commitment to making balanced decisions that uphold financial discipline without imposing an undue burden on the public.
Mr Dar chaired a high-level meeting to review matters related to the power sector. The meeting was attended by the ministers for power and petroleum, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, and senior officials, according to a press release issued by the Deputy Prime Minister’s Office.
Discussions centred on key aspects of the power sector, with a focus on ensuring financial sustainability and consumer protection.

• Nine children among 37 killed in military strikes across Gaza Strip
DOHA: Gaza mediators are engaging with Israel and Hamas to build on momentum from this week’s ceasefire with Iran and work towards a truce in the Palestinian territory, Qatar foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said.
Israel and Iran on Tuesday agreed to a ceasefire brokered by the United States and Qatar just hours after the Islamic republic launched a salvo of missiles towards the wealthy Gulf state, targeting the American military base hosted there.
The unprecedented attack on Qatari soil followed Washington’s intervention into a days-long war between Israel and Iran which saw US warplanes strike Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting promises of retaliation from Tehran.
In an interview with AFP on Friday, Ansari said Doha — with fellow Gaza mediators in Washington and Cairo — was now “trying to use the momentum that was created by the ceasefire between Iran and Israel to restart the talks over Gaza”.
“If we don’t utilise this window of opportunity and this momentum, it’s an opportunity lost amongst many in the near past. We don’t want to see that again,” the spokesman, who is also an adviser to Qatar’s prime minister, said.
US President Donald Trump voiced optimism on Friday about a new ceasefire in Gaza saying an agreement involving Israel and Hamas could come as early as next week.
Mediators have been engaged in months of back-and-forth negotiations with the warring parties aimed at ending 20 months of war in Gaza, with Ansari explaining there were no current talks between the sides but that Qatar was “heavily involved in talking to every side separately”.
‘The right pressure’
A two-month truce, which was agreed as Trump came into office in January, collapsed in March with Israel intensifying military operations in Gaza afterwards.
“We have seen US pressure and what it can accomplish,” Ansari said referring to the January truce which saw dozens of prisoners held by Hamas released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
The Qatari official said particularly in the context of US enforcement of the Israel-Iran truce, it was “not a far-fetched idea” that pressure from Washington would achieve a fresh truce in Gaza.
Another 37 Palestinians killed
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed 37 people in the devastated territory on Saturday, including at least nine children who died in strikes.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP 35 people were killed in seven Israeli drone and air strikes in various locations, and two others by Israeli fire while waiting for food aid in the Netzarim zone in central Gaza.
He said the dead included three children who were killed in an air strike on a home in Jabalia, in northern Gaza.
Bassal said at least six more children died in a neighbourhood in the northeast of Gaza City, including some in an air strike near a school where displaced people were sheltering.
AFP images showed mourners weeping over the bodies of seven people, including at least two children, wrapped in white shrouds and blankets at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.
Video footage filmed from southern Israel showed smoke rising over northern Gaza after blasts. Other AFP footage filmed in Gaza City showed a cloud of smoke rising from buildings after a strike.

• ISPR blames India, ‘Fitna al Khwarij’ for attack
• 14 militants killed during military operation
NORTH WAZIRISTAN / PESHAWAR: Thirteen security personnel were martyred and 16 others injured while 14 militants were killed in two separate attacks in North Waziristan district on Saturday.
The deadliest attack occurred in the Khadi Khel area of Mir Ali tehsil around 7:15am, when an explosive-laden vehicle targ­eted a Mine-Resistant Ambush Prot­ected (MRAP) vehicle belonging to the security forces’ bomb disposal unit.
Sources said the blast claimed the lives of 13 soldiers and injured 10 others. Rescue operations were launched immediately, with the injured and the bodies shifted to Bannu district. The area was cordoned off following the incident.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) described the attack as a “cowardly act” planned and orchestrated by the “terrorist state of India” and executed by its proxy Fitna al Khwarij — a term the military uses for the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the ISPR, the suicide bomber attempted to ram a convoy, but was intercepted by the leading vehicle. In desperation, the vehicle was driven into one of the leading group’s vehicles, resulting in the casualties.
“Resultantly, 13 brave sons of soil embraced Shahadat. In this tragic and barbaric incident, three innocent civilians — two children and a woman — also got severely injured,” it said.
However, local sources said the number of civilian injuries was 14. They reported that an emergency had been declared at a hospital in Mir Ali, with all entry and exit points in the area closed.
They also said that the intensity of the blast caused the roofs of nearby houses to collapse, injuring several residents. A curfew had already been imposed in the area since 6am due to prevailing security concerns.
Following the attack, security forces launched a sanitisation operation. After an intense exchange of fire, 14 militants were killed. “The operations in the area would continue, and perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act will be brought to justice,” the ISPR added.
The martyred personnel were identified as Subedar Zahid Iqbal (aged 45) from Karak, Havildar Sohrab Khan (39) from Naseerabad, Havildar Mian Yousaf (41) from Buner, Naik Khitab Shah (34) from Lower Dir, Lance Naik Ismail (32) from Naseerabad, Sepoy Rohail (30) from Mirpur Khas, Sepoy Muhammad Ramzan (33) from Dera Ghazi Khan, Sepoy Nawab (30) from Quetta, Sepoy Zubair Ahmed (24) from Naseerabad, Sepoy Muhammad Sahki (31) from Dera Ghazi Khan, Sepoy Hashim Abbasi (20) from Abbottabad, Sepoy Muddasir Ejaz (25) from Layyah, and Sepoy Manzar Ali (23) from Mardan.
Security officials pointed fingers at Afghan nationals for the attacks on security forces. “Afghans have infiltrated there in hundreds and they are playing havoc with everything on earth,” a senior security official said.
The ISPR reiterated the military’s resolve to eliminate “Indian-sponsored terrorism” from the country, adding that “such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further reinforce our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs”.
Asood-al-Harb, a group linked to the banned Hafiz Gul Bahadur network — which has increased attacks in the region — claimed responsibility for the Mir Ali bombing.
Suicide attack
In a separate incident, a suicide attacker on a motorbike targeted a security convoy in the Saidgai area of Ghulam Khan tehsil near the Pak-Afghan border, leaving six security personnel injured.
Three of them were critically wounded and shifted to Bannu after initial treatment in Miramshah, sources said. No official statement from ISPR on the Ghulam Khan incident was issued at the time of reporting.
Cop martyred
Meanwhile, in another attack in Peshawar, a cop posted at Hashtnagri police station was martyred after unidentified motorcyclists opened fire on him in the Shahpur area on Saturday.
The officer, Constable Shahenshah, was en route to duty when he was attacked near Shah Ji Abad graveyard, the city police said in a statement.
The constable’s funeral was held at the Peshawar Police Headquarters and was attended by Inspector General of KP Police Zulfiqar Hameed, CCPO Peshawar Qasim Ali Khan, SSP Operations Masood Ahmad, senior military officials and the martyr’s family members.

KARACHI: At least 32 people have been killed in four provinces over the past two days as heavy rains triggered flash floods and damaged houses, according to rescue officials and disaster management authorities.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, two more casualties were reported on Saturday, a day after 17 people lost their lives in rain-related accidents.
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), one person each was killed in Charsadda and Shangla.
The NDMA reported that one person drowned in the river in Charsadda as continuous rainfall in the upper catchment area increased the flow downstream. His body was recovered near the Shahi Kaly Tranab by Rescue 1122 officials.
In Shangla, heavy rain triggered a landslide in Dhok area, killing a woman named Jan Ferroza.
The PDMA’s report stated that a total of 56 houses were damaged due to the rain, with 50 partially damaged and six completely collapsed.
Punjab
In Punjab, five people, including three minors, lost their lives and 20 were injured on Saturday.
Punjab Rescue spokesperson
Farooq Ahmad said most of the deaths occurred due to roof collapses. In Lahore, two minors died and four others inju­red when the roof of a house collapsed in Shahdra.
In Attock, a woman died after falling into a drain. In Faisalabad, four-year-old Umme Hania was killed and two injured when the roof of a house collapsed in Roshan Wali Jheel at Sumandari Road.
Four people were inju­red in similar accidents in Kothi Jhanda Singh and Peoples Colony.
In Gujranwala, a 55- year-old man was killed by a collapsed wooden roof.
Similar accidents in Alipur tehsil of Muzaffa­rgarh, Sheikhu­pura, Okara and Hafizabad left eight people injured.
In Hafizabad, one person was injured after being electrocuted.
All the injured were shifted to hospitals where they were said to be stable.
Balochistan
In Zhob, four members of a family, including three women and a girl, were swept away in a flash flood on Saturday.
Officials said the victims were a family coming from Quetta to Multan via the Quetta-Zhob-Islam­abad highway.
They stopped at a picnic point in Salyazah to take some rest when a huge flash flood suddenly hit the area due to heavy rainfall in the mountainous areas of Zhob and Sherani.
“Six members of the family were swept away in the flash flood,” said Naveed Alam, the Zhob assistant commissioner.
He added that Levies and rescue officials managed to save a woman and the driver, but four others drowned in the gushing water.
“The bodies of the victims were sent to their native area of Multan alo­ng with the injured woman and driver,” a senior Levies official told Dawn.
In Khost, Harnai, the local administration and rescue teams saved three persons who got stuck in a heavy flood.
Sindh
In Karachi, four people lost their lives in two separate accidents on Saturday.
According to officials, two of them were killed when a roof collapsed in Lyari while two others died of electrocution.
More rainfall
Heavy rainfall continued across the country on Saturday, with the prediction for similar weather over the next few days.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued alerts for glacial lake outburst floods (Glof), urban flooding, and flash floods across various regions of Pakis­tan over the next 24 to 48 hours.
In Balochistan, heavy rains inundated areas around Koh-i-Suleman, Zhob, Sherani, Barkhan, Qila Saifullah, Musakhel, Kohlu, Dera Bugti, Khuz­dar, Kalat, Qila Abdullah and Chaman.
In KP, the Met De­­par­tment has forecast rainfall in Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Bajaur, Shan­gla, Battagram, Manseh­­ra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Peshawar, Charsadda, Mardan, Buner, Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Kur­ram, Orakzai, Waziristan, Kohat, Karak and Hangu on Sunday.
In Punjab, the maximum rainfall on Saturday was recorded in Attock (102mm). The reading in Lahore was 62mm, Chak­wal 32mm, Bahawalpur 3mm, Narowal and Noorpur Thal 2mm and Kasur 1mm.
The first spell of monsoon rains in Punjab will continue till July 1, the PDMA said earlier this week.
Disaster alert
The NDMA has warned that intense rainfall and above-normal temperatures have increased the likelihood of Glof events in northern districts KP, including Upper Dir, Chitral, Swat, Reshun, Booni, Brep, Sardar Gol, Arkari, Dir Gol, Thalu 1 and 2 and Kumrat Valley.
A statement by the NDMA said these areas were at risk of Glof and sudden flash floods which could damage roads and infrastructure and disrupt public mobility.
Similarly, isolated rain and thunderstorms were expected in Chitral, Dir, Swat, Abbottabad, Mans­e­hra, Haripur, Karak, Ko­­hat, Kohistan, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, Now­shera, Malakand, Char­sad­da, Bannu, Buner, Haz­ara, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, and Waziristan.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, rapid glacier and snow melt combined with rain had escalated the risk of Glof in high-altitude valleys such as Badswat, Hinar­chi, Tursat Hundur, Darkut, and Ishkoman. Rainfall was also likely in Hunza, Skardu, Astore, Chilas, and adjoining regions.
The Glof events could increase the water level in rivers and trigger flash floods.
In Azad Jammu and Ka­­shmir, rainfall is expected in Neelum Valley, Bagh, Kotli, Rawalakot, Muzaf­farabad and Haveli.
In Punjab, widespread rain and thunderstorms were forecast in Murree, Galiyat, Rawalpindi, At­­tock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Mandi Baha­uddin, Gujranwala, Guj­rat, Hafizabad, Khushab, Sargodha, Narowal, Chi­n­iot, Toba Tek Singh, Fai­sa­labad, Lahore and Okara.
Islamabad will also witness the same weather conditions in the next 24 to 48 hours.
In Balochistan, rainfall is expected in Quetta, Zhob, Loralai, Ziarat, Kal­at, Musakhel, Khuzdar, Awaran, Barkhan, Jaffarabad, Kohlu, Sibi and Dera Bugti.
In Sindh, widespread rain and thunderstorms were likely in Jacobabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Nawab­shah, Khairpur, Kash­m­­ore, Hyderabad, Thar­par­kar, Mirpur Khas, Umer­kot, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, That­­ta, Badin and Karachi.
The NDMA has urged all provincial and district administrations to remain on high alert to deal with all emergencies.

Temperatures are set to rise to 37 degrees Celsius (99 Fahrenheit) in Rome, driving the Eternal City’s many tourists and pilgrims to the Vatican alike towards the Italian capital’s 2,500 public fountains for refreshment.
With residents of the southern French port city of Marseille expected to have to cope with temperatures flirting with 40C (104F), authorities in city ordered public swimming pools to be made free of charge to help residents beat the Mediterranean heat.
Two-thirds of Portugal will be on high alert on Sunday for extreme heat and forest fires, with 42C (108F) expected in the capital Lisbon, while visitors to — and protesters against — Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos’s Friday wedding in Venice likewise sweltered under the summer sun.
The heatwave is forecast to become even more intense on Sunday.
Spain, which has in past years seen a series of deadly summer blazes ravaging the Iberian Peninsula, is expecting peak temperatures in excess of 40C across most of the country.
According to the Spanish meteorological agency, temperatures may even register 42C in some areas, including the Guadalquivir, Guadiana, and Tagus regions.

At least 16 scientists and 10 senior commanders were among those mourned at the funeral, according to state media, including armed forces chief Major General Moham­mad Bagheri, Revolutionary Gua­r­­ds commander General Hossein Salami, and Guards Aerospace Force chief General Amir Ali Hajizadeh.
 
 

Their coffins were driven into Tehran’s Azadi Square adorned with their photos and national flags, as crowds waved flags and some reached out to touch the caskets and throw rose petals onto them. State-run Press TV showed an image of ballistic missiles on display. Mass prayers were later held in the square.
State TV said the funeral, dub­bed the “procession of the Martyrs of Power”, was held for a total of 60 people killed in the war, including four women and four children.

In attendance were President Masoud Pezeshkian and other senior figures, including Ali Sham­khani, who was seriously wounded during the conflict and is an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as Khamenei’s son Mojtaba.
There was no immediate statement from Khamenei, who has not appeared publicly since the conflict began. In past funerals, he led prayers over the coffins of senior commanders ahead of public ceremonies broadcast on state television.
Bagheri, Salami and Hajizadeh were killed on June 13, the first day of the war. Bagheri was being buried at the Behesht Zahra cemetery outside Tehran mid-afternoon on Saturday. Salami and Hajizadeh were due to be buried on Sunday.
According to Iranian health ministry figures, 610 people were killed on the Iranian side in the war before a ceasefire went into effect on Tuesday. More than 4,700 were injured.

At least 19 people have been killed and six others injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid heavy rains and the consequent flash floods and landslides, according to data from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Separately, KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah suspended Swat Additional Deputy Commissioner for relief Ihsan-ul-Haq, Babuzai Assistant Commissioner (AC) Nida Iqbal and Khwazakhela AC Muhammad Amir Khan.
Tarar expressed his grief over the disaster in the Swat River, stating, “Whenever there’s a natural disaster, it is the government’s responsibility to extend relief.”
Speaking about the KP government suspending the Swat deputy commissioner, Tarar said that KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur should have been suspended instead.
“The CM should have been suspended; a man who says ‘I cannot hand out tents, it’s not my job’,” Tarar stated.
“Did the people of KP give you the mandate to work from Adiala?” the minister asked, referring to how Gandapur approaches incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for instructions and approval. “The people did not give you a mandate to operate like this; they gave you a mandate to serve the public.”
Tarar then noted how, despite advanced technology, the PTI’s KP government has been unable to implement effective infrastructure and attempts to rescue people who get trapped atop steep rock formations using makeshift arrangements.

“The KP government helicopter, which is used by the CM and was used by Imran Khan, could not be flown to the rescue of women and children who were in grave danger,” he lamented.
“Coming to Islamabad, armed with weapons and attacking policemen is not bravery, nor is it any sort of feat,” Tarar said, referring to the PTI’s Islamabad rally. “Real bravery is implementing an effective rescue system during 12 years of government.”
He addressed Gandapur: “If you could not procure rescue equipment, you should have just kept quiet. If handing out tents is not your job, then what is? Is rescuing people and keeping them safe not your job?”
Tarar noted that the KP taxpayer is bearing the brunt of inaction by the provincial administration. The minister suggested that Gandapur “abolish the PDMA … and stop taking taxes if you are not able to save people”.
 


According to Rescue 1122 KP spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi, the bodies of 11 of the 13 people who were swept away in the flood have been recovered so far.
“Of the bodies, nine are from Sialkot, while two are from Mardan,” Faizi told Dawn.com. “Rescue 1122 is conducting a search operation to recover the remaining missing people.”
Following the flooding, the KP government later on Saturday announced measures to mitigate the problems caused by flooding in rivers across the province.
In a post on X, the provincial government announced that among the decisions taken were a complete ban on all types of mining activities and encroachments along the riverbed, as well as declaring the office of the assistant deputy commissioner (relief) a response centre.
Additionally, all rivers will be effectively monitored, rescue teams will be provided with life jackets, drones and other modern equipment and irrigation early warning systems will be re-evaluated.
 






Swat DC among another official removed from posts
The KP government suspended the Swat deputy commissioner today, while another official faced disciplinary action for their alleged negligence during the floods.
An order from the KP government’s Establishment Department, seen by Dawn.com, read that Shahzad Mehboob was removed from his post as DC and transferred to the establishment department.
The same order, issued by the KP chief secretary, stated that Saleem Jan would be awarded the post.
Meanwhile, the Tehsil Municipal Officer (TMO) for Khawazakhela, Zahidullah Khan, was also removed from his post, according to an order issued by the KP government’s local government, elections and rural development department.
According to the order, seen by Dawn.com, Khan was removed from his post for “failure in delivery of municipal services and performance of assign lawful duties during emergency/floods situation”.
Under the powers conferred under the Local Councils PUGF (E&D) Rules, 1980, read with Local Council Board (Constitution and Conduct of Business) Rules, 1988, the chairman of the Local Council Board suspended Khan on administrative grounds with Immediate effect.</p><small>2025-06-28 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2823021581d25e6.jpg?r=231616' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920819/g7-agrees-to-avoid-higher-taxes-for-us-companies' target='_blank'><strong>G7 agrees to avoid higher taxes for US companies</strong></a><br><p>The United States and the Group of Seven nations have agreed to support a proposal that would exempt US companies from some components of an existing global agreement, the G7 said in a statement on Saturday.
The group has created a “side-by-side” system in response to the US administration agreeing to scrap the Section 899 retaliatory tax proposal from President Donald Trump’s tax and spending bill, it said in a statement from Canada, the head of the rolling G7 presidency.
The G7 said the plan recognises existing US minimum tax laws and aims to bring more stability to the international tax system.
G7 officials said that they look forward to discussing a solution that is “acceptable and implementable to all”.
In January, through an executive order, Trump declared that the global corporate minimum tax deal was not applicable in the US, effectively pulling out of the landmark 2021 arrangement negotiated by the Biden administration with nearly 140 countries.
He had also vowed to impose a retaliatory tax against countries that impose taxes on US firms under the 2021 global tax agreement.
This tax was considered detrimental to many foreign companies operating in the US.</p><small>2025-06-28 18:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611436-all-abettors-perpetrators-of-terrorism-to-be-brought-to-justice-vows-coas-munir' target='_blank'><strong>All abettors, perpetrators of terrorism to be brought to justice, vows COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>

The remarks followed recent tensions between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
Pakistan had strongly denied the allegations and called for a neutral probe. As the situation turned into a military confrontation between the nuclear powers, it took American intervention for both sides to agree to a ceasefire.
Speaking at the Pakistan Naval Academy in Karachi, COAS Munir said that Pakistan will protect its sovereignty and national interests decisively and without hesitation, state media PTV reported.
The report quoted the army chief as saying, “In recent years, India has twice undertaken acts of unprovoked aggression against Pakistan, which were met with our resolute response.”
“Despite grave provocations, Pakistan acted with restraint and maturity, and demonstrated its commitment to regional peace and stability, leading to its role as a net regional stabiliser,” he added.
 






He further said that India was “deliberately creating tension in the region” when Pakistan was close to eliminating terrorism, PTV said on X.
COAS Munir also highlighted the Kashmir issue, saying, “At such a time, we must remember the sacrifices of our Kashmiri brothers who are struggling against India’s illegal occupation.”
“Pakistan is a strong advocate for a just resolution of the Kashmir issue in accordance with United Nations resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people,” he added.
He called for a “just and peaceful resolution” to the Kashmir issue for lasting peace in the region.
Separately, Field Marshal Munir visited the Corps Headquarters in Peshawar, where he was briefed on the prevailing security situation and ongoing counter-terrorism operations, according to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The statement said, “During the visit, the field marshal also attended the funeral of martyrs of the incident at Bannu Garrison and visited the injured at Bannu Combined Military Hospital.”
“COAS (Munir) paid rich tribute to the unwavering courage and resilience of Pakistan’s security forces, who continue to confront and neutralise the Indian-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij with exemplary valour.”
 






The ISPR further said that the army chief vowed to bring “all facilitators, abettors, and perpetrators of terrorism” to justice, assuring “swift and decisive retribution” against those who undermine the country’s stability.
“The field marshal also emphasised the critical need for institutional capacity enhancement of civilian law enforcement agencies, particularly the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police,” the statement said.
“He urged relevant government stakeholders to prioritise these efforts, while reaffirming the Army’s continued support in building and augmenting the capabilities of law enforcement institutions.”
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
Earlier today, at least 13 security personnel were martyred in a suicide bombing in KP’s North Waziristan district, carried out by Indian proxy terrorists.
The military has said India was using its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, with ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry detailing “irr­e­futable evidence” of an Ind­ian military personnel’s involvement.</p><small>2025-06-28 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/28215800489963b.jpg?r=220008' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920818/norris-secures-pole-at-austrian-gp-with-stunning-last-lap-to-end-verstappen-dominance' target='_blank'><strong>Norris secures pole at Austrian GP with stunning last lap to end Verstappen dominance</strong></a><br><p>Lando Norris delivered a superb final flying lap in his McLaren on Saturday to end Max Verstappen’s run of domination in qualifying at the Red Bull Ring by claiming pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix.
The 25-year-old Briton clocked an outstanding lap in one minute and 3.971 seconds to outpace nearest rival Charles Leclerc of Ferrari by 0.521 seconds, with McLaren team-mate and championship leader Oscar Piastri third.
Norris, who is 22 points behind Piastri in the drivers’ title race, erased any hangover from his collision with Piastri in Canada two weeks ago with a thrilling demonstration of his speed and talent.
“It was a good lap, that’s for sure,” said Norris. “I guess that just little bit by little bit, I was able to get more time. Q1 was good, but I knew there were a few places I could get more time and I did what I planned to do.”
Verstappen had taken pole position at the Red Bull-owned circuit in the Styrian Alps for the last five F1 races before Norris succeeded and seized his first pole in Austria, his third of the season and 12th of his career.
Team-mate Piastri was disappointed and frustrated.
“I had [Pierre] Gasly spin at the first corner so I didn’t even open my second lap. Lando’s been very quick all weekend so it would have been a tough challenge, but we had the pace to be on the front row,” he said.
“We can still have a good race from there and we are not here to come home third.”
Verstappen’s last lap was stymied by a yellow flag waved when Gasly spun in his Alpine, leaving him, like Piastri, unable to clock a flying lap time. He finished seventh.
Leclerc said: “I’m very pleased. It’s been a long time since we started on the front row and it’s been a difficult season overall, but the team has kept pushing.
“We brought some new parts this weekend which for sure made a difference. We know we have a better car in the race than in qualifying so I hope we can put more pressure on the McLarens.”
Leclerc’s Ferrari team-mate and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton was an encouraging fourth ahead of Mercedes’ George Russell, Liam Lawson of Racing Bulls, four-time champion Verstappen of Red Bull and Gabriel Bortoleto of Sauber.
Italian rookie Kimi Antonelli was ninth in the second Mercedes and Gasly 10th.
‘Worse than before’
The session began in hot conditions with temperatures of 32° Celsius (air) and 48°C (track), indicating hard work for tyres.
After a frantic finale, in which Russell recovered from the drop zone to 11th, it was Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll, Esteban Ocon of Haas, Red Bull’s Yuki Tsunoda, Carlos Sainz in the second Williams and Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg who were eliminated.
McLaren, led by Norris, set the pace.
The entire field was separated by less than a second with the Red Bulls of Verstappen and Tsunoda, sixth and 18th, only 0.25 seconds apart. It was Sainz’s third consecutive Q1 exit.
The track temperature touched 50 at the start of Q2 with Ferrari leading the way on used softs as Norris established his supremacy again before a trackside grass fire prompted a red flag stoppage, Hamilton having run wide there at turn 10.
Verstappen was unhappy with his car’s reaction to the heat. “No grip, it’s worse than before,” he reported. “I don’t know what to say!”
After six minutes, the action resumed with only four to go as Norris and Piastri set the pace ahead of Leclerc while two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin, Williams’ Alex Albon, Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar, Franco Colapinto of Alpine and Oliver Bearman of Haas missed out.
All of this left Bortoleto celebrating his first top ten qualification in fifth for the improving Sauber outfit, while Verstappen complained he was impeded by a Ferrari in a way that was “a bit naughty and super unnecessary”.
As Q3 began, Russell almost hit a Ferrari when he was released into their path, narrowly avoiding a collision.
On the first runs, Norris was fastest again, ahead of Leclerc with Piastri third and Hamilton fourth, the Ferraris enjoying the heat as Mercedes wilted before Norris stormed to pole.</p><small>2025-06-28 17:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611422-indian-sponsored-terrorists-martyr-13-troops-in-north-waziristan-convoy-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Indian-sponsored terrorists martyr 13 troops in North Waziristan convoy attack</strong></a><br><p>

Karachi has been experiencing moderate to heavy rainfall since Thursday night, bringing on reprieve from the scorching summer heat. Monsoon rains continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities. Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September every year.
According to an NDMA alert on X, there is a risk of urban flooding within the next 48 hours in the districts of Sujawal, Thatta, Badin, Karachi, Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas.
The authority also issued an urban flood warning for “the low-lying areas of Pothohar/northeast Punjab”, including Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot and Lahore.
 






Meanwhile, two people died in rain-related incidents in Karachi, according to police, hospital and rescue officials.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com, a 30-year-old man was fatally electrocuted in New Karachi and his body was transported to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
“The man was electrocuted in his home,” New Karachi Station House Officer Mohammed Saud told Dawn.com.
Separately, a 17-year-old boy was fatally electrocuted near Murtaza Chaurangi in Bilal Colony, according to an Edhi Foundation spokesperson.
Korangi Industrial Area SHO Mohammed Ali Niazi said no one approached the police for legal proceedings regarding the teenager.
Earlier, the Met Office forecast intermittent showers in Karachi till tomorrow as the city continues to receive rain for a third consecutive day on Saturday.

It advised farmers to manage their activities in light of the weather forecast.
The Met Office directed concerned authorities to remain alert and take all necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation.
Separately, an advisory issued by the traffic police advised people to avoid unnecessary travel, and to not take sudden brakes while on the road, as the roads may become slippery.
The advisory further asked commuters to maintain a low speed when driving, keeping a distance from the next vehicle and urged motorcyclists to use the left side of the road only.
On Friday, two young men died from electrocution in Karachi’s SITE and Surjani Town.

The members raised slogans and protested during Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s speech in the assembly yesterday, when she responded to PTI leadership’s comments that ex-premier Nawaz Sharif — also an MNA — had been removed from the political arena.
According to an order issued by Malik on Friday, the suspended MPAs “became disorderly, beyond all parliamentary reasoning and practices”, including tearing the agenda papers and hurling torn pieces towards the treasury benches as well as using “offensive, abusive, and unparliamentary language and slogans”.
The order was issued under Rule 210 of the Punjab Assembly Rules of Procedure 1997 (power to order withdrawal or suspension of member) and stated that the 26 MPAs violated four provisions of Rule 223.
These were (c) (shall not interrupt any member while speaking by disorderly expression or noises or in any other disorderly manner), (f) (shall maintain silence when not speaking in the assembly), (h) (shall not chant slogans, display banners or placards, throw and tear table documents and reports, etc), and (i) (shall not indulge in rowdy behaviour).
 






The MPAs also allegedly manhandled the treasury members, blocking their way as they tried to approach the treasury benches with “threatening gestures”.
Malik, in his order, said he repeatedly tried to call the assembly to order, but the opposition “declined to act in accordance with the Rules and persisted with misconduct and disorder and kept challenging my orders and authority”.
The speaker concluded that the opposition MPAs had “disregarded [his] authority as speaker […] consistently and willfully obstructing the business of the assembly”.
Out of the 26 MPAs suspended, 17 were listed as belonging to the Sunni Ittehad Council, which PTI-affiliated candidates joined last year after their party was deprived of its election symbol. At least eight others, however, were stated as PTI MPAs.

10 MPAs fined for ‘vandalism’
Separately, the Punjab Assembly secretary general has also fined 10 MPAs Rs203,550 each for allegedly damaging public property during the June 16 session, according to a letter issued today.
According to Malik, opposition members had tried to interrupt the budget speech by Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman. He claimed SIC’s Hassan Malik had hit the minister with the budget book repeatedly, causing the Rehman to stop his address.
The letter by Chaudhry Amer Habib to the 10 lawmakers stated that the fine was being imposed on account of damages, as eight microphones were broken after the named individuals climbed upon the desks. It also cited a video recording of the incident.
The statement added that if the payment was not made within seven days, action would be taken under the Punjab Government Dues Recovery Ordinance 1962.
 
 

The 10 MPAs included six who have been suspended over yesterday’s session — SIC’s Tanveer Aslam, Imtiaz Mahmood and Riffat, along with PTI’s Nisar, Ismael and Aurangzaib.
Others were Shahbaz Ahmed, PTI’s Chaudhry Javed Kausar and Mohammad Ahsan Ali, and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen’s Asad Abbas.
The MPAs, the letter said, had violated Rule 223 (r), which states that a lawmaker “shall not break or harm any furniture, equipment or device installed in the chamber”.
Malik directed the recovery of the damage under Rule 235 (residuary powers of the speaker.</p><small>2025-06-28 14:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611411-ptis-gohar-urges-cjp-to-ensure-justice-after-reserved-seats-verdict' target='_blank'><strong>PTI's Gohar urges CJP to ensure justice after reserved seats verdict</strong></a><br><p>
