Instead of meaningfully reassessing their strategies, these institutions appear to be resorting to increasingly coercive and defensive responses. While coercion has its place, especially when integrated with a broader political strategy, an overemphasis on primitive actions risks undermining hard-won security gains and is counterproductive.
Before unpacking this argument further, it is worth examining how Pakistan’s security apparatus is currently attempting to secure two key capitals: Islamabad, the federal seat of power, and Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan, a province grappling simultaneously with a protracted insurgency and the persistent threat of Islamist militancy.
The key issue is not to contrast London and Paris as Charles Dickens did, but to analyse how two Pakistani cities, despite receiving similar financial and human resources for security, face threats on different scales, one significantly more secure, the other less so. The state expends large resources on intelligence, deployments, and checkpoints. Still, terrorists exploit weaknesses: attacks occur less often in Islamabad and far more frequently in Quetta. The residents of both cities remain dissatisfied with the security institutions’ counterterrorism strategies, as these measures directly disrupt their daily routines and negatively impact local businesses. The security institutions rarely take public grievances into account when developing their preventive strategies.
 
 

Recent statistics on terrorist incidents in Islamabad and Quetta underscore the pressing need for security agencies to rethink and modernise their preventive measures. In Islamabad, there have been six terrorist attacks since January 2021, resulting in 21 fatalities. Notably, the most recent attack on Nov 11, which struck the district courts and led to 12 deaths, was the deadliest; earlier attacks were comparatively smaller, occurring on the city’s outskirts and primarily targeting police officers, with most incidents linked to the TTP.

Public frustration and insecurity are as lethal as the threat of terrorism itself.

In contrast, Quetta faced 152 terrorist attacks during the same period, causing 264 fatalities. The targets in Quetta were far more diverse: civilians, government officials, security forces, tribal elders, religious communities and their leaders, and political workers. The perpetrators were equally varied, from nationalist insurgent groups such as the Baloch Republican Guards, BLA, BLF, and BRAS (an alliance of BLA, BLF, and BRG), to Islamist militant and sectarian organisations including IS-K/ISPP, LeJ, TTP and UBA. This pattern has remained persistent. Since January alone, Quetta has suffered 32 attacks, causing 32 deaths, with the same range of actors and targets.
The data clearly shows that militant groups, their targets, and their operational tactics have evolved over the years. This shift reflects the ineffectiveness of current counterterrorism strategies, both operational and preventive, which rely heavily on security checkpoints, safe city surveillance systems, and internet jamming. In Islamabad, the latest attack is a stark reminder that terrorist groups have breached the defensive wall constructed by law-enforcement agencies.
The level of insecurity in Quetta is naturally very high, but residents of the federal capital are increasingly frustrated for different reasons: the expanding layers of security, the growing number of checkpoints, and hours-long road blockages due to the movement protocols for cricket teams, foreign dignitaries, and government officials. The city often comes to a standstill, reflecting nervousness and poor management despite the availability of substantial state resources. Yet the government appears reluctant to revisit or rethink its security planning.
When security agencies become overly obsessed with rigid protocols, they inadvertently give an advantage to terrorists who adapt their tactics, focusing on breaching these measures. Data from the two cities illustrates this pattern.
When terrorists gain a sense of advantage, or in some cases of victory, it weakens the state’s coercive strategies. These strategies include pressuring states that provide hideouts or support to militants, as well as the political approach of engagement or non-engagement with such actors. The state’s counter-propaganda strategies also lose credibility when the public sees a very different reality unfolding on the streets.
Pakistan has been pressuring the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to cease its support for terrorist networks, particularly the TTP. Just the other day, the Foreign Office stated that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depends on Kabul ending cross-border terrorism, and even linked the future of key regional energy projects to the Taliban halting support for militant groups. This was in response to the Afghan deputy prime minister for economic affairs Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar’s recent press conference, in which he advised Afghan traders to stop exporting goods through Pakistan. Clearly, this approach is not working, as the adversaries see the level of frustration when dealing with them.
Law-enforcement agencies must enhance their use of human, financial, technical and cyber resources, and strategically adapt operations. Reliance on visible deterrence, such as check posts and major street blockades, disrupts public life, yet efficacy would not decrease with fewer check posts if technology were used more efficiently. As terrorists continually attempt to breach both overt and covert security measures, agencies must broaden their efforts across all domains.
Blocking highways and major routes for the movement of foreign and local VIPs does not reduce risks. In many cases, it increases them and fuels public panic and frustration. This frustration is particularly pronounced in Islamabad, while insecurity remains high in Quetta. Again, the data indicates that the state needs a comprehensive review of its countering strategies, with coherence across political, operational and preventive dimensions.
Public frustration and insecurity are as lethal as the threat of terrorism itself, yet these human-centred dimensions find little space in the state’s counterterrorism thinking. State institutions often expect citizens to bear the burden of sacrifices required to secure cities, while ordinary people ob­­serve a contrasting reality: state functionaries al­­locate disproportionate resources to securing their own areas, creating red zones, deploying heavy contingents, and disrupting daily life whenever the power elites move through public spaces.

Most seats fell vacant following the disqualification of PTI lawmakers convicted for their alleged involvement in the May 9, 2023, violent riots after the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan.
The six National Assembly constituencies where polling is taking place includeNA-18 (Haripur), NA-96 (Faisalabad), NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-129 (Lahore), NA-143 (Sahiwal) and NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan).
The seven Punjab Assembly constituencies where by-polls are being held are PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), PP-98 (Faisalabad), PP-115 (Faisalabad), PP-116 (Faisalabad), PP-203 (Sahiwal) and PP-269 (Muzaffargarh).
Security personnel deployed
In Punjab, as the by-elections begin, more than 20,000 police personnel have been deployed for security in the province’s national and provincial constituencies.
Meanwhile, according to the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) code of conduct for the armed forces, troops will be deployed outside polling stations declared “most sensitive” and will remain in quick-response mode at the remaining stations as third-tier responders.
The personnel have been directed to perform duties strictly in accordance with Article 245 of the Constitution, the law and the mandate assigned to the armed forces to assist the election regulator.
While stationed outside selected polling stations, they have been instructed to focus solely on ensuring a secure environment, complying with all relevant laws, and maintaining public confidence by safeguarding voters and preserving law and order throughout the polling process.
They have been barred from preventing any eligible voter from entering a polling station, except in cases involving weapons, explosives, prohibited items or attempts to incite violence or threaten national security.
National Assembly
The by-elections are being contested on six seats of the National Assembly, including that of PTI NA opposition leader Omar Ayub on NA-18 in Haripur, where his wife, Shehrnaz Omar Ayub, is now contesting the seat and will face Babar Nawaz. She is contesting an election for the first time.
In NA-96, the PML-N has fielded Muhammad Bilal Badar Chaudhry, brother of Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry.
Meanwhile, in NA-104, the PML-N has nominated Daniyal Ahmed, who is contesting against three independent candidates. Mr Ahmed previously contested the elections and lost to Sahibzada Hamid Raza, who secured 132,655 votes. Mr Ahmed is the son of Raja Riaz, the former leader of the opposition in the National Assembly.
In NA-129, the seat fell vacant following the death of former Punjab governor and PTI stalwart Mian Muhammad Azhar. His grandson Chaudhry Arsalan is now contesting the by-poll, while the PML-N has fielded Hafiz Mian Muhammad Noman.
For NA-143, PML-N has fielded Muhammad Tufail Jutt against independent candidate Zarrar Akbar Choudhary.
In NA-185, PPP’s Dost Muhammad Khosa and the PML-N’s Mehmood Qadir Khan Laghari are among the key candidates.
Punjab Assembly
In Punjab, candidates are set to contest over seven constituencies.
From PP-73, the PML-N has fielded Mian Sultan Ali Ranjha as its candidate.
In PP-98, the party has nominated Azad Ali Tabbasum, who is contesting against nine independent candidates. The party had not nominated any candidate in this constituency in the 2024 elections, backing instead the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) candidate Muhammad Ajmal, who was runner-up to PTI-backed Junaid Afzal Sahi.
In PP-115, the ruling party’s candidate Muhammad Tahir Pervez is facing three independents and an Awami Justice Party Pakistan (AJPP) candidate. Mr Pervez also contested the 2024 polls and remained runner-up to PTI-backed Shahid Javed.
In PP-116, the PML-N has nominated Ahmed Shaharyar, the son-in-law of Senator Rana Sanaullah. He is contesting against five independents and a Pakistan Nazriyati Party (PNP) candidate. In the 2024 polls, Mr Shaharyar was runner-up with 52,517 votes.
In PP-203, the PML-N’s Muhammad Hanif Jutt, brother of Muhammad Tufail Jutt, is contesting against independent candidate Falak Sher Dogar.</p><small>2025-11-23 03:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956822/legal-fight' target='_blank'><strong>Legal fight</strong></a><br><p>ONE day, the humbling of the present-day judiciary may be remembered as a tragedy. For now, it resembles a spectacle.
Earlier this week, four judges of the Islamabad High Court approached the Supreme Court, hoping to challenge the recently enacted 27th Amendment. Instead of the senior judges being given an audience, they were told to take their issues to the Federal Constitutional Court. In other words, the petitioners were told to seek justice from an institution whose very creation they were there to challenge.
It was a sobering moment. The four judges had petitioned the Supreme Court after months of voicing their apprehensions regarding the “incremental but systematic dismantling” of judicial independence, a process which began with the passage of the 26th Amendment and ended in the most recent constitutional changes. Instead, they appeared to find the Supreme Court more than deferential to an institution that had subverted its authority.
One must highlight again that these were not ordinary petitioners. All four are sitting judges — recognised members of the country’s superior judiciary. All four would seem to strongly believe that the new amendment is severely violative of several established articles of the Constitution. The objections they raised in their petition regarding the appointment of the new court, the transfer of judges on executive whim, and the decimation of judicial independence through institutional capture and the installation of ‘like-minded’ judges are questions that have also been raised by legal experts, international observers, as well as concerned members of the public. For them to be brushed aside as brusquely as parliament had the amendment enacted merely reinforces the perception that a future has been chosen for the judiciary, and that no debate or legal cross-examination of the ‘why’ and ‘what for’ will be able to change it.
The legal fight has now become even more complicated. On Saturday, the four judges, joined by one more, challenged the transfer from the Supreme Court to the FCC of an intra-court appeal against a Constitutional Bench judgement deeming the transfer of judges from other high courts to the IHC ‘constitutional’. They have now told the FCC directly that they consider the 27th Amendment ‘unconstitutional’ and reminded it that the amendment is under challenge.
Now, those in the judiciary who have agreed with the regime on the 27th Amendment may choose to stick to their guns. And they are free to do so. But they should satisfy the petitioners, and all those who will be following this case, that any decision to uphold the amendment rests on sound legal reasoning and not another ‘doctrine’. This case must be heard in detail, and the proceedings should ideally be televised for public consumption. This is an opportunity for the FCC to establish its credentials. It must avail it.

This shifting landscape framed the session ‘Truth, Trust, and Tenacity: The New Media Paradigm,’ held on Saturday, which brought together journalists Fazil Jamili, Azhar Abbas, Amber Rahim Shamsi and Azaz Syed under the moderation of Nadia Naqi.
The discussion was part of the Adab Festival, which returned to Karachi for its 10th edition at Habitt City from November 22 to 23.
Opening the discussion, Naqi noted the challenges journalists face in working and surviving in the current media environment.
“Speaking the truth comes with challenges; often we’ve seen journalists being intimidated, and the controlled environment makes it difficult to speak the truth,” she said. “With truth, of course, comes trust. Is there public trust in the media? That’s the big question; it’s a challenge, actually.”
Naqi asked how difficult it had become for traditional media outlets to remain relevant and compete in the new media paradigm, where social media, content creators, YouTubers, and digital platforms held huge influence.
Abbas, currently Managing Editor at Geo TV Network, said the pervasive noise made it much harder to speak the truth. He opined, without naming anyone responsible, that over the past 15 years, “social engineering” had created clouds of lies, misinformation, and doubt aimed at discrediting the political class, journalists, and human rights activists.
“Beyond mainstream media, digital and social media are also used to spread misinformation. It takes a long time for a journalist, politician, or human rights activist to build trust, but that trust can be destroyed in a minute by social media propaganda,” he added.
“We ourselves question whether we are still relevant,” Abbas said, adding that legacy media still held its audience in terms of numbers.
Naqi emphasised that censorship goes beyond shutting down news outlets or intimidating journalists, affecting their families as well. She noted that issues which cannot be raised on television are often addressed through digital platforms.
Shamsi, Pakistan Editor at Nukta, responded that even though digital media avoids censorship faced by traditional outlets, it comes with its own challenges.
“We exist in a time where there’s never been so much access to information,” she said. According to her, digital platforms prioritise clicks and views and appeal to the reactive, emotional side of the brain rather than encouraging rational thought. “You will prefer somebody who will agree with your views and opinions. That will confirm your bias.”
Another limitation, Shamsi said, came from the platforms themselves, including YouTube, Google, Meta, and X. Political and commercial interests shaped content distribution, where platforms profited from outrage, favouring content with sensational headlines and thumbnails.
“If you use keywords like ‘genocide’, ‘rape’, ‘murder’, or ‘Palestine’ in your [search engine optimisation], then you might get shadowbanned. Because it’s not your own platform, distribution remains an issue even in digital media,” she said.
Amid Israel’s onslaught in Gaza, social media platforms have reportedly been accused of curtailing the reach of pro-Palestine or Israel-critical content, though the companies deny it.
“Globally, journalism is struggling, and I don’t think truth is important anymore,” Shamsi added.
Moderator Naqi indicated that journalists today often felt as though they were “competing with creators on TikTok and YouTube, despite their core responsibility being to report news and seek the truth”. She questioned whether the profession itself was partly to blame, emphasising that social media had deepened divisions within journalism, including within press bodies.
Jamili, President of the Karachi Press Club (KPC), said the line between information and journalism had become increasingly blurred, largely because of social media. “Journalists themselves are confused, and even mainstream media gets caught up when something comes up on social media,” he said.
“There’s no comparison between speed and accuracy. You need time for the truth; only then is there trust. These are things we’ve abandoned over time,” he lamented.
Jamili said censorship had evolved, with self-censorship, now the most prevalent form. Editors and reporters, he added, often wrote with fear.
It is important to note that Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan 158 out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index.
He argued that algorithms effectively replaced the editor’s role. “Earlier, editors decided which stories mattered, assessed their quality and relevance, and determined how they should be published. Now the algorithm dictates the priorities, and we’ve become captive to it.”
Speaking about KPC, he said that although it had around 1,800 active members, more than half were unemployed. With delayed wages and salary backlogs stretching three to four months, he asked, “If a journalist is hungry, how can you expect them to be honest?”
Syed, also associated with Geo TV Network, disregarded using the word “truth,” and argued that it was subjective, with each religious or political group holding its own version. “My job is to collect facts,” he said, emphasising instead the need for journalists to distinguish between facts, assumptions, and opinions.
On the role of editors, Naqi noted they were once considered “untouchable”, but said the editors themselves no longer pushed back the way they used to. Jamili added that the practice of editorial writing had effectively disappeared. He mentioned that one of Pakistan’s largest-circilated Urdu newspaper no longer published editorials, yet “no one seems to care”.
In response to a question about controversial media ownership and the influence of land developers in Pakistan, the journalists stressed that such challenges “plagued the industry globally.”</p><small>2025-11-23 03:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956790/why-do-companies-delist-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Why do companies delist in Pakistan?</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Shield’s baby feeders are a common household essential for many families. Considering Pakistan’s high population growth rate, one might expect the business to be thriving. However, recently, Shield Corporation has decided to delist, joining the ranks of companies like Gillette and Philip Morris.
In the 1980s, Pakistan offered a 5 per cent tax advantage to firms that listed on the stock exchange, explains Ali Farid Khwaja, CEO of Oxford Frontier Capital and Co-founder and Chairman of KTrade. That incentive drew dozens of family-owned textile mills and others to the PSX.
That incentive no longer exists. Once the tax break went away, many firms had little interest in public shareholders. They quietly bought back shares, shrank the free float, and continued operating like private family businesses. This explains why many listed companies today have negligible trading volumes.
Some delist simply because public ownership is insignificant. Philip Morris fits partly into this category: its free float was 5pc, small enough to make the listing meaningless while still inviting regulatory scrutiny.
“When you’re listed, you become transparent. If you delist, these requirements go away,” says Asad Ali Shah, former managing partner of Deloitte. Being listed increases visibility, reporting obligations, and tax scrutiny. It also limits the ability to operate in the “grey zones” common in Pakistan’s largely undocumented economy and can make competition harder when non-listed peers are less constrained.
Multinationals often prefer to book profits in lower-tax jurisdictions. Listing complicates this because shareholders can question intercompany transactions, import pricing, margins, and royalties. Pakistan’s regulatory apparatus does not meaningfully oversee transfer pricing. “Not a single transfer pricing case has been pursued to conclusion,” notes Mr Shah. Through transfer pricing, profits can be kept in low-tax jurisdictions while the local listed entity shows thin margins or even losses, he explains. Those losses can then be carried forward for years as tax shields. Once listed, all this becomes visible.
Listing also helps families manage inheritance across generations. “For large family groups with multiple sub-families, a listed structure makes it easier to distribute wealth while keeping the business intact,” notes Mr Khwaja.
 
 

Sayyid Babar Ali writes about this in his autobiography, Mr Khwaja points out. In family-driven businesses, listing provides liquidity, inheritance planning, and the ability to monetise a small portion of shares without giving up control.
Being part of a family business holding shares in a listed company can also generate windfalls. Even selling a tiny fraction of shares at a high price brings cash, and when prices fall, you can buy back. Notices on the PSX often show independent directors, family members, mothers, sisters, and aunts selling small percentages and buying them back. Some families also strategically let prices fall and rise again to maximise returns.
Delisting is expensive. Public shareholders must be bought out at a premium, sometimes many multiples of the share price. Pak Suzuki Motors’ stock illustrates this: from around Rs100 before its delisting notice in April 2023, it shot to Rs900 on January 11 2025. Eventually, Suzuki Japan set a minimum share price at Rs406, but the PSX ultimately fixed the buyback at Rs609. Similarly, when Gillette’s delisting news broke, the stock climbed from Rs212 on October 1 to Rs605 by October 16, before settling at Rs340 by last Friday’s close.
M. Farid Alam of AKD Securities adds that delisting also affects price discovery and competitive pressures. In Pakistan, most listed companies are tightly held, with sponsors owning 90-95 per cent of shares, unlike global markets where 10-20pc is often sufficient.If tax rates remain high, more large companies may eventually consider leaving the stock market. Yet delisting is complex and costly, so many companies remain listed by default, even if it is no longer their preference.

In a joint statement, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) affirmed that it was their two-decade-old demand that the FCC should be established with equal representation of the provinces for hearing constitutional and political matters, so that general public cases could be decided by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in a timely manner.
The statement was jointly issued by PBC Vice Chairman Chaudhry Tahir Nasrullah Warriach and SCBA President Haroonur Rashid.
 
 

According to the statement, the FCC will strengthen the federation. It said the premier bodies were watching carefully the entire process, including the appointment of judges, and would express their concerns and grievances, when needed, through decisions and resolutions of the general houses of both bodies. The statement said that the PBC and the SCBA always stood for upholding the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, the supremacy of institutions, and adherence to the Constitution.
The statement also expressed regret over certain political factions within the legal community aimed at creating chaos and division among lawyers, just to achieve their ulterior political motives and promote their political agenda. They often issue statements aimed at sabotaging the democratic system of the country, it claimed.
“We strongly reject and condemn such statements issued by the non-elected people and assure that their futile exercise will soon be rendered ineffective,” the statement said.
“We, the elected representatives, want to make it explicitly clear that the PBC and SCBA, being apex bodies of the legal fraternity, were only supposed to issue statements on behalf of the ins­titutions on national issues,” it stressed.

PM Shehbaz receives a presentation on initiatives to improve Pakistan Railways.—APP

• ADB approves $10m for railway improvement project
• PM for adopting public-private partnership for rail land
ISLAMABAD: With the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approving $10 million in assistance for preparing the Railway Improve­ment Project, Pakistan Railways is moving to outsource 11 more trains, a step expected to generate an additional Rs8.5bn for the country’s largest state-owned rail operator.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a meeting on Pakistan Railways on Saturday, where he was informed that tenders had been floated for outsourcing the eleven passenger trains to the private sector. Pakistan Railways has already outsourced four trains.
 
 

The meeting was also informed that railway hospitals in Lahore, Karachi, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta and Sukkur were being outsourced, while the outsourcing of railway schools, colleges and rest houses was already underway. Similarly, dry ports in Islamabad, Lahore and Azakhail were also being handed over to private operators.
It was also noted that 40 luggage and brake vans had been outsourced, which are expected to bring in an additional Rs820m. The outsourcing process for two cargo express trains was in progress and is projected to generate Rs6.3bn in additional revenue.
Addressing the meeting, the premier stressed that a public-private partnership model shou­­ld be adopted when managing Pak­istan Railways’ land and properties.
 
 

He said that the railway system serves as the backbone of a country’s economy and directed that top-tier legal and economic experts be engaged, especially for projects related to regional connectivity and cross-border rail links.
He appreciated the ongoing measures for the revival of the railway system and commended Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and his team.
The meeting was infor­med that the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul train service would resume soon, and preliminary work on the Kazakhstan-Uzbekistan-Afghan­istan-Pakistan rail corridor was underway.
A plan was being developed for upgrading the Karachi–Kotri section of Main Line-1 and Main Line-3.
The premier was informed that so far, 155 railway stations have been equipped with solar power. Seven digital portals under the ‘Rabta’ initiative are operational, 56 trains have been shifted onto the new system, and 54 stations have been digitised.
Free Wi-Fi service has been provided at the Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Faisalabad stations.
An online freight booking system has been launched while a pilot digital weighing bridge has been installed at Karachi City Railway Station.
To enhance security, 148 AI-powered surveillance cameras have been installed, and ATM machines are being set up at railway stations.
Cleanliness services have also been outsourced.

ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill heard the bail petition during a hearing held at Kot Lakhpat jail.
Barrister Taimur Malik argued on behalf of the petitioner and referred to the rule of consistency applied to other accused people, including PTI founder Imran Khan, former senator Ejaz Chaudhry and former governor Umar Sarfraz Cheema by the courts granting bail to them in similar cases.
The judge approved the bail for Dr Rashid in the case, subject to furnishing surety bonds worth Rs100,000.
However, he adjourned the hearing of the PTI leader’s bail petitions in three other cases till Nov 25.
In a statement, Barrister Malik said his client should be granted bail in the remaining cases as well on the same legal principle.
He added that later if the high court accepted her suspension applications, she could be released pending the outcome of her appeals against the convictions. The PTI Punjab president has already been convicted in four other May 9 cases including an attack on the Shadman police station.
Statements recorded
An anti-terrorism court also recorded the statements of 10 police personnel in a case related to violence at GOR-I neighbourhood during the May 9 riots.
The prosecution presented the police officials as its witnesses. A prosecutor told the court that 57 witnesses had testified in the case so far. The court summoned more prosecution witnesses on Nov 25. The Race Course police had registered the case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking the main gate of GOR-I Club Chowk and damaging property.

• Leaders warn of fracture in multilateralism
JOHANNESBURG: A Group of 20 leaders’ summit in South Africa adopted a declaration addressing the climate crisis and other global challenges on Saturday after it was drafted without US input, a move a White House official called “shameful”.
The declaration, using language Washington has opposed, “can’t be renegotiated”, South African Pre­sident Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson told reporters. “We had the entire year of working towards this adoption and the past week has been quite intense,” the spokesperson said.
President Ramaphosa, hosting the weekend gathering in Johannes­burg, said earlier there was “overwhelming consensus” for the summit declaration.
Envoys from the G20 drew up the draft on Friday without US involvement, according to four sources familiar with the matter.
The document utilised language long disliked by the Trump administration, stressing the seriousness of climate change and the need to better adapt to it. It praised ambitious targets to boost renewable energy and noted the punishing levels of debt service suffered by poor countries.
 
 

The inclusion of climate change language served as a snub to US President Donald Trump, who has doubted the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by human activities. US officials had previously indicated they would oppose such references.
“We should not allow anything to diminish the value, the stature and the impact of the first African G20 presidency,” Ramaphosa said in his opening remarks.
His bold tone presented a striking contrast to his subdued decorum during a visit to the White House in August. During that meeting, Ramaphosa endured Trump repeating a false claim that there was a genocide of white farmers in South Africa. Trump subsequently said US officials would not attend because of allegations that the host country persecutes its white minority.
‘Geopolitical fractures’
The G20’s role in fixing economic crises is threatened by geopolitical fractures, leaders warned, however, despite the boycott, Ramaphosa downplayed Trump’s absence and argued the G20 remained key for international cooperation.
However, French President Emmanuel Macron warned during the summit that “the G20 may be coming to the end of a cycle.” Speaking at the opening, Macron noted that leaders are “struggling to resolve major crises together around this table”.
In a sign of other geopolitical fissures, EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen warned in a speech about “the weaponisation of dependencies.” This was a reference to China’s export curbs on rare earths vital for the energy transition.
While the US skipped the summit, it still intended to take up the G20 baton for the next gathering. Trump plans to stage that summit in 2026 at a Florida golf club he owns.

• Drone attack on Lebanon leaves one dead, five hurt
• Canadian PM, UAE president back comprehensive Palestinian peace plan
• Hamas says ‘escalating violations’ place a responsibility on mediators and US
CAIRO: Israel continued its deadly assault blatantly violating ceasefire agreements on two fronts with airstrikes on Saturday that killed at least 21 people in Gaza and one in southern Lebanon, despite assurances from Palestinian resistance groups that they remain fully committed to the accord.
Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip killed at least 21 people and wounded several others, local health authorities said, posing a further test to the six-week-old ceasefire.
Witnesses and medics said the initial attack struck a car in the densely populated Rimal neighbourhood, setting it ablaze. It was not immediately clear whether the five dead were passengers in the vehicle or included passersby. Dozens of people rushed to extinguish the fire and rescue the victims.
 
 

Shortly after the attack on the car, the Israeli air force carried out two separate airstrikes on houses in Deir Al-Balah city and Nuseirat camp in the central Gaza Strip, killing at least four people and wounding several others, medics said.
The Israeli military claimed a gunman had exploited the “humanitarian road in the area through which humanitarian aid enters southern Gaza” to cross into Israeli-held territory. The military said it was striking targets in Gaza in response.
A Hamas official in Gaza rejected the Israeli military’s allegations as baseless and an “excuse to kill”, insisting the group was committed to the ceasefire agreement.
Hamas said in a statement earlier on Saturday that Israel’s “escalating violations” place a responsibility on mediators and the US to confront the aggression and preserve the ceasefire.
While the October 10 ceasefire in the Gaza war has eased the conflict — enabling hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to Gaza’s ruins and increasing aid flows — violence has not completely halted.
Palestinian health authorities say Israeli forces have killed 316 people in strikes in Gaza while Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed since the ceasefire began since the truce began. Some observers are concerned Israel is seeking to reassert itself.
Attacks in Lebanon
Violations also continued on another front, where an Israeli strike in southern Lebanon killed one person on Saturday, Lebanon’s health ministry said. The death occurred in the latest attack despite a nearly year-long ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.
In a statement, the ministry attributed the death to “an Israeli enemy strike” on a vehicle in Zawtar al-Sharqiyah. The National News Agency identified the man killed as Kamel Reda Qarnabash.
The ministry also reported that a grenade dropped by an Israeli drone in the southern town of Shaqra wounded five people.
The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the deadly incident in Zawtar al-Sharqiyah but claimed it struck “several Hezbollah launchers that were recently identified and placed in military sites in southern Lebanon”.
Lebanon has accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement reached in Nov 2024 by continuing its strikes and maintaining forces inside Lebanese territory. According to the health ministry, more than 330 people have been killed in Lebanon and 945 wounded since the ceasefire.
The attacks follow an Israeli strike Tuesday night on the Ain al-Hilweh camp for Palestinian refugees in southern Lebanon that killed 13 people.
A secondary school in the camp stated on its Facebook page Thursday that two of its students were killed in the attack, publishing an image of two adolescent boys.
Canadian PM, UAE president meet
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan met on Nov 20 in Abu Dhabi to advance bilateral ties and discuss Gaza peace plan, Canada’s government said on Saturday.
Regarding Gaza, the leaders reaffirmed a shared commitment to a “comprehensive, just and lasting peace” based on the two-state solution, leading to a sovereign, independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel.
Both sides welcomed the leadership of US President Donald Trump and his “comprehensive peace plan” to end the war in Gaza, as well as the adoption of Resolution 2803 by the UN Security Council as a key instrument for implementation.

• Firms cut purchases by 23m kg in four years
SWABI: Tobacco purchasing companies have slashed their demand for the 2026 crop by 13.183 million kg, marking the fourth consecutive year of reduced requirements. This cutback is expected to result in significant financial losses for local tobacco farmers, sources told Dawn on Saturday.
Tobacco experts noted that while multinational and national firms have the capacity to store large quantities of tobacco, growers face major challenges due to limited financial resources and storage options. The inability to store crops like Virginia and White Patta tobacco means any surplus must be sold quickly, leaving growers at the mercy of fluctuating market demand.
For 2026, the total demand from tobacco companies is set at 61.627m kg, with 58.184m kg of flue-cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco, 0.360m kg of dark air-cured tobacco, 1.342m kg of White Patta, 1.381m kg of burley, and 0.360m kg of sun-cured tobacco.
This marks a significant reduction from previous years, with companies cutting their demand by 23.873m kg over the past four years. In 2023, total demand was 85.5m kg, which fell to 77.322m kg in 2024, 74.810m kg in 2025, and will drop to 61.627m kg in 2026.
The bulk of tobacco purchases is made by multinational companies, with a smaller portion allocated to national companies and smaller tobacco entrepreneurs. Among multinational firms, Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC) and Philip Morris (Pakistan) Ltd are the largest buyers, with a combined demand of over 36m kg of FCV tobacco in 2026. The remaining FCV demand will be met by 78 national companies, including Khyber Tobacco.
Shift in tobacco requirements
The Pakistan Tobacco Board (PTB) has noted that while demand for FCV, dark air-cured, and sun-cured tobacco has decreased in 2026, demand for White Patta and burley tobacco has increased slightly. FCV tobacco remains the primary focus for both multinational and national companies, given its use in cigarette manufacturing and export.
Iqbal Shewa, a prominent tobacco grower, stressed that both multinational and national companies are primarily concerned with FCV tobacco for export and cigarette production. To avoid confusion during the purchasing season, PTB has instructed tobacco companies and landowners to formalise agreements for the upcoming year and share those agreements with the board. Farmers have been advised to grow tobacco in line with these agreements to avoid complications during the buying season.
Price discrepancies and low profit
Ayaz Khan, a former PTB director, explained that companies are reducing their demand for the 2026 crop in part because of the price discrepancy between the weighted average price (WAP) and the minimum indicative price (MIP). The WAP for the current year was set at Rs 719 per kg, while the MIP for surplus tobacco was set at Rs 545 per kg. Companies, Mr Khan said, profited from purchasing surplus tobacco at the MIP, which was Rs174.8 less than the WAP, resulting in significant savings for them but at the expense of the growers. This year’s surplus tobacco amounted to 35.35m kg, which allowed companies to profit by Rs6.17 billion, a windfall that was not shared with the farmers.
 
 

In contrast, the farmers have faced significant losses. The lower purchase prices have put them in a difficult financial position, with many reliant on tob­acco cultivation for their annual income.
Surging exports
Despite the reduced demand for domestic consumption, tobacco exports have seen a marked increase. In 2023-24, Pakistan exported 20m kg of tobacco, rising to 47m kg in 2024-25, an increase of 135pc year-on-year. However, despite this rise in exports, companies have kept their domestic purchase demand low to avoid paying higher prices for surplus tobacco.
Mr Khan also pointed out that the increased exports have not led to corresponding benefits for local growers. Instead, the companies’ strategy of reducing domestic purchases and capitalising on cheaper surplus tobacco has disproportionately benefited the tobacco industry, while the farmers and government have borne the brunt of the financial losses.
The ongoing reduction in tobacco demand by purchasing companies is creating a challenging environment for tobacco growers, who face severe financial losses due to lower prices and limited storage options. While companies continue to benefit from price discrepancies and increased exports, farmers remain the biggest losers in this equation.

“Pakistan has strengthened its global digital connectivity with the deployment of the SEA-ME-WE 6 submarine cable system, a 19,200-km high-capacity fibre network linking Pakistan to countries between Singapore and France,” said the statement from the ministry.
The cable has a total capacity of over 100 terabit per second and it will provide “one of the lowest-latency routes between Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Western Europe”.
It added that Pakistan has been allocated a total of 13.2tbps, with 4tbps being activated immediately — expanding the country’s international bandwidth capacity and enhancing support for cloud services, data centres, fintech, e-commerce, streaming, and the broader digital economy.
 






The press release added that SEA-ME-WE 6 features “more fibre pairs and more than double the capacity” of previous SEA-ME-WE systems, enhancing resilience and diversification across high-traffic Asia-Europe routes through trans-Egypt geo-diversified crossings and landing points.
“The system enables rapid scalability, improved fault protection and lower total network ownership costs for participating service providers, while adding an essential new redundancy layer to the global internet backbone.”
It added that the consortium involved in the project included Pakistan’s Transworld Associates, Bangladesh Submarine Cable Company, Bharti Airtel, Dhiraagu, Djibouti Telecom, Mobily, Orange, Singtel, Sri Lanka Telecom, Telecom Egypt, Telekom Malaysia and Telin.
In February, Pakistan Tele­communication Com­pany Ltd successfully landed the Africa-1 submarine internet cable at Karachi.
In December, Trans­world Associates linked the Africa-2 cable to its landing station in Karachi.
Currently, six cables, with a capacity of 13tpbs, bring internet to Pakistan: Asia-Africa-Europe 1 (AAE-1), South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 (SMW4) and India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE), managed by PTCL; and South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 5 (SMW-5) and Transworld Associates 1 (TWA-1), operated by Transworld Associates.

A statement from the Crime Reporters Association (CRA) condemned what it said were “threatening activities of two suspicious persons” at the house of senior journalist Faraz Khan, associated with The News International, in Federal B Industrial Area.
Referring to a video of the alleged incident making the rounds on social media, the CRA said: “The two persons can be clearly seen in the CCTV footage, who knocked on the door of the house and threatened the family of serious consequences, which caused panic and fear among the family.”
It said the incident had caused “serious concern” among the affected family and wider journalist community, adding that it had immediately informed the police and high-ranking officials.
“Taking immediate action, Federal B Industrial Area station house officer has reached the house … where the police authorities have taken evidence in their custody and the statements of the affected family are also being recorded.”
“The association demands that the strictest action be taken against such elements in accordance with the law so that the threats to journalists and their families can be addressed,” added the CRA statement.
Central Senior Superintendent of Police Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi similarly told Dawn that police officers visited the residence and took the CCTV footage for investigation purposes.
He said investigators were waiting for the journalist to lodge a case to initiate legal proceedings about the alleged threats.
Last month, the attempted target killing of a DawnNewsTV journalist was foiled following the arrest of the suspects by the Rawalpindi police.
Journ­alists and media professionals have faced a tightening landscape in 2025 for free expression, according to a report by the Pakistan Press Foundation.
Reporters Without Borders has ranked Pakistan as one of the world’s deadliest countries for journalists owing to its high rate of impunity for the killers of journalists.
According to a report by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.</p><small>2025-11-22 17:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634934-polish-woman-marries-pakistani-man-after-social-media-friendship' target='_blank'><strong>Polish woman marries Pakistani man after social media friendship</strong></a><br><p>

In securing the accord, countries attempted to demonstrate global unity in addressing climate change impacts even after the world’s biggest historic emitter, the United States, declined to send an official delegation.
“We should support it because at least it is going in the right direction,” the European Union’s climate commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, told reporters before the deal was gaveled through.
The Belem deal launches a voluntary initiative to speed up climate action to help nations meet their existing pledges to reduce emissions, and calls for rich nations to at least triple the amount of money they provide to help developing countries adapt to a warming world by 2035.
 
 

Scientists have said existing national commitments to cut emissions have cut projected warming significantly, but are not enough to keep world temperatures from breaching 1.5 degrees Celsius above industrial levels, a threshold that could unleash the worst impacts of climate change.
Developing countries have argued in the meantime that they urgently need funds to adapt to impacts that are already hitting, such as rising sea levels and worsening heat waves, droughts, floods and storms.
The agreement also launches a process for climate bodies to review how to align international trade with climate action, according to the deal text, amid concerns that rising trade barriers are limiting the adoption of clean technology.
Avinash Persaud, special adviser to the president of the Inter-American Development Bank, a multilateral lender focused on Latin America and the Caribbean, said the accord’s focus on finance was important as climate impacts mount.
“But I fear the world still fell short on more rapid-release grants for developing countries responding to loss and damage. That goal is as urgent as it is hard,” he said.
The European Union had been pressing for language in the official deal on the move away from fossil fuels, but had come up against stiff resistance from the Arab Group of nations, including top oil exporter Saudi Arabia.
That impasse was resolved after all-night negotiations on Friday led to an agreement that the issue could be left out of the accord and included in a side text put forward by COP30 host Brazil.
G20 summit in South Africa adopts declaration despite US boycott, opposition
Separately, a Group of 20 leaders’ summit in South Africa adopted a declaration addressing the climate crisis and other global challenges after it was drafted without US input in a move a White House official called “shameful”.
The declaration, using language to which Washington has been opposed, “can’t be renegotiated”, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s spokesperson told reporters, reflecting strains between Pretoria and the Trump administration over the event.
“We had the entire year of working towards this adoption and the past week has been quite intense,” spokesperson Vincent Magwenya said.
Ramaphosa, host of this weekend’s gathering of Group of 20 leaders in Johannesburg, had earlier said there was “overwhelming consensus” for a summit declaration.
But at the last minute, Argentina, whose far-right President Javier Milei is a close ally of US President Donald Trump, quit the negotiations right before the envoys were about to adopt the draft text, South African officials said.
“Argentina, although it cannot endorse the declaration … remains fully committed to the spirit of cooperation that has defined the G20 since its conception,” its foreign minister, Pablo Quirno, said at the summit. Ramaphosa noted this, but went ahead with it anyway.
In explanation, Quirno said Argentina was concerned about how the document referred to geopolitical issues.
“Specifically, it addresses the longstanding Middle East conflict in a manner that fails to capture its full complexity,” he said. The document mentions the conflict once, saying that “members agree to work for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in … the Occupied Palestinian Territory”.
Envoys from the G20 — which brings together the world’s major economies — drew up a draft leaders’ declaration on Friday without US involvement, four sources familiar with the matter said.
“It is a longstanding G20 tradition to issue only consensus deliverables, and it is shameful that the South African government is now trying to depart from this standard practice,“ a senior Trump administration official said on Friday.
The declaration used the kind of language long disliked by the US administration: stressing the seriousness of climate change and the need to better adapt to it, praising ambitious targets to boost renewable energy and noting the punishing levels of debt service suffered by poor countries.
The mention of climate change was a snub to Trump, who doubts the scientific consensus that global warming is caused by human activities. US officials had indicated they would oppose any reference to it in the declaration.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In opening remarks to the summit, Ramaphosa said: “We should not allow anything to diminish the value, the stature and the impact of the first African G20 presidency”.
His bold tone was a striking contrast to his subdued decorum during his visit to the White House in May, in which he endured Trump repeating a false claim that there was a genocide of white farmers in South Africa, brushing aside Ramaphosa’s efforts to correct his facts.
Trump said US officials would not attend the summit because of widely discredited allegations that the host country’s black majority government persecutes its white minority.
The summit came at a time of heightened tensions between world powers over Russia’s war in Ukraine and fraught climate negotiations at the COP30 in Brazil.
“While the G20 diversity sometimes presents challenges, it also underscores the importance of finding common ground,” Japan Cabinet Public Affairs Secretary Maki Kobayashi told Reuters.
Commenting on Argentina’s absence from the final envoy meeting to agree on the text, Magwenya said: “Argentina [had] been participating quite meaningfully … in all the deliberations,” then never showed up to endorse the declaration on Friday. He added: “We have what we call sufficient consensus.”
The US president had also rejected the host nation’s agenda of promoting solidarity and helping developing nations adapt to weather disasters, transition to clean energy and cut their excessive debt costs.
“This G20 is not about the US,” South African Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told public broadcaster SABC. “We are all equal members of the G20. What it means is that we need to take a decision. Those of us who are here have decided this is where the world must go.”
But in a sign of the many geopolitical fissures underlying the agreed text, EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen warned in a speech about “the weaponisation of dependencies”, which she said “only creates losers”.
 
 

This was an apparent veiled reference to China’s export curbs on rare earths vital for the world’s energy transition, as well as defence and digital technology.
The US will host the G20 in 2026 and Ramaphosa said he would have to hand over the rotating presidency to an “empty chair”.
The South African presidency on Saturday reiterated its rejection of a US offer to send the US charge d’affaires for the G20 handover.
“The president will not hand over to a junior embassy official the presidency of the G20. It’s a breach of protocol that is not going to be accommodated,” Magwenya said.
Lamola later said that South Africa would assign a diplomat of the same rank as a charge d’affaires to hand over the G20 presidency at the foreign affairs department.</p><small>2025-11-22 17:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22144959ad5c68d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956701/ptis-hammad-azhar-claims-form-45s-missing-ahead-of-tomorrows-lahore-na-129-by-poll' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Hammad Azhar claims Form 45s ‘missing’ ahead of tomorrow’s Lahore NA-129 by-poll</strong></a><br><p>PTI leader Hammad Azhar on Saturday claimed that Form 45s are missing from the election material provided to presiding officers by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) ahead of tomorrow’s by-election in Lahore’s NA-129 constituency.
The by-election is being held after the seat fell vacant in July following the death of Azhar’s father, Mian Azhar.
In a post on X, Hammad said: “We are receiving reports that multiple presiding officers are missing Form 45s in the election materials they have received from ECP (Election Commission of Pakistan) for the by-elections of tomorrow. This is a serious violation of the electoral process.”
 






The alarm came after he had earlier issued “important instructions” for his party’s polling agents about the forms.
“When the bags containing election materials are opened in the morning, make sure that the Forms 45 and Forms 46 in them are blank and shown to you. This is most important.”
The PTI leader stressed the importance of the polling agents’ presence during the polling and the counting processes. “The polling boxes must not be out of sight at any moment.”
Hammad further told the agents that it was their “right to obtain the Form-45 [filled] as per the count”, and that any staff who obstructed this would be liable to strict legal punishment.
He directed all PTI workers at the party camps outside the polling stations to remain there after the polling had ended and “peacefully follow the presiding officer to the returning officer’s (RO) office”.
 






A candidate or their election agent can appoint “as many polling agents as may be prescribed” for each polling station to observe the process on behalf of the candidate under the Elections Act 2017.
In another post, Hammad also gave a message to the presiding officers and the polling staff, urging them not to indulge in any “illegal act”.
“We are aware that you are being frightened and threatened,” the PTI leader claimed, adding that those who were allegedly doing so were “finding immunity for themselves, buying property abroad and moving their families there”.
“They will push you into [carrying out] unconstitutional actions and flee themselves,” Hammad contended.
“Be careful! Do not put yourself in difficulty by taking any serious and illegal action at the behest of any intruder,” the PTI leader said, urging them to fulfil their duty.
 






The NA-129 seat is being contested by Mian Azhar’s nephew Chaudhry Arsalan Ahmad — nominated by Hammad, who himself is absconding as he is wanted by the state in different cases.
Hafiz Mian Nauman, who was defeated by Mian Azhar by a margin of over 30,000 votes in the 2024 elections, is once again the PML-N’s candidate.
The PTI has accused the PML-N’s Punjab government of employing rigging tactics in support of its candidate in the NA-129 by-poll.
Yesterday, Hammad said officials of the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) were appointed as presiding officers for the polls contested by Nauman, who has served as chairman of the Lesco Board of Directors.
Lesco Chief Executive Officer Ramzan Butt, however, rebutted Hammad’s post, stating that the appointments were the decision of the ECP and not Lesco or any other government organisation.
 
 

Before the election campaign could pick up, the local police officials, caught on video footage, were seen removing banners of the PTI candidate.
Similar to the situation during the 2024 general elections, Ahmad is contesting as an independent candidate on the “geyser” symbol, instead of the “bat” due to the revocation of the party’s electoral symbol last year.</p><small>2025-11-22 17:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22195051055c15c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956710/nawaz-sahibzada-star-as-pakistan-romp-to-seven-wicket-victory-against-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Nawaz, Sahibzada star as Pakistan romp to seven-wicket victory against Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>Spinner Mohammad Nawaz set it up for Pakistan before opener Sahibzada Farhan finished it off to the joy of a packed crowd at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.
With Nawaz (3-16) weaving his magic with the ball, including two wickets in two balls, in the Twenty20 tri-nation clash, Pakistan restricted Sri Lanka to 128-7 before romping to their target with 4.3 overs to spare in their Twenty20 tri-nation series clash on Saturday.
Sahibzada led the batting effort with his sixth T20 half-century, hitting five sixes and six fours in an explosive 80 not out off 45 balls, as Pakistan eased to a six-wicket victory that made in two in two for the hosts, who beat Zimbabwe by five wickets in the series opener.
Sri Lanka, meanwhile, have no wins in two with the defeat following a humbling at the hands on Zimbabwe on Thursday.
But it had seemed all so different at the start when skipper Dasun Shunaka won the toss and elected to bat with openers Kamil Mishara and Pathum Nissanka tearing into Pakistan’s bowling with the latter cutting away Salman Mirza for four on the first ball of their innings.
Mishara then pulled Mohammad Waseem Jr, in for the injured Shaheen Shah Afridi, for six and then smashed Salman for a four and a six off consecutive deliveries in the third over.
Mishara then slashed at Faheem Ashraf and got a top-edge that ran for four but his enterprising 22 off 12 ended on the next ball when he was undone by the change of pace and found Fakhar Zaman at mid-off.
One-drop Kusal Mendis, didn’t last long as he was run out in an attempt to scamper a quick two and Sri Lanka ended the powerplay at 44-2 after the incoming Kusal Perera pulled Faheem away past mid-on for four.
Spinner Abrar bowled an expensive first over, giving away 11 — four of them wides, with Perera raising Sri Lanka’s 50 with his second four. But Abrar hit back in his second over, having Nissanka caught at long-off for a sluggish 23-ball 17 and Sri Lanka trudged to 65-3 by the midway point of their innings.
Perera, who made 25 off 19, welcomed Saim Ayub into the attack with a six over deep square leg but Nawaz’s double-wicket burst left Sri Lanka reeling.
First Perera was cleaned up with a ball that was tossed outside off but turned enough to find a way between bat and pad and hit the off-stump before Shanaka was sent packing in similar fashion.
From 78-3, Sri Lanka slipped to 86-6 when Nawaz had Kamindu Mendis caught thanks to a superb display of athleticism by Waseem in the deep.
A first boundary in six overs came when Janith Liyanage, who hit a valiant 41 not out, lifted Abrar straight back over his head for six on the first ball of the 17th and as Sri Lanka crossed 100, Wanindu Hasaranga got a four over extra cover two balls later.
An upper-cut for off Waseem got Liyanage his first four and he followed it up with another off Salman in the penultimate over before Hasaranga (11) holed out in the deep.
Liyanage, though, couldn’t give Sri Lanka the lift they were looking for in the last over with just seven coming off it.
Pakistan got off to a flyer in the chase, Saim (20) getting the first boundary when he dispatched a full toss by Eshan Malinga and the left-hander ended the second over with two fours through the offside.
Sahibzada got on the act, lifting Hasaranga over mid-off for four and then hitting Dushmantha Chameera for a four and six — over square leg.
Saim sliced Shanaka for four to bring up his 1000 runs in T20Is but was stumped two balls later.
Sahibzada, though, was unfazed by losing his opening partner; crashing Vijayakanth Viyaskanth for four as Pakistan ended the powerplay at 53-1.
A glorious cover drive by Sahibzada off Malinga ended a 24-ball boundary drought and Pakistan were well-placed after ending the first 10 overs at 68-1.
Viyaskanth was then crashed by Sahibzada for a four and six, both in the square leg area, off consecutive balls before the right-hander raised his half-century off 33 balls.
At the other end, Babar Azam (16) got his first boundary on the 17th ball he faced when he pulled away Shanaka for six.
Sahibzada, though, was having no difficulty in getting the big hits — smoking two sixes off Hasaranga in the 13th over and following it up with another down the ground in the next off Chameera, who hit back by cleaning up Babar and trapping captain Salman Ali Agha lbw off consecutive balls.
But with Sahibzada at the crease, Pakistan had no late jitters and the right-hander lifted Malinga for four to seal a comfortable victory for his side.</p><small>2025-11-22 16:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/221915095a77b0a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956712/ptis-jhagra-assails-govt-says-judicial-distrust-creating-hurdles-in-foreign-investment' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Jhagra assails govt; says judicial distrust creating hurdles in foreign investment</strong></a><br><p>PTI leader Taimur Saleem Jhagra said judicial corruption and institutional distrust were barriers to capital investment in the country, while he assailed the government on Saturday following the release of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA) report.
The report, published earlier this week, highlighted persistent corruption challenges in Pakistan driven by systemic weaknesses across state institutions and demanded immediate initiation of a 15-point reform agenda to improve transparency, fairness and integrity.
Speaking at a press conference today about the report in Islamabad with former Sindh governor Mohammad Zubair, Jhagra highlighted a portion of the report that said: “The judicial sector that is organisationally complex is not able to [reliably] enforce contracts [or protect property rights] due to problems with efficiency, antiquated laws and the integrity of judges and judicial personnel.”
“[The report] also points out how capital investments in the country have been undermined by concerns over vulnerability to corruption of judicial institutions,” said the PTI leader.
“A barrier for investment in Pakistan is that the investor is scared of the fact that your judicial institutions are corrupt,” Jhagra said.
He added that according to the IMF, the judiciary was also unable to play a role in the economy besides political issues and those related to justice in society, as distrust in the system drove investors and businessmen away.
Speaking about the role of the National Accountability Bureau, he said the report criticised its structure and said anti-corruption efforts were constrained by “heavy reliance on a single institution exposed to strong political influence”.
“When IMF is saying there is corruption in Pakistan, and IMF states that the institutions in Pakistan, meant to fight corruption, have no coordination, and their actions are influenced politically; do you accept that or not?”
“If there is one thing that is written about the most, it is that everything is in the government’s hands,” said the former finance minister of KP.
As per the IMF, “state domination extends to employment, where the state employs 72 per cent of individuals with formal jobs”. In reference to this part, Jhagra said undue favours were inevitable when the state ran sectors that it should not.
The IMF pointed out, as emphasised by Jhagra, that the country’s sugar sector was a case study of how the intertwined relationship between economic and political elites and state regulators had combined to capture public benefits at deep cost to the populace.
“Firms in the sugar sector benefited from favourable government policies, subsidies and regulatory loopholes for decades, mainly due to the nexus between industry magnates and political leaders,” as per the report.
Jhagra also pointed out how the report criticised the role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), saying that it operated with “untested transparency and accountability provisions”.
Giving his own thoughts on the matter, Jhagra said the SIFC was brought about by the PML-N government to keep the stakeholders of the self-admitted current hybrid setup placated and content.
“They knew that it would not bring a penny’s worth of investment and neither have they tried.”
Jhagra said there were only two paths left after the report’s release, one was for the government to begin working on the issues and solutions outlined or to give answers to the questions being raised since the revelations were made public.
However, he quipped that the first was unlikely since “the government won’t remain and the SIFC won’t remain”.
Meanwhile, Zubair alleged that the IMF report was only disclosed by the government after “immense pressure” from the institution.
He further alleged that the SIFC awarded contracts to favourite contractors and that those who were involved in the sugar scandal were protected.
The former PML-N stalwart said 240 million people were suffering because of the policy failure of the current government, which had converted into an economic crisis.
He also said that it was unfortunate that no government representative had denied the report even after the passage of 48 hours. The former governor demanded an investigation after the report’s disclosures.
The politicians, under the banner of opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan, lashed out at the government and accused it of hiding the report for three months.
They also alleged that the report had identified corruption worth Rs5,300 billion in the governance system and termed it the “worst financial scandal” of the country’s history, demanding that the names of those responsible be made public.</p><small>2025-11-22 16:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22171318caa01b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956711/lawyers-protest-against-27th-amendment-at-shc' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers protest against 27th Amendment at SHC</strong></a><br><p>Lawyers of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) staged a protest on Saturday at the Sindh High Court (SHC) against the recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The contentious amendment, which resulted in the establishment of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), was passed by Parliament amid the opposition’s outcry.
It has also been criticised by some legal experts as a means to dethrone the Supreme Court (SC) as the country’s highest judicial forum, ceding that position to the FCC.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, voiced opposition to the amendment, particularly citing its impact on the SC. Hours after the amendment was enacted on November 13, two judges of the SC resigned, citing their reservations against it. The two judges were Athar Minallah and Mansoor Ali Shah, who was the senior puisne judge of the SC at the time.
Today, lawyers began their protest outside the SHC’s premises by chanting slogans against the amendment and later entered the high court’s premises.
Visuals showed some lawyers engaging in a scuffle with police personnel. Following the scuffle, police personnel backed up and allowed the protest to continue. There were reports of some minor injuries to police officials.
The lawyers entered the Sindh High Court Bar Association’s hall and continued their protest with sloganeering against the amendment and the government. They later took their demonstration outside the bar room after the electricity supply was switched off.
 






The KBA had observed a full-day strike in the subordinate judiciary last week in protest over the amendment’s passage and to express solidarity with the retired judges. It had also observed a full-day strike on Monday, during which litigants were not allowed to enter the City Courts premises and proceedings were adjourned due to the boycott.
The KBA had stated that from Tuesday to Saturday (today), “token strikes will be observed from 11am onwards”.</p><small>2025-11-22 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634913-cm-afridi-assures-centre-of-his-support-pledges-to-attend-all-federal-meetings' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi assures Centre of his support, pledges to attend all federal meetings</strong></a><br><p>

The development came as 7th Strategic Dialogue between Pakistan and the EU was convened in Brussels. The meeting was co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and EU’s chief diplomat Kaja Kallas.
The GSP+ status allows Pakistan to enjoy duty-free or minimum duty on European exports.
According to the FO, the meeting provided a “comprehensive review” of the full spectrum of Pakistan-EU relations, “building on the positive momentum of recent high-level engagements and sustained institutional interactions”.
 






Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to a “broad-based, multidimensional and forward-looking partnership anchored in shared values, the UN Charter, multilateralism, and the principles of mutual respect and cooperation” during the meeting, it said.
“The dialogue also offered an opportunity to exchange views on regional and global developments, including South Asia, Afghanistan, the Middle East, and broader geopolitical developments,” said FO.
“Both sides underlined the importance of coordinated approaches to peace, stability, sustainable development, and global challenges such as climate change and connectivity,” it added.
Moreover, Pakistan and the EU agreed to strengthen cooperation under the Strategic Engagement Plan, advance work on ongoing dialogues, and identify concrete avenues to expand collaboration in the years ahead, the FO said.
FM Dar later departed for Pakistan after wrapping up his visit.
“He engaged in substantive discussions on peace and security, maritime security, economic partnerships and global sustainability initiatives.
“On the sidelines, he held bilateral meetings with several counterparts and world leaders, exploring avenues to deepen strategic ties and enhance collaboration across multiple sectors,” the FO said.
 






GSP+ status is a special incentive awarded to developing countries to “pursue sustainable development and good governance” in exchange for cutting import duties to zero on two-thirds of the tariff lines of its exports. Governments with this status need to implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, good governance and the environment.
Earlier this week, EU Ambassador to Pakistan Raimundas Karoblis said the country needed to “do more” in terms of fulfilling its commitments under the GSP+ scheme ahead of a review.
‘Maritime threats are both multidimensional and transnational’
The deputy premier also delivered a statement on critical maritime security, saying that “Today’s maritime threats are both multidimensional and transnational.
“We face threats ranging from piracy, terrorism and trafficking of arms and narcotics, to cyber vulnerabilities at port infrastructure, marine pollution, and the growing climate-induced risks to coastal zones.”
 






He said Pakistan was a littoral state, one sharing the coastline with a particular sea or ocean, with a geostrategic location at the crossroads of key international sea lanes and the Arabian Sea as its “fifth neighbour”.
Dar said the Arabian Sea remained central to Pakistan’s national security, connectivity, economic resilience, food and energy security.
“From Karachi to Gwadar, our ports are gateways linking the landlocked heart of Central Asia to the global trading system.
“Pakistan, therefore, views maritime security and economic development as mutually reinforcing.”
He said stronger cooperation in the maritime domain, as well as awareness, information sharing, and early warning, was needed to address challenges.
The deputy premier said Pakistan believed that a maritime domain that was secure, resilient and also sustainable could be collectively built through mutual trust, transparency, and adherence to international law.
“First, to ensure that oceans remain spaces for cooperation and shared prosperity, we must look away from exclusionary or hegemonic arrangements in the maritime domain.
“We must enhance cooperation under the framework of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as well as regional and bilateral legal instruments and customary international law. It is imperative to ensure the harmonious and judicious use of ocean resources as a common heritage of mankind.
“Maritime disputes must be resolved through peaceful means, in line with international law,” FM Dar said.
He further said that connectivity must be combined with resilience and critical infrastructure should be developed through diversification addressing redundancy mechanisms.
“We must align best practices so that disruption in one region does not cascade globally.”
Third, he said maritime development must be anchored in international cooperation and technological solutions.
“Pakistan has strengthened its Joint Maritime Information Coordination Centre, integrating satellite-based monitoring and AI-enabled vessel tracking with the support of Suparco. We look forward to enhancing cooperation with our partners in this regard.
“Pakistan looks forward to deepening cooperation with the EU and partner countries in technology transfer, regulatory exchanges, and capacity-building for the protection of critical maritime infrastructure.
“Our vision is straightforward: we want to ensure that the seas remain zones of peace, prosperity, and shared progress, where connectivity builds resilience, not rivalry,” Dar concluded.</p><small>2025-11-22 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634915-opposition-alliance-demands-probe-into-economic-irregularities-flagged-in-imf-report' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance demands probe into 'economic irregularities' flagged in IMF report</strong></a><br><p>

US President Donald Trump gave Ukraine less than a week to approve the 28-point plan to end the nearly four-year conflict, which would see the invaded country ceding territory, cutting its army, and pledging to never join NATO.
Meanwhile, Ukraine’s European allies, who were not included in drafting the agreement, said the plan requires “additional work” as they scrambled at the G20 summit in South Africa to come up with a counter-offer to Trump’s plan to beef up Kyiv’s positions.

“In the coming days, consultations will take place with partners regarding the steps needed to end the war,” President Volodymyr Zelensky said, after he issued a decree stating Ukraine’s team for the talks, which will be led by his top aide, Andriy Yermak.

“Our representatives know how to defend Ukraine’s national interests and what is necessary to prevent Russia from launching a third invasion,” Zelensky added.

The wartime leader was also holding rounds of phone calls with European counterparts, as he earlier promised to work round the clock to ensure the final peace agreement will protect Ukraine’s future.
Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s security council secretary who’s also on board for the talks, earlier indicated Switzerland as a location for the deliberations.

“This is another stage of the dialogue that has been ongoing in recent days and is primarily aimed at aligning our vision for the next steps,” added Umerov, formerly a defence minister. He previously led a few rounds of negotiations with Russia in Turkey, which only yielded prisoner exchanges and bodies repatriations.

Zelensky’s decree also said the negotiations will include “representatives of the Russian Federation.” There was no immediate confirmation from Russia whether it would join the talks.
More work needed
The unilateral US plan to end the war in Ukraine “is a basis which will require additional work”, Western leaders gathered in South Africa for a G20 summit said Saturday.

“We are clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force.

We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine’s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack,” the leaders of key European countries as well as Canada and Japan said in a joint statement.

France’s Emmanuel Macron earlier sent a sombre message to the gathering, saying “the G20 may be coming to the end of a cycle,” adding that the grouping was struggling to resolve major crises around the world, referring to the unilateral US plan for resolving the Ukraine war.

Britain, Germany and France emerged as key Ukraine backers, providing it with crucial military and financial support, especially after the US sponsorship waned after Trump’s return to office.

Difficult choice
Ukraine faces one of the most challenging moments in its history, Zelensky said Friday in an address to the nation, adding that he would propose alternatives to Trump’s proposal.

“The pressure on Ukraine is one of the hardest. Ukraine may face a very difficult choice: either the loss of dignity or the risk of losing a key partner,” Zelensky said in his address, referring to a possible break with Washington.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said the blueprint could “lay the foundation” for a final peace settlement, but threatened more land seizures if Ukraine walked away from negotiations.

Better equipped and larger in numbers, the Russian army is slowly but steadily gaining ground across the lengthy front line.

Ukrainians were meanwhile facing one of the toughest winters since the war began, after Moscow carried out a brutal bombing campaign against energy infrastructure.

This comes as a sweeping corruption probe that unveiled graft in the energy sector was unravelling in Kyiv, sparking public outcry.</p><small>2025-11-22 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2218132680a107d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956714/pcbs-public-spat-ends-after-rashid-latif-unconditionally-withdraws-comments-against-board' target='_blank'><strong>PCB’s public spat ends after Rashid Latif ‘unconditionally’ withdraws comments against board</strong></a><br><p>Former Pakistan Test captain Rashid Latif ended the saga he began after apologising on Saturday for fiery comments made against the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) policies, which he termed “an error of judgement”.
Latif’s comments on surrogate advertising and removal of Mohammad Rizwan from ODI captaincy had prompted PCB to lodge a complaint against the former captain with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which summoned Latif to appear before an investigation officer at its Lahore office  on Nov 17.
Later, Rashid had also moved the Islamabad High Court against the inquiry, terming it illegal and saying it was issued without lawful authority and was liable to be quashed.
In a lengthy post on X today, Latif clarified that his “principal contention” was related to potential violations of the advisories issued by the Pakistani government.
“At no point, whether inadvertently or deliberately, have I ever sought or intended to implicate any individual including players, board members, or other stakeholders in wrongdoing,” Latif said.
 






He admitted “an error of judgement” when he commented on the removal of Rizwan from ODI captaincy.
“I acknowledge that I made an unwarranted reference to Mohammad Rizwan’s public support for Palestine as a potential factor in his removal from captaincy.
“Upon further reflection, I recognise that this assumption was inappropriate, unfounded, and not supported by any credible evidence.”
Latif said he deeply regretted any distress or offence that his comments may have caused to the general public or to the PCB more specifically.
“I offer my sincere apologies for any unintended harm arising from my remarks which I withdraw unconditionally and affirm that no such harm was ever intended,” he continued in his post.
“Going forward, I shall endeavour to ensure that my public commentary remains measured, evidence-based, and free from conjecture, particularly when addressing matters of sensitivity or issues that may carry significant implications.”
The 57-year-old, who often appears on TV as a sports analyst, further said: “I am an advocate of responsible broadcasting, research-based journalism, and objective analysis.
“Having had the honour of serving as captain of the Pakistan national cricket team, I hold the reputation and dignity of the country in the highest regard and would never intentionally act in a manner that could bring disrepute upon it.
“I endeavour to participate in public discourse in a manner that is fair, balanced, and constructive.”
Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi came to Latif’s defence, albeit untimely.
In a now-deleted post on X, Sethi said he was “shocked at the trumped up FIA against Latif” and urged cricket administrators “to desist from such repressive tactics and expect the judiciary to protect our freedoms”.
PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi responded to Sethi on X for his “misplaced, ill-timed, and factually incorrect” comments.
 






“The PCB’s action against Rashid Latif was never about silencing criticism, it was about addressing the deliberate spread of false and defamatory allegations,” he said in a post on X.
“Our proceedings have remained fully within the law and focused solely on protecting the integrity of Pakistan cricket and its players.
Naqvi further stated that the board welcomes Latif’s apology and offered a clean slate to the former cricketer.
“We do not use any other means to silence those who criticise the Board. We protect Pakistan cricket and its assets,” Naqvi concluded.</p><small>2025-11-22 13:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634886-pm-shehbaz-seeks-experts-to-boost-regional-connectivity-intl-train-links' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz seeks experts to boost regional connectivity, int'l train links</strong></a><br><p>

The IBO was conducted on November 21, according to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian-proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the “Indian-sponsored *khawarij”*, as per ISPR, “who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, LEAs and target-killing of innocent civilians.”
“The operation underscores the strengthened collaborative efforts between [LEAs] and security forces, who have significantly intensified intelligence-driven operations in the region,” said ISPR.
“These meticulously coordinated and synchronised security measures are designed to constrict the operational mobility of khawarij elements, systematically dismantle their facilitation networks, and curtail their capacity to reorganise,” the statement stressed, adding that operations are producing “substantial and measurable success” with continuous efforts to achieve more peace and stability.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khawariji found in the area, as the relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision Azm-i-Istehkam (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and [LEAs] of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” ISPR added.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of LEAs.
Earlier today, a terrorist plot to blow up Dawa bridge in Bannu’s Basia Khel area using an improvised explosive device (IED) was foiled.
Yesterday, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked in Bannu, according to police. Police officials had told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Taliban’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives.</p><small>2025-11-22 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634899-canadian-lawmaker-honours-shahzeb-khanzada-with-certificate-for-journalistic-services' target='_blank'><strong>Canadian lawmaker honours Shahzeb Khanzada with certificate for journalistic services</strong></a><br><p>

The application was filed by IHC’s Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri.
The case pertains to the transfer of three judges from other high courts to the federal capital. In June, the SC’s Constitutional Bench had declared that their transfers were not unconstitutional. Subsequently, the five IHC judges had challenged the decision and filed an intra-court appeal.
However, the intra-court appeal in the case has now been fixed before the FCC, which was established under the 27th Amendment, on November 24.
In the miscellaneous petition, the IHC judges asked the FCC to return the intra-court appeal to the SC, arguing that the matter constitutionally falls within the jurisdiction of the apex court.
The petition stated that the appeal was shifted to the FCC under the 27th Constitutional Amendment, but contended that the amendment itself contradicted the Constitution.
In their application, the petitioners argued that the Constitution clearly outlined the legislature, executive, and judiciary as the three essential pillars of the state and delineated limits and powers for each.
The judges maintained that while Parliament holds the authority to amend the Constitution, such powers could not be exercised to abolish, restructure, or fundamentally weaken the judiciary, which forms an integral component of the constitutional framework.
They further asserted that several apex court judgments affirm the separation of powers and the protection of judicial independence, insisting that the appellate jurisdiction in such matters remained with the SC unless expressly provided otherwise without affecting the judiciary’s constitutional existence.
The petition stressed that transferring the appeal to the FCC on the basis of the 27th Amendment was legally flawed since the amendment itself was under challenge for being inconsistent with the Constitution’s basic structure.
With the new miscellaneous petition filed, the FCC is now expected to determine whether it can proceed with the appeal or whether the matter must be returned to the Supreme Court for adjudication.
Four of the same five IHC judges, excluding Justice Jahangiri, who wanted to challenge the recently introduced 27th Amendment, were turned away by the SC earlier this week and told to approach the FCC. The judges had drafted a petition invoking the original jurisdiction of the top court under Article 184(3), and sent a representation to the apex court’s registry branch.
According to the draft petition, the judges had also challenged the amendments to Article 200, which allowed the transfer of high court judges without their consent. They had argued that such provisions exposed judges to pressure, fear of retaliation, and manipulation of court composition.

The political opposites, a Republican billionaire and a young democratic socialist, have clashed over everything from immigration to economic policy.
But it was clear the two forged a rapport in their first encounter.
Mamdani, a 34-year-old state lawmaker, stood by Trump’s desk as the 79-year-old president smiled up at him and patted him warmly on the arm, having only recently falsely caricatured Mamdani as an anti-Semitic communist, among other jibes.
 






“We agree on a lot more than I would have thought,” Trump said after letting journalists and cameras into the Oval Office at the end of a private meeting with the mayor-elect.
“We have one thing in common: We want this city of ours that we love to do very well.”
The meeting in the Oval Office, where Trump has sometimes embarrassed or chastised visiting heads of state, far exceeded Trump’s prediction earlier on Friday that it would be “quite cordial”.
The men, two different generations of New Yorkers, announced nothing new on policy except what seemed to be the launch of an unexpected, politics-shifting professional friendship.
“What I really appreciate about the president is that the meeting that we had focused not on places of disagreement, which there are many, and also focused on the shared purpose that we have in serving New Yorkers,” Mamdani said.
Just 26 per cent of Americans say Trump is doing a good job at managing the cost of living, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.
Meanwhile, Mamdani, promising a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, was one of a slew of Democratic victors around the country in elections earlier this month.
It was among the most deflating nights endured by Republicans this year, and Trump had not been expected to enjoy the reminder through a visit by one of the most prominent Democratic winners.
Yet the president, who found his fame as a New York real estate developer, brightened at Mamdani’s call for more housing in the city he will lead from January 1.
Trump was cheered to hear a chunk of New Yorkers who voted for him in last year’s presidential election had gone on to vote for Mamdani.
“When we spoke to those voters who voted for President Trump, we heard them speak of the cost of living,” Mamdani said.
Trump, who says he is paying increasing attention to affordability and inflation, said this made sense to him.
“Some of his ideas are the same ideas I have,” Trump explained. “The better he does, the happier I am.”
Mamdani, Trump laugh off past insults
As Mamdani surged in the polls to victory on November 4, Trump issued threats to strip federal funding from New York City. Mamdani has regularly criticised Trump’s promise to ramp up federal immigration enforcement efforts in a city where four in 10 residents are foreign-born.
In the weeks before they met, Trump had labeled Mamdani a “radical left lunatic,” a communist and a “Jew hater”.
Mamdani has espoused Nordic-style democratic socialism, not communism.
While a staunch critic of Israel, he was endorsed by prominent Jewish politicians, is bringing Jewish staff into his new administration, notably New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, and has repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism.

And yet, less than an hour after first meeting each other in person, Trump was repeatedly coming to Mamdani's aid to fend off pointed questions from the press.

The pair laughed away some of their spicier insults as reporters reminded them of what they had said about each other.

“I've been called much worse than a despot,” Trump said with a smile. “So it's not that insulting, but I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together.”

Mamdani was asked if he still considered Trump a fascist. “That’s OK, you can just say ‘yes’,” Trump interjected, swapping grins with Mamdani and patting his arm twice. “It’s easier than explaining it.”
 






Trump defends Mamdani as ‘very rational person’
Trump also defended the Uganda-born Mamdani, who will be New York City’s first Muslim mayor, from some of the Islamophobic slurs he has faced.
One reporter asked Trump if he believed he had “a jihadist” standing by him.
“No, I don’t,” Trump said as Mamdani looked on. “I met with a man who’s a very rational person.”
Some politicians and commentators were discombobulated by the televised friendliness. At least a couple Republicans said they still did not trust Mamdani, Trump’s new approval notwithstanding.
“What the heck just happened?” US Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat from Michigan, wrote on social media, sharing a clip of one of the meeting’s Trump-Mamdani buddy moments.
 






Trump had repeatedly urged New Yorkers not to vote for Mamdani, warning it would be a disaster for a city that is already portrayed as a crime-ridden hellscape by conservative media, despite being among the safest big cities in the country.
After his first term as president, Trump decamped from Manhattan to become a Florida resident.
A reporter asked Trump if he would consider moving back to the city of his birth with Mamdani running it.
“Yeah, I would,” Trump said, “especially after the meeting.”</p><small>2025-11-22 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22130211a1c2f76.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956699/india-trade-unions-condemn-new-labour-codes-plan-nationwide-protests' target='_blank'><strong>India trade unions condemn new labour codes, plan nationwide protests</strong></a><br><p>Ten large Indian trade unions condemned the government’s rollout on Friday of new labour codes, the biggest such overhaul in decades, as a “deceptive fraud” against workers.
The unions, aligned with parties opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanded in a statement late on Friday that the laws be withdrawn ahead of nationwide protests they plan to hold on November 26 (Wednesday).
Modi’s government implemented the four labour codes, approved by parliament five years ago, as it seeks to simplify work rules, some dating to British colonial rule, and liberalise conditions for investment. It says the changes improve worker protections.
While the new rules offer social security and minimum-wage benefits, they also allow companies to hire and fire workers more easily.
Unions have strongly opposed the changes, organising multiple nationwide protests over the past five years.
 


The Labour Ministry did not immediately respond on Saturday to a Reuters request for comment on the union demands. The government has held over a dozen consultations with unions since June 2024, an internal ministry document on the labour codes shows.
The rules allow longer factory shifts and night work for women, while raising the threshold for firms that need prior approval for layoffs to 300 workers from 100, giving companies greater flexibility in workforce management.
 


The codes define gig and platform work for the first time, expanding legal and social protection to workers outside traditional employment structures.
The gig workforce has surged since the pandemic, with more than 23.5 million expected to be employed in the sector by 2030, up from around 10m in 2024/25, according to government think tank NITI Aayog.

 
 

Businesses have long criticised India’s work rules as a drag on manufacturing, which contributes less than a fifth to the country’s nearly $4 trillion economy. Strengthening the manufacturing sector is key to creating jobs in the world’s most populous country.
But the Association of Indian Entrepreneurs expressed concern that the new rules would significantly increase operating costs for small and midsize enterprises and disrupt business continuity across key sectors. It asked the government for transitional support and flexible implementation mechanisms.
“The labour codes have been implemented despite strong opposition from the trade unions and it will snatch the workers’ rights, including fixed-term jobs and rights available under the earlier labour laws,” said Amarjeet Kaur, national general secretary of the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC).

Not all unions oppose the overhaul. The right-wing Bharatiya Majdoor Sangh, aligned with Modi's party, called on states to implement them after consultations on some of the codes.
The labour ministry said the codes — covering wages, industrial relations, social security and occupational safety — would “ensure better wages, safety, social security and welfare for the country’s workforce”.
The codes will replace 29 existing laws. Indian states are expected to craft rules aligning with the new federal codes covering wages, industrial relations and occupational safety.
Despite parliamentary approval in 2020, the BJP had until now not been able to implement the laws uniformly across the country due to political resistance and opposition from some unions.
Modi yesterday defended the overhaul, saying on X that the codes would serve as “a strong foundation for universal social security, minimum and timely payment of wages, safe workplaces and remunerative opportunities”, adding that the reforms would boost job creation and productivity.

In May, the government had enacted the 60-day import and export ban on precious metals and gemstones to stabilise its foreign exchange reserves. The restriction was also linked to the military conflict with India as a potential strategy to limit the flow of precious metals via Dubai.
In a fresh SRO2198 dated November 21, the Ministry of Commerce rescinded its May directives for the ban, thereby allowing the import and export of gold and other precious metals.
The ministry further said the period of suspension so far under SRO760 was “accordingly condoned, thereby enabling exporters to avail the mandatory entitlement period of 120 days under the entrustment scheme”.
The entrustment scheme provides a facility for the export of jewellery against imported gold supplied as a partial advance payment, by the foreign buyer in the manufacturing of jewellery to be exported. In addition, exporters are required to only export eligible and authorised items within 120 days from the date of import.
 
 

Gold is still used as a traditional store of value and is an important part of Pakistan’s cultural, financial, and manufacturing sectors. Pakistan predominantly imports gold from the United Arab Emirates, Switzerland and other gold-trading hubs.
Industry leaders had previously stated that the restrictions on gold trade had effectively paralysed the gold and jewellery export sector, with exporters unable to fulfill orders despite having received raw gold under legal contracts from international buyers.
In a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Atif Ikram Sheikh had called for the immediate restoration of SRO 760 to protect the jewellery export industry.
In October, the Economic Coordination Committee had approved the continuation of the existing framework with enhanced transparency and automation measures to improve efficiency and traceability on the import and export policy for precious metals and jewellery.
Amendments to 2013 rules for jewellery import, export
Separately, the Ministry of Commerce also made several amendments to SRO760, originally titled ‘Import and Export of Precious Metals, Jewellery and Gemstones Order 2013’.
It renamed SRO760 to ‘Import and Export of Precious Metals and Jewellery Order 2013’. Further, the definition of “jewellery passbook”, issued by the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP), has been expanded to include “either paper or digital” versions of it by amending Clause 2(j).
 
 

TDAP monitors the import of gold and export of jewellery. All transactions are recorded in ‘jewellery passbook’ which are authenticated by the authority.
Further, the scope of trade allowed under Clause 3(2) has been clarified from “the import or export of precious metals, gemstones and jewellery” to “the import of precious metals and gemstones and export of jewellery”.
Regarding customs stations where exports or imports are allowed under Clause 3(9), the government has specified the procedure in case of operational issues by adding: “In the event of operational constraints, a no objection certificate shall be required from the respective additional or deputy collector of customs to allow one-time change of customs stations.”
On imports allowed under the entrustment scheme, the second provision of “import” under Clause 4(2) now includes that the contract may be apostilled under the Apostille Convention, 1961.
The provision now reads: “TDAP shall ensure that the contract signed by the supplier is notarised from the relevant foreign country’s legal authorities, duly attested by the relevant Pakistan Missions abroad or apostilled under the Apostille Convention, 1961 where applicable. The contract shall contain inter alia, all information as prescribed in Annex-D.”
Lastly, a new paragraph (iii) has been inserted into the “export proceeds” heading under Clause 4(2): “All the transactions under the entrustment scheme shall be processed exclusively through the same bank, ie export of jewellery from the same bank that processed or handled the corresponding import of precious metals.”</p><small>2025-11-22 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/22115347acfacfa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956692/major-maga-figure-marjorie-taylor-greene-resigns-from-us-congress' target='_blank'><strong>Major MAGA figure Marjorie Taylor Greene resigns from US Congress</strong></a><br><p>Influential right-wing United States lawmaker Marjorie Taylor Greene announced on Friday that she is resigning from Congress, one week after former President Donald Trump withdrew his support for the Georgia Republican. Her last day in office will be Jan 5, 2026.
In a video posted online, the 51-year-old congresswoman, elected in 2020, said she had “always been despised in Washington DC and never fit in”.
Greene added she did not want her supporters and family to endure “a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the president we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will likely lose the midterms”.
 






The resignation marks the clearest sign yet of a growing rift in the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, which has been shaken by strong Democratic victories in this month’s off-year elections, including the leftist New York mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, who met with Trump earlier on Friday.
Greene’s break with Trump appeared linked to his flip-flop on releasing emails connected to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein, a wealthy financier, had cultivated ties with elite politicians, business leaders, academics and celebrities, and was accused of trafficking girls and young women for sex.
Greene referenced the affair in her resignation speech.
“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,” Greene said.
Trump, in a phone interview with ABC News, described Greene’s resignation as “great news from the country”, adding that she had not given him notice but “it doesn’t matter … I think she should be happy”.
Earlier this week, Congress passed and Trump signed a law requiring government records on Epstein to be made public, after months of the former president attempting to block their release.
 
 

Before reversing his position, Trump had withdrawn all support for Greene, whom he dubbed “Wacky Marjorie”, and attacked her on Truth Social as a “lightweight” and “traitor” to the Republican Party. Greene subsequently reported receiving a wave of threats.
A prominent MAGA ally, Greene had championed Trump’s agenda, advocated for immigrant deportation, gun rights, and vaccine scepticism.
The rupture comes amid criticism of Trump over the US cost of living and the Epstein scandal. Greene’s departure sparked speculation she may run for president in 2028, which she dismissed as “baseless gossip”.
In her resignation speech, Greene highlighted her loyalty to Trump and the Republican Party. She said she “fought harder than almost any other elected Republican to elect Donald Trump and Republicans”, spending “millions” of her own money.
Greene also contrasted herself with “establishment Republicans who secretly hate him and who stabbed him in the back”. She emphasised, “My voting record has been solidly with my party and the president. Loyalty should be a two-way street.”</p><small>2025-11-22 07:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/221124311711108.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956693/terrorist-plot-to-blow-up-bridge-in-bannu-foiled' target='_blank'><strong>Terrorist plot to blow up bridge in Bannu foiled</strong></a><br><p>A terrorist plot to blow up a bridge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district was foiled on Saturday.
According to an official statement from KP police, terrorists attempted to blow up Dawa bridge in Bannu’s Basia Khel area using an improvised explosive device (IED). It said that the plot was thwarted due to timely action by the Bannu police bomb disposal squad.
It said that the terrorists had attached the IED, a bucket full of 8-10 kilogrammes of explosive material, to the central pillar of the bridge.
“The local people praised the timely action taken by Bannu police,” the statement said.
It also quoted Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan as saying that it was necessary to “eliminate elements inconveniencing the public by destroying infrastructure”. He asserted that such elements do not deserve any mercy.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents followed the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Yesterday, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked in Bannu, according to police. Police officials had told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Taliban’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives.
Earlier this week, a bid to blow up another bridge in Bannu had failed when an IED detonated prematurely while it was being installed.</p><small>2025-11-22 07:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/220951179da491f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956616/saudi-oil-giants-operations-in-islamabad-challenged' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi oil giant’s operations in Islamabad challenged</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has taken up a case challenging the operations of Saudi oil company Aramco-branded fuel stations in the federal capital, issuing notices to the country’s top oil regulator and other respondents for allegedly allowing the foreign entity to operate without a license.
The petition, filed by Mohammad Shafiq Mir, owner of a PSO station on Srinagar Highway, was heard by Justice Mohammad Azam Khan. The court has ordered a response from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA), Aramco Asia Singapore Pvt Ltd, Gas & Oil Pakistan Ltd (GO), Askar Oil, and several other government bodies.
The petitioners counsel Kashif Ali Malik argued that the Saudi state-owned oil company, has been running petrol pumps under its own branding without being a registered corporate entity in Pakistan and without obtaining a mandatory marketing license from OGRA.
The petitioner contends that this violates the OGRA Ordinance, the Pakistan Oil Rules 2016, the Petroleum Act, and the Explosives Act.
He claims the Aramco outlet near his station is operating by relying on licences and permits, including an explosives licence, that were originally granted to local companies Gas & Oil Pakistan Ltd and Askar Oil.
Such an arrangement, the petition argues, is illegal and creates “serious safety, regulatory, and competitive distortions.”
OGRA and other authorities were accused of “systemic inaction” for not restraining Aramco’s operations despite the apparent legal breaches, which the petitioner says has caused him financial loss and undermined fair competition.
After a preliminary hearing, Justice Azam Khan issued notices to all respondents, seeking their written replies. The case has been adjourned, with a future hearing date to be determined by the registrar office.
