The northern part of Colombo was facing a major flood, as the water level in the Kelani River continued to rise, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said.
The death toll had reached 159, with another 203 people missing, the DMC reported, following a week of heavy rains brought on by Cyclone Ditwah, which moved away from Sri Lanka on Saturday.
“Although the cyclone has left us, heavy rains upstream are now flooding low-lying areas along the banks of the Kelani River,” a DMC official said.



President Anura Kumara Dissanayake declared a state of emergency yesterday to deal with the aftermath of the cyclone and appealed for international aid.
India was the first to respond, sending relief supplies and two helicopters with crew to carry out rescue missions.
Japan said it will send a team to assess immediate needs and pledged further assistance.
While the rains have subsided across the island, several roads in the worst-affected central province remained inaccessible, the DMC said.
The extreme weather system has destroyed more than 20,000 homes and sent 122,000 people into state-run temporary shelters.
Another 833,000 people required assistance after being displaced by the floods.



Troops from the army, navy, and air force have been deployed alongside civilian workers and volunteers to assist with the relief effort.
Officials reported that about a third of the country remains without electricity or running water due to collapsed power lines and inundated water purification facilities. Internet connections have also been disrupted.
Pakistan extends relief assistance
On the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in coordination with the armed forces, launched a “comprehensive” relief assistance operation for Sri Lanka.
“A 45-member Army Urban Search & Rescue team, mobile field hospitals along with boats, life jackets, tents, blankets, infant milk, food packs and medicines will be dispatched via C-130 [tomorrow] from Noor Khan Airbase to Colombo,” the NDMA said on X shortly after 12am.
“Pakistan will continue to provide support to flood-hit Sri Lanka,” the NDMA affirmed.







Yesterday, the Pakistan Navy also delivered humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to Sri Lankan authorities at the Colombo port.
Aid included “food staples, MREs (meals ready to eat), dry rations, first‑aid kits and medicines, along with equipment”, the Navy said.
“This swift support underscores Pakistan Navy’s commitment to international obligations, regional stability and solidarity with friendly nations in their hour of need,” it noted.







Expressing his heartfelt condolences, PM Shehbaz had said Pakistan was ready to extend “any support in rescue, recovery and relief efforts as a symbol of our solidarity with our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters”.
Cyclone Ditwah has become Sri Lanka’s deadliest natural disaster since 2017, when flooding and landslides claimed more than 200 lives and displaced hundreds of thousands.
The worst flooding since the turn of the century occurred in June 2003, when 254 people were killed.</p><small>2025-11-30 07:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251628073602c4c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957070/governing-for-population-stabilisation-and-welfare' target='_blank'><strong>Governing for population stabilisation and welfare</strong></a><br><p>Population has long been viewed as a simple denominator — a way to calculate per capita resources and economic standing. But behind the numbers lies a more urgent reality: Pakistan’s 251 million people, with an income of $1,484 per capita and a growth rate of 2.5 per cent, are on track to swell to 386m by 2050.

This rapid surge will demand far more than headline figures can capture: more safe drinking water per capita, more doctors and hospital beds per capita, more schools and teachers per capita, more police per capita, and more electricity, gas, and essential services across the board.
Development policy and governance frameworks treat population as a core management indicator for assessing various deprivations and projecting future needs for economic growth and social development. In doing so, the literature on population studies and policies draws extensively from other fields of knowledge, including cultural studies, economics, public health, and institutional coordination theories.
One of the core arguments in this literature is that effective population policies, and the governance structures needed to support better population management, emerge from at least three conditions. First, they require a broad-based consensus within state governance and policy-making systems that population growth is a central policy priority.
Second, they depend on serious investment in healthcare infrastructure to ensure the delivery of family planning services and counselling.
Third, they necessitate long-term, sustained improvements in inclusive growth, particularly in education, mobility, and employment opportunities for women.
On this scale of population governance, Pakistan offers an interesting story of the rise and fall of management policies. It was one of the first countries, back in 1958, where civil society, and then the government in 1965, started talking about population management policy and the need to make population a centre point in economic planning.
The years from 1965 to 1975 are called the first push years. However, the years 1972–1981 witnessed a population growth spurt, while there was a progressive decline in public policies around population management until the late 1980s.

         View this post on Instagram            

Population policy specialists call the 1977 to 1988 era “the lost decade.” The fertility rate started to decline ten years later than the rest of South Asia (in the 1990s), while remaining at a higher level (4.1pc) with contraceptive prevalence rate levelling off around 30pc.
However, during 1989–98, Pakistan’s population welfare policy community witnessed a resurgence in emphasis on population under various initiatives such as the Social Action Programme, the Lady Health Workers Programme, the Planning Commission’s Vision 2030, among many others.
After the 18th Amendment in 2010, population welfare has been devolved to the provincial governments along with health, education, and women’s issues.
During a recent meeting at the Planning Commission, provincial and federal governments were found discussing “fragmentation” in population planning mechanisms, while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has emphasised the need for a unified national policy for population stabilisation and welfare.
Interestingly, during this period — and continuing today — South Asian states such as Bangladesh and India, as well as countries like Iran, achieved far stronger outcomes in slowing population growth. Their performance on building consensus around population measures, strengthening reproductive healthcare, and advancing women’s socio-economic status has consistently outpaced Pakistan’s.

However, Pakistan’s development paradigms could not find any substantial use of the population argument in five-year plans despite international donors and local non-governmental organisations laying emphasis on the need to do so.
At the institutional levels, the Ministry of Population Welfare and the Ministry of Health could not find a common ground, diverging from the turf war they keep fighting on various issues — healthy ageing being one of the latest.
Even the donors were not persistent in providing financial leverage to population services, and emphasis shifted to HIV/AIDS and polio eradication and other development priorities, leading to short-termism in addressing the larger population management question.
The fragmentation and inconsistency in policies and planning have led to patchy and/or near-absent institutional support to increasing contraceptive prevalence, bridging the unmet demand for child spacing services, and providing better reproductive health and mother and child healthcare services at the local levels, especially in the underserved areas.
It is sobering to note that Pakistan stands at 137 out of 166 countries on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Index, with troubling indicators in maternal and child health, education, and access to clean water.
The UNDP’s 2025 Human Development Report places Pakistan in the ‘low’ human development category, assigning it an HDI score of 0.544 and ranking it 168 out of 193 countries.
The last factor in population stabilisation and population welfare is very important and forms the positive feedback loop for social and economic change, which is associated with lowering fertility rates. This factor is the social and economic change in society.
Development economists argue that with changes in social and economic conditions, such as better education and an increase in employable skills among women, improvement in physical mobility conditions for women, and job creation, marriages can be delayed and the opportunity cost of raising children increased.
So, investment in girls’ education, mobility, and better business and employment conditions can help improve prospects of population management and lower the fertility rate close to two or replacement levels. Pakistan needs to put in a great deal of effort to form and execute public policies and investment frameworks in that direction.

 

While it is heartening to see that the three main political parties have incorporated various dimensions of population welfare and population management in their manifestos of 2024, and there is a Parliamentary Forum on Population, there is still a need to improve parliamentary oversight.
The federal and provincial commissions on the status of women, and the women’s ombudsman’s office, should be made an active part of such parliamentary forums, and a whole-of-government approach with active participation of civil society organisations must be developed. Last but not least, the Pakistan Health and Demographic Survey must be made a mandatory exercise to provide the required evidence base for population policy and governance.

Data compiled by research organisation Population Council, UK Aid and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) shows the average annual growth rate in Pakistan — based on data from 2017 to 2023 — is 2.55 per cent, resulting in a population of 241.5 million, making it the fifth most populous country in the world.
The country is on course to cross 300 million within the next five years and edge towards 400 million by 2050.
According to a DawnMedia press release, the two-day event will take place at the Serena Hotel.
The event will take stock of the situation in Pakistan, as it faces the challenges of rising population growth outpacing available resources.

 

“Urgent and serious action is required to bridge the growing gap between demographic increase and sustainable resource management. Recognising the crucial implications of a high population growth rate on Pakistan’s economy, social infrastructure, education, health, food and water security, and employment is critical,” it said.
The summit is aimed at bringing together politicians, economists, development specialists, and private-sector leaders to establish a practical pathway to long-term growth.
Notable speakers exp­ected to address the event include Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Finance Minister Muham­mad Aurangzeb, among others.
The summit is being organised by DawnMedia in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning, De­­v­­elopment and Special Ini­tiatives; the Ministry of Na­­tional Health Services, Regulations and Coordi­nation; the Sindh government, the KP government, UK International Deve­lopment and the World Bank Group as principal partners.
It is supported by the Karachi Water and Sewe­rage Corporation, while the Population Council and FCDO serve as strategic partners, while Pathfinder International, Population Services International, QZ Catalyst, and UNFPA contribute as knowledge partners. Ipsos and Repu Media-Acumen Media Intel­ligence also support the initiative as research partners.

Jhang Satellite Town police said the attackers managed to flee after the shooting.
Munir Sadhana was on the way to Jhang District Courts Complex when his car was attacked near Bilqees Hospital. As a result of firing, his driver Mumtaz Ahmad died instantly while Sadhana himself, shopkeeper and passer-by Mushtaq were shifted to Jhang District Headquarters Hospital where Sadhana and passer-by also succumbed to their injuries.
The lawyer was a close aide of former federal interior minister Syed Faisal Saleh Hayat, who was present at the hospital to receive the body of his friend along with relatives of the deceased.
Deputy Commissioner Ali Akbar Bhinder and DPO Bilal Kiani were also present. As soon as news of attack reached the courts, the lawyers started their strike.
In a press release, DBA President Mehr Muhammad Fareed Nawaz Naul has announced three working days of mourning over the assassination of Sadhana. He demanded the immediate arrest of the killers.
Till the filing of this report, no FIR was registered and the police said they had not received a complaint for registration of the case yet.
A large number of people, including lawyers, judges and government officers, attended the funeral prayers for Sadhana at Church Ground.
ACCIDENT: A motorcycle rider died and his two pillions were injured critically after a speeding car hit their two-wheeler near the FDA City gate on the Sargodha Road.
Nishatabad police identified the deceased as Ahmad Ali (19) of Chak 46-JB and injured as Naveed (18) and Nawaz (21). Both the injured were shifted to Allied Hospital. The car driver fled after the accident.
Meanwhile, a 22-year-old unidentified man died at Allied Hospital after being hit by a train near the graveyard of Chak Bhaiwala in Millat Town police area. He was crossing the track when he was hit by the train.
APPROVAL: The Provincial Development Working Party (PWDP) has approved the establishment of a landfill site for waste management in Faisalabad.
The landfill site, which will be established on 150 acres, at the locality of Lakwana located on the Makkuana-Khurianwala Road will have a capacity to dump 1,100 tonnes of waste every day while a plan for recycling waste/garbage is also included in it.
Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar said there was a dire need for a landfill site in Faisalabad and the approval of funds for it by the PWDP was a significant step. He said the work on this project would start soon.

The terrified local community nicknamed the animal ‘Osama bin Laden’, after the then-leader of the global terrorist organisation Al-Qaeda.
The Indian government eventually issued shoot-to-kill orders, and a professional hunter was contracted for the task. Aided by the people of the small Assamese town of Behali, the hunter successfully cornered the destructive elephant and shot it dead.
While most of the affected population celebrated the elephant’s demise, a significant number of sceptics arose. They argued that an innocent animal had been slain and that ‘Osama’ remained alive and active. This belief persisted even though the elephant was never seen again. The doubters continued to present ‘evidence’ suggesting it was alive and had likely gone into hiding.
In 2011, when the terrorist Osama bin Laden was shot dead by American Navy Seals, sceptics flooded social media sites to claim that a ‘body double’ of the terrorist had been killed and the real Osama was still alive. They argued that the decision by the Americans not to release graphic photos and DNA evidence was a reason for doubt. The US government stated the decision was made to avoid inciting further violence and to prevent the creation of a shrine, and that DNA evidence from family members confirmed the identity beyond a doubt.

While it is wise to question everything in the information age, questioning the obvious is not an exercise in critical thinking

Despite the abundance of evidence confirming that he was shot and his body disposed of in the open sea, and that he was never seen or heard from again, a small but persistent group of sceptics remains unconvinced. In 2019, an acquaintance with a PhD in economics insisted that bin Laden’s killing was a hoax and that he was still alive. When I challenged the convoluted theories he offered to support his claims, he accused me of undermining ‘critical thinking.’

 

Critical thinking requires one to think clearly and rationally, basing conclusions on facts and evidence rather than emotion or personal opinion. The economist in question did the exact opposite. He presented his opinion as fact and relied on his emotional desire to see a violent “challenger” to “American imperialism” succeed as his sole “evidence”. More than evidence, this was wishful thinking.
For years, academics and scholars have been bemoaning the gradual decline in people’s ability to apply critical thinking. According to the American online learning specialist Holly Burns, and many like her, this loss is driven by several factors. Modern information consumption favours speed and superficiality over depth and reflection; our current social and political environment rewards fast, emotional responses and conformity; and many educational systems prioritise standardised testing and recall at the expense of developing complex reasoning skills.
Then there are growing incidents of formulating conspiracy theories and presenting them as outcomes of critical thinking. This is what my economist friend was doing. In an article for the British Psychology Society, the journalist and author Emily Reynolds posited that the confusion between conspiracy theories and critical thinking stems from their shared starting point: both involve scepticism and rejection of official narratives.
Both their starting point is a sceptical question. But their routes to investigate or answer the question quickly bifurcate. Critical thinking is about looking for the most convincing answer backed by solid evidence, even if the evidence produces an answer that is not to the liking of the questioner. A conspiracy theorist’s quest is more about ‘unmasking’ a perceived conspiracy and discarding any evidence that fails to back the claim of a diabolical plot.
Critical thinking does not reject official claims outright — rather, it rigorously tests these claims against evidence before reaching a conclusion. In contrast, conspiracy theorists immediately reject official narratives and declare them as lies used to conceal a ‘truth’, often without any convincing counter-evidence. Their subsequent effort is almost entirely focused on ‘proving’ this predetermined conclusion.



In the 2025 issue of the Journal of Intelligence, Professor Oscar Eugenio Tamayo Alzate wrote that critical thinking is “epistemic”. It involves thinking about the nature of knowledge and how we justify beliefs. It is a process of inquiry focused on acquiring true beliefs, evaluating claims and understanding the limits of what we know. It requires an understanding of how we construct, evaluate and use knowledge.
According to a 2017 essay in Current Directions in Psychological Science, whereas critical thinking’s motivation is epistemic, conspiracy theories have “existential motives.”
Studies have shown that people are likely to turn to conspiracy theories when they are anxious and feel powerless. Conspiracy belief is strongly related to lack of social or political control.
This dynamic is compounded by the now widely accepted consensus within the scientific community that individuals with low analytical and critical thinking skills often overestimate their own competence. And these are the people more likely to shape or believe in conspiracy theories. They genuinely believe that their ability to question the mainstream narrative is a sign of high intelligence and insight. This ‘delusion’ feels reassuring to a person confused or disturbed by certain events.
The individual actively looks for information that supports his belief in a conspiracy, refusing to accommodate and even suspect any evidence to the contrary. The sense of power in them comes from the belief that, apparently, they have decoded something secretive, hidden and only known to a few.

 

The final boundary lies in what is being questioned. Last year, a well-known TV journalist shared a meme-like image of a turkey crossing the road while carrying a kitchen knife. The journalist asked, “Is this real?” Apart from the image being clearly amateurish and having the AI tool watermark visible, questioning it was not an exercise in critical thinking. Nor did it warrant a deep dive.
While it is wise to question everything in the information age, questioning the obvious is not critical thinking. There is more than enough evidence that Osama the terrorist and Osama the elephant are both permanently gone, confirmed by both official evidence and robust critical assessment. Questioning these assessments is like questioning the obvious. Turkeys don’t walk around carrying knives.
Questioning this is not a sign of critical thinking, but sloppy pretence. And maybe, even delusions about oneself, which often lead to conspiratorial beliefs.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Con­stitutional Court (FCC), the country’s newly-established apex forum for constitutional interpretation, apparently acting under the proviso of Article 208 of the Constitution made certain appointments in which some employees have been placed in the federal government’s Special Professional Pay Scale (SPPS) policy.
A notification issued by FCC earlier this week, and approved by Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, created eight senior posts — including one in BS-22 and seven in BS-21 — all placed in SPPS. Under SPPS-I, the pay package ranges from Rs1.5 million to Rs2m, almost equivalent to the salary of a high court judge.
However, senior federal officials familiar with service laws say the FCC administration has thus far not framed any rules under Article 208 and therefore, under the proviso to the said article, can only follow the Supreme Court Rules relating to the appointment of officers and servants of the SC.
Assigning the pay scales of SPPS to certain officers, without there being a similar provision in the related Supreme Court Rules, may raise issues as to the legality of the settled terms and conditions of officers and servants of FCC.
At present there are four types of pay packages for those being paid from the exchequer.
It includes the Basic Pay Scale, which applies to all the government sector; the Project Pay Scale, which covers the salaries of those working on specific projects of the government; the Management Pay Scale, also called the MP Scale for highly trained professionals; and SPPS, which was introduced to attract the highly paid experts of the private sector.
According to the FCC notification — issued under Article 208 of the Constitution — the court has created administrative posts, including: registrar (SPPS-I/BS-22) – one post, secretary to the chief justice (SPPS/BS-21) — one post, additional registrar (SPPS/BS-21) — six posts, deputy registrars (BS-20) — six posts, assistant registrars (BS-19) — 10 posts, senior private secretaries (BS-20) — five posts , research and reference officers (BS-19–20) — six posts, and a range of other positions from BS-16 to BS-2, including senior assistants, clerks, dri­­­vers, daftaris, qasids and sweepers.
The notification states that the expenditure will be met from FCC’s allocated budget for FY 2025-26.
‘Not permitted under SC Rules’
A senior court official told Dawn that the SPPS pay scales were incorporated into the notification without fully understanding the legal prerequisites, adding that a review was now under consideration.
The 27th Constitutional Amen­dment, which created FCC, amended Article 208 to clarify that till the court frames its own rules, the rules governing officers and servants of the Supreme Court shall apply mutatis mutandis.
The proviso read: “…till such time rules are made in this regard, the rules providing for the appointment of officers and servants of the Supreme Court and for their terms and conditions of employment shall mutatis mutandis apply to the officers and servants of the Federal Constitutional Court.”
A senior SC official confirmed that the court’s rules contained no provis­ion for SPPS appointments and did not permit high-salary contractual expert hiring structures of this nature.
The SPPS framework — detailed in the Establishment Division’s office memorandum of April 9, 2024 — lays out strict conditions for creating and filling the SPPS positions.
They include that the SPPS posts are for technical specialists, not regular bureaucracy. This means they require “highly skilled and specialised professional experts” in specific technical fields.
“It cannot be used to appoint registrars, secretaries, additional registrars or routine judicial administrators, who fall under regular service rules,” a senior official of the Establishment Division told Dawn.
Mandatory steps
As per the SPPS policy, before creating any posts, the sponsoring division must: establish that no equivalent expertise exists within sanctioned strength; prepare detailed terms of reference, job descriptions, job specifications, deliverables and timelines; and provide justification for hiring technical specialists under SPPS instead of management or regular service scales.
There is no indication that FCC conducted such a need assessment as it was not mentioned in the notification.
The SPPS recruitment must be competitive and widely advertised. The policy requires: national advertisement of vacancies; scrutiny by an internal committee; selection by a special selection board, which includes ministry officials and outside experts; and approval from the relevant minister or secretary depending on scale.
These steps are mandatory, but the FCC notification simply created the SPPS posts without initiating any recruitment process.
The SPPS appointments are contractual, not permanent, the policy read. It added that SPPS was strictly for two-year contracts, extendable only after performance evaluation. The FCC notification creates the posts as regular establishment positions, contradicting the SPPS structure.
FCC Registrar Mohammad Hafeezullah Khan told Dawn that the SPPS packages were “in accordance with the law”.
He argued that Article 208 empowered FCC to determine its own staffing structure.

“Due to the drop in the Karkheh Dam reservoir level, its power plant’s units were removed from the production circuit,” Amir Mahmoudi, the head of the dam and its power plant, said, according to state news agency IRNA.
He added that the water was subsequently released from the lower valves of the dam to meet the needs of people living downstream.
He said that the reservoir behind the dam is currently holding about one billion cubic metres of water, adding that “the current water level is 180 meters, which is 40 meters lower than the natural operating level” for electricity production.
The Karkheh Dam is one of the biggest earthen dams in the world and the largest in Iran and the Middle East, according to IRNA.
Built on the Karkheh River, it is located 22 kilometres (14 miles) northwest of the city of Andimeshk in the southwestern province of Khuzestan.
The development comes as the country faces one of its most severe droughts since records began six decades ago.
Iranian media have in past weeks reported that precipitation levels had de­creased by about 90 percent this year, compared with the long-term average.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin of the Department of Homeland Security said in a post on X that the suspect, Mohammad Dawood Alokozay, had uploaded a TikTok video showing himself assembling what he suggested was an explosive device. She said the video indicated that the Fort Worth area was his intended target.







Alokozay was arrested on Tuesday by the Texas Department of Public Safety and the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force and charged with making terroristic threats.
The arrest came less than 24 hours before the violent attack in Washington in which another Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, shot and critically wounded two members of the US National Guard. Lakanwal, who had been in the United States for more than a year, opened fire during a routine patrol near a residential neighborhood not far from the Capitol. Authorities described the shooting as a deliberate act of terror. He was taken into custody shortly afterward.

Suspect uploaded video on social media showing himself assembling ‘explosive device’

The two back-to-back incidents involving Afghan nationals have added urgency to President Donald Trump’s new immigration actions. The president has already announced a “reverse migration” initiative aimed at removing immigrants who “do not belong here or do not add benefit to our country”. He has also ordered federal agencies to conduct heightened security reviews of Afghans who entered the United States under Operation Allies Welcome, calling for a case-by-case reassessment of their status.
Trump has vowed a permanent halt to migration from all third world countries and directed his administration to reexamine every refugee, parole, and humanitarian program created during the Biden years. More directives are expected as agencies expand their scrutiny of recent arrivals.

The CDF position, created under the 27th Constitutional Ame­nd­ment, replaced the now-abolished office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, which formally ended on Nov 27. Officials and observers had expected the new notification to coincide with the abolition of the CJCSC post, but Nov 29 was seen as a critical marker being the date on which the original three-year tenure of the incumbent Army Chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, was set to expire.
Some legal experts had argued that without a new notification, FM Munir’s tenure could be interpreted as having lapsed.
However, a 2024 amendment to the Pakistan Army Act extended the tenure of the service chiefs to five years. That change included a “deeming” clause stating that the amendment “shall always be deemed to have been part of the Pakistan Army Act”, a formulation that legal minds say removed the requirement for a fresh notification extending the COAS tenure from three to five years.

Some legal experts argue tenure can be interpreted as having lapsed, others say no need for fresh notification after legal tweaks

Therefore, they contend, Nov 29 never constituted a legal cut-off.
Still, there is near consensus among security and legal officials that the creation of the CDF post, a new assignment rather than a continuation, does require a formal notification. Under the 27th Ame­ndment and subsequent changes to the Army Act, the army chief will simultaneously serve as the CDF for a five-year term.

 

Therefore, several security sources, when contacted, said the government would have to issue a new, public notification assigning the CDF role to Field Marshal Munir, unlike the quiet extensions recently granted to PAF chief Air Chief Marshal Zaheer-ud-din Babar and ISI director general Lt Gen Asim Malik.
However, the delay is widely seen as a sign of unresolved debates within the highest levels of government. According to individuals with insight into the discussions, one point under consideration is which date would be taken as the start of the COAS’s five-year tenure: November 2022 when FM Munir originally took command or November 2025 as had been broadly speculated after passage of the new legislation.
Another sensitive question is the extent of operational and command authority the CDF would exercise over the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy.
The government rapidly pushed the 27th Amendment through parliament earlier this month, but the notification setback has left top military leadership embarrassed and has complicated the transition to the restructured higher-defense framework, which military planners had hoped would be seamless.
Another pending decision is the appointment of the commander of the National Strategic Command, a new four-star position created to assume the nuclear manager role previously exercised by the CJCSC. Officials believe this appointment will be made only after the CDF notification is issued.
Meanwhile, the National Command Authority (NCA) Act still requires amendment to reflect the abolition of the CJCSC and the emergence of the CDF and NSC commander under Article 243. The changes are expected to be complex, particularly regarding the placement of the new posts relative to the PAF and PN chiefs and whether the air force and navy heads will retain representation in the NCA once their strategic commands are subsumed under a unified NSC commander.

In a statement issued in Geneva on Friday, the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society. He added that the “hastily adopted” amendments undermined judicial independence and raised concerns about military accountability.
A press release issued by the FO said that Pakistan rejected the “baseless” statement.
“Pakistan notes with deep concern the ungrounded and misplaced apprehensions aired on behalf of the UN high commissioner for human rights regarding the 27th Constitutional Amendment adopted by the two-third majority of the parliament of Pakistan,” the press release by the FO said.
“Like all parliamentary democracies, all legislation as well as any amendment to the Constitution remain the exclusive domain of the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan,” it added.
The FO said that democracy and democratic methods “form the bedrock of civil and political rights, and therefore must be respected”.
“The constitutional amendments adopted by the parliament of Pakistan followed due procedures as enshrined in Pakistan’s Constitution,” it said.
It added that Pakistan remained “fully committed to protecting, promoting and upholding human rights, human dignity, basic freedoms and the rule of law” as enshrined in the Constitution.
“While Pakistan gives due importance to the work of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, it is regrettable that Pakistan’s views and ground realities were not reflected in the statement issued,” the FO said.
“We urge the high commissioner to respect the sovereign decisions of Pakistan’s parliament and avoid commentary that reflects political bias and misinformation.”
The recent 27th Amendment was pushed through Parliament at top speed earlier this month amid widespread outcry. Among the top concerns are its overhaul of the judicial system via the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court, and changes to Article 243 positioning the army chief as the new Chief of Defence Forces at the top of Pakistan’s armed services.</p><small>2025-11-30 05:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/300918509d592d7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958213/kmc-plans-five-new-graveyards-as-existing-cemeteries-run-out-of-space' target='_blank'><strong>KMC plans five new graveyards as existing cemeteries run out of space</strong></a><br><p>• Four 500-acre graveyards to be established on city outskirts and one 25-acre within Karachi• Sindh govt is likely to approve mayor’s proposal soon• While burial charges are just Rs9,300 in KMC-run cemeteries, actual charged amount can run up to Rs150,000
KARACHI: Amid a burial-place crisis that could leave Karachi with nowhere to bury its dead by the year 2040, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has decided to establish four 500-acre graveyards on city outskirts and a new 25-acre graveyard within the metropolis.
The Sindh government has in principle agreed to this proposal and is likely to approve it soon.
The KMC’s plan came to the fore after repeated warnings that almost all city graveyards have run out of space for burial.
The situation has not only set off alarm bells but also exposed a set of troubling facts that are fast turning into a new challenge for Karachiites.
The sources said Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab pushed for the plan which got the provincial authorities’ nod after which the KMC could acquire plots at different locations.
“In recent meetings and back-to-back discussions between the two sides [the KMC and the Sindh government] it was finally decided that four major locations measuring around 500 acres each would be marked for the KMC graveyards at different city outskirts. A 25-acre piece of land has also been sought within the city which is also expected to receive a go-ahead from the Sindh government. The land within the city is expected to be marked near the newly built Shahrah-e-Bhutto,” said an official.
A KMC official said that the city has nearly 220 graveyards, of which 192 are formally allotted. Among the allotted graveyards, 173 are for Muslims and 19 for non-Muslims which included 12 Christian cemeteries and five Hindu cremation grounds.
“Of these allotted sites, 46 are overseen by the KMC, 20 are run by the Defence Housing Authority, various cantonments and government bodies, while 112 — 99 Muslim and 13 non-Muslim — are managed by social organisations, community groups and private entities. An additional 14 graveyards are operated by various institutions or individuals,” he added.
He said that amid complaints that old graves were being demolished to make room for new burial spaces, the KMC had already imposed a ban on burials in several major graveyards of the city, including Society Graveyard near Tariq Road, Model Colony Graveyard, Paposh Nagar Graveyard, Korangi No. 6 Graveyard, Yaseenabad Graveyard and Azeempura Graveyard. However, he acknowledged that the ban was not being fully enforced on any of these graveyards in practice.
With least focus of the law-enforcement agencies and deteriorating situation at most graveyards, the burial grounds are also fast becoming safe havens for drug traffickers and criminals, he added.
Another official said that the growing control of “mafias” on the city graveyards was not only a problem for Karachiites, but also had led to encroachments and illegal plotting, commonly known as “China-cutting”.
“The reality is that there is no space in the city’s well-known and traditional graveyards and this is the fact which KMC officials and certain other elements are exploiting,” said the official.
“If a family wishes to bury its loved one in a specific graveyard, only grave-related expenses can reach Rs100,000 Rs150,000. Most people are not even aware that at KMC-run graveyards, the grave and burial fee is just Rs9,300. But due to fast shrinking space, this job has become a mafia’s business. If the plan prepared and proposed by the Karachi mayor meets the reality, it would be a great relief for the Karachiites.”

Sources told Dawn that Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri is likely to tender his resignation early next week. He is also expected to visit the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) on Dec 2, a day before key developments in his pending degree-related case.
Justice Jahangiri is among the three IHC judges who removed their personal effects from the high court building over the past week as rumours intensified regarding their possible resignations following sweeping constitutional changes introduced through the 27th Amendment.
The three judges — Justices Jahangiri, Babar Sattar and Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan — had reportedly packed their belongings and shifted them home. According to the sources, Justice Jahangiri removed all books, documents, decorative items and other personal effects from his chamber, and even took back the furniture he had arranged himself.
The sources said informal directives to clear the chambers were relayed shortly after the 27th Amendment came into force. The amendment reshaped the judicial structure by creating the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and empowering authorities to transfer high court judges without their consent.

IHC bench to hear judge’s degree case on Dec 2

Justice Jahangiri is expected to make a final decision by Dec 1. His planned visit to the IHCBA on Dec 2 coincides with the hearing of a petition challenging the validity of his law degree — a matter now central to the controversy.
Insiders said his five-year term in judicial service will complete on Dec 30, and a resignation would take effect from Dec 31.
The petition questioning his LLB surfaced earlier this year when Justice Jahangiri was expeditiously hearing election petitions filed by PTI candidates who contested the February 2024 general elections.
Justice Jahangiri was one of the six IHC judges who wrote to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) last year alleging interference in judicial affairs by intelligence agencies. The letter sparked a wider debate on judicial independence and led to demands for an inquiry. Later, five of these judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — challenged the federal government’s decision to transfer three judges to the IHC earlier this year.
The transferred judges — Justices Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Asif — had been moved from the Lahore, Sindh and Balochistan high courts.
Justice Dogar later took oath as IHC chief justice. A constitutional bench of the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge on June 19, after which the petitioners approached the newly formed FCC, which also rejected their plea.
Degree case hearing
Meanwhile, an IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan is scheduled to hear the degree case against Justice Jahangiri on Dec 2. Although the IHC website initially listed the hearing for Dec 1, the case was shifted to the next day in a revised cause list.
It is believed that once the bench takes up the matter and issues notices after admitting the petition for regular hearing, the case would proceed to its logical end, and a resignation at that stage would not halt proceedings without proper judicial scrutiny.
Recently, the SJC continued proceedings against former Justice Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi despite his resignation, ultimately finding him guilty of misconduct and punishing him accordingly.
On Sept 16, the same bench barred Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial duties through an interim order. He then approached the Supreme Court in person.
On Sept 29, a five-member constitutional bench suspended the restraining order on the grounds that it had been issued without notice.
The next day, the bench set aside the order entirely, declaring it “null and void” and holding that a sitting judge could not be barred from judicial work through an interim directive.
The petition filed by Advocate Mian Dawood under Article 199 seeks a writ of quo warranto against Justice Jahangiri, arguing that his LLB from Karachi University is “invalid” and that his legal career and elevation are therefore unconstitutional — a jurisdiction rarely exercised in such matters.
Justice Jahangiri has not joined the separate petition filed by four IHC judges challenging the 27th Amendment.

LAHORE: Punjab Assembly Spea­­ker Malik Ahmad Khan has defended the 27th Constitution Amendment, describing it as a “necessary institutional reform aimed at reducing friction among constitutional bodies, clarifying judicial jurisdiction, and ensuring long-term administrative stability”.
Addressing the “Speaker Aur Awam” public engagement session here on Saturday, he said a major part of the discussion centered on the 27th Amendment. He said the amendment established a Federal Constitutional Court, introduced reforms to the transfer process for high court judges, created a commander for the new National Strategic Command, and provided legal protections to senior armed forces officials and the president.
“The amendment was necessary institutional reform aimed at reducing friction among constitutional bodies, clarifying judicial jurisdiction, and ensuring long-term administrative stability,” he reiterated.
He emphasised that the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court would help streamline constitutional cases, reduce overlapping mandates between courts, and promote greater judicial efficiency. Stability in constitutional interpretation, he argued, was essential for governance, economic continuity, and strengthening the federal structure.
Mr Khan also explained the role of the Punjab Assembly in shaping the lives of citizens through legislation, oversight, and representation. He highlighted the importance of youth participation in democracy, noting that the assembly’s legitimacy grew when the public — especially young people — engaged directly with elected representatives.
Defamation suit
Meanwhile, Malik Ahmad Khan was cross-examined on Saturday by counsel for incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan in a defamation suit filed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif against the ex-PM.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Yalmaz Ghani conducted the hearing of the Rs10 billion defamation suit.
The Punjab Assembly speaker appeared before the court to record his statement. Before testifying, he took an oath, stating that he would only speak the truth and that Almighty Allah would be displeased with him if he lied.
Malik Ahmad told the court that he has political and party affiliation with PM Shehbaz. He said the PTI founding chairman had levelled allegations in April 2017, which were aired on various television channels. He said the allegations were baseless and misleading, adding that they were repeated in a private TV programme and during a rally at an Islamabad playground.
The speaker stated that the propaganda, accusations and false statements were aimed at damaging PM Shehbaz’s reputation.
Responding to queries from the defendant’s counsel, he said he has also practised law and filed cases in the past. In reply to another question, he said the allegations were made in Islamabad and Peshawar, not in Punjab. However, he said he had heard them on TV channels in Lahore.
The PTI founder’s counsel asked whether, under defamation law, the suit should have been filed in Islamabad. The speaker replied that it was the prerogative of the plaintiff’s lawyers to decide where the suit should be filed.
To another query, Malik Ahmad said that to his knowledge the Panama leaks included names of individuals with offshore investments.
He expressed ignorance when asked if Imran Khan or Nawaz Sharif had filed any petition in the Supreme Court regarding the Panama leaks.
He acknowledged that former PM Nawaz Sharif was convicted and disqualified.
The judge adjourned the hearing for recording testimonies of more witnesses on Dec 13.
Previously, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar had also been cross-examined in the defamation suit.
In his suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran Khan levelled baseless allegations against him. He sought a decree for recovery of Rs10 billion as compensation from the defendant for publication of defamatory content.

In patriarchies such as ours, just staying alive can be a struggle. The attitude towards women was best reflected in the remarks of an honourable member of the Federal Constitutional Court.
The honourable justice, inter alia, appeared to blame ‘live-in relationships’ among the ‘elite’ for the evil and depraved murder of a young woman who was forcibly detained against her will by a male friend, murdered and beheaded by him in a fit of rage because he could not exercise control over her.
The judgement was penned when His Lordship was still a member of the Supreme Court of Pakistan where the murderer’s appeal against his death sentence by a lower court was heard. To the public’s relief, the sentence was upheld, despite the remarks in the written verdict that may have been wholly out of place and unnecessary.

 

We have had many a legislation — from tweaks to constitutional amendments — mainly to benefit the very few who occupy the highest point of the power pyramid.

For women in this country, the challenges are that much harder and life that much coarser.

But what about the awam, the people, millions of whom live below the poverty line? They work hard, harder than you or I could imagine, and yet face the heartbreak everyday at not being able to put enough food on the table for their families.
If you happen to be a woman, your challenges are that much harder, life that much coarser. Normally, I don’t include emails that Dawn readers send me but today I felt compelled to for two reasons. The first is to remind the practitioners and advocates of our patriarchy to pause and yet again see how intellectually astute our young women are and, second, of course, in the hope that these thoughts are heard, to have an impact. (I have altered some of the content to ensure that the identity of the writers is protected).
Here is the first: “I don’t quite know why I find myself writing to you; it’s something I have never felt compelled to do with any other writer. Perhaps it’s because I believe you would understand the emotions I’m trying to express but cannot fully capture in words.
“I was reading your Dawn piece on the 27th Amendment, and it left me feeling deeply sad. Though, to be honest, that feeling has been building for days. As a girl from an orthodox Baloch family, I have had to fight against and break so many toxic generational cycles. I used to believe that education would give me wings and open up a life I had always dreamed of. But witnessing the state of affairs in this country, my hope is beginning to fade. There are days when I want to leave the country, but I know escape isn’t the answer. I have known that since childhood.
“Every day when I pick up the newspaper, my heart sinks. Where have we come to as human beings? Everything feels bleak and heavy. From Gaza to Sudan, and then the heartbreak unfolding closer to home in Balochistan, I feel as though humanity has been abandoned. I keep wondering why and when mankind fell from grace into such cruelty and darkness.
“I’m sorry for the unsolicited rant, I just feel very lost right now, and don’t quite know whom to share these thoughts with. From what I have sensed through your writings, you seem to be someone with humanity … And for people like me, who’re clinging to even a speck of compassion in these dark times, it means more than you may realise. Kindness and respect have become hard to find lately.
“So, thank you for sharing your compassion and wisdom with people like me who’re struggling to find their way.”
This young woman, without argument, writes better than I’d ever hope to and has intellectual nous and wisdom that should place her among the intellectual elite of our blighted country. Despite her despondency, she remains resolute to continue the fight. She also has the humour to insinuate I have wisdom.
The second letter is equally worthy of consideration but here, understandably, hopelessness is dictating a different path.
“I am writing to express my deep concern and confusion after reading your recent article regarding The Jailed Leader [sic]. It left me reflecting on my own experience during the protest on that cold day, when innocent people in our community were brutally killed at their workplaces. Instead of receiving support and empathy, we were called blackmailers and our genuine fears and needs were dismissed. [The reference here is to the Hazara murders in January 2021].
“This raises a painful question for me: isa leader truly worthy of leadership if he can sacrifice minorities for political convenience? Are we, as minorities, not considered human enough to deserve safety, dignity, and a peaceful life?
“As someone belonging to the Hazara community of Balochistan, these experiences are not new. Despite being born and raised in this country, despite studying at one of our country’s top educational institutions and contributing to society, I constantly feel alienated. Even basic legal documentation such as CNICs and passports becomes an unnecessary struggle. While other provinces receive adequate facilities and support, our region continues to lag behind in even the most fundamental necessities.
“It pains me to say this, but I am reaching a point where I no longer see a future for myself in this country. The nation I call home has repeatedly failed to protect us or acknowledge our suffering. Therefore, I am seriously considering leaving next year in search of a place where minorities are accepted, valued, and protected.
“I hope my words are taken as a sincere plea for reflection, not hostility. I still believe that a nation is strengthened when all its people are treated with dignity — especially, its most vulnerable.”
To these words steeped in anguish and wisdom, I can add nothing except to say let women run our country if there is to be any hope.

QUETTA: Seven blasts rocked Quetta and Dera Murad Jamali on Saturday, with one explosion blowing up a section of railway track near the provincial capital and suspending train traffic to other parts of the country.
The first blast took place near a police checkpost on Qambrani Road, where unidentified atta­ckers hurled a grenade. The device exploded but caused no loss of life.
Police said the second blast occurred shortly afterwards on the same road, when armed men detonated a motorcycle carrying an improvised explosive device (IED) as a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) vehicle passed by, carrying bomb disposal squad personnel to the site of the first explosion.
“Miscreants planted an IED on the motorbike and detonated it with a remote control when the CTD vehicle was passing through the area,” SSP Operations Capt (retd) Asif Khan told Dawn, adding that the CTD vehicle escaped the blast and no casualties were reported in either attack.
SSP Khan said two more explosions were reported in the evening. “One blast took place on the railway track near Lohr Karez, on the outskirts of Quetta, which blew up the main line connecting Quetta with other parts of the country,” he said.

No casualties reported; seven explosions occur in Quetta, Dera Murad Jamali

Police said an IED had been planted on the track and was detonated shortly before a train was exp­e­c­ted to arrive in Quetta. “Around one and a half feet of the track was blown up in the blast,” an official added. Rail traffic was suspended while repair work was initiated.
In another incident, unknown motorcyclists hurled a grenade at Manzoor Shaheed Police Station, but the device failed to explode. A bomb disposal squad later defused it.
Later in the evening, unidentified attackers hurled another grenade in the Kechi Beg area at a police patrol. The grenade exploded, but no casualties were reported.
Meanwhile, armed men also targeted a police vehicle at DC Chowk in Dera Murad Jamali by throwing a grenade.
The device did not explode and was defused by the bomb disposal squad. Police said the vehicle was on routine patrol when it came under attack.
In yet another incident late on Saturday night, unidentified armed men attacked the camp of a construction company in Quetta’s Sariab area.
Police said motorcyclist hurled a grenade at the site, damaging mac­h­inery and injuring a security guard, who was shif­ted to the Civil Hospital. The company is currently engaged in the construction of Sariab Road.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the incidents.

More than fear itself, there is a silence sharpening both itself and its people, an eerie quiet that tightens its grip with each passing day. Security anxieties hang heavily in the air.
Multiplied checkpoints, road blockades, intermittent internet shutdowns, school closures triggered by security alerts, restrictions on movement in ‘sensitive’ zones, netted fortifications draped over key government buildings, and the saddening return of Afghan refugees have all together turned Quetta into a city of unsettling tension.

 

Quetta was never like this. Whatever unfolded in Balochistan, whatever the security climate, the city always retained its colour and pulse. People complained, expressed anger in private and public, argued with fate, and then returned to life. What Quetta has lost in the past year is that rhythm. People no longer express outrage: they no longer protest against the tightening constraints around them. They simply stay quiet. They move through life in silence, and that silence is the city’s greatest tragedy.
If Ahmed Faraz were alive, perhaps he would have written a shehr-i-ashoob for this moment. Yet the government finds comfort in this quiet, mistaking it for stability. The numbers, after all, appear to be on its side.
Quetta witnessed only 10 terrorist attacks by nationalist insurgents this month, all of low intensity, resulting in six injuries. However, over the last three months, 52 attacks attributed to nationalist insurgents were reported across the province, claiming 49 lives. The bleak side of this picture is that these groups have expanded their operational footprint, particularly into Sindh. A recent ambush in Hyderabad by the Baloch Republican Guards on a police unit underscores that the threat continues to evolve, becoming more diffuse and posing increasing challenges for kinetic responses.
The insurgents have expanded their raids across the province, including abducting individuals accused of spying or disrupting local intelligence networks. These abductions reportedly occurred during raids on the homes of suspected informants at different places. The insurgent groups have also intensified their psychological warfare by staging scattered road blockades in remote regions and temporarily seizing major highways. The road blockades may exert greater pressure on the state than repeated terrorist attacks.
Nevertheless, the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) deserve credit for containing the threat to some extent, whether by forcing tactical retreats, disrupting logistical networks, or limiting the insurgent groups’ operational capacity. Non-kinetic measures, of course, are not their primary mandate. Yet here lies another tragedy: the authority in the security institutions lacks a coherent non-kinetic approach to addressing the problem.

Quetta’s people move through life in silence, and that silence is the city’s greatest tragedy.

What worries the LEAs most is that, in the absence of a non-kinetic approach, reliance on kinetic measures continues to grow. This not only deepens the trust deficit between the LEAs and ordinary citizens but also ultimately weakens the flow of intelligence about the enemy. People remain silent, avoiding alignment with either state or non-state actors, and prefer not to reveal their loyalties.
The hybrid nature of the state inherently prevents it from gauging the depth of public disappointment. For them, such discontent is difficult to quantify, and meeting citizens’ expectations requires effective delivery and functioning political, economic, judicial and social systems. Silence, therefore, is not a sign of success; it can instead reflect a deeper, unspoken pain within society.
Although the number of terrorist attacks has decreased, the disappearance of young people continues. This may contribute to the prevailing silence, but it also intensifies the province’s collective trauma. With the leadership of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) behind bars, few voices remain to protest.
Silence has become the order of the day. Still, those enforcing it remain fearfully alert to even the smallest movement. November holds symbolic significance for many non-violent nationalist groups and armed separatist networks, both inside the province and across the diaspora.
This is due to bitter memories tied to this month. In anticipation of potential violence in the capital, the Balochistan government banned all intra-provincial passenger transport, including coach and train services. It also restricted cellular and data networks across many districts. Partial suspensions were enforced in major cities, and educational institutions in the capital were closed. Measures planned for mid-month lasted until end November. Now, people worry that these steps could become routine since there is no resistance from locals, other regions, or civil society, which was once expected to support them.
What the common man says does not matter to the power corridors; the nationalist political parties have been sidelined both by the state and insurgents, and the remaining space has been captured by the BYC. The religious parties are in confusion about which side they should take, as the state’s hard-line policy in the province is difficult for them to digest. In such a scenario, one can imagine that the insurgents are the beneficiaries, and the contest is becoming one that is directly with the state, as the middle ground is disappearing fast.
Amid the prevailing chaos, the common people have not lost their composure; they still believe that the province’s problems can be resolved through peaceful means, rooted in dialogue and engagement with all stakeholders. One issue that an ordinary person readily identifies is the province’s political economy. Destabilising actors thrive along the conflict fault lines that stretch from the Afghan and Iranian borders through Sherani-Zhob and down towards the Hub district.
People know well who these spoilers are. What they struggle to understand is why state institutions fail to acknowledge them, or worse, why they continue to rely on them. Perhaps someone holds the answer, but in this season of silence, no one dares to speak aloud. Those who remain silent simply watch and hope that someone will interpret their silence and offer a remedy for the pain that has settled deep into their souls.

KYIV/MOSCOW: Ukrainian Presi­d­ent Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday that a delegation headed by security council secretary Rustem Umerov was on its way to the United States to continue talks on an agreement to end Russia’s war.
Umerov has been put in charge of the Ukrainian delegation after the previous lead negotiator, Zelensky’s powerful chief of staff Andriy Yermak, resigned on Friday hours after anti-corruption detectives searched his apartment.
Zelensky said he expected that the res­ults of previous meetings with the US in Geneva, which took place last weekend, would now be “hammered out” on Sunday.
Those meetings allowed Ukraine to present a counter-offer to proposals laid out by US Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll to leaders in Kyiv almost two weeks ago.
“Rustem delivered a report today, and the task is clear: to swiftly and substantively work out the steps needed to end the war,” Zelensky wrote on X.







Yermak told the New York Post hours after his resignation that he was “going to the front”. “I am an honest and decent person,” he said.
Russian oil terminal
One of Russia’s largest oil terminals halted operations on Saturday following an attack by sea drones.
The Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), a group that includes US oil majors Chevron and ExxonMobil and which owns the terminal, called the strike a “terrorist attack”.
Ukraine, which did not comment on the incident, has sought to punch back against its neighbour as the war grinds through its fourth year.
“As a result of a targeted terrorist attack by unmanned boats at 4:06am Moscow time (6:06 PKT) single Mooring Point 2 (SMP-2) sustained significant damage,” the CPC said in a statement on Telegram.
“Further operation of SMP-2 is not possible. Loadings at the terminal will be carried out in accordance with established rules once the drone threats are lifted,” it added.
The CPC pipeline, which begins in Kazakhstan and ends at the terminal, is a major conduit for Kazakh oil and one of the world’s largest by volume, handling around one percent of global supplies.
A Ukrainian source, meanwhile, clai­m­ed responsibility for attacks on two oil tankers in the Black Sea allegedly cover­tly transporting sanctioned Russian oil.
The two ships, the Virat and the Kairos, were rocked by explosions off Turkey’s coast late Friday, according to the Turkish transport ministry. One of the two was struck again early Saturday, the ministry said.
“Modernised Sea Baby naval drones successfully targeted the vessels,” a source in Ukraine’s SBU security service told AFP.
The source shared a video that purported to show sea drones gliding towards the two ships, before sparking explosions.
Kazakhstan’s energy ministry said on Saturday it had activated a plan to redirect oil exports to alternative routes after the CPC halted operations following the Ukrainian naval drone attack. Kazakhstan’s energy ministry called the attack unacceptable.
Strikes on Ukraine
The attack came as vast Russian overnight attack on Ukraine killed three people and wounded nearly 30, officials said on Saturday, with more than 600,000 households left without power after strikes on the grid.
President Zelensky said Russia had launched around 36 missiles and nearly 600 drones in the attack.
AFP journalists in Kyiv reported a night of intense explosions that kept many in the capital awake.
In the morning, reporters saw burned out cars and apartment buildings charred from fire.
Russia, which denies targeting civilians, says it struck energy infrastructure powering the Ukraine’s military-industrial complex.

Whatever it may think of Imran Khan today, the fact remains that he is a former prime minister and, as such, entitled to basic dignity during his incarceration.
Arbitrarily cutting off his access to family and lawyers appears intended to inflict psychological pressure. This is a tactic that should not be countenanced in a just society. To be fair, Mr Khan himself, while in power, demonstrated little concern for the rights of his political opponents. He repeatedly used abusive language against them and even publicly threatened to withdraw basic amenities from the jail cell of his principal rival, Nawaz Sharif.
But while there is no denying that his conduct set a poor precedent, it should not now be used as justification for the treatment he is receiving under a government led by Mr Sharif’s party. If anything, this cycle of score-settling only underscores how little separates major political parties when it comes to the misuse of state authority.

 

It may be noted that the courts have issued orders on several occasions allowing Mr Khan’s family and lawyers to meet the jailed leader. In most instances, however, these orders have been ignored and dismissed by the prison authorities, who, it seems, answer to some higher powers. With the courts appearing helpless in enforcing their writ, Mr Khan’s family and supporters are quite understandably growing increasingly frustrated.
Things have taken a particularly concerning turn since some publications in hostile countries recently published articles alleging that Mr Khan may have been grievously harmed in custody. Though such news appears to be fabricated and aimed at agitating Mr Khan’s supporters, it has still sparked some concern for his general well-being in his family. It is unkind of the government to not allow them to at least satisfy themselves regarding his health, even if it wants to prevent lengthy conferences.
Prisoners in Punjab, including political detainees, are generally allowed five visitors per week and 30 minutes of phone time under the jail manual. There is no defensible reason why a public figure like Mr Khan should be denied these basic privileges.
Leaving such decisions to the personal discretion of a jail superintendent reflects poorly on the current government, whose cabinet members have repeatedly tried to justify such actions, but only end up deepening the impression of vindictiveness.
Pakistan’s political class has, for decades, sent each other to jail. If they cannot break this cycle, they can at least agree on a minimal standard for how political prisoners should be treated, regardless of which party happens to be in power. Anything less will merely ensure that today’s enforcers become tomorrow’s victims, and that no one ever learns from the past.

“Our position on the stabilisation force is clear that its main mandate must be monitoring the ceasefire on the ground to ensure that both sides abide by their commitments, and securing the borders of Gaza,” he said while talking to Dawn shortly after landing in Islamabad for a two-day visit during which he would discuss with Pakistani leaders a wide agenda — from consultations on conflicts, including Gaza and Sudan, and the dispute over the Iranian nuclear programme, to ways of intensifying economic cooperation.







His comments came after Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar disclosed publicly for the first time that Islamabad had conveyed to international partners its willingness to contribute troops to the stabilisation force.
Much like Pakistan’s position that seeks to avoid involvement in the controversial issue of disarming Hamas, Abdelatty said the details of the force were still being negotiated.
“We are working with various partners, including the United States, to agree on a specific mission and mandate which should be focused on peacekeeping, not peace enforcement.
“We must agree on the countries that will contribute troops, the mission, the mandate, the guarantees, and the safeguards,” he said, noting that everything remained under discussion.
Abdelatty said Egypt is hosting a reconstruction conference on Gaza and looked to Pakistan for an expanded role.
“Regarding Gaza, we need everything from Pakistan, not only funding, but also participation from private companies in reconstruction and recovery efforts. We also need technical assistance and medical support. There are 50,000 medical cases in Gaza that require urgent intervention.
“We are expecting a more engaged role from your great country,” he added.
Abdelatty noted that both Pakistan and Egypt viewed the realisation of a Palestinian state as the only path to sustainable peace.
Gaza is not the only conflict on his agenda.
“We are also discussing other issues, including Sudan, where the situation is disastrous. We must intensify efforts to stop this ugly war and the killing of civilians.
“The same applies to other regional files, including the Iranian nuclear issue. We need de-escalation, dialogue and peaceful settlement of disputes. Egypt and Pakistan share the same views. We believe in de-escalation with Iran, resuming peaceful processes, and upholding the principles of international law and the UN Charter.
“There are no military solutions, only political and peaceful ones. We must work together for de-escalation.”
On the bilateral front, he called for scaling up economic ties. He said both countries must double trade volume, boost mutual investments, and strengthen South-South cooperation.
He noted proposals under discussion, including reformulating the Pakistan-Egypt Business Council and convening a business forum in either Karachi or Cairo to connect the private sectors of both countries.
He said Egypt and Pakistan should enhance cooperation in energy, textiles, food processing, agriculture, information technology, digitisation, artificial intelligence and petrochemicals, while also expanding collaboration on counter-terrorism, combatting illegal migration and trafficking, and pursuing defence cooperation centred on technology transfer and joint projects.</p><small>2025-11-29 18:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636442-egyptian-foreign-minister-arrives-in-islamabad-on-two-day-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Egyptian foreign minister arrives in Islamabad on two-day visit</strong></a><br><p>

The alleged closure of the trust’s bank account was widely discussed on social media, with some voicing concern that it could affect patients.
However, SKMT assured its donors that it was making efforts to unfreeze the bank accounts and would ensure the uninterrupted supply of medicine to its patients.
“We would like to reassure our donors and supporters that the vast majority of our bank accounts are fully operational, and we continue to receive donations without any disruption. A small number of our accounts have had restrictions placed on them, and we are working to have these lifted at the earliest. We expect that these restrictions will be removed soon.”
It further confirmed that all patient care and treatment services continued uninterrupted.







SKTM is a charitable organisation established under the Societies Registration Act XXI of 1860 of Pakistan and launched by PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan.
It operates the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centres in Lahore and Peshawar, with construction underway for a third location in Karachi.</p><small>2025-11-29 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636444-pia-says-its-airbus-jets-perfectly-safe-as-global-airlines-rush-to-fix-software-glitch' target='_blank'><strong>PIA says its Airbus jets 'perfectly safe' as global airlines rush to fix software glitch</strong></a><br><p>

Chasing a modest 115 for victory, the hosts came home in 18.4 overs thanks to Saim (36 off 33 balls).
Babar (37 not out off 34) played an exquisite cut shot through point off pacer Dushmantha Chameera for a boundary to complete a well-deserved victory.







Mohammad Nawaz won the Player of the Match, as well as Player of the Series.
“To deliver when the team requires you is very important,” he said in the post-match presentation.
“I plan with the coaches and try to keep it simple because as a fingerspinner, you don’t have many options. So I try to read the game and bowl accordingly.
Speaking on his batting, he said: “I try to see what the situations demands: to build a partnership or attack. So I try to play accordingly.“







Skipper Salman Agha was pleased with his side’s performance ahead of the World Cup.
“It was a great performance from us. This has been very good two months for us, against South Africa and Sri Lanka. We have been doing well in both ODIs and T20Is,” he said after the match.
“Before going to the World Cup, you want your 15 ready. If anything happens to your main players, you want to have the back-up ready. So we are giving chances to everyone.
“I think we are pretty much ready for the World Cup. We still have six games before the World Cup to try out things if we want but think we are pretty much clear on our 15 players.”
Sri Lanka skipper Dasun Shanaka said his side needed to fine-tune their game ahead of the next series.
“We expected the wicket to play better than this but they also bowled well in the middle overs. We couldn’t have taken some chances: right-handers getting out to the left-arm spinner and left-hander to offspinner,” he said after the match.
“We need to fine-tune our game ahead of the next series. Mishara, Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Chameera, Maheesh, Hasaranga were the positives. And we showed good intent int he field.“
Earlier, Pakistan bowlers made a spectacular comeback to dismiss Sri Lanka for a paltry 114.
After being sent in to bat, Shanaka’s side dominated the proceedings in the first half of their innings, reaching a solid 81-1 in 10 overs before they faced a dramatic collapse.
Spinners Mohammad Nawaz (3-17), Abrar Ahmed (2-18) and Saim Ayub Ayub (1-17) checked the Sri Lankan progress while fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi (3-18 off three overs) mopped up the tail.
The Sri Lankans were eventually dismissed in 19.1 overs when pacer Salman Mirza cleaned up Dushmantha Chameera.

The extreme weather system has destroyed more than 20,000 homes, sending 108,000 people to state-run temporary shelters, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) reported.
A further 798,000 people required assistance after being temporarily displaced by the floods, DMC spokesman Pradeep Kodippili said.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake invoked emergency powers, granting him sweeping authority to manage the aftermath of the devastation caused by a week of torrential rain across the island.
Kodippili confirmed that 153 people had been killed.



Among them were 11 residents of an elder care home that was flooded in the north-central district of Kurunegala on Saturday afternoon, police said.
Troops from the army, navy, and air force have been deployed alongside civilian workers and volunteers to assist with the relief effort.
The military rescued 69 bus passengers on Saturday, including a German tourist, who had been stranded in the Anuradhapura district after a 24-hour operation.
One of the passengers, speaking from the hospital, described how navy sailors helped them climb onto the roof of a nearby house after using ropes to guide them safely through the floodwaters.
“We were very lucky … while we were on the roof, part of it collapsed… three women fell into the water, but they were helped back onto the roof,” said WM Shantha.
A helicopter had to abort an initial rescue attempt because the downdraft from its rotors threatened to blow away the roof they were perched on. They were later rescued by naval boats.
Roads in the central district of Badulla remained inaccessible, leaving many villages cut off and relief supplies unable to get through.
“We lost two people in our village … others are sheltering in a temple and a house that is still standing,” said Saman Kumara from the Badulla village of Maspanna, one of the worst-hit districts.
“We can’t leave the village, and no one can come in because all roads are blocked by landslides. There is no food, and we are running out of clean water,” he told News Center website by telephone.
No clean water
Officials said about a third of the country was without electricity or running water because power lines had collapsed and water purification facilities were inundated. Internet connections were also disrupted.
Cyclone Ditwah moved away from the island on Saturday and was heading towards neighbouring India.
India’s Chennai Airport cancelled 54 flights due to the cyclone’s approach, with the weather department forecasting extremely heavy rainfall and strong winds over the next 48 hours.
The Sri Lankan government has issued an appeal for international aid and urged Sri Lankans abroad to make cash donations to support affected communities.
India was the first to respond, sending two plane loads of relief supplies and two transport helicopters, along with a rescue crew of 22.An Indian warship, which was already in Colombo on a previously planned goodwill visit, donated its rations to assist the victims.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences over the loss of lives in Sri Lanka and said New Delhi was prepared to send more aid.







Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan was ready to extend “any support in rescue, recovery and relief efforts as a symbol of our solidarity with our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters”.
“Pakistan stands in solidarity with the people and government of Sri Lanka in this hour of grief,” he said.







The Pakistan Navy delivered humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to Sri Lankan authorities at Colombo.
“This swift support underscores Pakistan Navy’s commitment to international obligations, regional stability and solidarity with friendly nations in their hour of need,” it said.







Flooding in low-lying areas worsened on Saturday, prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders for residents living along the banks of the Kelani River, which flows into the Indian Ocean from Colombo.While rain had eased in most parts of the country, including the capital, the island’s north was still experiencing showers.The cyclone has become Sri Lanka’s deadliest natural disaster since 2017, when flooding and landslides claimed more than 200 lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people.The worst flooding since the turn of the century occurred in June 2003, when 254 people were killed.</p><small>2025-11-29 17:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/29173654d43694b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958161/islamabad-court-completes-prosecution-witness-examination-in-mazari-chattha-social-media-case' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court completes prosecution witness examination in Mazari-Chattha social media case</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad district and sessions court on Saturday completed the examination of prosecution witnesses in the controversial social media post case against lawyer and rights activist Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Advocate Hadi Ali Chattha.
The case against Imaan and Hadi was registered on the accusations of attempts to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
During the previous hearing, Imaan and Chattha had objected after the apparent vanishing act of the court-appointed lawyer representing them in the case and the appointment of a new counsel.
Two days prior, the counsel appointed by the court had refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying that he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
The hearing today — held amid tense exchanges between police officials and lawyers — resumed with the state counsel continuing the witness examination process, where five witnesses appeared before the presiding judge, Additional District and Sessions Judge Afzal Majoka.
As the proceedings began, Advocate Chatha opened his counter-arguments by informing the court that he had forgotten his case file after learning that arguments were beginning without his presence. He said he had subsequently retrieved the file, adding that the prosecution had not addressed several points he had raised earlier.
He clarified that he never argued that the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) was the “appropriate forum” in the matter. Instead, he said, his contention was that two official approvals were required before any inquiry could be initiated under the law.
Judge Majoka remarked that if there was ambiguity regarding the authority of the concerned officer, the 2025 amendment could be examined.
“What power was used while issuing the standard order?” the judge asked, observing that the standard order “is not in accordance with the 2018 rules”.
Advocate Mazari argued that similar cases had earlier been registered against journalists, after which directions were issued by the Islamabad High Court. Chattha further contended that the prosecution had failed to specify the timing of the alleged posts, adding that some screenshots were from 2021 while his current account was created in January 2025.
Showing his account to the judge, he maintained that “no tweet can be used against me” from a period before the creation of the account.
He added that all four charges framed against him and Imaan referenced 2021, even though his current account did not exist at that time. Citing various court judgments, he requested his acquittal. After hearing his arguments, Judge Majoka reserved the decision and later announced that the acquittal application stood rejected.
Following the rejection, the court moved to the evidence stage and summoned prosecution witnesses for cross-examination. At this point, Advocate Mazari informed the court that her counsel was not present. When the judge directed her to call her counsel, Mazari responded that the lawyer in question was not representing her.
This sparked a bitter exchange between Mazari, Advocate Chatha and the state counsel.The state counsel complained that he was being subjected to verbal hostility.
Judge Majoka warned the accused not to disrupt proceedings, telling them he would remove them from the courtroom if necessary. He summoned the ladies’ police and moved the state counsel to the rostrum to proceed with the cross-examination.
However, tensions escalated further when Mazari told the judge: “This is a military court,” and subsequently accused the state counsel of being a “tout”.
The judge ordered both accused to be removed from the courtroom, and police officers escorted them out. Lawyers and police personnel exchanged harsh words in the courtroom afterwards, and the atmosphere remained volatile.
Proceedings resumed after a brief break. Advocate Mazari filed an acquittal application and sought its immediate hearing, but the judge rejected the request and issued notices instead.
Chattha told the court he had repeatedly attempted to contact their counsel, but he could not reach the court. The judge directed the state counsel to proceed with cross-examination in the absence of the defence counsel.
The state counsel then examined witnesses Aneesur Rehman, Shahroz, Waseem, and Imran Haider. The fifth and final witness, Afzal, arrived late, prompting the judge to warn that he would close the evidence stage if the witness did not appear.
The prosecution assured the court that the witness was on his way, and once Afzal arrived, his testimony was recorded, completing the prosecution’s evidence.
At the conclusion of the examination process, the judge directed the prosecution to prepare and submit the questionnaire under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to the accused.
“You are being given the questionnaire; you must submit your answer,” the judge said, adding that if the accused failed to submit their responses, the state counsel would be responsible for doing so.
The court directed the prosecution to submit the completed questionnaire by December 4 and adjourned the hearing until the same date.</p><small>2025-11-29 17:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636440-finland-to-shut-embassies-in-pakistan-other-countries-for-strategic-reasons-next-year' target='_blank'><strong>Finland to shut embassies in Pakistan, other countries for 'strategic' reasons next year</strong></a><br><p>

The recall of 6,000 planes, covering more than half of Airbus’ global A320-family fleet, is among the broadest in its 55-year history and is a blow for the planemaker weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model.
“PIA has confirmed that its entire A320 fleet is not affected by this Airbus alert. PIA’s Engineering and Maintenance department is closely monitoring their fleet’s airworthiness, ensuring safe operations,” said a statement by the airlines spokesperson issued today.
Meanwhile, airlines worked through the night to make fixes after Airbus issued the emergency recall to 350 operators around the world, and global regulators directed carriers to remedy the software problem before resuming flights.
That appeared to help head off the worst-case scenario and capped the number of flight delays in Asia and Europe early on Saturday. The US will face high travel demand later in the day after the Thanksgiving holiday period.
“It’s not as chaotic as some people might think,” said Asia-based independent aviation analyst Brendan Sobie, adding that airlines were always prepared for various potential disruptions. “But it does create some short-term headaches for operations.”
Airbus is also now telling airlines that emergency repairs to some of the A320 jets affected may be less burdensome than first thought, industry sources said, with fewer than feared likely to need hardware changes rather than the software fix.
Even so, industry executives said the abrupt action was a rare and potentially costly headache at a time when maintenance is under pressure worldwide from labour and parts shortages.
Fix is simple but necessary
Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320 model. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again.
European low-budget airline Wizz Air said early on Saturday that software updates had been implemented overnight on all its affected A320-family jets with no further disruption expected.
Flight tracker data from Cirium and FlightAware showed most global airports operating with good-to-moderate levels of delays.
AirAsia, one of the world’s largest A320 customers, said that it aimed to complete fixes in 48 hours, with engineering teams “working around the clock”.
India’s aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected, but the software reset would be completed by Sunday.
The country’s largest airline, IndiGo, said it had completed the reset on 160 out of 200 aircraft, while Air India said it had done 42 of its 113 impacted planes. Both airlines warned of delays.
Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island’s carriers are affected.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimise any disruption to passengers.
ANA Holdings, Japan’s biggest airline, cancelled 95 flights on Saturday, affecting 13,500 travellers.
ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320.
October incident triggered recall, sources say
Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight on October 30 from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall.
Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia’s flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected.
South Korea’s Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service.
South Korea’s Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning.
Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half of its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal.
The world’s largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 209 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, revised down from an earlier estimate, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday.
Other US carriers, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and United Airlines, are also among the world’s 10 biggest A320-family operators.
Germany’s Lufthansa and Britain’s easyJet were among other airlines that said they would do the repairs.
Middle East low-cost carrier Air Arabia said it would implement “required measures” across impacted aircraft.
Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70 per cent of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.</p><small>2025-11-29 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/29180216c178101.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958164/finland-to-close-embassy-in-pakistan-over-operational-and-strategic-reasons' target='_blank'><strong>Finland to close embassy in Pakistan over ‘operational and strategic’ reasons</strong></a><br><p>Finland has announced that it will be closing down its embassies in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Myanmar, citing “operational and strategic reasons,” it emerged on Saturday.
“The ministry for foreign affairs has decided to close the embassies of Finland in Islamabad, Kabul and Yangon in 2026,” said the Finnish foreign minister in a press release issued on Friday.
“The embassies will be closed for operational and strategic reasons, which are linked to changes in the countries’ political situation and their limited commercial and economic relations with Finland,” the statement added.
“Decisions on closures are made by a decree of the President of the Republic,” it said.
The ministry stated that preparations to close the embassies in the three countries have “already started” and added the missions would be closed during 2026.
The move comes as part of Finland’s “strategic review” of its network of missions.
It takes into account Finland’s foreign and security policy interests and the needs of Finland’s export promotion activities, the statement read.
“The aim is to concentrate resources on countries that are strategically important to Finland,” it added.
“We will systematically develop Finland’s network of missions abroad to meet future challenges,” Finnish Minister for Foreign Affairs Elina Valtonen was quoted as saying.
“Our operating environment is changing rapidly. The changes to be made will help us to build a stronger and more competitive Finland and to manage Finland’s external relations in accordance with our priorities,” she said.
The country had shut down its operations in Pakistan in 2012 as well, forced by budgetary constraints, but the mission was later reopened in 2022.
In 2023, Sweden also indefinitely closed its embassy in the capital, citing the security situation as the reason.</p><small>2025-11-29 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/291925167476f02.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958159/fm-dar-says-pakistan-ready-to-join-gaza-peace-force-not-ready-to-disarm-palestinian-resistance-group-hamas' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar says Pakistan ready to join Gaza peace force, ‘not ready’ to disarm Palestinian resistance group Hamas</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday said Pakistan was ready to commit its troops to the Gaza peace force, but distanced the country from any role in disarming the Palestinian resistance group Hamas.
A cornerstone of the United States-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries. According to officials close to the discussions, an announcement is expected soon from the federal government regarding the decision.
Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said discussions within the government and military establishment were at an “advanced stage”. According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission.
Last week, the UN Security Council (UNSC) adopted a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump’s plan to end the conflict in Gaza. The plan also authorises the ISF for the Palestinian enclave. Thirteen UNSC members, including Pakistan, voted in favour of the resolution, while Russia and China abstained. However, Hamas rejected the resolution and also decried the establishment of an international force whose “mission includes the disarmament” of Palestinian resistance groups in Gaza.
The foreign minister said the matter of Hamas’ disarmament first came up during a meeting in Riyadh on the two-state solution. The foreign minister was speaking at a press conference held today at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
“We are not ready for that. This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement. We are definitely ready to contribute to the force — the prime minister has in principle already announced after consultation with the field marshal that we will contribute — but this decision can not be taken until it is decided what its [ISF] mandate and TOR (terms of reference) will be.”
“As per my information, if it will include disarming Hamas, then even my Indonesian counterpart has informally expressed his reservation.”
Dar said he was present at the initial talks when the matter of the force was raised, adding that Indonesia had offered 20,000 troops and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also signalled “in principle” that Pakistan would positively consider its participation.



The matter of any supposed role of Pakistan in disarming Hamas had elicited anger from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif last month, who had rubbished and strongly condemned contentious remarks by government spokesperson Danyal Chaudhry that the force’s mandate would include disarmament of Hamas.
Talking about the ISF, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad had said at the UNSC vote that it could be stabilising only if it operated under a clear UN-consistent mandate. Disarmament, he had said, must be carried out through a negotiated political process under a unified Palestinian National Authority.
The text of the resolution says member states can take part in the Board of Peace, envisioned as a transitional authority that would oversee the reconstruction and economic recovery of Gaza.
It also authorises the ISF, which would ensure a process of demilitarising Gaza, including by decommissioning weapons and destroying military infrastructure.
Trump’s 20-point plan is included as an annexe to the resolution.
The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of Israel’s onslaught.
The resolution’s text also says that “conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” once the Palestinian Authority has carried out a reform programme and Gaza’s redevelopment has advanced.
That eventuality has already been firmly rejected by Israel.
Pakistan did not take kinetic action against Afghanistan at Qatar’s request
The foreign minister also talked at length about the recent flare-up and deterioration of bilateral ties with Afghanistan.
Referring to retaliatory action by Pakistan following terror attacks carried out by Afghan nationals in the country, the foreign minister said it was a mistake of the Taliban authorities to believe that Pakistan could not sort out the situation itself, saying the country had ample kinetic capabilities, but it would not be a “desirable” course of action to invade a brotherly country and neutralise problematic elements.
“The situation was possibly leading to that stage when this issue began. Qatar is a country whose foreign ministry was contacting me hourly at that time,” he said, adding that the Qatari prime and foreign minister was in touch with him “every hour”.
“They found out that we were about to take kinetic action. They requested that ‘please stop your side and we will mediate, take responsibility and get the issue resolved.’”
FM Dar added that he was grateful to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army chief for accepting his stance and “the cleanup operation that was about to happen that night — that would have surely taught them a lesson — was stopped”.
Despite that, he said nothing was gained from the negotiations mediated by Qatar and Turkiye, adding that the mediators were themselves frustrated by the lack of progress in the talks.
He urged Kabul’s authorities that “dialogue and diplomacy” were the only way to resolve current issues and called on the Afghan Taliban regime to reflect on its weaknesses and faults.
Referring to the shooting of two US National Guards by an Afghan national and attacks on Chinese workers in Tajikistan from Afghanistan, Dar warned that “the time is not far when Muslims and non-Muslims will unite to eliminate this terrorism”.
He said it was better for regional players to purge the area of terrorism before such a moment arrived.
The foreign minister elaborated that there was a divide in the Taliban ranks between the peacemakers and the warmongers.
Dar further said that he was working to restore delivery of relief goods, food and essential humanitarian aid “for the sake of the Afghan people” on the request of the United Nations, adding that he had secured the army chief’s nod and PM Shehbaz’s approval was awaited.
All matters nearly settled with EU monitoring mission
Talking about the current visit of a seven-member European Union delegation as part of the fifth Biennial Review of the GSP+ scheme and Pakistan’s progress so far, FM Dar said: “Nearly all of our matters have been satisfactorily handled; around six items are pending, of which it is hoped that three legislative actions will be completed in the ongoing Parliament and Senate sessions.”
Dar said he had informed EU officials in Brussels that its review group would “give a very positive report” upon their return from Pakistan.
The deputy PM expressed hope that the review would be successful.
UAE visa issues
The foreign minister also addressed the issue of UAE visas, and assured that the issue had been raised multiple times.
“We are not sleeping. This issue has been raised many times. They’ve also shown evidence that of the different nationalities involved in crime in the UAE, Pakistanis are at the top, unfortunately.”
Dar added that the issue had reached such an extent at a certain point that “even visas of officials and ministers were refused”.
He stated that he had sent the reports of mass offloading of passengers to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and would pursue the issue with him. However, seemingly justifying the action, he said it was not occurring “without reason”.
The foreign minister pointed to the issue of the begging racket, including in Saudi Arabia, that involved Pakistanis.
He said issues would not be resolved until the above matters were tackled and eliminated.</p><small>2025-11-29 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/29200224d010082.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958168/trump-says-airspace-above-and-around-venezuela-should-be-considered-closed' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says airspace above and around Venezuela should be considered closed</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Saturday that the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela should be considered “closed in its entirety”, but gave no further details as Washington ramps up pressure on President Nicolas Maduro’s government.
“To all airlines, pilots, drug dealers and human traffickers, please consider the airspace above and surrounding Venezuela to be closed in its entirety,” Trump said in a Truth Social post.
Venezuela’s communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government, did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Trump’s post.
The US Defence Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

 

US strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean have been underway for months, along with a US military buildup in the region, and Trump has authorised covert operations by its Central Intelligence Agency in Venezuela.
The president told military service members this week that the U.S. would “very soon” begin land operations to stop suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers.
Last week, the US aviation regulator warned major airlines of a “potentially hazardous situation” when flying over Venezuela due to a “worsening security situation and heightened military activity in or around” the South American country.
Venezuela revoked operating rights for six major international airlines that had suspended flights to the country after the US Federal Aviation Administration warning.
The Trump administration has accused Maduro of involvement in drug trafficking, a charge he has denied.
Maduro, in power since 2013, has said that Trump is seeking to oust him and that Venezuelan citizens and the military will resist any such attempt.
US forces in the region have so far focused on counter-narcotics operations, although the assembled firepower far outweighs anything needed for them.
They have carried out at least 21 strikes on alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September, killing at least 83 people.</p><small>2025-11-29 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636424-not-enough-dpm-dar-says-afghan-taliban-jailed-hundreds-of-ttp-militants' target='_blank'><strong>'Not enough,' DPM Dar says Afghan Taliban jailed hundreds of TTP militants</strong></a><br><p>

The case pertains to the custodial killing of Zaryab Khan, who was detained in 2020 in Punjab’s Dera Ghazi Khan, and later died in police custody. It was alleged that two officials of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) tortured the detainee and caused his custodial death. They were later acquitted by a criminal court but were dismissed from service over misconduct by the regional police officer. Subsequently, they filed an appeal with the SC, arguing that the dismissal is “baseless” if they have been acquitted in the case.
In a seven-page judgment, authored by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, SC dismissed the petitions and upheld the earlier ruling.
“The Constitution imposes a duty upon the State to protect the right to life of every citizen and to prevent custodial violence and killings.”
The judgment — a copy of which is available with Dawn — is dated August 21.
“The right to life has been categorised as the supreme human right, which is codified in every major human rights treaty,” Justice Mandokhail stressed.
“These Constitutional guarantees against illegal detention, arrest, brutality, torture and extra-judicial killings in any form are bedrock legal and fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution; therefore, illegal detention and torture are neither encouraged nor justified under any circumstances,” he said.
Justice Mandokhail ruled that “torture and other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment, including outrages upon personal dignity are not permitted in any circumstance, as it is against human dignity and the rule of law.”
He noted that at times “torture led to extrajudicial killings by the police, presuming de facto impunity and as a means of bringing [the] alleged  criminal to justice”.
The judge also called for an “effective, dedicated, external” oversight of the police, terming it “the need of the hour”.
Justice Mandokhail highlighted that, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), “everyone is entitled to rights and freedom without discrimination, including the right to life, liberty, and security of person, and protection from torture, slavery, and degrading treatment”.
Citing Article 4 of the Constitution, the ruling stated that “no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken, save in accordance with law.”
“Protection of law and to be treated in accordance with the law is the inalienable right of every citizen,” Justice Mandokhail ruled.
He went on to say: “Article 10 of the Constitution provides safeguards as to arrest and detention of a person.
“It mandates that no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed of the grounds of such arrest and shall be produced before the Magistrate within a period of 24 hours of such arrest.”
Justice Mandokhail, citing Article 14 of the Constitution, further stated that it stipulates that “the dignity of a man, and subject to law, privacy of home shall be inviolable. It further mandates that no person shall be subjected to torture”.
He stressed that the individual must be allowed due process, calling it a “fundamental right”.
Justice Mandokhail noted that the “police force is the custodian of law” and as the custodian, it had a duty to “preserve the framework of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution”.
“It is bound to provide security and to protect life, liberty and the dignity of a person,” he stressed.
“When a government functionary harms a person without following the law, this not only constitutes a fundamental rights violation, but also violates due process of law, guaranteed by the Constitution,” Justice Mandokhail said in the judgment.
However, it highlighted that while “there is no denial of the fact that the police [have] the authority to arrest any person who violates the law, but any such action without adopting the due process provided by the Constitution and law, and treating such person [inhumanely], cruelly and subjecting that person to torture, constitutes not only a criminal act, but also amounts to a misconduct”.
The judge ruled that the police officials had acted in violation of their duty as per law “by detaining Zaryab Khan illegally and subjecting him to torture”.
The act amounted to “misuse of authority” falling within the definition of grave misconduct, defined in sub-rule (iii) of Rule 2 of the Rules of 1975.
In October, former SC judge Justice Athar Minallah had termed extra-judicial killings, custodial torture and the excessive use of force as the most “intolerable crimes” in a democratic society, calling them the “worst form of violation” of the Constitution.
According to data compiled by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), Punjab has witnessed more than 500 alleged encounters since January 2025, resulting in over 670 fatalities — a figure higher than in any other province.</p><small>2025-11-29 11:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636381-nabs-one-click-reform-to-curb-massive-housing-frauds' target='_blank'><strong>NAB's ‘One-Click' reform to curb massive housing frauds</strong></a><br><p>

He made the comments during a briefing with journalists on November 25, a video of which was released by the ISPR on Friday evening.
“Borders are always mutually guarded. Both countries [guard] them. Now, on the other side is such a country whose posts first engage your posts through fire, and an exchange begins. And then they have them (terrorists) pass through the gaps in between,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.



The DG ISPR said one would barely find any “administration” on the borders in terrorism-prone areas, except in “hardly five to 10 per cent” of the areas.
“Go to Tirah, Khyber; you will not find any governance. Neither will you find any courts, nor any departments that deal with law enforcement and writ of the government.”
The ISPR chief also pointed out that villages and populations were “divided” across the Pak-Afghan border.
“There are 29 tribes here that are divided, whose population is here (Pakistan) and there (Afghanistan) as well. Right on the border. How will you control the movement there?” he asked.
He noted that many questioned how terrorists could infiltrate the Pak-Afghan border, how smuggling was carried out, and how non-custom paid vehicles were able to pass through if the army and the Frontier Corps were stationed at the border.
The military spokesperson then showed images of border fences. He highlighted that military posts were set up at a distance of about 15-25 kilometres from the border.
Noting suggestions for hermetically sealing the border, the DG ISPR questioned whether even the United States, with its vast resources, was able to do the same to its border with Mexico.
“What you call a fence has no value in military terms if it is not covered by observation of fire, because someone can hold and cut that obstacle to bridge it,” he said.
The military spokesman said building a security post every 2-5km and having drone surveillance would incur a “huge cost”. “You will have to invest in the infrastructure, as well as manpower,” he emphasised.
Speaking on the “terror-crime nexus”, the DG ISPR said cells of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on the Pakistani side provided support to this network.
Similar to the strategy he explained for terrorists’ infiltration, Lt Gen Chaudhry said there were extremely coordinated attacks on the army and FC deployments on the routes. “[They] attack the posts and have smugglers’ vehicles pass from below,” he said.
He further said that non-custom-paid vehicles were a part of this network.
“If there are 0.40-0.45 million non-custom-paid vehicles moving in your province, then why do you not stop them? Who is to stop them […] why are they not stopping it, why are they not checking it, whose responsibility is this?” he asked.
“The non-customs paid vehicles are part of this political-terror-crime nexus, are being used in vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and by these terrorists in their movement,” the DG ISPR said.
‘Afghan side could not deny evidence presented by Pakistan’
On the Pak-Afghan dialogue that broke down earlier this month, Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted that Pakistan’s stance was “absolutely clear”, with Islamabad conveying that the presence of TTP cells, and their funding and functioning from Afghan soil, was not acceptable.
“We presented all kinds of evidence, and they could not deny that evidence. It was absolutely clear to the mediators, as well as to the Afghans there,” the military spokesman highlighted.
He said that Pakistan was even open to a “third-party agreement” that would detail a verifiable mechanism to combat cross-border terrorism.

 

He cited a report by the United States’ Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) that said more than $7.2 billion worth of US military equipment had been left behind in the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Lt Gen Chaudhry said the Afghan Taliban had been unable to “convert” themselves into a state after 2021, and were now patronising various non-state actors, including those that were “country-specific and region-specific”.
He noted that Fitna Al Khawarij (TTP), Fitna al Hindustan, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Al Qaeda and Daesh were among those groups found in Afghanistan.

 

“We say that you need to act like a state now. […] They had said that ‘we will not allow our soil to be used for terrorism’,” the DG ISPR said, adding that the Kabul regime was not representative of the Afghans.
The military spokesperson recalled the promises made in the 2020 Doha agreement and asserted that Pakistan had been engaging with the Afghan Taliban since 2021.
“Our problem is not with the Afghans. Our problem is with the Afghan Taliban regime,” he added.
“Blood and business cannot go together,” he said, stressing that trade had been halted as Pakistan’s security was paramount.
During the same briefing, Lt Gen Chaudhry also refuted allegations by the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan had conducted overnight strikes in Afghanistan earlier this week.
“In our view, there is only one sort of terrorist which is good, which is a dead terrorist,” he quipped, adding that there was “no distinction” between terrorists.
The DG ISPR also highlighted statistics for the repatriation of illegal migrants, stating that 971,604 individuals had been sent back this year so far — 239,574 in November alone — compared to 366,704 people in 2024.
‘Delusional India wants to sell defeat as victory’
Lt Gen Chaudhry also spoke about India during his media talk. “We can’t do anything about a delusional mind,” the DG ISPR said, recalling the Indian army chief’s comments on the May conflict being a “trailer”.
“Seven jets were downed, 26 locations were attacked, and the S400 batteries were lost in that ‘trailer’. So, I think now he wants to watch a full horror film,” he said, adding that India wanted to sell its defeat as a victory to its population.
“Any country that provides any kind of equipment to the Afghan Taliban, saying they are giving it to their army, you can consider that it is available to the terrorists.”

 

The military spokesperson also highlighted that there were social media accounts based outside of Pakistan that were involved in inciting violence in the country.
Using social media platform X’s new feature to show the country a user is located in, Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted certain handles that post about Balochistan.
He said the accounts were “doing politics inside Pakistan, and concocting a narrative against the state, against your army, against your leaders”.
‘Seems local population engagement missing in KP’
“All our governments and political parties agree that the solution to terrorism lies in a comprehensive National Action Plan,” the DG ISPR said.
He detailed that there were provincial apex committees chaired by the chief minister with 23 members, a provincial steering committee with 25 members, followed by a division-level monitoring committee, and then a district-level implementation body.
Speaking further on the non-kinetic aspects, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that the administration and the military had 140 engagements per day with the local population, including school visits and jirgas.
“The actual solution to terrorism lies in these, which the provincial and district governments ought to do […] We feel all this is missing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said.

 

The ISPR chief also noted that 949 projects were underway in 35 districts, and that work was also being carried out on the Green Balochistan Initiative, a part of the Green Pakistan Initiative.
The military spokesman highlighted that the smuggling of Iranian diesel was a huge contributor to the “illegal spectrum, the funding of the terrorists”.
“Before the army, FC and the provincial government started this crackdown, permits were given for 20.5 million litres per day, or it was smuggled. We have brought it down to the current average of 2.7m litres,“ he said.
‘Over 67,000 IBOs conducted since Jan’
Detailing the counter-terrorism efforts, the DG ISPR said 4,910 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) had been carried out since November 4, amounting to 233 IBOs per day.
“The intensity of the kinetic counter-terrorism effort is going up,” he said, noting that 206 terrorists were killed in these operations.
Providing a breakdown of the security situation since January, Lt Gen Chaudhry said 67,023 IBOs had been conducted across the country since then.
Balochistan had the highest number of such operations, with over 53,000, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had over 12,800, and the rest of the country recorded about 850.
The military spokesperson said the country had witnessed 4,729 terrorist incidents since January, with 3,357 in KP, 1,346 in Balochistan and 26 in other regions.
