In its debt bulletin issued on Friday, the SBP reported the central government debt at Rs76.045tr, showing an increase of more than Rs8.31tr (12.3pc) in a year, when it stood at Rs67.73tr in May 2024.
The domestic debt stood at Rs53.46tr, posting a year-on-year growth of 15.9pc. The external debt was stated as nearly Rs22.59tr, 4.52pc higher than the same month last year.
In just a month from April to May, the central government debt grew by Rs937 billion, lower than the Rs1.035tr increase recorded in the same period of 2024.
 
 

Pakistan’s total debt and liabilities had stood at Rs89.83tr at the end of March, according to the data released by the SBP in May.
The SBP data showed that Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) contributed around Rs35.24tr to the public debt — surging from Rs27.70tr in May 2024 — compared to Rs8.04tr by the market treasury bills, which have declined from Rs9.44tr last year.
SBP data from earlier this year showed that PIBs’ long-term contribution to the central government’s debt had increased compared to the short-term treasury bills.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb had said the government saved Rs850bn through refinancing while the central government’s debt increased by Rs5.36tr to Rs52.52tr in April 2025.
In contrast, the central government’s debt stood at Rs47.16tr in June 2024.
In the first nine months of the previous fiscal year (July 2024-March 2025), there was an increase of Rs4.8tr in the domestic debt. The growth was largely driven by higher mobilisation through long-term instruments, while short-term and other components saw a decline.</p><small>2025-07-05 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/051645048378194.jpg?r=164513' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922294/jirga-member-killed-3-injured-by-armed-suspects-firing-in-bannu-police' target='_blank'><strong>Jirga member killed, 3 injured by armed suspects’ firing in Bannu: police</strong></a><br><p>At least one person was killed and three others were injured after armed assailants attacked a jirga in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, police said on Saturday.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities recently, especially in KP and Balochistan after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Bannu police spokesperson Kashif Nawaz told Dawn.com, “The Sardi Khel community had organised a jirga in the Mandi Khel area, which was attacked by militants who attempted to take away the jirga leader, Malak Eid Nawaz Sardi Khel, resulting in a clash with the jirga participants.”
He said that the armed men opened fire at the participants, killing one person and injuring three other people, including a police constable.
Nawaz further said the injured were taken to the District Headquarters Hospital Bannu for treatment.
A police party had gone to the crime scene and searched for the terrorists while making efforts to maintain peace in the area, he added.
Bannu has witnessed several militant attacks over the past several months.
 
 

In March, 16 terrorists were killed while five soldiers were martyred as security forces responded to a terrorist attack on the Bannu Cantonment.
The incident resulted in the deaths of 13 civilians and injured 32 others after “severe destruction” of a mosque and a residential building due to the suicide blasts, causing the perimeter wall to partially collapse.
On October 14 2024, five militants wearing burqas and suicide vests were killed as four police officials embraced martyrdom in an attempt to foil a gun and bomb attack on Iqbal Shaheed Police Lines.
Last year, a terrorist attack in July targeting Bannu Cantonment had martyred eight members of the security forces, while a retaliatory operation killed 10 terrorists.
Despite several high-profile attacks, the country saw an overall decline in militant violence during June, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
The report said that there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees.</p><small>2025-07-05 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612528-ppp-will-remain-key-ally-despite-pml-n-securing-simple-majority-says-dar' target='_blank'><strong>PPP will remain key ally despite PML-N securing simple majority, says Dar</strong></a><br><p>

Thibault Verny, 59, will be president of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors while also remaining the archbishop of Chambery in southeast France.
The Vatican commission was created by Pope Francis in 2014 in an effort by the late pontiff to respond after sexual abuse scandals affected the Church in countries across the world.
The scandals have damaged the Church’s standing as a moral voice, led to lawsuits costing millions in countries across the globe, and resulted in a number of resignations of bishops.
Verny said he was committed to improving the Church’s safeguarding measures.
“We will promote the […] equitable sharing of resources so that all parts of the Church, regardless of geography or circumstance, can uphold the highest standards of protection,” he said in a statement.
Verny replaces Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the former archbishop of Boston. O’Malley, 81, had been serving beyond the Church’s traditional retirement age of 80 for bishops.
O’Malley had led the group since its creation.
While some victims have praised the commission’s efforts, it has also been roiled by the resignations of several of its members over the years.
 
 

In 2023, a prominent Jesuit priest and papal adviser stepped down, saying publicly that he had concerns over the way the group was operating.
Verny was first made a member of the commission by Francis in 2022. He has also led the French Church’s safeguarding efforts.
O’Malley praised the appointment, saying in a statement Verny is “a collaborative leader committed to advancing the global adoption of protection and safeguarding, to as best possible assure the safety of those in the care of the Church throughout the world”.</p><small>2025-07-05 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/051708139a16609.jpg?r=173311' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922304/pakistan-extend-afc-womens-asian-cup-qualifying-chances-with-2-1-win-over-kyrgyzstan' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan extend AFC Women’s Asian Cup qualifying chances with 2-1 win over Kyrgyzstan</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Saturday achieved a 2-1 victory over Kyrgyzstan in their qualifying match for the 2026 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Women’s Asian Cup, bringing them one step closer to qualifying for the tournament.
The national squad was drawn in Group ‘D’ of the qualifiers in Jakarta alongside Chinese Taipei, Indonesia and Kyrgyzstan. Pakistan lost their first match of the campaign to Chinese Taipei 8-0 on June 29, but beat hosts Indonesia 2-0 in their second group match this week.
Mariam Mahmood scored her first international goal in the very first minute of the match.
“Layla Aliya won possession at the halfway line and threaded a pass that initially looked to be claimed by Dilnura Abibulla, only for the Kyrgyz Republic custodian (goalkeeper) to drop the ball, allowing Mariam Mahmood to roll it into an unguarded net,” said an AFC press release.
 






Mahmood then doubled Pakistan’s tally by converting a penalty in the 18th minute.
 






Kyrgyzstan scored their only goal of the match when Alina Gaparova scored a low drive into the bottom corner in the 69th minute, the AFC said.
The AFC said that Pakistan’s fortunes “depend on the outcome of the later match between Chinese Taipei and Indonesia”, which is being played today.
The Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) marked the team’s campaign with a lengthy post on Instagram, hailing their overall first-ever outing in the AFC Women’s Asian Cup Qualifiers.

“For the first time in history, Pakistan took part in the AFC Women’s Asian Cup Qualifiers and what a statement they made,” the federation wrote.
“After a tough start against Chinese Taipei, the team bounced back with incredible determination and heart, securing back-to-back victories against Indonesia (2-0) and Kyrgyzstan (2-1). With these wins, they’ve written a new chapter in Pakistan’s football journey.”
The PFF called the campaign “a moment of pride for every supporter of the game”, congratulating the team, coaching staff and officials.

There has been a recent uptick in terror attacks in Pakistan over the past year. The CTD regularly carries out operations to prevent and investigate terrorism-related activities and gather intelligence.
A press release issued today by the CTD said that an intelligence-based operation took place near the Tri-Border Village.
According to a CTD spokesperson, the operation was launched following “credible intelligence reports” about the presence of alleged armed terrorists in the area. Although the operation aimed to apprehend them, they opened fire on the CTD team, leading to a retaliatory crossfire.
The press release detailed that the exchange of heavy fire continued for several hours, during which five terrorists were eliminated, while five others sustained injuries and escaped into the nearby forest.
“The CTD teams acted swiftly and professionally, preventing what could have been a catastrophic attack,” the statement added.
During the combing operation, the team recovered a cache of lethal weapons including rifles, three improvised explosive devices, a large quantity of ammunition, hand grenades and explosive material.
The statement highlighted that these recoveries underscored the severity of the threat and the scale of the planned attack.
 
 

It added that a search operation was currently underway to trace and apprehend the wounded terrorists who fled the scene. The press release said CTD teams established checkpoints near Romani, Taunsa, to secure the region and prevent further escape and the identification process of the deceased terrorists was ongoing.
It said four bodies were handed over to the hospital for legal formalities, while one was taken from the scene by the accomplices.
The CTD has been “continuously operating against the terrorists attacking police posts in the tri-border area of Dera Ghazi Khan”, the statement added.
A statement from Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi praised the CTD for its operation and said the terrorists were from the Fitna al Hindustan.
The government has designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al Hindu­stan. The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
In May, the Punjab CTD said it foiled a “major terror plot” by arresting 34 alleged terrorists of banned organisations during 415 intelligence-based operations across the province.
The previous month, it arrested 10 terrorists belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.</p><small>2025-07-05 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/051623499739af8.jpg?r=162539' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922268/search-continues-as-death-toll-from-lyari-building-collapse-rises-to-15' target='_blank'><strong>Search continues as death toll from Lyari building collapse rises to 15</strong></a><br><p>Rescue teams pulled more bodies from the rubble of a five-storey building collapse in Karachi overnight, taking the toll on Saturday to 15 as the recovery operation continued for a second day,
The five-storey building on Fida Husain Shaikha Road in Lea Market had already been declared uninhabitable by authorities due to its dilapidated structure, which was further weakened by recent rains, said Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed to Dawn.com that the toll had risen to 15. She added that there were nine wounded people since yesterday, out of whom six had been discharged and one had serious injuries.
“Rescue operation is still underway in Baghdadi, Lyari where the building had collapsed on Friday,” DIG Raza told Dawn.com.
 
 

Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
Karachi, home to more than 20 million, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.
There were conflicting reports of the death toll, with Rescue 1122 stating it as 16 and DIG Raza saying that a 17th body was recovered from the rubble.
“On one side, debris has been removed up to the ground floor, while on the other side, the rescue team has removed debris up to the third floor,” the police officer added.
The deceased included nine men, six women and a child, according to a statement by Rescue 1122. Their bodies had been taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK).
“My daughter is under the rubble,” 54-year-old Dev Raj told AFP at the scene.
“She was my beloved daughter. She was so sensitive but is under the burden of debris. She got married just six months ago.”
Rescue teams worked throughout the night, and families said that at least eight people were still believed to be trapped as temperatures climbed to 33 degrees Celsius in the morning.
Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, leading the Rescue 1122 efforts at the scene, told AFP that the operation continued through the night “without interruption”. “It may take eight to 12 hours more to complete,” he said earlier today.
Up to 100 people had been living in the building, senior police officer Arif Aziz told AFP.
The incident came days after a portion of a building collapsed in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported.
The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over 570 buildings declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.
 


The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) said it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.
The authority said it had issued three ejectment notices to the residents since then, as well as asked K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) to disconnect utility services.
But Imran Khaskheli, an owner and resident watching the rescue operation on Saturday, denied receiving notices.
“Do you think we are out of our senses to stay in an unsafe building with our families?” he said, speaking to AFP. He said he had seen cracks in the pillars of the building early on Friday morning.
 
 

“I knocked on all the doors and asked families to leave immediately,” Khaskheli said, adding that around 40 families lived in the building but that many did not heed his warning.
More than 50 buildings in the district have been declared unsafe, with six evacuated since yesterday, Karachi (South) Deputy Commissioner Javed Nabi Khoso told AFP.
‘Hinderances’ in rescue efforts
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan said the incident had reportedly occurred between 9am and 9:30am. However, they said they received the information late due to the suspension of communication networks, he added.
Mobile services are usually suspended in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.
Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said yesterday there were hindrances during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.
Heavy machinery faced difficulty in reaching the site amid the narrow alleys of Lyari, a low-income neighbourhood.
Police even had to baton-charge a crowd that had gathered around the site to make way for machinery, officials added.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah sought a report on the collapse and details of dilapidated buildings from the SBCA.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a high-level committee has been formed that will submit a report on the incident by Monday. He lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously.
The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.
Previous deadly building collapses
In April, a 10-year-old girl died when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.
In October 2023, five people were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.
 
 

The city witnessed two such incidents within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.
Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when 22 people were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments collapsed.
A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed 27 people. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took 33 lives.</p><small>2025-07-05 11:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0515232110750fd.png?r=155115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922291/dalai-lama-hopes-to-live-beyond-130-years-much-longer-than-predicted' target='_blank'><strong>Dalai Lama hopes to live beyond 130 years, much longer than predicted</strong></a><br><p>The Dalai Lama said on Saturday he hopes to live until he is more than 130 years old, two decades longer than his previous prediction, following his assurance to followers that he would reincarnate as the spiritual head of the faith upon his death.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner was speaking during a ceremony organised by his followers to offer prayers for his long life, ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, and as China insists it will choose his successor. The Dalai Lama told Reuters in December he might live to 110.
“I have been able to serve the Buddhadharma (the teachings of Buddhism) and the beings of Tibet so far quite well,” he said between prayers, clearing his throat now and then.
“And still, I hope to live over 130 years,” he said, sparking applause and cheers among his followers.
 


The 14th Dalai Lama, already the longest-lived head of Tibetan Buddhism, spent about 90 minutes at the prayers in his temple.
The ceremony was attended by thousands of followers from around the world who gathered in the northern Indian hill town of Dharamshala, where he has lived since fleeing Tibet in 1959 in the wake of a failed uprising against Chinese rule.
“We have lost our country and we live in exile in India, but I have been able to benefit beings quite a lot. So, living here in Dharamshala, I intend to serve beings and the dharma as much as I can,” he said in Tibetan, which was translated simultaneously into English and other languages.
China, keen to consolidate its control over Tibet, views the Dalai Lama as a separatist. Beijing insists its leaders would have to approve his successor, in a legacy from imperial times.
The Dalai Lama has previously said that he would reincarnate in the “free world” outside China, and this week told his followers that the sole authority to recognise his reincarnation rests with his non-profit institution, the Gaden Phodrang Trust.
Devotees stream in
The Dalai Lama is a charismatic figure whose following extends well beyond the millions of Tibetan Buddhists living around the world.
He won the 1989 peace prize for what the Nobel committee said was keeping alive the Tibetan cause and seeking genuine autonomy to protect and preserve the region’s unique culture, religion and national identity without pressing for independence.
At the prayers on Saturday, he sat on a throne before a large statue of the Buddha, with dozens of monks seated in front of him.
Marigold garlands hung from pillars as his followers and journalists crowded around the main temple area. Oracles and other figures, shaking in trance, arrived to pay their obeisance to their guru. Monks struck cymbals and played ornate long trumpets in honour of the Dalai Lama and others.
The Dalai Lama said he prays daily to benefit all sentient beings and feels he has the blessings of Tibet’s patron deity, Avalokitesvara.
“Looking at the many prophecies, I feel I have the blessings of Avalokitesvara,” he said. “I have done my best so far. At the least, I hope to still live for 30 or 40 years more.”
His birthday celebrations on Sunday will be attended by senior Indian ministers as well as diplomats from the United States, along with thousands of his devotees.</p><small>2025-07-05 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/05152036298e6fc.png?r=153328' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922292/turkiye-arrests-three-more-opposition-mayors-party' target='_blank'><strong>Turkiye arrests three more opposition mayors: party</strong></a><br><p>Turkiye arrested three more opposition mayors early on Saturday as part of an investigation into alleged graft, officials from the main opposition, the Republican People’s Party (CHP) said, denouncing it as a “political operation”.
The early morning arrests were the latest move targeting elected officials of the CHP as the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan puts increasing pressure on the party, which won a huge victory against his Justice and Development Party (AKP) in the 2024 local elections and is rising in the polls.
The arrests were linked to an investigation into alleged graft which resulted in the removal in March of Istanbul’s powerful opposition mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, whose jailing sparked mass protests in Turkiye’s worst street unrest since 2013.
Imamoglu is Erdogan’s biggest political rival and the CHP’s candidate for the 2028 presidential race.
Earlier this week, police arrested more than 120 people as part of a probe into alleged graft in the opposition stronghold of Izmir, Turkiye’s third city.
 
 

The latest detainees were based in southern Turkiye: mayor of the southern city of Adana, Zeydan Karalar; mayor of the resort town of Antalya, Muhittin Bocek; and the mayor of Adiyaman in the southeast, Abdurrahman Tutdere.
“In a system where the law bends and sways according to politics, where justice is applied for one group and ignored for another, no one should expect us to trust in the rule of law or believe in justice,” wrote Mansur Yavas on X, opposition mayor of the capital Ankara.
“We will not bow to injustice, lawlessness, or political operations.”
 






The pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy Party (DEM), the third largest in Turkiye’s parliament, also denounced the arrests in a strongly-worded statement.
‘Stop persecuting elected officials’
“This persecution of elected officials must stop,” wrote DEM co-president Tulay Hatimogullari on X.
“Not respecting the decisions of the people at the ballot box and not recognising the will of the people is causing deep rifts within society,” she wrote.
“These operations are not a solution, but block the road to a democratic Turkiye.”
 






DEM has in recent months been working closely with Erdogan’s government to facilitate moves to end the decades-long conflict with the Kurds, facilitating talks which in May saw Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) rebels ending their bloody armed struggle in a conflict that cost nearly 40,000 lives.
Saturday’s arrests were the latest in a slew of legal manoeuvres targeting the CHP.
On Monday, an Ankara court began hearing a case against the party involving allegations of vote-buying at its 2023 leadership primary which could end up overturning the election of CHP’s popular leader Ozgur Ozel, who rose to prominence for his role in leading the March protests.
 
 

Anadolu news agency said the Adana and Adiyaman mayors were linked to a case opened by the Istanbul public prosecutor’s office into alleged tender rigging and bribery.
Police also arrested the deputy mayor of Istanbul’s Buyukcekmece district Ahmet Sahin as part of the same probe, BirGun news website said.
Antalya’s mayor was held over a separate investigation launched by the resort town’s chief public prosecutor into allegations of bribery, with police also arresting his son, it said.</p><small>2025-07-05 10:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/051452539c66226.jpg?r=150800' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1922283/muharram-9-central-procession-underway-in-karachi-amid-tight-security' target='_blank'><strong>Muharram 9 central procession underway in Karachi amid tight security</strong></a><br><p>Karachi’s central mourning procession of Muharram 9 left Nishtar Park towards its destination of Hussainiya Iraniyan Imambargah in Kharadar on Saturday amid tight security, according to police.
Earlier in the week, Karachi Traffic Police issued a traffic plan for Muharram 8 to 10, outlining the procession routes as well as alternative traffic flows.
Stringent security measures are being taken across the country, such as army deployment as well as a crackdown on sectarian content and hate mongers, ahead of Ashura (Muharram 10), which will be observed tomorrow.
“At 1:29pm, the 9th Muharram-ul-Haram procession [departed] from Nishtar Park,” the Karachi Police said in an alert.
Cellular services were also suspended in the areas adjoining the central procession’s route as well as the smaller procession’s routes across the city, according to a letter by the Sindh IGP.
 


Earlier in the day, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar reviewed the security arrangements for the 9th Muharram processions at various locations in the city.
He was accompanied by Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab, Senator Waqar Mehdi and Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ghulam Nabi Memon.
Home Minister Lanjar directed the law enforcement agencies to take foolproof security measures, according to the press release.
Lanjar, along with Mayor Wahab, also met with the organisers of today’s central procession.
On Friday, more than 5,500 police personnel were deployed across Karachi for the security of 8th Muharram processions.

“I signed some letters and they’ll go out on Monday, probably 12,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, adding that the countries to which the letters would be sent will be announced on the same day.
His comments come days before steeper duties — which the president said on Thursday would range between 10 and 70 per cent — are set to take effect on dozens of economies, from Taiwan to the European Union.
 
 

The tariffs were part of a broader announcement in April where Trump imposed a 10pc duty on goods from almost all trading partners, with a plan to step up these rates for a select group within days.
But he swiftly paused the hikes until July 9, allowing for trade talks to take place.
With less than a week to go before July 9, Pakistan and the United States concluded a critical round of trade negotiations yesterday, reaching an understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country’s key export sectors.
The Pakistani delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, was aiming to finalise a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a 29 per cent tariff on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products.
The agreement, when signed, could lead to incre­ased Pakistani imports of US goods — notably crude oil — and potential Ameri­can investment in Pakistan’s mining, energy, and infrastructure sectors.
 
 

Projects like the Reko Diq copper and gold mine and related energy infrastructure were a focus of the discussions. The deal could also pave the way for expanded engagement through the US Export-Import Bank.
Countries have been pushing to strike deals that would help them avoid these elevated duties.
So far, the Trump administration has unveiled deals with the United Kingdom and Vietnam, while Washington and Beijing agreed to temporarily lower staggeringly high levies on each other’s products.
As his July 9 deadline approaches, Trump has repeatedly said he plans to inform countries of US tariff rates by sending them letters.
Aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump said sending notices would be much easier than “sitting down and working 15 different things”.
He added: “You know, with the UK, we did that. And it was great for both parties. With China, we did that, and I think it’s very good for both parties.”
But he said it was “much easier to send a letter saying, ‘Listen, we know we have a certain deficit, or in some cases a surplus, but not too many. And … this is what you have to pay, if you want to do business [with] the United States’”.</p><small>2025-07-05 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612509-is-a-no-confidence-move-brewing-against-gandapur' target='_blank'><strong>Is a no-confidence move brewing against Gandapur?</strong></a><br><p>

Aamir Khan, the spokesperson for Lakki Marwat police, said in a statement today that the CTD, in collaboration with the local police, carried out an intelligence-based operation in the Bathani Neh area near Harama Tala village and killed three wanted militants.
The police statement said that the terrorists belonged to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group and were involved in the targeted killing of Waheedullah of the CTD, Traffic Constable Anwar Sher and Constable Idrees.
 
 

The statement added that the encounter lasted for about 25 minutes.
The police identified the suspected militants as Waseemullah alias Umar Khattab, Qudratullah alias Abu Bakr, and Hijratullah alias Hijrat.
They were residents of Gundi Khan Khel, Hijratullah, and Serai Gambila Town’s Harama Tala area of Lakki Marwat.
The police statement also mentioned that the terrorists were wanted by the Bannu CTD for blasts using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and attacks on police, among other serious crimes.
Lakki Marwat has long been a hotspot for terrorism and violence, with unrest dating back to the early 2000s. Militant attacks have become more frequent in recent months, despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
Last week, the leader of a peace committee and two of his companions were shot dead by terrorists in Lakki Marwat district.
Earlier in June, three terrorists were killed in the district’s Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee, in which a cop was also martyred.</p><small>2025-07-05 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/612501-at-least-six-killed-eight-injured-in-bus-trailer-collision-in-muzaffargarh' target='_blank'><strong>Bus-trailer collision leaves six dead in Muzaffargarh</strong></a><br><p>

Another residential building collapsed in Karachi’s Lyari neighbourhood on Friday, resulting in a number of casualties, including women and children.
Nine deaths had been reported as these words were being written. It was the third structural collapse incident in the city in two days. A day earlier, the third-floor roof of a building had collapsed in the Moosa Lane area, killing two; separately, an entire section of a six-storey building had collapsed under the weight of its rooftop water tank in Ghulam Hussain Qasim Quarters, thankfully without casualties.
 
 

In each case, the buildings had been previously declared unsafe by the Sindh Building Control Authority, but evacuation orders were repeatedly ignored.
A review of the city’s records reveals that there have been multiple structural collapse incidents in Karachi in recent years, with many involving condemned buildings. The question naturally arises: why has the SBCA been so helpless in enforcing its writ?
The problem is a multifaceted one: for example, citizens often resist evacuation orders for dangerous buildings as they may have no other place to go to, and they demand alternative arrangements before they agree to comply.
 
 

The SBCA is also accused of turning a blind eye to various illegalities and violations, especially the use of substandard construction materials, which has led to the proliferation of dangerous structures in the city. It is well known that in most construction projects, compliance with building safety codes is non-existent. Due to these factors, large parts of the city have turned into a sprawling mess of structures that can quickly become a death trap for their residents.
Since this problem most often affects the less privileged, the authorities seem not to treat it urgently. However, it is becoming clear that a major intervention is needed, and the administration must devise a comprehensive strategy for dealing with dangerous buildings and the threat they pose.

Speaking to BBC News, the contractor recalled one occasion when a guard had opened fire from a watchtower with a machine gun because a group of women, children and elderly people were moving away from the site too slowly.
Although the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has denied the allegations, claiming no civilians ever came under fire at their distribution sites, the BBC recorded 24 incidents where aid seekers were killed in large numbers.
The GHF began its operations at the end of May after an 11-week total blockade of Gaza by Israel, during which no food entered the territory.
Since it started, Israeli forces have killed more than 400 Palestinians trying to retrieve food aid from its sites, the UN and local doctors say.

Guards ‘fire into unarmed crowds, then laugh about it’

Describing the incident where guards fired on a group of Palestinians, the former contractor said: “As that happened, another contractor on location, standing on the berm overlooking the exit, opened up with 15 to 20 shots of repetitive weapons fire at the crowd.
“A Palestinian man dropped to the ground motionless. And then the other contractor who was standing there was like, ‘damn, I think you got one’. And then they laughed about it.”
The contractor, who spoke to us on condition of anonymity, said GHF managers had brushed off his report as a coincidence, suggesting that the Palestinian man could have “tripped” or been “tired and passed out”.
The GHF claims the man who made these allegations is a “disgruntled former contractor” who was terminated for misconduct, which he denies. He showed the BBC evidence that he left the post on good terms.
The contractor said he had worked at all four GHF distribution sites, and described a culture of impunity with few rules or controls.
He said contractors were given no clear rules of engagement or standard operating procedures, and were told by one team leader: “if you feel threatened, shoot – shoot to kill and ask questions later”.
 
 

The culture in the company, he said, felt like “we’re going into Gaza so it’s no rules. Do what you want.”
The contractor that each site had CCTV monitoring the activity in the area, and GHF insistence that no one there had been hurt or shot at was “an absolute bare-faced lie”.
Team leaders referred to Gazans as “zombie hordes”, the former contractor said, “insinuating that these people have no value.”
The man also said Palestinians were coming to harm in other ways at GHF sites, for example by being hit by debris from stun grenades, being sprayed with mace or being pushed by the crowds into razor wire.
He said he had witnessed several occasions in which Palestinians appeared to have been seriously hurt, including one man who had a full can of pepper spray in his face, and a woman who he said was hit with the metal part of a stun grenade, improperly fired into a crowd.

In the English language, the phrase ‘a rainy day’ means a probable time when money will be needed, unexpectedly. This may also suggest that while rain, in a certain way, has romantic and feel-good connotations, it can also bring with it a number of difficulties. The latter seems to be apt for Karachiites.
Every time — and it’s been happening for years now — it rains heavily in the city, citizens are found complaining about at least a few things: nerve-jangling traffic jams, damaged roads, sudden appearance of potholes and puddles, stagnant rainwater on roads and streets, and power failure.
 
 

Power failure, surely, in turn makes the availability of water supply a huge problem because in most localities in the city, water is pumped into pipes through machines run by electricity. Don’t the authorities concerned know that?
By authorities concerned one means the bodies responsible for managing Karachi: the provincial government, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, the cantonment board, etc.
Every year, during monsoons, a blame game starts which ends without a positive or permanent resolution to the issue. On June 27 and 28, heavy rains disrupted life in Karachi in a painful way. Despite the fact that June 28 was a Saturday, when a majority of the offices were closed, the snarl-up at thoroughfares such as Sharea Faisal was agonising. If one was in District South heading towards the airport, it took at least two hours to move from the Hotel Metropole roundabout to Drigh Road Railway Station.
As if it was an understandable consequence of Nature’s interference in Karachiites’ daily lives, there were reports of a prolonged power breakdown on June 28.

De-silting of major drains is yet to be completed by KMC

In DHA Phase V, for example, electricity went kaput in the afternoon and was restored at 4am. Similarly, quite a few blocks in Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Federal B Area, North Nazimabad, suffered power shutdowns for up to 10 hours.
The worrisome thing is that the monsoon season has arrived early (as it usually begins in July). Have the authorities pre-empted the situation? One can’t be sure.
What adds to the worry is that at some places — for example, from Jail Road to Nipa — construction work has been going on for many a month. If rains come down heavily in July, these projects might get affected. No one knows how much money has so far been invested in the making of these yet-to-be-completed underpasses, overhead bridges and new roads. Whatever the amount may be, they need to be protected from uncalled-for interventions. Also, one hopes that construction work completes as soon as possible because it’s already a massive traffic issue.
 
 

It has to be said, though, that the one step that the KMC has taken,  in terms of preparing in advance for the rains, is that a few days back the corporation had begun the process of cleaning the stormwater drains in the city.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab himself witnessed the process during which he had said: “In addition to the 46 major drains, smaller drains are also being cleaned. A joint strategy will be employed to ensure the drainage of rainwater across all towns. As soon as the rains begin, staff, machinery and pumps will be dispatched to major roads. We  believe in working indiscriminately across all districts of Karachi and  will respond to critics through our work.”
It all sounds good. But, thus far, not all drains have been cleaned.
The clouds, as the month of July sets in, look ominous. There’s likelihood that citizens will soon be faced with a wet season. And if preventive measures are not taken in totality, Karachiites are in for a toilsome time.

• Calls upon India to choose between belligerence and talks
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday ruled out the creation of an alternative forum to the already existing South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).
“Pakistan remains committed to the principles and objectives of the Saarc charter. It has actively been participating in different Saarc activities,” the foreign office spokesperson said about the eight-nation organisation, which included Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka.
In his weekly press briefing, Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan said Pakistan desires Saarc to function as an “important forum for regional cooperation”.
He rejected the reports about the creation of a Beijing-led alternative to Saarc.
Regarding cooperation among Pakistan, China, and Bangladesh, the member of the purported coalition, Mr Khan said China was a very important country that enjoys friendly relations with most of the South Asian countries.
“China pursues an agenda of peace, development and common prosperity [and] in that sense, these three countries are working together”, he remarked.
The three nations have recently intensified bilateral contacts and held several high-level meetings.
Last month, they launched a trilateral cooperation mechanism, pledging to pursue “win-win cooperation”.
The move, seen as a subtle yet significant shift in South Asia’s strategic landscape, was announced after the inaugural meeting of the Bangladesh-China-Pakistan Vice Foreign Minister/Foreign Secretary mechanism.
The new trilateral platform marked a notable development in the South Asian geopolitical landscape, particularly as it brought together Pakistan and Bangladesh, which had remained diplomatically distant for decades.
The relations between Islamabad and Dhaka have warmed considerably since the ouster of former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina last year.
Under the interim leadership of Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, Dhaka has actively pursued broader diplomatic horizons, including a new phase of engagement with both China and Pakistan.
Nuclear blackmail
FO spokesperson Khan also expressed concerns over India’s military buildup and said it cannot be allowed to make arbitrary decisions about attacking other countries.
“No state can allow another state to violate its sovereignty and territorial integrity at will. In the face of any aggression, Pakistan shall always defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity with full vigour. There should be no doubt about that”.
Referring to the Indian assertions about the so-called nuclear blackmail, he said it revealed the “profound insecurity and frustration of India about Pakistan’s effective capabilities to defend itself”.
“Pakistan’s conventional capabilities are adequate to deter India without the self-imposed ‘nuclear blackmail’ that New Delhi suffers from.”, he remarked.
 
 

In reply to a question about the Indian Defence Ministry’s approval of $12.31 billion to strengthen its missile and combat capabilities, he said Pakistan has been repeatedly flagging concerns about its neighbour’s rapid military buildup.
“The past Indian strategic behaviour demonstrates, irrespective of their declaratory position, that this military buildup is primarily configured for use against Pakistan”, he said.
India’s choice
The FO spokesperson once again reiterated the call for dialogue to resolve longstanding issues between India and Pakistan.
He said Pakistan preferred dialogue and diplomacy over conflict and confrontation.“Now it is India’s choice whether it treads the path of belligerence, bellicosity or takes steps for dialogue and reconciliation”, Mr Khan added.

Conducted by the provincial labour department with technical support from Unicef and the Bureau of Statistics Sindh, the survey also revealed that over half (50.4pc) of child  labour victims aged 10-17 worked in hazardous conditions, exposing them to  excessive hours, extreme weather and unsafe tools.
Labour Director General Muhammad Ali Shah, who is also the project director of the survey, told Dawn that the survey had been submitted to the provincial government.
He said that the incidence of child labour has seen a significant decline, reduced by nearly 50pc compared to the 1996 baseline.
 
 

According to Pakistan’s first and only National Child Labour Survey, conducted in 1996, the prevalence of child labour in Sindh was recorded at  20.6pc of the total child population at that time.
The latest survey also revealed that school attendance among working children is significantly lower (40.6pc) compared to non-working peers (70.5pc), with attendance declining steeply with age.
According to the survey, girls aged 14 to 17 years bear a heavier burden of household chores, averaging 13.9 hours per week and face higher school dropout rates.
The survey stated that child labour was strongly linked to poverty, with 33.7pc of the poorest households reporting at least one working child.
It stated that 20.1pc of children in child labour report symptoms of depression, nearly double the rate among children not in child labour.
The survey highlights significant variations in child labour rates across districts. Qambar Shahdadkot has the highest rate at 30.8pc, followed by Tharparkar (29pc), Shikarpur (20.2pc) and Tando Muhammad Khan (20.3pc), while Karachi has the lowest rate at 2.38pc.

The much-delayed but suspenseful exercise will see elections on 11 seats — seven general and two each reserved for women, ulema and technocrats.
Experts believe the outcome will hinge on how PTI-backed and JUI-F members vote. If the opposition remains united and PTI-backed members strictly follow party discipline — with JUI-F support — the ruling coalition may win only one general seat.
However, the scenario would shift dramatically if some PTI members break ranks and JUI-F strikes a deal with the ruling coalition. In that case, the coalition might bag around five seats, potentially gaining a two-thirds majority in the upper house of parliament. JUI-F already holds five seats in the Senate.
Currently, the ruling coalition has 54 members in the 96-member Senate — 10 short of the two-thirds majority (64 seats).
Polling for the 11 KP Senate seats will be held on July 21, while a separate election for the seat vacated by Senator Sania Nishtar is scheduled for July 31.
According to an ECP statement, the Senate elections in KP were delayed due to an incomplete electoral college. The schedule was announced two days after 25 reserved seats — originally allocated to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — were redistributed among parties, including PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, PTI-P and ANP.
The elections were earlier postponed in April 2024, exacerbating political uncertainty in the province. Polling for another Senate seat — vacated after the death of Professor Sajid Mir — will also take place on July 21.
An ECP spokesperson said letters have been sent to the speakers of national and provincial assemblies, requesting the oath-taking of members elected on reserved seats and notified on July 2, 2025. This is to ensure they can assume office and vote in the Senate elections in KP and Punjab.
It may be recalled that Senate elections in KP were previously postponed on April 2, 2024, due to the speaker’s refusal to administer oath to newly elected members on reserved seats.
A fresh notification reads: “In continuation of the earlier notification dated April 2, 2024, whereby the poll date for Senate elections from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province against seven general seats, two women seats, and two technocrats including ulema seats was postponed, the Election Commission of Pakistan hereby appoints July 21, 2025, as the poll date for the said Senate election.”
 
 

The ECP has also issued a detailed schedule for the seat vacated by Dr Sania Nishtar. The public notice will be issued on July 9, nomination papers can be submitted on July 10 and 11, scrutiny will be held on July 16, and polling will take place on July 31. The former PTI lawmaker had resigned in October last year, but her seat was declared vacant on March 10 this year.
Furthermore, a notification has been issued for the election to the seat left vacant by the demise of PML-N Senator Professor Sajid Mir. The revised list of candidates will be issued on July 15, nomination withdrawals are allowed until July 16, and polling will be held on July 21 at the Punjab Assembly building.
In addition, an election schedule has been issued for two vacant seats reserved for PML-N women from KP in the National Assembly. The returning officer will issue a public notice on July 8; nomination papers can be submitted on July 9 and 10; scrutiny will take place on July 14; and the final list of candidates will be released on July 24. The PML-N’s previous priority list has been exhausted, and a new one must be submitted to the priority list counting officer by July 10.

Earlier, media reports suggested that the global tech giant had moved its operations out of the country.
These were based on a LinkedIn post by Jawad Rehman, the former head of Microsoft in Pakistan. Citing sources, he claimed the company “is officially closing its operations in Pakistan”.
Microsoft had an on-ground presence in Pakistan until recently, albeit with a significantly reduced local workforce. Most of its operations were handled from foreign offices and by partners in Pakistan, people familiar with the matter told Dawn.
In response to Dawn’s query, a Microsoft spokesperson said, “We will serve our customers through both our strong and extensive partner organisation, and other closely located Microsoft offices. We follow this model successfully in a number of other countries around the world.”

Spokesperson says company to provide services through local partners, offices abroad

The decision to move out of Pakistan was part of the company’s ongoing series of layoffs worldwide as it looks to pivot towards artificial intelligence (AI).
On Wednesday, Microsoft announced it would lay off nearly four per cent of its around 228,000 employees, Reuters rep­orted. In May, the company announ­ced layoffs affecting around 6,000 workers.
The company said on Wednesday it planned to manage its operations with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles.
Evolving business models
In a statement on Wednesday, the IT and Telecommunications ministry said global tech companies are moving from on-premises software deployment to the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model. Microsoft’s decision is also reflective of this shift.
According to technology expert Habibullah Khan, large software enterprises have two business models: on-premise and Saas.
Under the former model, the company installs and runs software on the customer’s servers or infrastructure, with hardware and data centres managed internally by customers. The company gets a one-time payment through the sale of licences.
On-premise software deployment is a capital-intensive model and results in high upfront costs with recurring needs for maintenance and upgradation.
In comparison, SaaS allows a company to serve a particular location without any on-ground presence as the software is hosted in the cloud. In the model, the company makes money through subscription costs.
With the evolution of technology, more companies have transitioned to SaaS models, as it reduces upfront costs, Mr Khan explained.
Not an ‘exit’
The IT ministry also said Microsoft’s move couldn’t be construed as an exit from Pakistan, but rather a shift to a “partner-led, cloud-based delivery model”.
Over the past few years, several multinational companies in various sectors have either shut down their operations in Pakistan or sold them to local enterprises. Last month, ride-hailing service Careem announced it would end operations in Pakistan from July 18.
 
 

However, Mr Khan believes Microsoft’s move is different from other exits, as the company now earns almost all of its revenue through cloud-based subscriptions.
He added the company is on a global cost-cutting drive and its decision to close the office in Pakistan was reflective of the move towards SaaS-and-AI operating model, “and is not in any way a reflection on Pakistan’s tech ecosystem or its economy”.

The decisions were taken during a key meeting of the Special Task Force on Zaireen, chaired by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi at the Ministry of Interior.
The meeting, held on the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, was also attended by Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain and Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry.
Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. From 2026 onwards, pilgrims will only be allowed to travel under registered organisers.
The FIA and other relevant bodies have been directed to prevent unauthorised individuals from entering Iraq under the pretext of pilgrimage.
Authorities informed the task force that 1,413 applications have so far been received for registration as Zaireen Group Organisers and the scrutiny process is currently under way.
The Civil Aviation Authority briefed the meeting that the number of weekly flights to Iran has already been increased from six to 15. Additionally, 107 special flights are being arranged for Arbaeen pilgrims heading to Iraq.
Further increase in the number of flights for Zaireen travelling to Iran and Iraq is also under consideration. A ferry service is also being launched to provide better travel facilities to pilgrims in the future. It was agreed that the security situation would be reassessed after Ashura before a final decision is made on the resumption of land travel to Iran and Iraq.
Mr Naqvi emphasised that, in light of the current situation, protecting Zaireen from any trouble or difficulty is the government’s top priority.

• Zarah Sultana says their alternative is ‘rooted in justice & equality’
• Group includes MPs Shockat Adam, Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, Iqbal Mohamed
LONDON: In an overnight reshaping of Britain’s political landscape, Zarah Sultana, the MP for Coventry South, has announced she will co-lead the formation of a new political party alongside former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.
The move signals a break with the Labour Party, which both politicians accused of abandoning its core values.
Sultana declared her resignation from Labour on Thursday evening in a statement that described Westminster as “broken” and accused the two major parties of offering “nothing but managed decline and broken promises.”
She urged supporters to join the duo in building an alternative, rooted in justice and equality.
Though Corbyn has long floated the idea of a more formal vehicle for left-wing and pro-Palestinian politics, Sultana’s announ-cement surprised many within the Independent Alliance, the loose group of five MPs, including Corbyn, who parted ways with Labour mainly over its stance on Gaza. Sources close to Corbyn indicated frustration with the timing of Sultana’s decision, describing it as potentially “premature.”
Still, Corbyn acknowledged ongoing discussions about forming a new political organisation. Speaking on ITV’s Peston, he said: “That grouping [of independents] will come together, there will be an alternative.”
 

Zarah Sultana

While he declined to label it a party or confirm a leadership role for himself, he reaffirmed a commitment to a political movement centred on “peace rather than war,” tackling poverty and inequality.
The pair’s new initiative has drawn comparisons to rising progressive movements abroad. Economist Richard D. Wolff tweeted: “A new political left is rising… in the US, Sanders-AOC-Mamdani, and in the UK now Corbyn-Zarah Sultana. Finally!”
However, some questioned her focus, accusing her of neglecting local issues in Coventry.
‘Collective leadership’
Corbyn, who led Labour from 2015 to 2020 before being suspended in a row over antisemitism, has been cautious about titles, preferring collective leadership. The new group, which includes MPs Shockat Adam, Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, and Iqbal Mohamed, now matches Reform UK and the DUP in parliamentary numbers, and outpaces the Greens and Plaid Cymru.
Last September, Corbyn attended a closed meeting to discuss launching a new party called Collective, intended to challenge Labour’s centrist turn under Keir Starmer.
In an opinion piece, Guardian columnist Andy Beckett noted that Sultana is usually “one of the most effective political communicators” in the UK.
“She has more followers on TikTok than any MP except Nigel Farage. Unlike him, she has an ability to talk with moral force and clarity: about Palestine, inequality, the rightward shift of the government and other issues particularly important to Britain’s large minority of left-wing voters, a neglected electoral bloc since Corbyn’s Labour leadership ended in 2020.”

According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), imports from India totalled $211.5 million in the first 11 months of FY25 — surpassing $207m in FY24 and $190m in FY23. In May alone — when the four-day conflict broke out in the first week—imports stood at $15m, slightly down from $17m in the same month last year.
 
 

However, Pakistan’s exports to India remained negligible. In May, they were recorded at just $1,000, while total exports during July-May FY25 were only $0.5m. In FY24 and FY23, exports stood at $3.44m and $0.33m, respectively—highlighting the highly one-sided nature of bilateral trade.
Traders were reluctant to discuss the continuation of imports during the tense period. One trader suggested the goods might have arrived through third countries, with payments made prior to the hostilities.
“It may have come from a third country and the payment for the May imports would have been made before the war,” he said.

Pakistan’s imports from New Delhi hit 3-year high

Although official data reflects limited trade, Indian research institutions claim actual trade is far higher. The India-based Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) reported last month that India’s unofficial exports to Pakistan are estimated at $10bn annually, routed primarily through Dubai, Colombo, and Singapore.
Analysts say the unofficial trade remains robust due to Pakistan’s high cost of production and industrial dependence on foreign inputs.
“We should not ignore smuggling from India since the cost of production in Pakistan is the highest in the region, which creates space for goods from India, China, and Bangladesh,” said an exporter.
Formal trade relations between Pakistan and India have remained frozen since 2019, but the data and ground realities suggest economic interdependence persists, albeit through unofficial channels.

An official at MG Pakistan stated the company would absorb the price hike despite the new levy. The assembler of Haval vehicles has also decided to maintain prices at previous levels.
The carbon levy or NEV adoption levy is charged at 1pc on engines below 1300cc, 2pc on engines between 1300cc and 1800cc, and 3pc on engines above 1800cc, applied on the invoice price, including duty and taxes.
 
 

Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) has raised prices across its lineup by Rs18,810 to Rs186,000. The Alto VXR, VXL, and AGS now cost Rs2.994m, Rs3.166m, and Rs3.326m, reflecting increases of Rs167,861, Rs177,480, and Rs186,446, respectively.
In the upgraded Suzuki Cultus range, the VXR, VXL, and AGS models are now priced at Rs4.089m, Rs4.359m, and Rs4.591m, up by Rs40,490, Rs43,160, and Rs45,460, respectively.
The Suzuki Swift GL MT, GL CVT, and GLX CVT now retail at Rs4.460m, Rs4.605m, and Rs4.766m, compared to Rs4.416m, Rs4.560m, and Rs4.719m earlier.

Assemblers increase vehicle prices by up to Rs700,000 following carbon levy and higher GST

Suzuki Every VX and VXR posted price increases of Rs163,230 and Rs166,200, reaching Rs2.912m and Rs2.965m, respectively. Ravi pickup and its without-deck variant now cost Rs1.975m and Rs1.899m, up by Rs19,560 and Rs18,810. PSMCL clarified that the revised prices include FED, sales tax, and carbon levy but exclude advance income tax.
Citing rupee depreciation, rising international freight charges, and the carbon levy, Lucky Motor Corporation increased prices of various KIA models from Rs95,000 to Rs700,000. The Picanto AT, Stonic EX Plus, and EX now sell at Rs4.090m, Rs5.999m, and Rs4.862m after respective increases of Rs150,000, Rs499,000, and Rs95,000.
The Sportage L Alpha, L FWD, and L HEV have seen hikes of Rs400,000 to Rs600,000, now priced at Rs8.899m, Rs10.499m, and Rs11.599m. The Sorento 3.5L V6 now costs Rs13.899m, up by Rs400,000, while its other variants—3.5L V6 EMI, HEV FWD, HEV AWD EMI, HEV AWD, and HEV AWD EMI—range from Rs14.399m to Rs17.199m, marking increases of Rs400,000 to Rs700,000. The Kia Carnival is now priced at Rs18.2m, up by Rs700,000.
However, LMC has kept the prices of its electric vehicles—V5 Air, EV5 Earth, and EV9—unchanged at Rs18.5m, Rs23.5m, and Rs43.2m, respectively.
Atlas Honda Ltd (AHL) has raised the prices of various motorcycles by Rs2,000 to Rs6,000. Its flagship models, the Honda CD 70 and CG-125, now cost Rs159,900 and Rs238,900, respectively.
United Auto Industries has also revised up the prices of several two-wheeler models following the imposition of 18pc GST and the NEV levy. The US-70cc (standard), Self Start, Alloy Rim, and Alloy Rim with Self Start models are now priced at Rs111,000, Rs122,000, Rs121,000, and Rs132,000, compared to Rs93,182, Rs102,411, Rs101,572, and Rs110,801 previously.
Car and bike parts imports surge
Despite the price hikes, bike and two-wheeler sales are expected to remain firm in the coming months, supported by a rising trend in parts and accessories imports by assemblers.
 
 

According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the import bill for semi- and completely knocked-down kits by car assemblers rose by 41pc to $950m during July–May FY25, from $676m in the same period last year. Imports of two-wheeler parts increased by 16.5pc to $43m from $37m during 11MFY24.
According to Large-Scale Manufacturing data, bike production surged by 34pc to 1.362m units in July–April FY25, from 1.013m units in the same period last year.
Mohammad Sabir Sheikh, a bike sector analyst, rul­ed out any adverse impact on sales following the carbon levy. He noted that demand has remained strong since January, with many buyers opting to replace old­er mot­orcycles—typically over five years old—with new models.
Atlas Honda Ltd achieved record monthly production and sales of 130,189 and 130,240 units, respectively, in May 2025.

“An IAEA team of inspectors today safely departed from Iran to return to the agency headquarters in Vienna, after staying in Tehran throughout the recent military conflict,” the Interna­tio­nal Atomic Energy Age­ncy (IAEA) said in a post on X.
 






“IAEA Director Gen­eral Rafael Grossi reiterated the crucial importance of the IAEA discussing with Iran modalities for resuming its indispensable monitoring and verification activities in Iran as soon as possible,” it added.
Iran officially suspended its cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog on Wednesday, after Israel launched its first military strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, followed by the US strikes last month.
 
 

As a party to the NPT, Iran must account for its enriched uranium, which normally is closely monitored by the IAEA, the body that enforces the NPT and verifies countries’ declarations. But the bombing of Iran’s facilities has now muddied the waters.

In the Nov 25, 2024 meeting, senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah had proposed that the minutes of JCP meetings be made public, but the idea was turned down by a majority of members, a well-placed source revealed.
On June 25, Justice Shah again urged the JCP to share minutes of its meetings — citing past transparency measures taken during the tenure of former CJP Justice Qazi Faez Isa, when the minutes of a three-judge committee formed under the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023 were regularly uploaded on the Supreme Court’s official website.
The Nov 25 JCP meeting had been convened to constitute a nine-judge constitutional bench for the Sindh High Court, which was approved by a majority vote of 11 to 4. However, PTI representatives — Leader of the Opposition in National Assembly Omar Ayub and Leader of the Opposition in Senate Shibli Faraz — did not attend the meeting.
The JCP waited for nearly two hours for the two members to arrive, but their mobile phones remained switched off. The commission then proceeded with its meeting. Later, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar were nominated to replace Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz in the JCP.
During the session, chaired by CJP Yahya Afridi, Justice Shah invoked Article 19A of the Constitution to argue that the proceedings of the commission should be made public due to the significant public interest involved in its decisions. He emphasised that transparency in judicial appointments was essential to uphold democratic norms and public trust.
 
 

Law Minister Tarar responded that the decision should be based on the collective wisdom of the commission’s members.
AGP Awan noted that the in-camera nature of JCP meetings was prescribed by the commission’s rules of 2010 and that any deviation would require a formal amendment to those rules.
The CJP clarified the current legal framework did not allow disclosure of proceedings, as the existing rules explicitly prohibit it. Nevertheless, he put the matter to a vote.
The proposal was rejected, with 11 members voting against it and only three — including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar — voting in favour. SHC Chief Justice Shafi Siddiqui abstained.
In a fresh letter, Justice Shah reiterated his concern, stating that the opacity surrounding the commission’s working was neither healthy nor democratic and was inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s role as the guardian of constitutional values. He underscored that judicial appointments are acts of public significance with far-reaching consequences.

• MSF mourns colleague slain in previous day’s shooting at aid centre
• UN records 613 killings at GHF aid points & convoys
TEL AVIV/CAIRO: Hamas said on Friday it was ready to start talks “immediately” on a proposal for a ceasefire with Israel, after holding consultations with other Palestinian factions.
“The movement is ready to engage immediately and seriously in a cycle of negotiations on the mechanism to put in place” the terms of a draft truce proposal received from mediators, the group said in a statement.
Earlier on Tuesday, Israel accepted the conditions needed to finalise a 60-day ceasefire with Hamas, during which the parties would work towards ending the war.
A source familiar with Hamas’ position said the group was seeking guarantees that talks to end the war would take place during the 60-day truce, and that if no deal was reached by the end of that period, the pause in fighting would be extended till both sides come to terms.
Meanwhile, as US President Donald Trump said he expected Hamas to respond to his “final proposal” for a ceasefire in Gaza in the next 24 hours, at least 20 Palestinians were killed on Friday in an Israeli air strike in Gaza, according to local health officials.
Health officials at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, said the Israeli military had carried out an air strike on a tent encampment west of the city around 2am, killing 15 Palestinians displaced by Israeli attacks.
A Gaza civil defence official said those killed included five who were shot while waiting for aid near a US-run site near Rafah in southern Gaza and several who were waiting for aid near the Wadi Gaza Bridge in the centre of the territory.
They were the latest in a spate of deaths near aid distribution centres in the devastated territory, which UN agencies have warned is on the brink of famine.
At Nasser hospital in Khan Yunis, crowds mourned 16 people killed on Thursday by what the civil defence agency said was shooting close to a nearby aid centre.
Medical aid charity Doctors Without Borders said Abdullah Hammad, who recently finished a contract working for it, was among those killed in Thursday’s shooting.
It said he was the 12th colleague the group had lost in the Gaza war.
“We demand an end to this bloodshed,” MSF said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the the UN human rights office said it had recorded at least 613 killings both at aid points run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and near humanitarian convoys.
“We have recorded 613 killings, both at GHF points and near humanitarian convoys — this is a figure as of June 27. Since then … there have been further incidents,” Ravina Shamdasani, the spokesperson for the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters in Geneva.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is yet to comment on Trump’s ceasefire announcement. While some members of his right-wing coalition oppose a deal, others have indicated their support.

The Pakistani delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paal, was scheduled to return on Friday after completing four days of talks in Washington.
While both sides have reached an understanding, a formal announcement is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.
The delegation arrived in Washington on Monday with the aim of finalising a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a 29 per cent tariff on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products.

Formal announcement expected once Washington wraps up talks with other nations

The tariff relief, temporarily paused earlier this year, was at risk of expiring if no progress had been made by the July 9 deadline.
Officials familiar with the negotiations say the talks were successful, with both sides agreeing to a broad framework.
The agreement, when signed, could lead to incre­ased Pakistani imports of US goods — notably crude oil — and potential Ameri­can investment in Pakistan’s mining, energy, and infrastructure sectors.
Projects like the Reko Diq copper and gold mine and related energy infrastructure were a focus of the discussions. The deal could also pave the way for expanded engagement through the US Export-Import Bank.
Although US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had earlier indicated that Washington might allow limited flexibility on the deadline if meaningful pro­g­ress was evident, Pakistani officials say they pushed for early completion to remove uncertainty for exporters and investors.
Officials remain optimistic that the agreement will sustain Pakistan’s access to the US market and help reset bilateral economic ties, which had been under strain since the high tariffs were introduced during the Trump administration.

Today’s incident comes days after a portion of a building collapsed in the city’s Kharadar area. However, no casualties or injuries were reported. The Public Account Committee of the Sindh Assembly had directed the provincial government in December to take urgent steps to evacuate over 570 buildings declared “dangerous” by authorities across Karachi.
Rescue efforts were underway at the building situated on Fida Hussain Shaikha Road in Lyari’s Baghdadi neighbourhood, according to a statement from the Baghdadi police.
Pakistan Rangers, in a statement, said its personnel were also assisting in the rescue operations and “engaged in rescuing individuals trapped under the rubble”.
The heavy rescue machinery struggled to access the narrow alleys, and police baton-charged residents to clear the way, AFP reported.
Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said the government needed to “take action”, noting that there were around 434 buildings in the Old City area that had been declared “dangerous” by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). A statement by the authority put the number of such buildings across Karachi at 588.
“We have two options: to convince people to move out or force them to evacuate,” Wahab said, adding that any government tries not to take any forced action but to convince people.
“This loss of lives today shows that when the state or the government tells you anything, you should follow it.”
The mayor requested the inhabitants of such dilapidated buildings to evacuate as soon as possible to prevent any unpleasant incident and loss of life or property.
 


Saad Edhi of the Edhi Foundation described the structure to AFP as a “worn-out building”. Police official Arif Aziz told AFP that up to 100 people had been living in the building.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that the incident reportedly occurred between 9-9:30am but due to disruption of the communication network, the department received the information late.
He said that as per the residents and relatives, there were still 20-25 people stuck in the rubble and the rescue operation was still under way. He said some families had already realised the gravity of the situation and begun leaving with a few of them having already left the building as its structure had started to deteriorate after the recent rains.
SBCA says issued multiple prior notices to vacate building
Meanwhile, the SBCA said it had declared the plot as dangerous through its Technical Committee for Dangerous Buildings after a thorough inspection conducted in October 2022.
It said it had received a complaint from the Sindh Human Rights Commission on July 22, 2022, and the authority had thereafter promptly issued the first ejectment notice on June 2, 2023, directing the residents and occupants to vacate the premises.
It said a second notice was issued on February 28, 2024, followed by a third with a three-day final warning and lastly a fourth notice addressed to the managing director of K-Electric, Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) on June 25, 2024, instructing them to disconnect utility services.
The SBCA added that an urgent reminder for ejectment was issued on June 2 with copies sent to the South deputy and assistant commissioners and the Kalari station house officer, requesting their intervention to evacuate the premises and prevent any potential incident.
“On June 29, 2025, the SBCA director also reported that residents were warned via megaphones to evacuate the building immediately.
“Regrettably, the residents were reluctant to vacate the building unless alternate accommodation was provided. Furthermore, the utility agencies, K-Electric, SSGC, and KWSB, did not respond or disconnect services in a timely manner, nor did the district administration paid attention and responded by our issued ejectment notices.
“It is important to note that the monsoon season is ongoing, increasing the risk associated with dangerous structures. According to SBCA records, 588 buildings have been declared dangerous throughout Karachi with 107 such buildings in Lyari alone. The SBCA has repeatedly advertised these threats through print and electronic media.”
It also pointed out that during his tenure, former Sindh chief secretary Sohail Rajput had instructed then-Karachi commissioner Saleem Rajput to take efforts to vacate the buildings declared dangerous by the SBCA Technical Committee. It added that the matter was still pending.
‘We are helpless’: Relatives worry for trapped families
All six family members of 70-year-old Jumho Maheshwari were at his flat on the first floor when he left for work early in the morning.
“Nothing is left for me now — my family is all trapped and all I can do is pray for their safe recovery,” he told AFP.

Another resident, Maya Sham Jee, said her brother’s family was also trapped under the rubble.
“It’s a tragedy for us. The world has been changed for our family,” she told AFP.
“We are helpless and just looking at the rescue workers to bring our loved ones back safely.”
Shankar Kamho, aged 30, a resident of the building who was out at the time, said around 20 families were living inside.
“I got a call from my wife saying the building was cracking and I told her to get out immediately,” he told AFP at the scene.
“She went to warn the neighbours, but one woman told her ‘this building will stand for at least 10 more years’. Still, my wife took our daughter and left. About 20 minutes later, the building collapsed.”

Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani said a high-level committee has been formed that will submit a report on the incident within three days.
His spokesperson Zubair Memon said the committee has been directed to submit a report identifying the responsible officers and their negligence. The minister also ordered the suspension of the related officials at the SBCA.
Speaking to reporters at the site of the incident, Ghani lamented that residents did not evacuate the building despite being served notices previously due to the unsafe conditions of the run-down structure.
“Not one but many notices were given to them (residents) to evacuate the building in the past four to six years. But I can also understand the citizens’ struggle.
“[…] On the one hand is your home in which you are residing, [but] on the other hand is your life,” Ghani added, urging residents of other dilapidated structures to evacuate to avoid any disaster.
 






“If we forcibly make them evacuate, then also a humanitarian aspect comes forward, and we have to become a target of criticism for it,” the minister stressed.
Ghani said he had been told that the building was built in 1974. “There is an entire mafia that constructs these illegal buildings in the city; we have taken strict action against them and filed FIRs,” he said, urging citizens not to buy or rent such buildings to “end the demand”.
Taking notice of the incident in a statement, Ghani ordered the top officials of the relevant authorities, including the SBCA, to reach the site of the incident to monitor the rescue efforts.
“A report on the causes of the building collapse and all its reasons should be submitted immediately,” he said in the statement issued by Memon.
“All obstacles around the building should be removed to speed up the rescue operation,” Ghani added.
Roof and building collapses are common across Pakistan, mainly because of poor safety standards and the use of shoddy construction materials.
But Karachi, home to more than 20m, is especially notorious for poor construction, illegal extensions, ageing infrastructure, overcrowding and lax enforcement of building regulations.
 
 

In April, a 10-year-old girl died when a three-storey building in Bhains Colony suddenly collapsed, while a man and a woman were pulled alive from the debris.
In October 2023, five people were killed and four others injured when an under-construction building collapsed in Shah Faisal Colony.
The city witnessed two such incidents within 72 hours in September 2020, claiming the lives of at least three people and injuring over a dozen.
Lyari also faced a similar incident in June 2020, when 22 people were killed after a five-storey residential building housing about 40 apartments collapsed.
A building collapse in Karachi’s Gulbahar area in March 2020 killed 27 people. A similar 2011 incident in Lyari’s Musa Lane neighbourhood took 33 lives.
Rescue DG lists ‘hinderances’ in operations
Sindh Rescue 1122 Director General (DG) Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh, in a statement, said the service’s Central Command and Control Centre received an alert of the incident at 10:53am.
“As soon as the alert was received, the Urban Search and Rescue team, along with a disaster-response vehicle (DRV), immediately reached the site of the incident,” the Rescue 1122 DG asserted.
He detailed that over 100 rescue personnel, five DRVs, two snorkels and multiple ambulances were present at the building’s location. Cranes and lifters have also been dispatched to the site, DG Shaikh added.
He explained that there were hindrances during the rescue operation due to the “unruly crowd, various road blockades and mobile network [issues]”.
Mobile services are usually suspended in certain areas due to security concerns during Muharram.
The Rescue 1122 head affirmed that the operation would continue till the site was “cleared”.

Sindh CM seeks report
Taking notice of the incident, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah directed that rescue teams immediately rescue those trapped under the rubble, while immediate medical assistance be provided to the injured.
“This is an unfortunate incident; concerned authorities should submit an immediate report,” CM Murad was quoted as saying in a statement by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.
CM Murad also sought details of dilapidated buildings in Karachi from the SBCA.
“Dangerous buildings should be identified immediately and practical steps should be taken to protect citizens,” CM Murad said. “Negligence will not be tolerated; protection of human lives is the top priority.”

Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori expressed his grief over the incident and ordered rescue authorities to conduct “immediate, effective, and coordinated relief operations”.
In a statement, he directed that all available resources be employed to safely rescue those trapped under the rubble, and that “every possible facility” be provided to the affected families.
“Any kind of neglect or carelessness will be intolerable,” Tessori warned.
 






President, PM stress preventing such future incidents
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep grief and sorrow over the incident, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
In separate statements, the president and the premier offered their “heartfelt condolences and sympathies” to the family members of those who lost their lives.
Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured, President Zardari directed the Sindh government to expedite the relief efforts and immediately rescue those trapped under the debris.
The president also ordered that the causes of the incident be determined immediately and that effective measures be implemented to prevent such incidents in the future.
 






PM Shehbaz also issued directives that all possible medical facilities be provided to the injured.
“Such incidents must be prevented in the future by formulating a strategy on a priority basis,” the prime minister stressed.
Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, chairman of the PPP that governs Sindh, conveyed his condolences to the aggrieved families and wished the injured a quick recovery.
“I assure [the public] that the Sindh government will provide all assistance [needed],” Bilawal said in a statement shared by his party.
 






Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, and Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah also expressed their condolences.
Sindh Assembly Syed Awais Qadir Shah, in a statement, highlighted that immediate action must be taken to identify dilapidated buildings and ensure public safety.
Sardar Abdulrahim, information secretary of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA), said that further loss of lives could have been avoided if the rescue machinery had reached the site on time.
“A fair of illegal buildings has been set up in the city due to the [Sindh] government’s incompetence,” the GDA leader said.
He demanded that the families of the injured and wounded be provided with financial assistance, that alternate accommodation be arranged for the affected people, and that a case be filed against those responsible for the loss of precious lives.
