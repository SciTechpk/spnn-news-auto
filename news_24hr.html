A day earlier, the PTI had lashed out at a press briefing by the military’s media wing, calling it “inappropriate and unfortunate” after the spokesperson accused incarcerated Imran Khan of edging into “security threat” territory through his persistent anti-army rhetoric.
Taking to the X platform, PML-N leader and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal called Imran’s political rhetoric “a deeply irresponsible and dangerous trend that seeks to undermine Pakistan’s state institutions, weaken national cohesion, and erode public trust in the armed forces who defend our borders with courage and sacrifice.”
“Political differences are part of any democracy—but when politics crosses the line into anti-state narrative building, deliberate misinformation, and attacks on the integrity of Pakistan’s Armed Forces and its leadership, it threatens the stability, security, and unity of the country,” he wrote.
Iqbal added that no leader had the right to weaponise divisive rhetoric for personal gain at the cost of Pakistan’s national security.
“The Pakistan Army is a professional, disciplined, and patriotic institution that has stood as the shield of this nation, from fighting terrorism to defending territorial sovereignty.
“Attempting to malign the armed forces or create discord between the people and their defenders serves only the agenda of Pakistan’s enemies,” he said, adding that he “strongly condemned Imran’s “continued politics of hate, distortion, and incitement against the state and state institutions.”



‘Another conspiracy against Pakistan?’ — MQM-P
The leadership of Muttah­ida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) also called out the PTI for “deviating from a political route and resorting to the politics of the streets to cause instability in the country”.
“The PTI has continued its politics of hurling allegations, and instead of choosing the right forum to address those allegations, it used it to create political instability in the country,” MQM-P Chairman Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said during a press conference in Karachi.“During this time, when all parliamentarians on both sides of the spectrum should have stood with the armed forces, the leadership of the armed forces, and the political leadership of the country, a campaign was instead initiated over the last two days, giving way to fears that there might be some foreign elements involved in all of this,” he said.
Siddiqui went on to say that all political parties could have different viewpoints and even different dreams for Pakistan’s future, “but whenever the country found itself in crisis, all political parties are seen to be standing together.”
“Even when PTI needed us, all political parties, including us, stood with them. Did we ever say we would not speak to political forces despite being part of the political force ourselves?” he questioned.
He continued: “So, I would also expect from the government that the anti-Pakistan rhetoric, and the campaign which is being led from outside Pakistan, should be carefully observed. Is this creating grounds for another conspiracy against Pakistan?”
He said that MQM-P, for the sake of Pakistan’s dignity, honour, respect, and prosperity, invites all political parties to come and sit together and talk about it.
“It is indeed the responsibility of all parties that if anyone is working against the interest of Pakistan, we should not only identify it, but also take action against it.
“Today, there is democracy in Pakistan, so democratic forces should together tackle those who, under the guise of democracy, are harming Pakistan owing to their ego or at someone’s direction. There is a need for a joint, united struggle against all such attempts.”
‘Had you listened to me then, we would not have anarchy, terrorism’: Hanif Abbasi
Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi assailed Imran during a press conference in Rawalpindi, calling him a “threat to national security” and stating that had his claims about the ex-premier receiving funding from India and Israel been taken seriously, Pakistan would not be in the state it is now.
“I filed a case against you,” Abbasi said, addressing the PTI founder and referring to a legal case about the PTI receiving foreign funding and “compromising” patriotism.
“I had said that the PTI was receiving Indian and Israeli money. This was proven. I took the foreign funding case to the Supreme Court,” he added. “Had the decision been made then and had he (Imran) been disqualified, then there would not be anarchy or terrorism.”
Echoing the words of Director General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the railways minister called Imran a “mental patient” and slammed him for a social media post against the armed forces. He also assailed Imran’s family for giving interviews to Afghan and Indian media.
“His children appear on Afghan media, his sisters appear on Indian media. What’s going on here?” Abbasi asked. “You (Imran) have not been punished or mistreated. You cannot handle jail, and you’re threatening national security.”
The minister added that Imran’s post targeted an entire institution rather than one person and added that since becoming an atomic power, Pakistan’s institutions have been targeted by foreign states.
“If you were only against one person, you’d pray for martyrs, you would not say that MNAs going into NDU (National Defence University) are traitors because they met officers,” Abbasi stated.
He then turned his attention to Imran’s sisters, who appeared on Indian media outlets to give interviews and were the target of criticism by the government for “defaming Pakistan”.
The minister stated that the PTI founder’s sisters “said that the whole of India is crying for Imran Khan” and slammed them for “worshipping” the powers that be.
“If they meet you, then all is good, but if they don’t, then you are ready to threaten our nation’s security,” Abbasi said.“Your true face has been exposed in front of the world — you targeted your heroes,” he added. “If you are against one person, that’s fine, but you targeted monuments to martyrs, GHQ, Corps Commander House. You did what our enemies hoped to achieve.““My point is that I cannot understand how someone who plays with our national security is a Pakistani. They can be a traitor or a mental patient, but not a Pakistani.”

According to a letter dated November 26 and addressed to Barrister Gohar, which is seen by Dawn, the PTI leader had written an application to the commission on November 13 regarding the inclusion of senators into the PTI.
While the letter did not elaborate on the matter raised by Barrister Gohar, he seemed to have sought the inclusion of those senators into his party who were elected to the upper house of Parliament from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly in July after much delay.
The ECP said in its letter that “after due deliberation, it was observed that the issue of intra-party election of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is pending before the commission due to the stay order obtained by the party from the Lahore High Court (LHC)”.
“Hence, in the above circumstances, the commission is not in a position to accept you as chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. Therefore, you do not have any locus standi, and you are informed, accordingly,” the letter read.
The PTI has held intra-party elections three times, but the initial two were voided by the commission. Following the third election, the PTI approached the LHC, which restrained the commission from issuing any final order in proceedings related to the intra-party polls.
On Saturday, Barrister Gohar also addressed the matter during a press conference, recalling that the last intra-party election of the PTI was held on March 3.
“We filed documentation pertaining to it, but there was no [confirmation of] acceptance by the election commission. Today, for the first time, I received the election commission’s letter in which they formally said that ‘we do not recognise you’. It is very unfortunate that they do not recognise the PTI,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-07 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637893-fo-rebuffs-indian-fms-highly-inflammatory-baseless-remarks-against-pakistan-army' target='_blank'><strong>FO rebuffs Indian FM's 'highly inflammatory, baseless remarks' against Pakistan Army</strong></a><br><p>

The FO’s condemnation came a day after Jaishankar alleged that India’s core challenges with its neighbouring country stemmed directly from Pakistan’s military establishment.
In its reaction to his remarks, the FO underscored that Pakistan was a responsible state, and all its institutions, including armed forces, were a pillar of national security, dedicated to safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.







The FO’s statement also referred to a brief four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May, saying that it “vividly demonstrated Pakistan armed forces’ professionalism as well as their resolve to defend the motherland and the people of Pakistan against any Indian aggression in a befitting, effective yet responsible manner”.
“No amount of propaganda can belie this truth,” the statement added.
It labelled attempts by the Indian leadership to defame Pakistan’s state institutions and its leadership as “part of a propaganda campaign designed to distract attention from India’s destabilising actions in the region and beyond, as well as state-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan”.
“Such incendiary rhetoric only exemplifies the extent of India’s disregard for amity, peace and stability in our region.”
The statement said that instead of making misleading remarks about the armed forces of Pakistan, “India must investigate the fascist and revisionist Hindutva ideology that has unleashed a reign of mob justice, lynchings, arbitrary detentions and demolition of properties and places of worship”.
Indian state and leadership both had become “hostage of this terror in the name of religion,” it added.
The statement further stressed that “Pakistan believes in co-existence, dialogue and diplomacy. However, it stands united and resolute in its intent and ability to safeguard its interests and sovereignty”.</p><small>2025-12-07 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/071431438ed8305.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959746/pakistan-to-sell-excess-gas-in-international-markets-from-january-1-petroleum-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to sell excess gas in international markets from January 1: petroleum minister</strong></a><br><p>Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik said on Sunday that Pakistan would begin selling excess liquefied natural gas (LNG) in international markets from January 1.
Malik’s statement during a press conference in Lahore came months after it was reported that Pakistan was exploring ways to sell excess LNG cargoes amid a gas supply glut that could cost domestic producers millions in annual losses.
He noted that Pakistan had been importing gas from “our friend” Qatar and Italian energy company Eni. But, he continued, there was an excess of this imported gas as the use of this fuel for power generation had reduced in the country during the past few months.
Resultantly, “we were compelled to divert it to domestic consumers, due to which circular debt was increasing in the gas sector”, he said, adding that it also caused a loss of around Rs1,000 billion to Pakistan from 2018-19 till now.
“From January 1, we will sell this excess fuel in international markets and reduce our burden while limiting the loss caused by it,” he added.
Moreover, he said, the measure would also allow Pakistan’s state-owned enterprises in the sector to operate on their full capacity and generate profit.
Last month, it was reported that Pakistan had struck a deal to cancel 21 LNG cargoes under its long-term contract with Eni as part of a plan to curb excess imports that have flooded its gas network. Meanwhile, sources also said that Pakistan was in talks with Qatar about gas supplies from the Gulf state, with options including deferring some cargoes or reselling them under existing contract clauses.
Foreign investment
During his press conference, Malik also outlined the expected investment in the petroleum sector by foreign companies.
He recalled that Turkiye’s energy minister had visited Pakistan recently and “after 20 years, Turkish Petroleum, in collaboration with Pakistani companies”, would be taking part in onshore and offshore exploration activities.
“Turkish Petroleum will also open its office in Islamabad, where 10 to 15 Turkish nationals will be working,” he said, adding that Pakistanis would also get employment there.
“We are moving towards decreasing our reliance on imported oil and gas,” the minister further stated.
He said a delegation of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) would be visiting Pakistan in the coming week, adding that it was also expected to collaborate with local companies for oil and gas exploration.
The minister said SOCAR was also opening its office in Pakistan. “It will also invest millions of dollars in the construction of an oil pipeline from Machike to Thalian in collaboration with the PSO (Pakistan State Oil) and FWO (Frontier Works Organisation).”
He said the pipeline’s construction would begin in a month or month and a half.
Malik said private fundraising of $3.5 billion for the Reko Diq project had been finalised, and now the banks were finalising the agreements. In addition, he said, local companies and Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold would invest more than $3.5bn in the project.
In total, $6-7bn would be invested in the first phase of the project, following which “you will see the face of Chaghi (the site of the project) changing”, he added.
The minister said Reko Diq’s signing ceremony was expected to take place in a month or two at the Prime Minister’s House.

A chain of tropical storms and monsoonal rains has battered Southeast and South Asia, setting off landslides, flooding vast tracts and cutting off communities from Sumatra island’s rainforests to the highland plantations of Sri Lanka.
At least 1,812 people have been killed in the natural disasters rolling across Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam over the past two weeks.
Indonesia’s president on Sunday vowed to step up aid, with demonstrators rallying after the country’s death toll surpassed 900.
More than two million people in Sri Lanka — nearly 10 per cent of the population — have been affected by last week’s floods and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, the worst on the island this century.
The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said monsoon storms were adding more rain and making hillsides unstable, including in the central mountainous region and the north-western midlands.
Helicopters and planes were being used on Sunday to supply communities cut off by landslides in the centre of the country.
The Sri Lanka Air Force said it had received a planeload of relief supplies from Myanmar on Sunday, the latest batch of foreign aid.
The government has confirmed 618 dead — 464 from the lush tea-growing central region — while 209 people remain unaccounted for.
The number of people in state-run camps had dropped to 100,000 from a peak of 225,000 as floodwaters receded across the island by Sunday, the DMC said.
More than 75,000 homes were damaged, including close to 5,000 that were completely destroyed, it added.
‘Disaster tourism’
In Indonesia, President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday flew back to Sumatra’s hard-hit Aceh province, with a ministry saying his visit was “to ensure the acceleration of emergency response and recovery in affected areas”.
The Indonesian government has so far shrugged off calls to declare a national disaster, which would free up resources and help government agencies coordinate their response. The toll in Indonesia on Sunday remained at 916 dead, with 274 still missing.

 

Prabowo will also “monitor the distribution of aid, the evacuation process of residents, and measures to reopen road access,” the Ministry of the State Secretariat said.
“The government emphasises that the handling of the floods in Aceh is a national priority and all resources are being mobilised to expedite the recovery of community conditions,” it added in a statement.
Speaking shortly after arriving in the capital Banda Aceh, Prabowo promised that “we will put all our efforts into this, and later we will repair all the bridges, hopefully within one or two weeks”.
Many survivors said their greatest need remained clean drinking water.
Some victims accused the Indonesian leader and other officials of engaging in “disaster tourism” and failing to address the crisis.
“We see that, including Prabowo’s visit in Bireuen today, it seems like a disaster tourism trip,” said Syahrul, a 35-year-old protester in northern Aceh province.
“We don’t need officials to just observe. We need their presence to address the issues faced by the community,” Syahrul told AFP.
Protesters carried placards reading: “The Aceh disaster is not a tourist spot; it’s not enough for Prabowo to just take a stroll.” In Sri Lanka, the government unveiled a major compensation package on Friday to rebuild homes and revive businesses wiped out by the natural disaster, which hit the island as it was emerging from its 2022 economic meltdown.
A senior official earlier said recovery and reconstruction might cost up to $7 billion.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday it was considering Sri Lanka’s request for an additional $200 million to help with rebuilding.
The money is on top of the $347 million tranche due later this month, part of a four-year, $2.9 billion IMF bailout loan agreed in 2023.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake told parliament on Friday that Sri Lanka’s economy had made a significant recovery, but was not strong enough to withstand the latest shock alone.</p><small>2025-12-07 09:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637878-sngpl-issues-new-winter-gas-schedule-for-punjab-kp' target='_blank'><strong>SNGPL issues new winter gas schedule for Punjab, KP</strong></a><br><p>

According to the statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the IBO was conducted on Saturday on the reported presence of “terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Hindustan”.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR statement detailed that during the operation yesterday, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 12 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were found in the terrorists’ possession, it said, adding that they had been “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area as [a] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under [the] vision [of] ‘Azm-i- Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Yesterday, a statement issued by the ISPR had said that 14 terrorists had been killed in three separate intelligence-based IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Balochistan’s Tank.
Earlier this week, security forces had killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in KP’s North Waziristan district.</p><small>2025-12-07 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637863-security-forces-neutralise-12-india-sponsored-terrorists-in-kalat-ibo' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces neutralise 12 India-sponsored terrorists in Kalat IBO</strong></a><br><p>

According to the FO statement, President Subianto will arrive in Islamabad and will be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising key ministers and senior officials.
“This will be President Prabowo’s first visit to Pakistan. The last presidential visit from Indonesia was undertaken by President Joko Widodo in 2018,” the statement said, adding that the upcoming visit carries added significance as it coincides with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Indonesia.
During his stay, the statement said, President Prabowo will hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz and meet President Asif Ali Zardari. Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir will also call on President Prabowo, it added.
“The two sides will discuss a wide-ranging agenda aimed at further strengthening Pakistan-Indonesia relations and exploring new avenues of cooperation, including trade, investment, defence, health, IT, climate, education and culture, as well as enhancing collaboration at regional and global levels.”
The statement also said that several memoranda of understanding are expected to be signed during the visit.
It further stated: “Pakistan and Indonesia enjoy close, cordial and long-standing relations, underpinned by shared values and mutual interests. The visit of President Prabowo will provide an important opportunity to deepen bilateral ties and expand mutually beneficial cooperation, contributing to the continued growth and diversification of the partnership between the two countries.”</p><small>2025-12-07 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/69341a687ab65.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959558/smokers-corner-superstitions-and-statecraft' target='_blank'><strong>SMOKERS’ CORNER: SUPERSTITIONS AND STATECRAFT</strong></a><br><p>On November 14 of this year, The Economist’s sister publication, 1843, ran a feature on the controversial spiritual influence of Bushra Bibi — the current wife of former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan, who is now in jail. Bushra Bibi is also currently incarcerated and it is widely believed that Khan remains captivated by her ‘roohani [spiritual]’ powers. 1843 also quoted former close comrades and house staff of the couple, more than alluding to her use of ‘magic’ to maintain Khan’s power and control his opponents.
But the content of the feature was hardly groundbreaking for most Pakistani media personnel. They were already aware of the details that the feature elaborated. However, when allegations about the couple appeared in a highly respected international magazine, the reaction was explosive.
Khan’s opponents capitalised immediately on social media, while journalists who had previously been lambasted by Khan’s party for airing what were dismissed as unfounded rumours, viewed the feature as validation of their long-held suspicions. Khan’s critics accused Bushra Bibi of directly interfering in politics throughout Khan’s tumultuous tenure, an accusation that starkly contrasted with Khan’s public insistence that she was “just a pious housewife”.
Then there were those who derided Khan himself, suggesting that, despite his Oxford education, he was in reality a highly superstitious and irrational individual. Finally, a third group criticised the 1843 feature itself, arguing that it was ‘sexist’ for laying the blame for everything that went wrong with Khan’s government squarely at Bushra Bibi’s feet.

From Islamabad to Pyongyang, authoritarian rulers often use myths, ‘magic’ and the ‘supernatural’ to command loyalty, silence rivals and turn political authority into something ‘sacred’

I posit that this situation mirrors countless examples where politicians strategically exploited beliefs in magic and the supernatural. This tactic is often deployed to instil fear in the populace and scare off rivals, especially in regions where such beliefs are widespread. Fundamentally, this strategy is a practical application of the broader ‘politics of fear’ tactic, designed to exploit psychological vulnerabilities for political advantage.
François ‘Papa Doc’ Duvalier, the dictator who ruled Haiti from 1957 to 1971, is a prominent example of a leader portraying himself as utilising ‘voodoo’ and magic for authoritarian control. Duvalier established a powerful cult of personality by merging brutal authoritarianism with voodoo mysticism. He modelled his demeanour on the Haitian ‘spirit of the dead’. This allowed him to cultivate an image of a magical ruler, leveraging deep-seated spiritual beliefs and fears among the populace. He claimed to have connected his regime with the spiritual world.
He was able to consolidate his power, especially over the rural population, who were predominantly voodoo practitioners. His tyrannical paramilitary force, dubbed the Tontons Macoutes, derived its name from a figure in Creole folklore — a bogeyman who kidnaps disobedient children. This naming strategy effectively utilised cultural fear and superstition as a tool for political repression.



The Kim Dynasty in North Korea maintains control by cultivating a pervasive mythology that attributes supernatural powers and divine status to its leaders. State-sponsored tales suggest that the ruling Kims can perform supernatural feats, such as being able to control the weather. These non-rational narratives solidify the Kims’ absolute authority, elevating them beyond the status of mere political rulers.
Former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein cleverly leveraged rumours of the occult to instil fear and psychologically undermine the opposition. Saddam and his family were widely rumoured to employ sorcerers to protect their regime and forecast the moves of their enemies. Stories circulated among the public that Saddam possessed a magic stone or talisman, rumoured to be implanted under his skin, which rendered him invulnerable to harm. The belief that the dictator was magically protected served as a powerful psychological deterrent, suppressing any internal movements before they could seriously challenge his power.
Even in a democracy such as Sri Lanka, with an ostensibly modern political culture, superstition and traditional beliefs remain significant in politics. According to political scientist O.N. Thalpawila, many Sri Lankan politicians continue to adhere to traditional superstitious beliefs, notably depending heavily on astrology to guide and advance their political careers. Thalpawila suggests that Lankan politicians openly embrace and confess these supernatural beliefs to gain traction and support from a populace that also shares these beliefs.
These are but just a few modern illustrations of a timeless authoritarian tactic: rulers claiming to possess or utilise supernatural powers over a population, particularly when large segments of that populace adhere to traditional or superstitious beliefs. This practice transforms political authority into a sacred or terrifying force.
The political use of the supernatural is a double-edged sword, though. While some leaders project divine power, others use accusations of black magic to destroy their opponents’ reputations. These accusations can severely damage an opponent’s reputation and credibility.
Khan often framed Bushra Bibi as a pious, Sufi figure, arguing that his political rivals were deliberately attempting to demonise her as a ‘witch’ to discredit him. One cannot outrightly dismiss this. However, the accusations were not limited to external rivals. Even elements within Khan’s own political party, wary of her increasing political influence over him, allegedly described her as a diabolical person using magic for nefarious purposes.

 

Conversely, some observers speculated that Bushra Bibi’s spiritual persona was a calculated act, exploiting Khan’s reputed superstitious nature and naïveté for political gain. It is also highly probable that the couple publicly engaged in forms of ‘spiritualism’ commonly practised by the rural populace (especially in Punjab), to gain traction and secure political support from these segments.
It is also likely that Bushra Bibi actively cultivated her growing reputation as a powerful practitioner of supernatural forces, including the rumour that she was served by djinns, as a strategic means to control her opponents, both within Khan’s party and among rivals outside of it.
The political behaviour of Khan and Bushra Bibi, characterised by repeated verbal and public actions suggesting they were guided by supernatural forces (which they often framed as ‘Sufism’), certainly made all the previously discussed scenarios plausible. Their explicit reliance on this perceived spiritual guidance created a powerful narrative. However, it also opens the door to a question: if this claimed ‘Sufism’ was so potent, why has it not been effective in securing Khan’s release from prison and restoring him to the prime minister’s office?
While it is true that their opponents likely fuelled significant exaggeration regarding the couple’s spiritual practices, it is undeniable that the couple themselves created the space and justification for these exaggerations to take root and spread.

Parallel findings from UN monitoring teams and a Washington Post investigation indicate that some of these weapons have already filtered to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), strengthening a group responsible for escalating attacks inside Pakistan.
The 137-page report, released this week by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), recounts the scale of the two-decade American project to rebuild Afghanistan. Congress, it notes, provided roughly $144.7 billion between 2002 and 2021 to reconstruct the country and to support a democratic transition — “yet ultimately delivered neither.”
Recent UN assessments reinforce the regional implications of that failure. A UN panel reported that the Afghan Taliban continue providing logistical and operational support to the TTP, while the Washington Post has documented that dozens of US-origin weapons are now surfacing in Pakistan in the hands of terrorists targeting the state.

 

SIGAR attributes part of this spillover to the abrupt loss of visibility after the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. “Due to the Taliban takeover, SIGAR was unable to inspect any of the equipment provided to, or facilities constructed for, the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) following the Afghan government’s collapse,” the report states.
The US Department of Defence, however, has confirmed that approximately $7.1bn worth of American-provided equipment was left behind — including thousands of vehicles, hundreds of thousands of small arms, night-vision devices and more than 160 aircraft.
The consequences of this transfer are already manifesting in Pakistan.
According to the Washington Post, serial numbers of at least 63 seized weapons inside Pakistan match those originally supplied by Washington to Afghan forces. The Washington Post report cited Pakistani officials as saying that some of these rifles and carbines are “significantly superior” to the weaponry commonly used by TTP fighters before 2021.
UN monitoring reports echo this concern. The 36th Monitoring Report (2025) estimates that the TTP maintains a force of around 6,000 fighters spread across Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, Kunar, Uruzgan, and Zabul provinces of Afghanistan, and shares training facilities with Al Qaeda.
Addressing the UN Security Council, Denmark’s deputy permanent representative Sandra Jensen Landi said the TTP continues to receive “logistical and substantial support from the de facto authorities” in Kabul.
Earlier UN reports detailed Taliban-provided guesthouses, weapons permits, movement authorisations, and immunity from arrest for TTP leaders — arrangements that have allowed the group to entrench itself deeper in Afghan territory. SIGAR’s own quarterly reports for 2025 cite a string of cross-border attacks, including an assault in South Waziristan that killed 16 Pakistani security personnel.
SIGAR’s final review also revisits the scale — and the futility — of US investment in Afghanistan’s security sector. Between 2002 and June 2025, Washington obligated $31.2bn for ANDSF infrastructure, transportation, and equipment. The US purchased 96,000 ground vehicles, more than 427,000 weapons, 17,400 night-vision devices, and at least 162 aircraft for Afghan forces. As of July 2021, just before the then-Afghan government collapsed, the Afghan Air Force still had 131 operational US-supplied aircraft — virtually all of which are now under Taliban control, according to the report.
Another $11.5bn funded construction of bases, headquarters, and training facilities across Afghanistan, most of which are now either controlled by the Taliban or completely inaccessible to US inspectors, it says.
The report concludes that America’s ambition to build a stable and democratic Afghanistan was hamstrung from the outset by flawed assumptions and misaligned partnerships. Early US decisions to back “corrupt, human-rights-abusing powerbrokers,” SIGAR argues, undermined governance, fuelled insurgent recruitment, and gradually hollowed out the institutions the US was trying to build. The watchdog estimates that $26–29.2bn was lost to waste, fraud, and abuse.
The human cost was far greater. Tens of thousands of Afghans and more than 2,450 US service members were killed, only for the Taliban regime to be restored — and now strengthened by the very equipment the US spent years procuring for its adversaries, it adds.
Despite the collapse, the United States has remained Afghanistan’s single largest donor, having disbursed more than $3.83 billion in humanitarian and development assistance since August 2021 — underscoring Washington’s continued struggle to balance humanitarian obligations with security fears.
As SIGAR ends its mandate after nearly two decades, the final report offers a sobering warning. The Afghanistan experience, it concludes, should serve as a cautionary tale for any future effort to rebuild fragile states on a massive scale — a failure whose ripple effects are now reshaping the security landscape of the wider region.</p><small>2025-12-07 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/07113256ce52310.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959635/justice-zafar-ahmed-rajput-sworn-in-as-shc-cj' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput sworn in as SHC CJ</strong></a><br><p>

KARACHI: Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput took the oath as the chief justice of the Sindh High Court (SHC) on Saturday.
Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori administered the oath at a ceremony held on the premises of the Governor House.
Besides judges of the high court, the event was attended by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjar, senior lawyers, federal and provincial law officers and foreign dignitaries.
Justice Rajput has already been serving as the acting chief justice of the SHC since Sept 15. He became the senior-most judge of the SHC after the retirement of the then chief justice Mohammad Junaid Ghaffar.
He was notified as the regular chief justice by the Ministry of Law and Justice on Dec 5, as the Judicial Commission of Pakistan had approved his elevation on Dec 2, after considering the nominations of the top three judges for the position of chief justice of the SHC.
Born on October 16, 1965 in Hyderabad, Justice Rajput was enrolled as a lawyer for the subordinate judiciary in 1990 and became an advocate of the high court in 2001.
He had also served in the district courts as, initially, he was appointed as a judicial magistrate/civil judge in 1993 and promoted as senior civil judge in 2000. Thereafter, he left the service and started his private practice as a lawyer.
Justice Rajput was appointed as a judge of the SHC in August 2013 and he is set to retire in October 2027, if not elevated to the superior courts.
Presently, the SHC is functioning with 33 judges, including 21 permanent and 12 additional judges, against the sanctioned strength of 40.

Those who were offloaded belong to Faisalabad.
An FIA spokesperson said on Saturday that all of the passengers were going to Jeddah by flight number FZ 356 from Faisalabad airport; however, they were stopped during clearance on the basis of their suspicious movements and evidence.
The passengers included Hamza Ali, Zeeshan Ali, Samiullah, Shiraz Hassan, Imran Waris, Bilal Hassan, Syed Yasin Hussain, Muhammad Rizwan, Ghulam Rasool, Haq Nawaz, Faizal Bibi, Zahida Bibi and Sardaran Bibi.
He said there were reports that female passengers were being used as shields to travel to Europe through Saudi Arabia from various airports on Umrah visas.
During the investigation, suspicious international phone calls were detected which were made from the passengers’ mobile phones. He also added that calls from the phones of offloaded passengers were also detected which were made to an agent identified as Sajid Ali and chats were made with him related to their next illegal journey to Egypt and Libya.
According to the initial investigation, the passengers stated that they were planning to travel from Libya to Europe by boat.
The FIA Anti-Human Trafficking Circle has been handed over the custody of offloaded 13 passengers for investigation and legal action.
Meanwhile, FIA arrested two persons for violation of Copyright Act.
An official said that FIA Corporate Crime Circle team raided Sargodha Road and arrested both suspects Mazhar Ali and Arqam Ali from whom a large quantity of fake products of known registered companies were also recovered.
ACCIDENT: A youth died after he was hit by a speeding car near Tin Pullian Wala Adda on Shorkot Cantonment Road on Saturday.
Rescue 1122 said deceased identified as Amanullah (19) of Mauza Bhangoo was crossing the road when a car ran over him as a result he was critically injured. He was shifted to Shorkot THQ hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.The car driver sped away after the accident.
SUSPENDED: Faisalabad Commissioner Raja Jehangir Anwar suspended secretary of union council No 70 of Pirmahal tehsil, Syed Zeeshan Haider, due to his failure to eliminate stray dogs in UC villages which caused rising dog-bite cases.
During his visit to Pirmahal tehsil on Saturday, people complained to the commissioner that a number of children and senior citizens had been bitten by the rabid dogs.
He also warned the assistant director (local government) to boost municipal services in all 17 rural UCs in the tehsil, including focussing on dog culling and sanitation.
The commissioner took notice of the poor condition of the cleanliness in Pirmahal THQ hospital and asked the MS to improve cleanliness within seven days otherwise action be taken against him. He set the Dec 31 deadline for the contractor to complete the construction of trauma centre in the hospital.
During the briefing, he was informed that after the completion of 20-bed trauma centre the total number of beds will increase to 50.
He also directed the assistant commissioner to deploy additional janitors for cleaning the hospital and submit him report. He said the general bus stand at Pirmahal is in bad shape and its essential repairs would be done by District Council funds.
The commissioner also visited the Lyallpur Museum at Faisalabad along with its Chairman Board of Governors Dr Amir Sarfraz. On this occasion, it was decided to expand the Lyallpur Museum and the commissioner said that it is necessary to display more than 5,000 artifacts already kept in stock in the museum. He sought an expansion plan from the curator of the museum and said that the facilities for visitors will be upgraded.
He said that the maintenance issues in the museum should be resolved within two weeks. He visited the galleries containing the history of the region. Additional Commissioner (Coordination) Amir Raza and Curator Maqbool Ahmed Malik were also present.

“Since the creation of the Crime Control Department in January 2025, the national media and human rights bodies have been highlighting incidents of extrajudicial killings by Punjab police,” said the petition filed by lawyers – Mian Dawood, Pervaiz Elahi, Rai Imran Khan and Nadeem Abbas Dogar.
The petition argues that the CCD has created a state of fear and panic in society with the impression that the police can, now, kill any person by declaring him a criminal after preparing his past criminal record by implicating him in already lodged FIRs through supplementary statements.
According to media reports, nearly 1,100 citizens have been killed in police encounters so far, it adds.
The petition argues that the superior judiciary, in multiple judgments, has already declared fake police encounters unconstitutional and illegal.
“Fake encounters are being used as an alternative to the criminal justice system,” it alleges.
The petition states that recent killing of a young lawyer, Zeeshan Dhaddi, at his residence by the police in Vehari is a shameful example of fake encounters.

 

It submits that the Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act 2022 was enacted specifically to curb fake encounters, which empowers the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to conduct an inquiry into every custodial death within 30 days.
The petition contends that the Lahore High Court in several judgments already directed the federal government and the Punjab chief minister to ensure the implementation of the law.
However, the citizens are still being labelled as suspects and killed in Punjab with impunity and the FIA has not conducted an inquiry into any custodial death to date.
The petitioners ask the high court to immediately halt all police encounters in Punjab and direct the FIA to conduct inquiries into police encounters conducted since the creation of the CCD.
The Punjab government, Punjab police, CCD, FIA, and the federal government have been made parties in the petition.

Tourists were among the dead in the blaze, which broke out at about midnight at a club in Arpora in the north of the coastal state.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a statement that the deaths were “deeply saddening”.
Goa, a former Portuguese colony on the shores of the Arabian Sea, lures millions of tourists every year with its nightlife, sandy beaches and laid-back coastal atmosphere.







“Today is a very painful day for all of us,” Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said in a statement, adding that “25 people have lost their lives and six have been injured.” Sawant told journalists that “three to four” tourists had died, without giving their nationalities.
“I have ordered a magisterial inquiry into the entire incident to identify the cause and fix responsibility,” Sawant added.
‘Fire show’
Video images from the Press Trust of India news agency showed rescuers carrying the injured or dead on stretchers down the narrow stone staircase of the Birch nightclub.
“Most people died due to suffocation in the basement and kitchen area,” Nitin V. Raiker, Goa’s fire chief, told Indian broadcaster CNN News18.
“I received information that there was a club party going on, and a fire show was organised in the club. The wooden parts of the club caught fire, and smoke spread throughout the building.”
Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations.
In May, at least 17 people died after a fire ripped through a three-storey building in the Indian city of Hyderabad.
A month before that, a fierce blaze broke out in a hotel in Kolkata, killing at least 15 people. Some people clambered out of windows and onto the rooftop to escape.
And last year, at least 24 people died after a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat.</p><small>2025-12-07 05:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6934c70d883b9.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959658/beyond-the-notification-storm' target='_blank'><strong>Beyond the notification storm</strong></a><br><p>WHAT has been described by analysts and ministers alike as a storm in a teacup has subsided with the much-discussed/ awaited ‘notification’ now in the public domain. However, the notification does not say what caused the friction, if at all there was any, among the two elements of the hybrid set-up and who conceded ground, if anyone actually did.
Despite considerable speculation about the differences holding up the notification, with some ‘analysts’ suggesting a total breakdown was imminent, spelling an end to the hybrid set-up, there were others who were analysing the situation in a far more nuanced manner and insisting the doomsday scenario was grossly exaggerated and indicative of wishful thinking than fact.
After everything was so explicitly spelt out in the 27th Amendment, one couldn’t understand what room was left for friction. All that was nee­ded for the notification was a ‘cut and paste’ from the amendment, quite honestly. Not much more.
The amendment was in itself a reflection and recognition of the reality of the mutual need for the two rather unequal halves that make up the hybrid set-up, so where, how and why would the question of civilian reservations arise, let alone beggars (as in can’t be choosers) ‘taking a stand’?

After everything was so explicitly spelt out in the 27th Amendment, one couldn’t understand what room was left for friction.

If I ask you how significant the continuation of the current set-up is for its civilian element’s well-being, particularly in view of the last election, where its mass support seemed to have collapsed rather dramatically, when it had to be dragged across the finish line, despite every conceivable odd stacked against its main opponent, you’d say very. And you’d be spot on.
In an indication of how much the PML-N will be relying on one institutional leadership’s generous assistance in the hope of mid- to longer-term political survival and relevance is that the part now notified will remain in place for nearly two years beyond the next general election.
Another strong marker of how the hybrid system would stay in place came in the form of the recent acrimonious arguments between the jailed opposition leader and his tormentors where the language of the exchange descended into wholly unnecessary invective.

 

He may be the most popular politician in the country but must take the blame for framing his discourse in the coarsest of words and language, leading others to mimic him. This language pushes further and further any possibility of a national reconciliation and also pushes his adversaries closer together into one corner.
All else is irrelevant. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who successfully and even heroically transitioned from being the proud protégé of a military ruler to a leader committed to upholding the principle of civilian supremacy seems also to have had a reality check.
He occasionally speaks to assert that he remains wedded to his beliefs but, having played a long innings that included dramatic comebacks, now seems reconciled to taking the backseat and tempering his rhetoric in the light of the ground reality for the sake of his chosen political successor-daughter’s political career.
His younger brother, the prime minister, seems content with the role of a globetrotter, flying to different destinations in the Gulf, Central Asia and further afield to shake hands and embrace various leaders and sign MoUs which our hapless nation must earnestly wish materialise one day soon in the concrete shape of FDI so their lives are bettered.
Against this backdrop and the taming of the judiciary via two consecutive constitutional amendments, one struggles to see what discord could have delayed the notification. A cynical friend suggested the likely cause of the delay was not discussed in the media. Incompetence.
He says with the ‘smooth’ passage of the 27th Amendment by a compliant parliament everyone whose job it was to ensure the notification was written up and ready from the ministries of law and defence to the JAG branch may have slipped into a smug slumber.
And suddenly awake when the notification, or more appropriately the delay in its being made pu­­blic, became an issue. “This is how close crisis-pro­­ne Pakistan always remains to its default sta­te,” he added. With social media platforming the wildest theories, even the more or less neutered electronic media could not contain itself and jum­ped in. And the storm raged. Then the bubble burst.
Enough about that. The current set-up may have ensured its longevity for the foreseeable future, but the question is whether it has what it takes to deliver. The country is facing challenges on every front. Whether the terrorism gripping large parts of two of the four provinces is a blowback of years of failed, even suicidal, state policies or foreign-fu­nded and instigated, it is asking blunt questions of those responsible for the security of the country.
And promises of economic growth, when the population is growing at a faster rate than the economy, also sound no more than empty words. The MoUs being signed every other day — provincial autonomy being eroded to facilitate foreign firms’ interest in our mineral resources (‘rare earth’ is the term in vogue) — have not seen too many dollars flooding in.
Even the trickle that is there is unlikely to change the lives of those who are the true owners of that wealth. Another assault on the constitutionally agreed provincial financial resources share seems underway with little concern about the consequences.
Now that the notification crisis is over, all of the above warrant serious thought if the real issues have to be addressed. It is our collective duty. If the word ‘patriotic’ was not so politicised and loaded, I’d say patriotic duty. But is anyone willing to go beyond the rhetoric to do their real duty?

On similar grounds, a federal constabulary was established.
This restructuring process has been ongoing on federal and provincial levels, driven by the growing difficulty faced by premier security institutions in countering ‘foreign-influenced threats’, terrorism, and violent extremism.
What this process actually means for the future of law-enforcement agencies (LEAs) in Pakistan remains an open and pressing question. Will the centralisation and standardisation of security structures lead to more capable, accountable, and coordinated institutions, or will they further complicate the landscape of security governance? This is a question that will matter significantly in the coming years.
A few former police officers and security experts view this harmonisation process as occurring in parallel with global trends toward modernising security institutions, enhancing investigative capacity, strengthening responses to organised crime, and adopting new technologies.

 

Yet, Pakistan’s context remains burdened by deep structural problems, the police culture of moral policing, extortionist practices, and low public trust. These dynamics complicate any attempt at reform, raising concerns about whether organisational restructuring alone can transform entrenched attitudes and practices.
In this context, when state institutions burden LEAs with national security-related tasks, particularly those related to terrorism, violent extremism, and so-called foreign-influenced threats, the logic of security governance becomes more complex.
The term ‘foreign-influenced threats’ is vague, yet many among the security institutions increasingly interpret it through the lens of rising political mobilisation by movements such as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee in Balochistan, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement in KP, and the Joint Action Committees (JACs) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB). These movements are often framed by security actors as being funded or influenced by foreign forces, including diaspora networks, and therefore as presenting risks to national security.
Political analysts and movement leaders reject this framing, arguing that the state’s anxieties are instead rooted in fears of popular uprisings similar to those witnessed in Bangladesh and Nepal.
Although Gen Z-led movements are gaining momentum globally, the uprisings in Bangladesh and Nepal were interpreted by segments of South Asian power elites as externally engineered, including by the US and Pakistan. Regardless of the accuracy of such interpretations, these narratives have contributed to shaping Pakistan’s internal security architecture.

Will centralisation and standardisation of security structures lead to more capable institutions?

For example, when the federal government an­­n­­ounced the transformation of the Frontier Con­stabulary into a ‘nationwide federal force’, its int­e­nded mandate included operating across all provinces, Islamabad, AJK, and GB. One explanation for this expansive jurisdiction is the state’s perception that local police forces in AJK and GB have been unable to contain the JAC protests, neces­­­sitating a more centralised coercive capacity.
This harmonisation process was formalised with the establishment of the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre under the National Counter Terrorism Authority. The creation of Niftac was described as a step towards realising Nacta’s original objectives. In practice, however, Niftac has eclipsed Nacta, undermining its status and institutional relevance, despite expanding its footprint across all provinces. The irony is that a wing of Nacta has become so large that it has effectively subsumed the parent organisation.
If state institutions had wished to establish Niftac as an independent body, they could have done so and subsequently merged it with Nacta.
But Nacta was created through an act of parliament, meaning that any restructuring would have required legislative amendment and public debate. The more expedient strategy, therefore, was to create Niftac as a ‘wing’ of Nacta — while granting it a mandate that far exceeded that of the original authority.
Another development is the government’s plan to establish a National Cybersecurity Authority under the Cybersecurity Act, 2025, recognising that cybersecurity has become an integral component of the internal security domain.
The merger of the Levies into the police in Balochistan has raised significant questions, as competing narratives continue to shape the debate.
Critics argue that the Levies, despite limited resources and personnel, have historically performed better than the police across a vast and difficult terrain. They point to home department data showing that crime rates in Levies-administered areas are lower than in police-administered zones. This performance gap is particularly striking given the disparity in force size: the Levies operate with roughly 28,000 personnel, whereas the police have more than 42,000.
Most political parties in Balochistan have therefore rejected the merger, insisting that effective local security structures should not be dismantled merely for administrative uniformity. They also fear that the decision is driven less by performance considerations and more by the state’s anxieties over a rising insurgency and its desire to centralise coercive authority.
As mentioned, the purpose of harmonising the internal security infrastructure appears to be countering terrorism and violent extremism-related threats. Beyond that, it is increasingly aimed at addressing broader national security risks, including espionage, identifying actors linked to foreign influences, whether political, regional, or otherwise, and responding to activities deemed harmful to national security.
However, significant grey areas exist within this domain. Under such an expansive framework, any political or social movement can easily be labelled as ‘foreign-influenced’ rather than a legitimate, locally supported mobilisation.
This appro­ach extends across both kinetic and non-kinetic domains, yet what remains missing is recognition that many of these responsibilities traditionally fall within the core mandate of LEAs, particularly the police, whose primary functions are crime prevention and ensuring public safety and security.
The irony is that LEAs, especially the police, have drifted far from their foundational roles. Their increasing focus on moral policing and coercive enforcement has become more regressive, extra-constitutional, and marred by institutional corruption that continues to deepen.
The police have neither developed the capability to understand nor the capacity to implement their functions under evolving security paradigms. In the process, they have forgotten their core public-service mission.
While the roots of moral policing lie in the colonial era, its contemporary manifestation is influenced not only by state practices but also by the growing pressure of religiously motivated violent groups within society.

Exercise TAT-2025 served as an important platform for mutual learning, enhanced interoperability and professional development. Pakistan Navy and Royal Navy of Oman have been conducting the TAT series of exercises regularly since 1980 and TAT-2023 was conducted in Omani waters.
The visit included call-ons with senior Pakistan Navy leadership, onboard receptions and visits to key naval installations and training facilities. Personnel from both navies engaged in professional dialogues, operational discussions and exchange of experiences across various maritime domains.
The visit culminated in the sea phase, where naval ships from both forces conducted advanced operational maneuvers and joint exercises encompassing major facets of modern maritime warfare.

QUETTA: Calm returned to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border at Chaman on Saturday after heavy clashes occurred between the two sides a day earlier.
At least three civilians were injured in the clashes last night and were shifted to the district hospital in Chaman. On the Afg­han side, five people were inju­red, according to Afghan government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat.
According to officials, Afghan forces fired mortar shells on the Badani area, prompting security forces to retaliate. However, Afg­han Taliban spokesperson Zabi­hullah Mujahid claimed it was Pakistan that launched an attack on Spin Boldak, alleging that their forces were responding.
Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, confirmed the clashes.
“A short while ago, the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing along the Chaman border. An immediate, befitting [and] intense response has been given by our armed forces,” he wrote in a post on X early Saturday morning.
“Pakistan remains fully alert [and] committed to ensuring its territorial integrity [and] the safety [of] our citizens,” he added.
‘Fighting has stopped’
Chaman Deputy Commissioner Habibullah Bangulzai confirmed that fighting between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban had stopped. He said that immediately after the Taliban attack, an emergency was declared at Chaman District Hospital.
However, the deputy commissioner did not comment on the human or property losses.
SSP Chaman Abdullah Cheema said all security measures had been taken and the situation was under control. Sources said a mortar shell lan­ded on a house and exploded, inj­uring a couple and their daughter.
The residents of the area said that a large number of families living in border villages were shifted to Chaman city.
“Heavy fighting started at 10pm and continued for over two hours,” an official of the local administration said. The clash comes amid stalled negotiations between Pakis­tan and Afghanistan after three rounds of talks in Istanbul could not yield any results.
Border clashes first broke out between the two nations on Oct 11. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism.
Pak-Afghan talks
Soon after the clashes on Oct 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha.
Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators from Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on Nov 6.
But on Nov 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.

The assessment, conducted as part of Fafen’s “Countering Disinformation Thr­ou­gh Information” campaign, emphasis­­es the role of proactive disclosures in str­engthening institutional transparency and curbing misinformation. A lack of official and authentic information fuels speculation, rumours, assumptions, and conjectures, all of which become major drivers of disinformation that undermi­nes institutional credibility, erodes public trust, and contributes to instability.
The assessment reviewed 190 public bodies, including 36 secretariat departments, 98 attached departments, and 56 autonomous bodies, against the proactive disclosure requirements of Section 5 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Right to Information (KPRTI) Act, 2013. The Act explicitly mandates the publication of 12 categories of information and emphasises the need for up-to-date, accessible information, including online.
Overall, autonomous bodies and secretariat departments showed the highest compliance at 64pc, while attached departments lagged behind at 50pc.
Among the secretariat departments, the Auqaf, Haj, Religious and Minority Affairs Department and the Minerals Development Department emerged as top performers, each disclosing 92pc of the required information. The Institute of Management Sciences (IMSciences), Central Prison Peshawar, and the Pesh­awar Development Authority (PDA) led among attached departments with 83pc compliance. Among autonomous bodies, the University of Agriculture, Peshawar, also recorded 92pc compliance.
However, the assessment found that nearly half of the public bodies fall below the 50pc mark. Twenty-seven Secretariat Depart­ments, seventy-three Attached Departments, and thirty Autonomous Bodies disclosed only 33-67pc of the required information. In addition, fourteen Attached Departments, two Autonomous Bodies, and one Secretariat Department disclosed merely 17-25pc.
Organisational information, such as a public body’s functions, duties, and structure, was the most widely available category, with 89pc of public bodies sharing these details. Legal frameworks governing public bodies were accessible on 84pc of the websites. Personnel information and details on public services were available on 76pc of the websites.
Significant gaps, however, persist in disclosures related to decision-making and financial transparency. Only 15pc of public bodies shared information about their decision-making processes or opportunities for public consultation.
Budget transparency was notably poor, with only 27pc publishing proposed and actual expenditures.

Addressing a groundbreaking ceremony of a mass transport system, Prime Minister Shehbaz said the recent election results in Punjab reflected the public’s trust in the PML-N leadership.
“In the next three years, the incumbent PML-N government has the mandate to serve the people,” he said, stressing that they should work tirelessly under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif.
In remarks broadcast live on national TV channels, he expressed optimism that, on the basis of hard work and the launch of development projects, the next election results across the country would be favourable for the PML-N.
“The journey towards progress and prosperity has just begun, and we will move rapidly along the path of development. In the next elections, owing to this hard work, the PML-N will achieve historic results,” he added.

Recent victory reflects people’s trust in PML-N, Shehbaz claims at groundbreaking of mass transit system project

The ceremony was attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar, federal and provincial ministers, parliamentarians, members of national and provincial assemblies, relevant authorities, and a large number of citizens.
The prime minister termed the groundbreaking of the mass transport system a major initiative to facilitate city dwellers, as well as residents of surrounding areas, calling it a key step in providing public relief. He said the project was a gift from the Punjab chief minister and would transform the entire district, providing immense relief to commuters, including students, patients, labourers, lawyers, and people from all walks of life.
He recalled Nawaz Sharif had launched development projects at a time when the country was “embroiled in slogans and politicking,” burying that style of politics. He said the former prime minister and chief minister had initiated road networks, health facilities, and numerous other economic initiatives, starting a new chapter in politics during the 1988 elections which, he remarked, continued under PML-N leadership. He said history would remember Nawaz Sharif’s achievements “in golden words”, including making Pakistan a nuclear power in 1998. Had that not been the case, he opined, the situation during the recent conflict with India in May would have been different.
Carrying forward Nawaz Sharif’s legacy, the journey of progress was advancing rapidly under the dynamic leadership of his daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, he added.
He lauded the Punjab government’s initiatives, including the construction of a cancer hospital, the launch of metro bus services, the Clean Punjab campaign, pollution-reduction efforts, provision of housing for the homeless, assistance for flood-affected people, and the provision of missing facilities in schools.
The prime minister said that all these measures spoke for themselves and, like truth, could not be ignored even by political opponents.
CM Maryam, in her remarks, highlighted the key initiatives launched by the provincial government, saying the country had witnessed significant progress and development under the PML-N leadership. She also briefed the audience on the Gujranwala Mass Transit System project.

Police officials said unidentified individuals had planted an improvised explosive device (IED) on the track in the Nuttal area of Nasir­abad. Upon receiving information about the device, police and Frontier Corps personnel rushed to the site and cordoned off the area.
The bomb disposal squad also reached the location and safely defused the IED, Nasir­abad SSP Ghulam Sarwar Bhaou said. He added that the attackers wanted to target the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express, but timely action saved the train from a potential blast.
Trains halted in Jacobabad 
Meanwhile, the Jaffar Express arriving from Peshawar to Quetta and the Bolan Mail coming from Karachi were stopped at Jacobabad Railway Station due to security reasons.
According to railway officials, both trains were halted on Saturday at Jacobabad to ensure the safety of passengers. Authorities are assessing the situation, and services will be resumed once conditions are deemed secure.
Railway officials further stated that the Chaman Express, scheduled to run from Quetta to Chaman today (Sunday), has also been cancelled.

At the same time, market players believe it will be difficult for the State Bank to engineer a weaker rupee to boost exports, arguing that past experiences of devaluation failed to deliver a sustained increase in export volumes.
Some currency experts said the scope for further devaluation to support exports was limited, particularly as the US dollar itself has come under pressure against major global currencies.
“There is no mathematical calculation behind this expectation that the dollar may slip below Rs280 by the end of this month. It is the market sentiment and it happens at the end of the year,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market. He believes the dollar will slip below Rs280 only for a brief period.

Experts warn against devaluation, say past episodes failed to increase exports

Other experts said dollar demand would remain steady but sentiment had improved after a $3 billion rollover from Saudi Arabia, which they expect to support the rupee.
“If anything, the risk right now is that the rupee may trade below 280 per dollar, which could destabilise export-based industries, whereas a mild depreciation would be the right way forward,” said Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark.
During the current fiscal year, the rupee has appreciated gradually, with more noticeable gains since July 31, when the dollar hit its peak for the year. On July 31, the dollar was traded at Rs284.27, compared to Rs280.42 on the last trading day of the outgoing week.

 

One dealer noted that the US dollar has already lost about 12 per cent against major international currencies, arguing that the rupee had effectively helped the dollar remain relatively strong and stable in the local market.
Exports, however, have been declining. They fell 15.4pc in November, swelling the trade deficit for the first five months of FY26 to $37.2bn and putting pressure on the current account.
The market has been rife with speculation that the government is under pressure to devalue the rupee to support exporters, but the currency’s gradual appreciation has dismissed such perceptions.
“Yes, the calls for a weaker rupee have grown louder. You hear the usual arguments: global demand is soft, INR (the Indian rupee) drifting towards 90 per dollar, exporters cannot price orders due to high costs, and a correction will magically ‘fix competitiveness’,” Mr Mamsa said.
The rupee had collapsed from 180 to 300 against the dollar in just two years — one of the sharpest devaluations in the region. But there was no meaningful export boom, no import compression beyond what the SBP manually enforced and no structural improvement.
“A few publications this week are again glorifying REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate) and implying that a weaker rupee is somehow ‘necessary’. It’s a familiar narrative: REER goes above 100, currency is ‘overvalued’, therefore devalue it. It’s an incomplete way to look at a modern FX (foreign exchange) market,” Mr Mamsa said.
Currency experts also pointed out that the IMF has not treated REER as a primary barometer for the exchange rate since 2018, but exporters continue to exert political pressure for devaluation to shore up margins.

Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the officials were involved “in the oppression of women and girls and in undermining good governance or the rule of law” in Afghanistan.
Australia was one of several nations which pulled troops out of Afghanistan in Aug 2021, after being part of a Nato-led international force that trained Afghan security forces and fought the Taliban for two decades after Western-backed forces ousted them from power in 2001.
The Taliban, since regaining power in Afghanistan, have been criticised for deeply restricting the rights and freedom of women and girls through bans on education and work.
The Taliban government says it respects women’s rights, in line with its interpretation of Islamic law and local custom.
Wong, the Australian foreign minister, said in a statement the sanctions targeted three Taliban ministers and the chief justice, accusing them of restricting access for girls and women “to education, employment, freedom of movement and the ability to participate in public life”.
The measures were part of a new Australian government framework that enabled it to “directly impose its own sanctions and travel bans to increase pressure on the Taliban, targeting the oppression of the Afghan people”, Wong said.
Australia took in thousands of evacuees, mostly women and children, from Afghanistan after the Taliban retook power in the country, where much of the population now relies on humanitarian aid to survive.

The acting US ambassador, who called on the interior minister, offered her country’s full technical assistance for counter-narcotics operations and efforts to curb illegal immigration.
The meeting also focused on strengthening collaboration in intelligence sharing.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Naqvi said that Pakistan had a clear and firm policy regarding illegal immigration.
He added said the identification of drug trafficking cases at airports remained a top priority.
“State-of-the-art scanning machines are being installed at all major airports across the country.”
The minister reaffirmed that the country was strictly implementing a zero-tolerance policy against narcotics.
“Even today, drugs originating from Afghanistan are reaching dozens of countries and destroying young generations,” he noted, adding that US technical support to bolster Pakistan’s counter-narcotics capabilities would be welcomed.
On the prime minister’s directive, the National Narcotics Coordination Centre would be set up soon, the interior minister informed the envoy.
ANF performance
During the meeting, a detailed briefing was given on the Anti-Narcotics Force’s (ANF) performance and ongoing operations across the country.
It was shared that under the annual counter-narcotics campaign, 134 tonnes of narcotics were seized, 2,001 suspects — including 75 foreign nationals — were arrested, and drugs worth $12.797 billion were confiscated.
It was further informed that in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh, 110 Afghan nationals were arrested and 40,659 acres of land were cleared to maintain a “poppy-free status”.

 

Ms Baker appreciated the performance of the ANF and said that the United States placed special importance on its relations with Pakistan and would continue cooperation in all areas.
The interior minister said Pakistan-US relations were vital for promoting peace and stability in the region, and that Islamabad was committed to further strengthening their long-standing bilateral ties.
The meeting was attended by the interior secretary, the ANF director general, its director enforcement, representatives of the US embassy, and other officials.

Judicial Magistrate Mohammad Abbas Shah issued a written order declaring all three accused as absconders and directed the issuance of permanent arrest warrants. 
The order states that the accused were repeatedly summoned but failed to appear before the court.
According to the written order, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has completed and submitted challans in the respective cases. The FIRs against the three were registered in July and August 2025 under relevant cybercrime and related offences.
The court has instructed that the permanent arrest warrants be executed in accordance with the law to ensure the accused are brought before the court to face trial.

Exits and downsizing reflect rising costs and policy uncertainty. While the growing use of digital and asset-digital models points to new ways to stay competitive, says the report ‘Diagnosis of Multinational Exits from Pakistan’.
According to the report, MNCs face both opportunities and challenges. The country’s large market and strategic location offer strong growth potential, but rising costs, unpredictable regulations, and weak infrastructure make operations difficult. These domestic issues, along with global business shifts, are pushing many MNCs to restructure, scale down, or even exit the market, it says.
Restrictions on foreign exchange and delays in profit repatriation have historically deterred foreign investors. Profit repatriation declined sharply from $1.7 billion in FY21 to $273m in FY23, limiting reinvestment potential. However, FY24 witnessed a remarkable recovery to $2.215bn, followed by $2.1bn in FY25, reflecting improved profitability in select sectors and strategic capital adjustments.

MNCs’ exit signal rising costs, policy uncertainty

Lengthy processes for permits, tax clearances, and customs approvals remain a persistent barrier. While reforms have aimed to streamline investment procedures, bureaucratic inefficiencies continue to slow operations and increase compliance costs.
High electricity tariffs, inconsistent supply, and outdated logistics networks elevate production and transport costs. Export-oriented firms face additional port delays and limited road and rail connectivity, which affect delivery timelines and competitiveness in international markets.
Despite targeted strategies, Pakistan is still perceived as a high-risk but high-potential market. Many MNCs adopt a “selective presence” approach, retaining profitable business segments, outsourcing non-core operations, or forming local partnerships instead of a complete exit. Investor confidence is shaped not only by macroeconomic trends but also by the clarity, predictability, and ease of doing business in the country.
Multinational companies in Pakistan operate in a landscape marked by both promise and challenge. While global market dynamics influence investment strategies, it is the domestic environment, rising costs, inflation, regulatory uncertainty, infrastructure gaps, and competitive pressures that largely determine operational choices.
High taxation, fluctuating energy costs, and administrative bottlenecks weigh heavily on profitability, compelling MNCs to rethink business models. Simultaneously, evolving consumer preferences and digitalisation pressures drive innovation and strategic adaptation. The significant rebound in repatriated profits in fiscal year 2024, sustained into fiscal year 2025, highlights both the resilience of MNCs and the opportunities in sectors that adapt effectively to these challenges.
Pakistan remains a dynamic and evolving market that continues to attract global attention, even as some MNCs restructure or adjust their operations in the country. Despite some operational downsizing, Pakistan continues to attract foreign investment across automotive, energy, finance, IT, e-commerce, and mining sectors.

The PAK-KOREA Tes­ting Laboratory for PV Modules and Allied Equipment lab was established jointly by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA).
The laboratory has been developed through a $9.5 million grant-aid project from KOICA, alongside a local Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) contribution of Rs185.8m. 
The lab will become operational after achieving accreditation to ISO-17025 standards, including IEC-61215 and IEC-61730. 
The Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA), an allied department of MoST, has already initiated the process to include solar panels in its list of mandatory items.
The PSQCA will conduct random testing of samples from each imported consignment through the new testing lab to ensure quality control of solar panels in the country.
KOICA constructed the laboratory and provided, installed, and commissioned all required equipment for solar panel testing. It also conducted a nine-month training programme to ensure smooth operation during and after project completion.
The PSQCA aims to achieve Certification Body Testing Laboratory (CBTL) status, enabling the lab to issue IEC compliance certificates. It will facilitate local PV panel manufacturers in exporting their products to Europe and Central Asia.
KOICA President Chang Won Sam and the Republic of Korea Ambassador Park Jae-Lark inaugurated the lab on Saturday. 
Mr Sam highlighted that sustainable, reliable energy is vital to Pakistan’s future.
“Country’s abundant sunshine offers a tremendous opportunity in solar e­­nergy, and I firmly bel­i­­e­­ve Pakistan is well-positio­ned to accelerate its transition toward clean and green energy.” He added that Korea aims to support Pakistan in strengthening its capacity to test and certify solar PV modules in accordance with international standards.
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1983, Korea and Pakistan have continuously streng­thened their partnership and expanded cooperation, he said. 
Dr Jaesang Park, pro­­ject manager at KOICA, expressed confidence that the testing lab will significantly contribute to Pakistan’s solar industry.

In a blistering press conference on Friday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
Responding to the DG ISPR’s accusations in a press conference today at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “Do not drive away the people of Pakistan, they stand with Imran Khan and the PTI. Imran Khan is not a national security threat. He has kept the people united.”







Raja said there were many narratives in the country, including along ethnic and sectarian lines, yet Imran had rejected all of them to stand with the narrative of Pakistan, along with PTI’s supporters and voters.
“For God’s sake, don’t do this. You will not be able to minus Imran Khan, but God forbid if you do, it will be very difficult to keep this country’s interests united. If you attack KP and remove its elected government to install an unelected setup, then you yourselves will be responsible for the conditions that follow.”
Raja termed the DG ISPR’s press conference “unfortunate” and added that the party will not answer the accusation and charges levelled against the PTI founder.







“Today we are being told that the country’s most popular leader is a national security threat, which is ridiculous, but this has not been said for the first time.”
Referring to the establishment’s manoeuvring against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in the 1990s, Raja said: “The institutions decided again and again that any popular leader of the people is a national security threat and it is necessary to remove them from the scene, but this did not happen. You cannot remove them from the hearts of the people through your decisions. The nation has always been aware and there is a reason it is standing behind Imran Khan. We are not mad, we know who has always been in control in this country.”
Raja elaborated that he wanted to set the context for everyone, noting that there have been countless times in the country’s history when it was pushed from democracy toward force and authoritarianism.
Referring to previous military dictatorships in the country, he said prosperity was always promised, and yet, they all ultimately failed.
The general secretary of the party said it was claimed multiple times during the past that democracy, law and the Constitution does not suit the country, and needs a stick, but the “ruler always left it weaker than before”.
Raja lamented that the party was frequently criticised as a ragtag group without understanding of affairs and what heights the country was being taken towards.
However, the PTI secretary general questioned whether the country needed to be forcibly developed through the use of power, noting that if this were the case, it would have already happened during previous periods of military rule.
Raja said there was a need for a “grand dialogue”, given the country’s current situation, and that the nation needed to be involved lest the past repeat itself.
“There will be no change, and we will go backwards.”
Referring to the constitutional amendments and the subjugation of the judiciary, he said the development was not even comparable to anything under previous eras of military rule.
Slamming censorship in the country, the senior PTI leader said that anyone speaking freely could be subject to the Peca law, inquiries, and more, referring to the trial proceedings of husband-and-wife lawyer duo Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha.
Raja said the PTI was ready to talk, but the people of KP and their chief minister should never be mocked or denigrated.
“Don’t put the future of the country or KP at stake in this battle of narratives. This is a very sensitive area, take the people along in the conditions that are there at the moment and the state of terrorism. The PTI is the biggest force in the country that can take it towards betterment.”
The PTI secretary general also seemingly criticised the party’s social media wing and supporters, who he said called the party out to respond or answer why it was not taking action. “We are sitting because the country is dear to us and we don’t want discord in the country,” Raja added.
He said the party and Imran would take every step required for the benefit of the country.
“It is very easy to respond to the brick with a stone but we will not do it because the country’s benefit is not in this.”
Former National Assembly speaker and PTI MNA Asad Qaiser also voiced a complaint with the DG ISPR’s remarks.
“There is great anger and heightened emotions in our province. Your words should have been appropriate. We think such words should be desisted from and will also demand that they are retracted because a whole society and province think it has been disrespected.”
Barrister Gohar calls for easing of ‘tone’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali criticised the DG ISPR’s remarks, calling them “inappropriate and wrong” and saying it was “unfortunate for democracy” that a senior officer would use such language against a major political party, its leadership, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister.







Gohar said that “there is an enemy of ours” who would be pleased by press conferences against each other, adding that this was why he had earlier said today’s would not be a confrontational press conference.
PTI Chairman said the party wanted to clarify that “some people are trying to incite fighting between the workers of a major party and members of a major institution”.
Gohar said such incidents should never occur, warning that “the beginning of any great destruction is always due to a few inappropriate words”. He added that ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction.
The PTI leader said there was still time for “tone to be eased” and for steps to improve the current situation. He called for Tuesday’s meeting with Imran to be allowed without restriction and urged that no politics be made over the ex-premier’s meetings with his sisters.
He maintained that the country deserved to prosper and grow, but if the current tense atmosphere and attitude continued, “then it won’t be minus-one, but minus-everyone, which should not happen”.
At the start of the press conference, Gohar welcomed everyone to what he said would be an “unusual” press briefing in response to the military spokesperson’s remarks against the PTI founder, saying it would have a “different tone”.
“We are not going to do a confrontational press conference or to respond to a brick with a stone, but it is very important to tell some facts to the people as charges have been levelled at us.”
He claimed that the PTI was the country’s largest political party and its leader was Imran, with the support of 70 per cent of the nation.
“It is necessary to tell the people what has happened to us in the recent past. From 180 seats, we were reduced to 91 seats, and now we are left with 76. Reserved seats were taken and there was violence against women and children. The injustices against us are a tale of their own.”
Barrister Gohar said the party had continued to endure in order to uphold democracy, adding that the PTI’s stance was rooted in democracy, peace and the rule of law, and that Imran Khan had always maintained that both Pakistan and its army belong to the people.
The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role.
The PTI chairman added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but yesterday’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”.
Referring to Imran’s pending cases and delayed proceedings, he said the party began with a position of calling for his release and was now reduced to asking for meetings to be permitted with the PTI founder.
“All that we endured was for the sake of democracy and the country, but we say, if such conditions continue and such treatment with each other continues, then democracy will be the one to face the biggest loss.”</p><small>2025-12-06 17:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/06183004d610e1d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959570/victims-families-pardon-ihc-judges-son-in-hit-and-run-case' target='_blank'><strong>Victims’ families pardon IHC judge’s son in hit-and-run case</strong></a><br><p>A judicial magistrate on Saturday ordered the release on bail of the son of Islamabad High Court (IHC) Justice Mohammed Asif, after the victims’ families forgave him in the fatal accident case that claimed the lives of two young women.
The tragic incident occurred late at night on Monday near the Pakistan National Council of Arts in Islamabad when a black speeding sports utility vehicle (SUV) allegedly driven by Abuzar struck two girls who worked part-time for an event management company. The victims were travelling on a scooter when the speeding vehicle hit them, killing both on the spot due to severe injuries.
The accused, Abuzar, was remanded into police custody on Tuesday in the case.
He was produced before Judicial Magistrate Shaista Kundi upon completion of his four-day physical remand today. During the proceedings, the court recorded statements of the victims’ families.
The brother of one victim appeared in person, while her mother submitted her statement online. The father of the other girl also confirmed before the court that he had pardoned the accused.
After the statements were recorded, the court accepted the accused’s bail and ordered his immediate release.
According to the First Information Report (FIR) registered at the Secretariat Police Station on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Muhammad Asghar, the vehicle fled immediately after the collision.
Police traced the SUV through its registration number and located the suspect at a private hospital where he had reportedly gone for medical treatment. He was taken into custody, medical and forensic samples were collected, and the vehicle was impounded for examination.
On Tuesday, Judicial Magistrate Kundi had initially granted police physical remand of the accused after investigators requested more time to verify the medical report, conduct a vehicle inspection, and record eyewitness statements.
Sections 322 (manslaughter), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code were invoked in the case.
With both families pardoning the accused before the court, the magistrate granted bail and directed that Abuzar be released.
In Islamabad in 2022, an SUV allegedly driven by the daughter of a Lahore High Court (LHC) judge ran over two persons near the Sohan bridge on the Expressway and the investigation into the case had remained stalled.
As per the details available in the judicial record, on June 8, Shakeel Tanoli and his colleague, Hasnain Ali, were going home at midnight when they were hit by an SUV allegedly driven by a woman.
In July, 2024, Inspector General of Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi informed the IHC that the vehicle involved in the hit and run case was driven by a woman and was in the use of Supreme Court Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed.
In February this year, a local court in Islamabad acquitted Shanzay Malik, the daughter of the Supreme Court judge. The verdict was announced by Judicial Magistrate Adnan Yousuf, who accepted the acquittal application filed by Malik’s legal team.</p><small>2025-12-06 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637783-seven-year-old-dies-after-falling-into-open-manhole-in-lodhran' target='_blank'><strong>Seven-year-old dies after falling into open manhole in Lodhran</strong></a><br><p>
