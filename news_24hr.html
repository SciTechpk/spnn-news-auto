Cats and humans have had a deep relationship for literal millennia. They are a huge part of our lives as pets, internet content or as pest control.
French studio Annapurna Interactive knew the impact cats have and decided to develop a game centred around playing as one. Right down to the stretching, napping and scratching on sofas and carpets.
I know it’s an old game, but 2022’s Stray is one of those games that feels special, not because it’s a very good cat simulator, but a solid adventure, if a short one.



Here, kitty kitty
Without a single spoken word, Stray establishes what it is right out of the gate. We’re introduced to the player character — an orange cat whom we’ll name Buttons for this review — waking up from a nap alongside his family.



The group decides to venture out of a storm drain into a post-apocalyptic world. However, Buttons unfortunately misses a jump and falls into an abandoned underground city in one of the most painful sequences of the game.
Not only does Buttons get separated from his family, but he also falls from a great height and gets injured. Poor little guy.

After a while, doors mysteriously unlock and electronic signs in the environment guide Buttons to the next area of the game. Following signs and messages, he ends up in an apartment and comes across a drone called B12, which has the consciousness of a scientist who tried to escape the city, but has lost most of his memories.
Your goal is clear: escape the city by ascending its three main levels and reunite with your family.



The opening not only communicates this, but is also emotionally impactful when you see Buttons alone in an unforgiving city with an oppressive atmosphere.
It’s not just because he’s a cat, but that feeling of being alone in an unfamiliar and dangerous place is a relatable fear. This is emphasised when pressing the dedicated “meow” button, with Buttons mewing into the void with no answer.
This impact being achieved without spoken dialogue makes it all the more impressive.



It is a pretty brief adventure, though; I managed to finish it in three hours, and that includes time spent exploring the levels.
Moreover, I was left disappointed by the ending. Without spoiling it, it was very emotional, but it was also abrupt and left several key questions unanswered. It’s a shame that they capped off such a solid experience with a subpar conclusion.
Hardcore purr-kour
At its core, Stray is a platformer in which you need to navigate the world and either find items or solve puzzles to proceed through the story.



It’s very simple: run to an area, fetch something and bring it back to progress the quest. Or move empty barrels around to reach higher ground. Rinse and repeat. However, it didn’t get repetitive, at least not in my opinion.
I think this was down to the movement. You press the jump button when the prompt appears on screen, but holding it down allows you to jump across multiple objects in a row.



It’s a lot like free running — maintaining your flow of movement without losing speed or momentum. But sometimes the prompt doesn’t appear, leaving Buttons looking like a bit of a plum.
Escalating challenges emerge throughout, from creatures called Zurks to police drones called Sentinels. Later, laser fences are introduced, forcing you to find alternate paths. Gameplay is varied enough that it doesn’t get boring.
Zurks will kill Buttons by chasing and swarming him, so you need to run past them to survive these sections. You get a weapon at one point that makes them explode, but it overheats way too quickly to be effective.



Sentinels introduce stealth sections to the game — you have to stay out of their sight, otherwise they’ll chase and shoot Buttons. But this is where I found a bit of a problem: stealth is way too easy because of how dumb these things are.
If you’re spotted, the large circle that represents their line of sight will turn red, and you’ll hear a laser charging up. But if you dart round a corner and jump into a box, the Sentinel gives up its chase. I did this right in front of one and it just floated away.



These sections become more frequent in the game’s second and third acts but offer no challenge. You’re not tested, so stealth becomes somewhat boring.
It’s a cat’s world and we’re just living in it



After the frankly heart-wrenching opening, we’re introduced to the world of Stray, which is detailed, highly interactive and immersive.
Buttons traverses a dark, abandoned city, with neon signs with arrows and text lighting up when approached, guiding the player further down the correct path.
An abandoned urban area reclaimed by nature is a bit of an overdone aesthetic in gaming, but Stray’s environments are varied, vibrant and feel lived in, like people were once here.
In the Slums, there are rusty metal sheets, messy apartments and random items and trash scattered everywhere. These are contrasted by bright neon signs, which bathe these oppressive environments with bright colours.
As you ascend, the environments get cleaner; the second main hub, Midtown, has boutiques, restaurants, a nightclub and an apartment block. Neon signs are more widespread and the place is patrolled by police robots and Sentinels.



Though the levels are easy to navigate once you get used to the layout, the immersion is amazing: the world itself is guiding you to your next objective, not an arbitrary marker on your screen. In fact, there is barely a heads-up display at all.
The game has no compass or health bar, and button prompts, though visible on specific items in the world, only appear when approached.



It makes for a very clean display, with your view as a player not obstructed by visual clutter. You can appreciate the game’s art style and environments (which are excellent by the way), allowing you to enjoy the experience more.
Stray is also devoid of any human characters and populated entirely by robots and Zurks. It’s an interesting setting since, despite being robots, they exhibit human behaviour.



They express a range of emotions, play music, and respond positively or negatively to Buttons’ mewing or nuzzling against them.
For example, when two robots are playing Mahjong, Buttons can jump on the table and disrupt the game, causing tiles to fly everywhere and the robots to grow angry. This encounter demonstrates Buttons’ impact and the game’s physics on the world.



Speaking of physics, multiple objects can be knocked off tables or interacted with in general. Walls can be scratched, and bottles and billiard balls can be knocked off tables. If there’s spilt paint and Buttons walks through it, he’ll leave little pawprints behind. It’s an impressive level of detail and interactability.



Robot’s best friend
While the world is well crafted, we need to take a look at Buttons himself, since his animations are extremely lifelike and make gameplay all the better.
During production, Annapurna put real cats into motion capture suits to record their movements and use them to animate Buttons. If the behind-the-scenes documentary was anything to go by, it was a difficult process (because they’re cats), but it paid off.

Running, jumping and other actions are well-animated, making this probably the best rendition of a cat in a game yet, purely from an animation and rendering standpoint. Even Buttons’ expressions, such as when he hisses at Zurks, are animated very well.
If Buttons rubs up against something or purrs, you can feel it through the PS5’s DualSense controller. With the haptic feedback, you feel the vibration only in certain spots. You can also hear purring and meows through the controller’s built-in speaker.

However, we can’t ignore B12. As Buttons’ companion throughout the game, he’s the player’s main source of backstory about the world, interacting with control panels and storing items. But their bond goes beyond that.
Throughout their journey, Buttons and B12 grow closer as they journey up through the various levels of the city and B12 regains his memories. The pair rescue each other on several occasions too, strengthening this bond as they try to escape the city. Again, no spoken dialogue, yet you can feel their chemistry.
Purr-fection?
Stray isn’t a perfect game by any means, but it’s one that I truly enjoyed and can recommend wholeheartedly.
It took me back to an era where gaming was simpler: there were no microtransactions, battle passes or other effects of corporate greed. It’s just you, a cat and a world to explore.
It’s a solid, well-animated experience that should be celebrated, even if it is a very short one. If you’ve got a PlayStation Plus subscription, download it; if you’re on Xbox or PC, bear in mind you’ll be paying $30 for a three-hour game.

Teachers engage students more; the curriculum is constantly updated; books and teaching material are more interesting and even interactive; new ways of teaching and engaging students have been introduced; technology has made its way into education in a big way; corporal punishment is officially banned and frowned upon if still practised; it is widely accepted that children need to learn through doing and exploring rather than just listening to lectures; and last but not least, it is recognised that learning should not be a drudgery and should be enjoyable. There is no reason why learning cannot be enjoyable.
Bigger changes from outside have also had impacts. Online content has made access to quality material easier for teachers, parents and students. Online teaching and learning is opening new doors to ways of how children can be educated. It also improves access to subjects and areas that might not be available locally. Students can now participate in international competitions and other interactions from their schools or homes. AI has only just begun to have an impact. It is hard to see where it will take us but it will have a significant impact in multiple educational domains. Social media has changed access issues, and is shaping the brains, minds and habits of children for good and for bad. The impact is already significant and will be more so over the next decade.
When I talk to children, teenagers and young adults, it is clear that most of them enjoy school or college more than how much my friends and I enjoyed school. These changes need to be built on. There is no reason why any child should not have an enjoyable and fruitful learning experience. Education and learning are part and parcel of human existence. How does it make sense to not work on making this important part of life enjoyable?
At the same time, I have observed certain things over my 30-year or so teaching career that too need to be given some thought. Social media has been shown to have negative impacts on child development. It is not just trolling and peer pressure that are of concern but also how social media and electronic gadgets tend to hardwire children’s brains. A few countries have already started limiting access to social media and internet during school hours. Some have even put age limits on when children can access social media. We need to think this through. The technology is having an impact on student concentration, attention spans and even on how children learn.

There is no reason why learning should not be an enjoyable and fruitful experience.

Learning should be enjoyable but it is also the case that hard things require a lot of effort to learn. Memory usage and sharpness, concentration, grit and resilience need hard work to build. In a bid to make learning enjoyable, some schools end up making things too easy. Students are not able to stay with difficult problems for long. They get bored or frustrated far too easily. But there are definitely hard problems we need to tackle and students need to be able to build ‘muscles’ for the hard work needed.
Multiplication and division, introduced around Grade 3 and 4, are hard concepts to understand and work out. I have seen too many teachers only demonstrate the method for doing multiplication and/or long division and then just relying on examples and exercises to get students reasonably comfortable. There is little to no effort to engage with the concepts behind them. More importantly, there is little attempt to work on memory, grit, concentration, resilience and other desirable attributes when working on explaining the concepts.

 

Learning multiplication tables ‘by heart’ might not be needed anymore as students have access to calculators and computers all the time (though I do feel memorisation gets a bad rap when learning poetry, tables, etc, is excellent practice). But they do need to realise that understanding the basics of multiplication and division are strong ways to further this acquaintance.
I see too many children crying or giving up when they face questions they do not know how to attempt or whose answers they get wrong on the first try. Teachers are not imparting the lesson that failing, making mistakes and learning from them is part of the process and that it is essential to engage with difficult problems for longer periods.
I have seen similar struggles in the teaching and learning of languages. Urdu and English can be hard for children to learn, depending on their circumstances. If a child is introduced to a language three to four times a week — for 40 minutes or so each time — it would be a miracle if he/she is able to learn that language well. Learning is slow and deliberate; it requires significant repetition and a lot of attention. If the attempt to turn education into ‘edutainment’ takes away from these, it will be a loss.
Private schools, in my experience, face this pressure more. They need to show parents that their children are enjoying classes and work, are doing well and are (almost) always brilliant. I guess the fear of losing children drives part of the logic. But there is a fine balance between building the confidence of children and just appeasing them. This balance seems to be missing considerably in our K-12 education.
Though we know much more about how children learn effectively than we did 25-30 years ago, we still don’t know enough. Education should be enjoyable and children happy when learning new things. So, the kind of draconian regimes previous generations were educated under are out.
And rightly so. But education is not only about content; it is also about shaping humans and developing qualities like effective memory usage, deep concentration and focus for long periods, grit, resilience, etc. We need children to be able to take on hard tasks and to persist with them. Hopefully, modern trends in education will be able to forge a happy balance.

Spin doctors live in an alternate reality by definition, but the extent of the spin is remarkable given that even pro-capital donors like the World Bank have acknowledged that poverty and inequality have increased markedly in recent years.
There is arguably no bigger example of the gap between how the ruling class projects its ‘successes’ and the actual conditions of working people than the inordinate focus on foreign remittances. By going on about the contributions of overseas Pakistanis being major contributors to the country’s ‘economic recovery’, the regime implies that this is one of its great achievements.
The numbers are certainly eye-catching. According to the International Organisation for Migration, remittances reached a record high of $34 billion in 2024. This is equivalent to almost 10 per cent of GDP, making Pakistan’s one of the highest remittances-to-GDP rates in the world. Most of this money goes into household consumption, with real estate and small/medium enterprises (SMEs) the other two major recipient sectors.
One only has to scratch slightly beneath the surface to reveal what the numbers really mean. The vast majority of Pakistanis abroad are engaged in low-skilled occupations, often informal and precarious, especially in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The Gulf migrations began in the 1970s and have produced social mobility for millions of largely rural households for decades. But that should not distract from the typically poor working conditions, racism and repression to which migrant workers are subjected in ‘Muslim brethren’ countries. It is also the case that the demand for labour in the Gulf kingdoms has decreased over time.
There are many Pakistanis abroad in the high-skilled labour bracket too, some of whom left decades ago, and some who continue to leave today. They are the ones who tend to invest in real estate, moving their money from one speculative investment to the next, one of the reasons why so many plots in gated housing schemes are actually unoccupied.

What do the remittances figures actually reveal?

The number of migrants in both low- and high-skilled labour brackets has increased considerably in recent years. The Bureau of Emigration & Overseas Employment recently disclosed that 762,499 Pakistanis emigrated abroad in 2025. This is a considerable understatement; many who migrate abroad initially leave on student visas but have no intention of returning, becoming part of the precarious immigrant labour force mentioned above. Even more have no visa at all and leave via human smuggling rackets that promise a new home in European destinations like Greece and Italy. A significant number never make it, and disappear forever, or end up in limbo in countries like Iran and Afghanistan. Families who are lucky enough to track them down spend millions in bribes to get them back home. Many of these rackets, as we have seen recently, are run with the connivance of government departments like the FIA.
To harp on about the great contribution of remittances to Pakistan is to live in a make-believe world about the social and economic hardships and uncertainty about the future that are compelling more and more people to leave, including even those from relatively well-to-do backgrounds. Labour is now Pakistan’s biggest export, above and beyond any single physical commodity. This is not about to change.
For all the talk about enhancing exports, the fact is that this regime is outdoing even those that preceded it in accumulating short-term debt, promoting conspicuous consumption, and engaging in resource grabs.
There are more and more high-profile SIFC-fronted conferences with fancy claims about ‘mineral sector tra­nsformation’ and ca­­pital-intensive agriculture, but all of these revolve around the imperatives of capital, not labour.

 

It has been said before but it merits repeating that four million young people join the labour force every year. The opportunities for gainful employment are decreasing in parallel to the burgeoning supply of labour. This is why the number of people seeking to emigrate abroad is now touching one million a year.
None of the sectors where remittances are coming in are labour-absorbing. The real estate sector is amongst the biggest banes of our collective existence; not only does it create no jobs, it is sustained by land, water and forest grabs that are hastening environmental collapse. Then there is the SME sector, which may constitute a vital part of the informal economy, but cannot compensate for the absence of meaningful and broad-based industrialisation. The resort to more repression cannot hide the failure of this and previous regimes to provide for Pakistan’s young working masses.

It reflects the authorities’ understanding of the seriousness of the virus and their aim to act without feeding unnecessary alarm.
This balance must be carefully maintained. Nipah is not an unfamiliar threat. Since its identification in the late 1990s, outbreaks have appeared intermittently across South and Southeast Asia, usually contained but often deadly. With a fatality rate that can exceed 70pc and with no approved vaccine or cure, the WHO has rightly classified it as a priority pathogen.
These facts alone justify vigilance. But they do not justify panic. Health authorities and experts agree that the immediate risk to Pakistan remains minimal. The current outbreak in India is localised, with limited confirmed cases. Transmission dynamics, too, remain relatively constrained. Nipah does not spread as easily as airborne viruses such as Covid-19 or influenza. The virus spreads between people through direct exposure to bodily fluids such as saliva, respiratory secretions, or blood, which is why outbreaks usually remain limited to specific settings.

 

That said, infectious diseases do not respect borders, and our porous frontiers, high population density and uneven health infrastructure make preparedness essential. The Border Health Services’ advisory mandating 100pc screening, verification of 21-day travel histories, thermal checks and immediate isolation of suspected cases is a necessary first line of defence.
However, airport screening alone is not a foolproof shield. As experts have pointed out, the incubation period — often up to two weeks — means infected travellers may show no symptoms on arrival. Surveillance must therefore extend beyond entry points. Provincial health departments should ensure designated tertiary hospitals are ready, isolation facilities are functional, and laboratory staff is trained in safe sample handling. Rural areas, where human-animal contact is more common and health access weaker, deserve particular attention.
Public communication is equally important. Authorities must resist sensationalism while providing clear, factual guidance. Citizens should be informed about basic precautions — avoiding close contact with sick individuals, practising hand hygiene, and reporting symptoms early. Calm preparedness, coordinated planning and transparent communication offer the best defence against a virus that is dangerous, but not uncontrollable.

Trump said he is speaking with Iran and left open the possibility of avoiding a military operation after earlier warning that time was “running out” for Tehran as the United States sends a large naval fleet to the region.
When asked if he would have talks with Iran, Trump told reporters: “I have had and I am planning on it.”
“We have a group headed out to a place called Iran, and hopefully we won’t have to use it,” the US president added, while speaking to media at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania.
As Brussels and Washington dialled up their rhetoric and Iran issued stark threats this week, UN chief Antonio Guterres has called for nuclear negotiations to “avoid a crisis that could have devastating consequences in the region”.
An Iranian military spokesman warned Tehran’s response to any US action would not be limited — as it was in June last year when American planes and missiles briefly joined Israel’s short air war against Iran — but would be a decisive response “delivered instantly”.
Brigadier General Mohammad Akraminia told state television US aircraft carriers have “serious vulnerabilities” and that numerous American bases in the Gulf region are “within the range of our medium-range missiles”.
“If such a miscalculation is made by the Americans, it will certainly not unfold the way Trump imagines — carrying out a quick operation and then, two hours later, tweeting that the operation is over,” he said.
An official in the Gulf, where states host US military sites, told AFP that fears of a US strike on Iran are “very clear”.
“It would bring the region into chaos, it would hurt the economy not just in the region but in the US and cause oil and gas prices to skyrocket,” the official added.
‘Protests crushed in blood’
Qatar’s leader Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian held a call to discuss “efforts being made to de-escalate tensions and establish stability,” the Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported.
The European Union, meanwhile, piled on the pressure by designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a “terrorist organisation” over a deadly crackdown on recent mass protests.
“‘Terrorist’ is indeed how you call a regime that crushes its own people’s protests in blood,” said EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, welcoming the “overdue” decision.
Though largely symbolic, the EU decision has already drawn a warning from Tehran.
Iran’s military slammed “the illogical, irresponsible and spite-driven action of the European Union”, alleging the bloc was acting out of “obedience” to Tehran’s arch-foes the United States and Israel.
Iranian officials have blamed the recent protest wave on the two countries, claiming their agents spurred “riots” and a “terrorist operation” that hijacked peaceful rallies sparked over economic grievances.
In Tehran on Thursday, citizens expressed grim resignation.
“I think the war is inevitable and a change must happen. It can be for worse, or better. I am not sure,” said a 29-year-old waitress, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
“I am not in favour of war. I just want something to happen that would result in something better.”
Another 29-year-old woman, an unemployed resident of an upscale neighbourhood in northern Tehran, told AFP: “I believe that life has highs and lows and we are now at the lowest point.”
Trump had threatened military action if protesters were killed in the anti-government demonstrations that erupted in late December and peaked on January 8 and 9.
But his more recent statements have turned to Iran’s nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb.
On Wednesday, he said “time is running out” for Tehran to make a deal, warning the US naval strike group that arrived in Middle East waters on Monday was “ready, willing and able” to hit Iran.
Iranian authorities acknowledge that thousands were killed during the protests, giving a toll of more than 3,000 deaths, but say the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by “rioters”.
Billboards and banners have gone up in the capital Tehran to bolster the authorities’ messages.

According to Justice Arbab Muham­mad Tahir’s written order, released on Thursday, Advocate Salman Akram Raja told the bench that he was unable to effectively assist in the case as he had been denied access to his client.
He said meaningful progress on key legal points could not be made without receiving direct instructions from his client.
The court noted that it had earlier directed the authorities to allow the meeting and now sought an explanation for the non-compliance.
The state counsel has been ordered to submit a detailed report before the next hearing, scheduled for Feb 24.

The petition, currently being heard by the IHC, raises constitutional and legal questions relating to freedom of expression, due process and the regulation of social media platforms.
Meanwhile, a Pakistan Telecom-mu­nication Authority report submitted to the court revealed that over the past three and a half years, the PTA made three separate requests to X to block or restrict the PTI founder’s account but received no substantive response.
The first request was sent on Aug 21, 2022, followed by another on April 18, 2024, citing court convictions in the Toshakhana, cypher and unlawful marriage cases. Despite this, X did not act on the requests.
On Nov 27, 2025, the PTA sought the blocking of 47 tweets from the PTI founder’s account, but X blocked only one.
During recent proceedings, the IHC had expressed dissatisfaction with PTA’s response and questioned how the case could proceed if counsel continued to be denied access to the PTI founder.
The court had also taken note of increasing restrictions on meetings between the former premier, his family members and party leaders.

The operation, which continued from morning till evening, was launched in the Sperka and Kotka Akbar Ali Khan areas of the tehsil and at least seven militants were inju­red in the heavy shootout. The security forces targeted the terrorists’ hideouts with more than 25 quadcopter strikes, while a heavy exchange of fire continued throughout the clashes, sources claimed.
The slain commander was identified as Zewaran alias Al-Badri, who was wanted in several cases. Following the operation, continuous surveillance by drones and helicopters was being carried out in the region to round up the remaining terrorists trying to flee the area.
According to locals, the operation also resulted in the death of three civilians, including two women, whose bodies were retrieved from a house in the afternoon. A local resident told Dawn that the deceased included Naeemullah, his mother, and his grandmother. The deceased’s son, wife, sister and cousin also sustained injuries and were taken to a hospital. Separately, Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital spokesperson Muhammad Noman told Dawn that four injured persons were brought to the hospital, including two women and two children.
Sources said the operation started in the morning and heavy contingents of police and security forces reached the area, while the residents were told to stay inside their houses.
The operation was supervised by Bannu RPO Sajjad Khan, DPO Yasir Afridi, and other senior security officials. They remained present in the field and personally monitored the action.
Earlier this week, two terrorists were killed in a shootout with police in Domel. On January 13, armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee in the district. The incident took place in the Gulbadin Landi Dak area of Bannu district.

CAIRO: The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have accepted the estimate that approximately 71,000 Palestinians were killed during its war on Gaza, Israeli outlet Haaretz reported.
Prior to this, Israel had never officially accepted the tally and described the numbers issued by Gaza’s Health Ministry as “misleading and unreliable”, even though the UN considered them reliable.
The IDF noted the casualty count excludes missing persons likely buried under rubble and only count those killed by military fire, excluding deaths from starvation or disease due to the conflict. Over 90 per cent of casualties have been identified by name and ID number.
According to the Gaza Health Ministry, 71,667 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since Oct 7, 2023.
2 killed; prisoners swapped
Meanwhile on Thursday, Israeli forces killed at least two Palestinians in Gaza, even as Hamas and Israel move to implement the second phase of a US-brokered peace plan.
Medics said two men were killed by Israeli fire in eastern Khan Younis, in an area adjacent to where the army operates.
According to the Gaza health ministry, Israeli airstrikes, tank shelling and gunfire have killed at least 490 people since the truce took effect in October. Israel said four soldiers have been killed by Palestinian groups in the coastal territory over the same period.
By advancing to phase two, the US and mediator partners Egypt and Qatar must confront the contentious issue of Hamas disarmament, which the group has long rejected.

 

Separately, the Red Cross said it facilitated the transfer of 15 Palestinian bodies to the Gaza Strip on Thursday after the last prisoner held in the territory was returned to Israel earlier this week.
Palestinian statehood
Meanwhile, Pakistan reaffirmed its demand for a credible, time-bound path to Palestinian statehood on Wednesday.







Speaking at a Security Council open debate, Pakistan’s Permanent Repres­entative to the United Nations Asim Iftikhar Ahmad emphasised that the unresolved question of sovereignty lies at the heart of Middle East instability.
Mr Ahmad strongly condemned Israeli actions against UN facilities, including the recent demolition of a UN compound in Sheikh Jarrah, stressing that such acts undermine stabilisation efforts.
He urged an immediate end to illegal settlement activity and attempts to alter the demographic, legal or historical character of the occupied territory.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday opposed the use of force and coercive measures against Iran, stressing that disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy as Western pressure on Tehran intensified with a continuing US naval build-up in the Gulf and fresh European designations and sanctions.
The Pakistani position was articulated across official engagements and public statements, including a telephone call bet­ween Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Iranian President Masoud Pezesh­kian, con­­tacts between the two foreign ministers, and remarks by the Foreign Off­ice spo­kesperson at the media briefing.
In a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz “underscored the importance of sustained dialogue and diplomatic engagement for promoting peace, security and development in the region”.







Separately, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi, conveying concern over the evolving situation and reiterating Pakistan’s position.
Mr Dar “expressed concern over the evolving regional situation and underscored that dialogue and diplomacy remain the only viable way forward”, the Foreign Office said in a statement.







At the weekly media briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Andrabi expanded on Islamabad’s stance, linking it explicitly to opposition to force, sanctions and external pressure.
“Pakistan has always advocated for peace and diplomacy to settle all outstanding issues. Our advocacy for peace diplomacy continues and this remains our stated position,” he said. “This region cannot afford war, turmoil because this in essence stops the economic development and prosperity. So, we hope that peace and diplomacy will prevail. We oppose the use of force. We are against coercive measures against Iran and interference in its internal affairs,” he added.
Referring to the nuclear issue and multilateral diplomacy, the spokesman said Pakistan supported efforts anch­ored in international law, citing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and subsequent UN Security Council resolutions, including resolutions presented at the Council in September last year.
He also cited a recent UN Human Rights Council resolution on Iran that opposed the use of force and called for upholding the UN Charter, noting that “we subscribe to these positions, and we will continue to do so”.
Islamabad’s emphasis on dialogue came as the European Union significantly hardened its stance on Iran and the build-up of US forces in the Gulf continued.

 

EU foreign ministers on Thursday unanimously agreed to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation. At the same time, the Council of the European Union adopted a fresh sanctions package over human rights violations and Iran’s military support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, adding 15 individuals and six entities to its blacklist.
Moreover, a significant American military build-up in the Middle East is underway, which has been described by analysts as the largest since the 2025 strikes.
The US has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, accompanied by three destroyers and more than 5,000 troops, joining existing assets including F-15E Strike Eagles and THAAD and Patriot missile systems, raising total US forces in the region to around 50,000 by late January.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration is hosting senior defence and intelligence officials from Israel and Saudi Arabia for talks on Iran this week, American news website Axios reported on Thursday.
‘Crushing response’
Iran’s army chief Amir Hatami on Thursday vowed a “crushing response” to any attack, according to state television, which reported 1,000 “strategic drones” had joined the combat regiments.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman have pressed for dialogue while signalling they will not allow their airspace, territory or waters to be used for military action against Iran, because of fears of retaliation and economic disruption.
Turkiye on Thursday said it would offer to mediate between Washington and Tehran during an upcoming visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, after Ankara’s top diplomat urged Washington to start nuclear talks with Tehran.
“It’s wrong to attack Iran. It’s wrong to start the war again. Iran is ready to negotiate on the nuclear file again,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Al-Jazeera.
Nato member Turkiye is also weighing contingency plans along its 530-kilometre border with Iran should the dispute escalate, a senior official told AFP.
Iran ally Russia on Thursday also said that “the potential for negotiations is not exhausted”.
“Any use of force can only create chaos in the region and lead to very dangerous consequences,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty in a call with his French counterpart Jean-Noel Barrot stressed the need for “the resumption of dialogue between the United States and Iran regarding the Iranian nuclear file”, Cairo said.

At a public hearing presided over by legal member of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), Amina Ahmed, the government also reported that it was working on another tariff package under which unutilised electricity would be offered at marginal cost — the actual cost of power supply — to various consumer categories during day time to absorb surplus capacity because of low demand amid rising solar penetration.
“The government is currently working on various options to offer an incentive tariff package (as an alternative to growing net metering), and soon we will approach Nepra for approval”, after its clearance from the federal cabinet, said an official of Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) of the Power Division.
He was responding to Nepra member Maqsood Anwar Khan, who asked whether the government intended to address the widening gap between day and night utilisation of grid electricity, as net-metered consumers draw from the grid at night. Officials cited a low of around 8,261MW and a peak of 14,888MW in Dec.

Consumers in for Rs1.41 per unit hike in February

A CPPA official said the consumers enjoyed a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of 93 paise per unit in January on account of consumption in November, which had come to an end. He said power distribution companies (Discos) would now need 48 paise per unit additional FCA on account of December consumption, resulting in a net increase of Rs1.41 per unit to be charged to consumers in February billing.

 

They confirmed that the higher FCA cost was mainly due to an incremental incentive package that increased consumption by about half a billion units, resulting in the need for utilisation of expensive power plants, given the limitations of hydropower and nuclear plants. On average, consumption in December was 6.5 per cent higher than in November and 8.47pc higher than in December 2024, while annual growth in demand was reported at 2.45pc.
Industrial representatives Rehan Javed and Amir Shaikh challenged a 22pc growth in consumption by the industrial sector on account of a three-year incremental incentive package claimed by the CPPA and PPMC officials and argued that official data was not based on facts.

PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir witness the exchange of PIA’s privatisation documents.—White Star

• PM says airline’s ‘glory days’ to return under Arif Habib-led consortium• NA panel seeks detailed report on PIA accord, employee safeguards
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the “glory days” of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) would return under the new management, as the government signed transaction documents for the airline’s privatisation.
“PIA will reach new heights under the leadership of the Arif Habib Consortium. The airline will improve its performance, punctuality, cabin service and professional standards,” the prime minister said while speaking at the signing ceremony.
The ceremony was attended by Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and federal ministers.







PM Shehbaz congratulated the nation on the signing of the transaction and said Arif Habib and his team were among Pakistan’s “distinguished business ambassadors” who had contributed to the country’s progress. He said the new owners’ first priority would be passenger comfort and safety.
Recalling the airline’s past, the prime minister said PIA had been at its peak in the 1960s, with a recognised presence across Pakistan and in world capitals. He also praised the role of federal ministers and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali in completing the transaction.
The prime minister said the privatisation process was conducted transparently and telecast live. He said the bidding closed at Rs180 billion, of which the consortium would spend Rs135bn on improving PIA.
He hoped that the new PIA owners would help the airline regain its past glory through “untiring efforts and innovation”.
Mr Ali explained the salient features of PIA’s privatisation and said the public would benefit from improved services.
NA body seeks details
Meanwhile, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation on Thursday sought further clarification and comprehensive information on the transaction from the Privatisation Commission.
Chaired by Dr Muhammad Farooq Sattar, the committee asked the commission to submit a comprehensive report at its next meeting, including employee participation, consultation mechanisms and grievance redress.
The meeting was convened to review ongoing privatisation transactions. The secretary of the privatisation ministry briefed the committee on the PIA process, including its stages and the current status of the deal.
The committee was also briefed by the power ministry on the installation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) meters.
It was told that as of Jan 9, a total of 1,614,296 AMI meters had been installed across distribution companies, surpassing the target of 1.5 million.
The panel was also briefed on Pakistan Re-Insurance Company Limited (PRCL), which is listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange and remains majority-owned by the government.
The committee was told that PRCL is planned for partial privatisation through a secondary public offering, but the transaction has been deferred due to unfavourable market conditions and valuation concerns.
Regarding Sukkur Electric Power Company Limited (Sepco), the committee was informed that the government was considering private-sector participation as part of power sector reforms, given the utility’s high losses, weak recovery and governance issues.
Outright privatisation was not considered feasible at this stage, while options under consideration included a management contract or partial privatisation, supported by preparatory reforms and financial restructuring.
The committee str­essed that consumer protection, Nepra oversight and employee safeguards must remain integral to any reform process.

The border closure triggered sharp revenue losses for KP as the collection of infrastructure development cess (IDC) fell to Rs3.48 billion, from Rs7.42bn, during the first seven months of the current fiscal year over the corresponding period of last year.
Muzammil Aslam, the KP chief minister’s finance adviser, has written a four-page letter to Commerce Minister Jam Kamal, seeking an urgent meeting of provincial and federal stakeholders.
The meeting is expected to deliberate on the revenue implications for KP and the challenges faced by exporters and traders, including stuck payments and the loss of business activity.

Collection of cess has dropped to Rs3.48bn in 7MFY26 from Rs7.42bn

The provincial government has already constituted a revenue review committee to examine the situation and found an alarming decline in IDC since suspension of the border trade.
Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan remain heavily concentrated at Torkham and Ghulam Khan, while trade through Kharlachi and Angoor Adda, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, continues to decline, indicating a post-Taliban shift in cross-border trade patterns. Torkham’s growth reflects its role as the gateway to Afghanistan’s key consumption centres, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border stations accounting for nearly 80 per cent of total exports in FY25.
Prolonged disruption
Mr Muzammil informed the federal commerce ministry that the prolonged border disruption was creating serious revenue, economic, and employment consequences for the province. He said revenue shortfall has emerged as a major blow to provincial finances.
He said the initial disruption in cess collection had originated from a court stay order, which was resolved in November. Recovery efforts were launched immediately after the legal hurdle was removed.
But those efforts failed to produce results as cross-border trade remained suspended, effectively bringing commercial activity to a standstill.

 

The adviser further pointed out that exporters and traders now face consignments and payments stranded across the border, intensifying liquidity pressures across the trading community.
The financial stress has left many businesses unable to meet their statutory cess obligations because of the sudden and prolonged trade suspension.
Muzammil Aslam further pointed out that the decline in IDC collection is visible each month, with particularly steep drops recorded since October, when receipts fell from Rs1.3bn to under Rs487 million. In November, collections dropped to just Rs198m from Rs1.29bn during the same month in FY25.
The collection of cess is directly linked to the movement of goods across borders and commercial activity. With trade suspended, achieving collection targets has become virtually impossible.
Traders’ grievances
Mr Muzammil also spoke about problems faced by traders. “They have genuine difficulty in making payments because they are unable to receive funds from buyers due to the overall stagnation of cross-border business.
“This situation is beyond the control of both traders and tax collectors and may result in a broader slowdown in economic activity across the province if trade disruptions continue.”

“Any audit observation made by the Auditor Gen­eral in relation to the accounts of, e.g., the Inland Revenue Department or the FBR or any other governmental entity or any authority or body established by the federation or a province cannot form the basis of enabling or allowing any tax authority exercising powers and performing functions under a fiscal statute to regard that observation as information that would allow for the audit or inspection of the accounts or activities of a taxpayer or sustain the issuance of any notice or initiation of any proceedings under the fiscal statute,” affirmed Justice Munib Akhtar.
Headed by Justice Akhtar, a two-member bench had taken up an appeal against the July 7, 2025, Peshawar High Court’s (PHC) quashing of proceedings against the private company Diamond Filling and CNG Station, Peshawar. The direction came in a sales tax case that was moved by the Inland Revenue commissioner, Peshawar, against the high court decision.
The tax department had initiated proceedings against the private CNG station based on audit observations made by the Director General of Revenue Receipt Audit (DGRRA), a wing of the Auditor General’s office.

Justice Munib Akhtar notes auditor general acts under 2001 ordinance, while tax authorities operate under fiscal statute; both are separate, work in own domains

In his six-page judgement, the judge explained the reason for the observation by stating that it was a well-settled rule that what “cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.”
What is properly within the scope, powers, and authority of the Auditor General acting under the 2001 Ordinance, on the one hand, and of the tax authorities under a fiscal statute, on the other, are separate and operate within their own spheres, he emphasised, adding that they constitute distinct compartments that do not overlap.
The judgement explained that Article 169 of the Constitution mandated that the Auditor General of Pakistan, in relation to the accounts of the federation and the provinces, shall perform such functions and exercise such powers as may be determined by federal law.
The statute currently in the field is the Auditor General’s (Functions, Powers, Terms and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2001. It appears that while exercising such powers in relation to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and in particular the Inland Revenue Department in relation to sales tax, an officer of the Auditor General, the DGRRA, made an audit observation against the CNG company, on the basis of which the officer concerned of sales tax issued a show-cause notice on March 9, 2023, under Section 11(2) of the Sales Tax Act (STA) 1990.
Being unsatisfied, the CNG station moved against the order for the recovery of sales tax by filing an appeal before the commissioner (appeals). That appeal succeeded, and when the commissioner took the matter to the appellate tribunal, the decision of the commissioner (appeals) was upheld on Oct 24, 2024. The department then took the matter in a tax reference to the PHC, which was dismissed.
The judgement said that to stretch the provision in the manner attempted by the department — to include private sector entities in its scope and thereby allow for their audit for fiscal purposes by the auditor general — was to completely misread, misunderstand, and misapply the provision. 
In the end, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal by the Inland Revenue commissioner.

An office-bearer of a traders’ association said India “has now opened an economic front”, after facing defeat on the battlefield, by signing trade deals with several countries and the European Union.
Saquib Fayyaz Magoon, chairman of the Businessmen Panel Progressive (BMPP) and vice president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), cautioned that the agreement could erode Pakistan’s competitive edge in European markets.
Despite Pakistan’s GSP Plus status, which allows duty-free access for nearly 80 per cent of its exports to the EU, the country’s textile exports stand at $6.2 billion, marginally ahead of India’s $5.6bn exports even though the latter faces a 12 per cent tariff.
“Once India secures zero-rated access under the EU deal, Pakistan’s advantage will vanish and our exports could suffer a severe blow,” Saquib Magoon warned.

Traders fear Pakistan could lose its ‘competitive edge’ if govt doesn’t take urgent measures

He feels Pakistan could lose its foothold in the European market if urgent corrective measures are not taken. “Once a market is lost, regaining entry becomes extremely difficult,” he said, urging the government to act decisively.
Magoon called for reducing power tariff to nine cents per unit, simplifying the tax regime, and offering incentives to exporters. “The government must declare an export emergency and adopt industry-friendly policies to safeguard the country’s economic interests.”
Drawing a parallel with military success, Mr Magoon observed: “Just as the armed forces secured victory on the battlefield, the business community now needs government support to win this economic war.”
A representative of JS Global said the EU and India had concluded the agreement after two decades of negotiations. Its upshot is that India’s textile and garment products would now “enjoy a reduction, or even elimination of tariff altogether, in EU states”.
India’s textile and garment exports are currently subject to an eight to 12pc tariff under the GSP regime (which was suspended last week), while Pakistan enjoys zero tariffs under the GSP Plus status.
With the FTA now in place, Pakistan is likely to lose its advantage, which was already thin, as India benefits from higher value addition and “vertical integration”, JS Global said.
The company fears the deal would hit Pakistan’s exports, 24pc of which go to the EU. The bloc remains the top destination for textile exports after the USA.
Price undercutting
Faisal Arshad, who heads the Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMA), said India-EU FTA could lead to aggressive price undercutting by Indian exporters in the EU market, an erosion of Pakistan’s market share in hosiery, knitwear, and value-added garments. This would have a knock-on effect in the form of an increased pressure on export margins, employment, and sector sustainability.
He cautioned that Pakistan’s reliance on GSP+ alone is no longer sufficient to safeguard its exports. “Tariff-free access without recognition of compliance and cost burdens creates an uneven playing field.
“Pakistan must not be disadvantaged for adhering to international conventions while competing with countries that do not face similar obligations,” Faisal Arshad said.
The PHMA chief urged the government to immediately take corrective measures, including rationalisation of power tariffs for export-oriented industries, provision of competitive financing and export refinancing schemes.
“If India secures FTA access while Pakistan’s structural cost disadvantages remain unaddressed, our textile exports will suffer,” he said. “Strategic and timely policy intervention is essential to protect exports and jobs.”
Tough conditions
According to Mr Arshad, Pakistan’s GSP+ access comes with strict conditionalities. “We are required to ratify, implement, and continuously report on compliance with 27 international conventions related to human rights, labour standards, environment, and governance.”
In contrast, the PHMA chairman observed, India’s market access under the FTA does not carry the same obligations.
He said Indian manufacturers benefit from cheaper energy, lower financing costs, large-scale manufacturing, integrated supply chains, and stronger logistics infrastructure.
“When tariff equality is combined with lower production costs and fewer compliance obligations, the competitive gap widens substantially against Pakistan,” Faisal Arshad added.

Presiding over a high-level meeting, the minister directed the National Highway Authority (NHA) to begin construction of the Sialkot-Kartarpur Motorway, which will be named “Guru Nanak Expressway”. He said three-star, four-star and five-star hotels would be developed along the highway to facilitate pilgrims.  
To encourage investment from the global Sikh community, the NHA will launch international marketing campaigns in London, Canada and the United States, he added.  
The minister said the projects would be showcased at international roadshows to attract foreign direct investment. “These projects will be a game-changer for the region,” he said.

Pakistan is expected to make a final decision by next week, over the cricket team’s participation in next month’s Twenty20 World Cup, keeping open the possibility of a boycott over Bangladesh’s withdrawal from the tournament.
Amid the uncertainty, Iceland Cricket had earlier quipped that it needed Pakistan to decide on its participation soon, saying they were “ready to take off”.
It is worth mentioning that Iceland is not a member of the International Cricket Council.







However, on Thursday, Iceland Cricket’s X account — known for its wisecracks — said: “It is with a heavy heart that we now announce our unavailability to replace Pakistan in the upcoming T20 World Cup.
“Regardless of whether they [Pakistan] now withdraw, the short timescales ensure it is impossible for our squad to prepare in the professional manner necessary to compete effectively in this global cricketing spectacle,” it said.







Referring to the ICC’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland, upon the former’s refusal to travel to India, it said, “We are not like Scotland and able to turn up on a whim, with no kit sponsor.
“Our players are from all walks of life and cannot simply drop their occupations to fly halfway around the world to experience temperatures only normally felt in Finnish saunas,” the post said.
“Our captain, a professional baker, needs to attend to his oven, our ship captain needs to steer his vessel, and our bankers need to go bankrupt (again),” it said.
“This is the harsh reality of cricket at the amateur level of the game. This news will be extremely disappointing to our fans,” it said.
“We were ready to give the Dutch the biggest shock they have experienced since William of Orange lost the Battle of Landen in 1693. And the Americans were looking forward to taking on Greenland, or so their orange-dyed leader thought,” the post added, taking a crack at US President Donald Trump.
“Our loss is likely Uganda’s gain. We wish them well. Their kits cannot be missed unless you have epilepsy, in which case they are probably best avoided,” it concluded.</p><small>2026-01-29 19:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29235212487e4ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969741/bangladesh-pakistan-flights-resume-after-14-years' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh-Pakistan flights resume after 14 years</strong></a><br><p>After a 14-year hiatus, the first direct flight between Pakistan and Bangladesh landed at Jinnah International Airport on Thursday night, as Biman Bangladesh Airlines completed its inaugural flight from Dhaka to Karachi.
In a statement, the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said that the Bangladeshi carrier returned to Karachi after 14 years and was given a traditional water cannon salute upon landing.
The authority hailed the flight as “a new chapter” in the relationship between the two countries.
Data from FlightRadar24 showed Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight BG341 landed in Karachi at 11:03pm, having departed Dhaka at 8:15pm.
Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori spoke to the press at the airport, stating that cooperation with Bangladesh would not be limited to aviation but would extend to other sectors.
“I absolutely want to say that today, after several years, the conspiracies have died,” Tessori said, holding India responsible for “driving a wedge” between the people of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
He further said that India was responsible for terrorism in Pakistan and was also “conspiring against Bangladesh”.
“I congratulate the people of Bangladesh, for they have not only defeated the Indian conspiracies but also exposed them,” he said. The governor added that India had been unfair to Bangladesh in cricket as well, saying it was “out in the open”.
“The love between Pakistan and Bangladesh will grow because I know that the Bangladeshi people love Pakistanis,” Tessori stated. “This love will transform through trade and cooperation, and we will fight these Indian extremists together.”
Earlier in the day, Pakistan’s High Commission in Dhaka had released a statement, saying that the “fully packed” inaugural flight had departed from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Dhaka.
The flight was seen off by Bangladesh Civil Aviation and Tourism Adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, High Commissioner of Pakistan to Bangladesh Imran Haider and other officials, the statement said.
“The resumption of direct flight after a hiatus of 14 years marks a significant milestone in strengthening connectivity and bilateral engagement,” it said.







Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Bangladesh’s adviser for civil aviation and tourism underscored the importance of the Dhaka–Karachi route in “enhancing connectivity, promoting tourism and strengthening people-to-people links”.
The statement quoted him as saying, “Bangladesh Airlines will gradually increase flight frequency and reduce airfares to make travel more affordable for the people.”
He expressed hope that people of Bangladesh will visit Pakistan and explore its natural beauty, cultural heritage and diverse cuisines, it added.
During the ceremony, Pakistan’s high commissioner recalled the vision of Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh’s interim leader, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “aimed at enhancing connectivity between Pakistan and Bangladesh”.
“In view of the vision of the leadership and aspirations of the people of our two countries, during the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar to Dhaka in August last year, both sides agreed to take immediate measures for the resumption of direct flights,” the statement quoted him as saying.
He also expressed gratitude to the government of Bangladesh, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, and the Civil Aviation Authority for making the launch of the flight possible, the statement said.
“Passengers travelling on the inaugural flight expressed happiness and enthusiasm over the restoration of the direct air link, describing it as a milestone towards bringing the two countries closer,” the statement added.
Earlier this month, it was announced that both countries would resume direct flight operations after a 14-year hiatus.</p><small>2026-01-29 19:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29231137c35d8a8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969745/trump-says-looks-like-hamas-will-disarm-in-gaza-deal-progress' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says ‘looks like’ Hamas will disarm in Gaza deal progress</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that it “looks like” Hamas would give up its weapons, a step the group has not confirmed, in what would be a major step forward in the fragile Gaza ceasefire with Israel.
“A lot of people said they’ll never disarm. It looks like they’re going to disarm,” Trump told a cabinet meeting.
Trump hailed cooperation with Hamas after Israeli forces brought back the remains of the last captive held in Gaza, Ran Gvili.
“They did help us with those bodies, getting them back, and that family is so grateful,” Trump said.
Trump had asked for an update on the Middle East from his roving special envoy Steve Witkoff, sitting in the side of the room as cabinet members and media listened.
An upbeat Witkoff voiced high confidence in Hamas following through.
“We’ve got the terrorists out of there and they’re going to demilitarise. They will because they have no choice,” Witkoff said.
“They’re going to give it up. They’re going to give up the AK-47s,” he told Trump.



Hamas has said that the return of Gvili’s body showed its commitment to the ceasefire, but it has so far not surrendered its weapons.
The group has repeatedly said disarmament is a red line, but it has also suggested it would be open to handing over its weapons to a Palestinian governing authority.
Disarmament is a key part of the second phase of the ceasefire plan sealed in October.
A Palestinian technocratic committee has also been set up to take over governance in the battered Gaza Strip.</p><small>2026-01-29 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2922075364ce131.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969742/jurists-body-and-partner-organisations-condemn-imaan-and-hadis-arbitrary-arrest-conviction' target='_blank'><strong>Jurists’ body and partner organisations condemn Imaan and Hadi’s ‘arbitrary arrest’, conviction</strong></a><br><p>The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and its partner organisations on Thursday published a joint statement condemning the “arbitrary arrest” and conviction of lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and Hadi Ali Chatta, and called for their release.
Imaan and Hadi were sentenced on January 24 under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act’s (Peca) sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyberterrorism), and 26-A (false and fake information). They were handed a total of 17 years in jail, with the longest sentence being 10 years, and fined Rs36 million each collectively.
The joint statement released on Thursday — signed by the Balochistan Bar Council, the Hyderabad Bar Association, the Karachi Bar Association, the Sindh High Court Bar Association and other global bodies — condemned the “arbitrary arrest and subsequent conviction” of Imaan and Hadi, calling for their immediate release and measures to ensure the conviction was set aside.







“Both lawyers have faced targeted reprisals, including harassment through judicial processes, for their human rights and legal work, as well as for their outspoken advocacy for accountability and the rule of law,” it said.
The statement noted that the couple were arrested while on their way for a hearing in the controversial social media posts case and police used “undue force and failed to produce either an arrest warrant or a first information report (FIR)”.
“The arrest occurred despite an order of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) dated January 21, 2026, granting them temporary relief from arrest, reinstating bail, and guaranteeing the right to a complete defence, including cross-examination,” the statement read.
It noted that after the IHC issued its order, the police invoked “dormant and backdated” FIRs against Imaan and Hadi. It also noted that the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) was “a law widely misused to suppress online expression in Pakistan” and raised concern about due process and the trial’s fairness.
“The sentencing abruptly concluded proceedings that had been marred by due process violations,” the statement said. “Although a transfer application pending before the IHC legally deprived the sessions court of jurisdiction, it nevertheless proceeded to pass judgment.”
It added that the couple was convicted after a one-minute court appearance, adding that Imaan had stated the couple would be boycotting the trial and also alleged “being subjected to torture and citing denial of food and water in detention”.
“They were refused the opportunity to complete cross-examination of prosecution witnesses and had no access to legal counsel while in custody, raising serious concerns about their fair trial rights and physical well-being,” it said.
The statement further said that Imaan and Hadi’s case was “emblematic of a broader trend of judicial persecution” to exhaust lawyers’ resources and obstruct them from carrying out their work.
“The couple have faced multiple parallel criminal proceedings under anti-terrorism and blasphemy laws, repeated cancellations of bail, and the continued threat of arrest, all compounded by persistent concerns regarding due process violations,” it said.
“Repeated summonses in cases on baseless allegations have severely disrupted their legal practice and violated their human rights, forcing them to appear before multiple courts across the country, reportedly with the intent of diverting their attention from defending vulnerable clients,” the statement added.
Moreover, it argued that Peca’s use in the case showed how “authorities are weaponising the justice system to punish dissent and target legitimate human rights work”.
The statement called on Pakistan to “respect and uphold its obligations under international law, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment”.
“Lawyers should be able to perform their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment, or improper interference, and should not be prosecuted for actions taken in accordance with their professional duties or for the legitimate exercise of freedom of expression.”
The signatories demanded Imaan and Hadi’s unconditional release and measures to set aside the conviction; their safety while in detention and a guarantee of food, water and medical care; an inquiry into the police’s use of force; an end to the misuse of Peca and the anti-terrorism act against lawyers and human rights defenders and the assuarance that they can carry out their work “without fear of reprisals, harassment, or undue interference”.
Separately, the United Nations Human Rights Office said that the conviction and sentencing of the couple “following fair trial concerns is deeply disturbing”.
“This case highlights the danger of this law being used to suppress dissent.  We urge the government to protect and uphold freedom of expression & the right to peaceful assembly in line with Pakistan’s international human rights obligations,” it said.

Afridi, who has been seeking a meeting with the incarcerated prime minister since he assumed office of the provincial chief executive in October last year, but to no avail.
He again reached Factory Naka — a police picket near the Adiala jail — today in yet another attempt to meet Imran, with Thursday and Tuesday being court-mandated dates for meeting with the former prime minister.
However, he, as well as Imran’s sisters and lawyers, have been barred from meeting him for the past several weeks — a restriction that has made sit-ins and protests near the prison a usual occurrence. On several occasions, police have also used force to disperse the protesters, who often camp at Factory Naka.
Speaking to the media on Thursday, Afridi announced his plans for an overnight stay and said “most of [PTI] parliamentarians have also reached the spot and some others will be arriving in some time”.
Standing alongside Raja, he added, “This is about our leader’s life. We will not let this get normalised. We will spend the entire night here. We are waiting for a meeting between Imran Khan sahib and his family and personal physician.”







He also said that if deliberate attempts were being made to worsen the situation for no reason, “we cannot do anything about this. All responsibility then lies with the government. Those who are not allowing the meeting will be responsible.”
The KP CM said if Imran’s sisters were allowed to meet him, the situation could be prevented from worsening.
CM Afridi’s visit comes after the PTI on Tuesday raised concerns about Imran’s health. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed earlier in the day that the PTI founder had undergone a medical procedure for an eye ailment at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on Saturday night.
Referring to Tarar’s statement, Afridi said he had “serious reservations” about the former premier’s health.







For his part, Raja said they had sent a list of names of those who were supposed to meet Imran to the prison administration as per the directions of the Islamabad High Court. “All those who have been mentioned in the list are present here,” he said.
Raja mentioned that they would not return without meeting the PTI founder today, calling the meeting Imran’s “human right”.
Referring to the former premier’s brief visit to Pims for a procedure, he said, “The PTI founder was taken to Pims secretly on Saturday night. It was certainly a situation where the party founder could not receive treatment in prison.”
“It was the prison administration’s responsibility to inform his family members so that they, along with his personal physician, were present.”
Rawalpindi police had made strict security arrangements ahead of Afridi’s expected arrival on Thursday, with personnel at the prison and in the adjoining areas on high alert.
Police pickets were established near the prison’s gate, at Shaigan Healthcare factory, and in Dahgal and Gorakhpur areas, while female cops were also deployed on pickets on Adiala Road.
Police checkpoints were also set up on the toll plazas of the M1 (Islamabad–Peshawar) and M2 (Lahore-Islamabad) motorways.
Other places where police personnel were deployed included Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh, GPO Chowk, Chungi No. 22, Khawaja Corporation Chowk, Gulshanabad Chowk, Thalian and Chakri Interchange.</p><small>2026-01-29 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29163156f5b023c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969731/pakistan-committed-to-working-with-eu-on-trade-initiatives-especially-through-gsp-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan committed to working with EU on trade initiatives, especially through GSP+: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said Pakistan was committed to working closely with the European Union (EU) on mutually beneficial trade enhancement initiatives, especially through the GSP+ status.
According to a handout by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), PM Shehbaz made these remarks while meeting the EU’s Ambassador to Pakistan Raimundas Karoblis, who called on him in Islamabad.
According to the EU, GSP+ status is a special incentive awarded to developing countries to “pursue sustainable development and good governance” in exchange for cutting import duties to zero on two-thirds of the tariff lines of its exports. Governments with this status need to implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, good governance and the environment.
According to the handout issued on Thursday, the premier welcomed the ambassador and reaffirmed “Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthen cooperation with the EU in all areas of mutual interest, particularly trade, investment, development, security, migration and climate change”.







“The prime minister emphasised upon the critical role of the GSP+ scheme in enhancing trade between Pakistan and the EU, and said the government of Pakistan is committed to working closely with the EU on mutually beneficial trade enhancement initiatives, especially through the GSP+,” it said.
He also expressed satisfaction at the seventh round of Pakistan-EU Strategic Dialogue held in Brussels in November last year, it added.
Meanwhile, the EU ambassador expressed gratitude and deep appreciation to the prime minister for the warm welcome he had received since his arrival in the country and assured him that he would continue to work steadfastly to strengthen Pakistan-EU relations across all spheres.







He also conveyed good wishes from the EU leadership to the prime minister, and said the EU would continue to engage closely with Pakistan on enhancing trade, under GSP+ as well as through trade promotion activities such as the first-ever EU-Pakistan Business Forum, which would be held in April.
The GSP+ status was granted to Pakistan by the EU in 2014, resulting in a 108 per cent increase in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs.
In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan.
According to the EU’s GSP Convention Compliance Database, Pakistan has ratified 27 international conventions, most recently ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1976) and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1987) in 2010.
Regarding the EU’s monitoring of Pakistan, the body prioritised 13 key areas, including enforced disappearances, torture prevention, and freedom of expression and belief and minority rights.
Last month, the EU had welcomed Pakistan’s progress towards implementing 27 international conventions under the GSP+ framework.</p><small>2026-01-29 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647944-pti-announces-sit-in-outside-adiala-jail-amid-concerning-reports-on-imrans-health' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi ends sit-in near Adiala jail, leaves for KP</strong></a><br><p>

The documents were signed by the government and a consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Limited at a ceremony in Islamabad, where several federal ministers were also present.
The Arif Habib-led consortium had won the auction for 75 per cent shares of PIA in December last year, making a winning bid of Rs135 billion.







After the documents were signed, PM Shehbaz said, “I want to congratulate the entire nation from the bottom of my heart on the completion of PIA’s privatisation, the process for which began a month ago.”
He commended Arif Habib and his team, terming them “committed business ambassadors of Pakistan”.
“Their performance in the industrial growth and progress of Pakistan is very prominent,” he added.
He said as Habib had also stated, speaking before him, the businessman’s first priority would be ensuring comfortable travel for passengers, their safety and respect.
The premier recalled that the airline had peaked in the 1960s, adding that he resolutely believed that Habib and his team would make PIA scale even greater heights.
Earlier, as the ceremony commenced, Adviser to the PM on Privatisation Muhammad Ali thanked the premier and the army chief for their “immense hard work” and “support” in the process of PIA’s privatisation.
“Had it not been for their guidance and engagement, we would not be here today. I have no qualms in saying that today we are here because of their efforts,” Ali said.
He said the signing marked “one of the most significant milestones undertaken by the current government”, adding that the transaction was completed in a very efficient and transparent manner. And the highest bidder won the auction for PIA after a competitive process, he said.
The PM’s adviser further stated that the airlines’ privatisation had turned out to be “the largest transaction in the history of privatisation in Pakistan”.
“Under this transaction, the investment by all consortium members will add up to Rs180bn, which is equivalent to around $650 million. From this amount, Rs125bn, which is equivalent to $450m, will be invested in PIA and Rs55bn, equivalent to $200m, will be paid to the government,” he detailed.
The growth capital invested in PIA would be used for fleet expansion, service improvement, private-sector management and to take the airline “back to its glory days”, he continued.
Ali said PIA’s privatisation had proved that “Pakistan means business”.
Moreover, he added, “it has also shown that our privatisation programme is aggressive, that the government has decided to sold its loss-making and commercial enterprises, and most importantly, that we have the capacity to structure complex transactions”.
And the transaction had also proved that Pakistan’s local entrepreneurs were not shying away from large ticket items and large investment, and that they would participate in Pakistan’s next growth story, Ali concluded.
After him, Habib addressed the ceremony and said, “We consider ourselves very lucky that we volunteered for this national cause.”
He said the entire investment under the transaction was “100pc equity”. Habib further said PIA’s privatisation was an endorsement of the business sentiment in Pakistan being “very positive”.
He further stated that the biggest beneficiaries of this transaction would be the people, who would avail the airlines’ improved services. He added that they had held a meeting with aircraft manufacturer Boeing and would hold another one with Airbus.
“We are exploring more options as well,” he said, adding that his consortium would get PIA’s control in three months and until then, the consortium’s team was working very hard.
“I assure the prime minister that we will fulfil your expectations. Our consortium believes that we are doing this for our respect. We responded to the government’s call, and if we accomplish this task, it will show that even businessmen are soldiers. So my request is to keep guiding us,” he said.
He also announced that the consortium had decided to exercise the option of acquiring the remaining 25pc shares of the airline as well. “So the government will get Rs55bn.”</p><small>2026-01-29 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/292107173e59be6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969723/saims-all-round-show-takes-pakistan-past-australia-in-first-t20' target='_blank'><strong>Saim’s all-round show takes Pakistan past Australia in first T20</strong></a><br><p>Saim Ayub gave an outstanding all-round performance, taking two wickets after a blistering 40-run knock as Pakistan defeated Australia by 22 runs in the first Twenty20 International at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Thursday.
This is Pakistan’s first T20I victory against Australia in more than seven years.
Winning the toss and batting first, Pakistan scored 168 runs at the loss of eight wickets in the allotted overs.
Despite Sahibzada Farhan’s duck in the first over, Saim and skipper Salman Ali Agha managed to anchor Pakistan’s innings with a 74-run partnership.
Returning to Pakistan’s T20 side after a troubled Big Bash League season, Babar Azam could score only 24 runs before losing his wicket to Adam Zampa.
For Australia, spinner Adam Zampa grabbed four wickets, including the crucial ones of Babar, Saim, and Salman. Xavier Bartlett and Mahli Beardman also took a couple of wickets each for Australia.







While defending the target, Pakistan’s decision to include four spinners proved to be vital in dismantling the Australian batting lineup.
Saim took the wicket of fiery-looking Australian Travis Head, who scored 23 runs, with two sixes and two fours. He also took the wicket of Matthew Short in his first over of the innings.
Pakistan’s Abrar Ahmed also joined hands with Saim, taking two wickets, while other spinners, Mohammad Nawaz and Shadab Khan clinched a couple of wickets together.
Australia’s Cameron Green and Xavier Bartlett made 36 and 34 runs respectively. Two of their batters also flung their wickets with perplexing run-outs.
Pakistan restricted the Australian side to 146 runs with eight wickets in 20 overs.
Saim, who earned the Player of the Match award, said after his side’s victory that “conditions were a bit challenging, but our plan was to dominate with the new ball as much as possible”
During the batting powerplay, the goal was dominate sensibly by calculating the innings, watching the ball, and enjoying the process, he said.
On Pakistan’s bowling strategy, Saim said, “We knew that if we hit a good length consistently, it wouldn’t be easy for the batters to score. That was the strategy”.
Skipper Salman lauded his team’s “outstanding” bowling performance but also acknowledged batting challenges.
“It was a great game. We started well with the bat but couldn’t finish the way we wanted. It became challenging after the first 10 overs as the ball stopped coming onto the bat, but I think we were outstanding with the ball,” he said.
He said he would continue to bat at number three as they were expecting a “lot of spin”.
“And I believe I can dominate spin during the powerplay. That’s why I moved up, and that is where I’ll stay.”
The Pakistan captain said 170 was a good enough target given the favourable conditions for spin and Pakistan bowling capability.
“Given how we were placed after ten overs, we probably could have scored 15 more, but I knew 170 would be plenty on this pitch because our spin bowling is outstanding.
“Abrar has been outstanding since his debut. Since the Asia Cup, our spin bowling has been doing really well for us; they are winning us games day in and day out. Hopefully, they can continue this form through to the World Cup,” he said.
After Pakistan’s innings, Australian captain Travis said, “We felt like we dragged it back well after the first ten overs. As the ball got softer, it became harder to score, so we felt we were right in the game. We had moments where we could have opened it up, but the conditions made it difficult.”
He credited bowler Mahli for working his way back into his spell and finished really strongly and said Xavier, too, had very good game.
“Zampa did his thing as usual.”
The Australian skipper said there were definitely positives, but also things to work on.
On his side’s preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup, he said, “We’ll have to wait and see how it plays out. We have two more opportunities before we head to Sri Lanka, and we want to continue playing as well as we can. Even though the result didn’t go our way today, there are things we did well and areas we can improve.”
The Australian cricket team arrived in Lahore on Wednesday for a T20 tri-series, which was announced earlier this month.
All three matches are scheduled to take place at the Gaddafi Stadium on January 29, 31 and February 1.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore on Wednesday, Australian captain Mitchell Marsh had praised the Green Shirts and said his team was excited about the challenge of playing them on home soil in preparation for the T20 World Cup.
In his remarks, Agha had stressed the importance of the series, saying, “There are some boxes that need to be ticked — this is one of those series where we will tick all boxes”.
The two teams played a three-match Test and an ODI series in March-April 2022, followed by a solitary T20I where they bagged a close three-wicket win at Gaddafi Stadium. Australia also played three of their 2025 Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan.

Speaking to Geo News, Tarar said the former premier, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
“Eye experts examined him in Adiala jail, after which they recommended that it was necessary to take him to Pims for a small medical process. Last Saturday night, he was taken to Pims on the recommendation of these eye doctors and experts,” Tarar said.
He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. The ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
“During the medical procedure, his vitals and everything were stable. He’s absolutely healthy,” Tarar stated.

 


The minister asserted that “all prisoners” have access to doctors and medical treatments when such an issue arises. “This is in accordance with the [jail] rules, and he is absolutely healthy,” he added.
Asked about the concerns raised regarding Imran’s health, Tarar reiterated that the PTI founder was “absolutely fine”.
The minister stressed that it was the medical experts’ opinion to take Imran to Pims for a medical procedure. “He is absolutely fine, and he was also perfectly fine when this medical procedure was being performed.”
On Tuesday, the PTI said it had learned through credible reports that Imran had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye, “resulting in a dangerous blockage in the retinal vein”.
Citing medical experts, the party had said that if not treated promptly and properly, CRVO could cause permanent damage to his eyesight.
Also on Tuesday, PTI MNAs filed a fresh petition before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission to meet Imran.
According to a senior doctor at Pims, Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on Saturday night for the procedure, which took quite some time.
“Whatever procedure was going on, it was completed when the time reached in the A.M. So we can say that he was taken back on Sunday,” he claimed.
The doctor said there was “extraordinary movement” on Saturday night, and the operation theatres and the anaesthesia room were cordoned off ahead of Imran’s arrival at Pims.
PTI condemns Imran’s ‘secret transfer’
Responding to the minister’s statement, the PTI said it strongly condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed and refusing access to his personal physicians.







The party declared it an act of “clear malice, bad faith, and a grave unconstitutional and illegal move”.
It said that according to Tarar, the PTI founder had requested medical treatment.
“If this is indeed the case, then why was such a request concealed from his family, party leadership, and legal counsel? The PTI, therefore, demands that this alleged request be made public immediately and presented before his family and lawyers,” it said.
“Secretive actions, suppression of information, and restrictions on meetings are unacceptable under any circumstances. The PTI demands that meetings with Imran Khan be arranged without delay and that his personal physicians be granted full and unconditional access,” it added.
“The treatment being meted out to a former elected prime minister and the country’s most popular national leader is a blatant violation of the Constitution, the law, democratic norms, and fundamental human rights. The Punjab government and the jail administration are deliberately disregarding court orders and are pushing the country toward a dangerous and volatile crisis,” it said.
The party warned that if the federal government, the Punjab government and the Adiala jail authorities failed to immediately allow meeting with Imran and access to his personal doctors, then the “full responsibility for the consequences will lie squarely with them”.
“Public patience is being severely tested, and a public reaction against this unconstitutional, illegal, and inhumane conduct is becoming inevitable,” it said, adding that it would continue to protect Imran’s constitutional and human rights.
It also penned an open letter to human rights organisations about the violation of Imran’s rights, saying: “The deliberate secrecy surrounding a detainee’s medical condition and location constitutes bad faith, malice, and a clear violation of international custodial standards, including the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.”
It urged the rights organisations to take cognisance of Imran’s situation; demand unrestricted access for his family, lawyers, and personal physicians; call for an end to solitary confinement and custodial abuse; and rrge Pakistani authorities to ensure fair, transparent, and timely judicial proceedings.







Further, the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) termed Imran’s transfer to the hospital without the knowledge of his family and personal physicians a “criminal negligence”.
It demanded that the details of Imran’s condition be disclosed to his family immediately, and said any “delay or irresponsibility” in this regard “will not be tolerated”.
It said that not providing him access to his personal physicians was a “violation of court orders”. It added that the silence of state institutions on Imran’s health was “alarming”.
Former opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub said, “The fascist regime is denying medical treatment to PM Imran Khan in Adyala. This is against all norms of human rights. The judiciary is unable and unwilling to enforce its writ.”
He said that Imran’s personal physicians, family members and lawyers should be given immediate access to Imran.







Imran’s sister demands his medical reports be made public
Prior to Tarar’s confirmation, Imran’s sister Noreen Niazi had raised concerns about why the PTI founder’s family and lawyers were not being kept informed if the reports of his medical treatment were true. She also asked for his medical reports to be made public.
“I am a sister, and today my question is directed towards the corridors of power,” Niazi said on X this morning.
“According to multiple journalists and media sources, our brother, Imran Khan, was taken under the cover of the night to the Pims hospital on the pretext of eye treatment. He was kept there for three hours, and then transferred back to Adiala jail in an atmosphere of extreme mystery and terrifying silence,” she stated.
Contending that it was a “blatant crime” if the reports were true, Niazi asked: “Why does no one have the courage to tell the truth to Imran Khan’s family and lawyers? Who is this being hidden from, and on whose orders?
“What treatment is our brother being subjected to inside the jail, and why are our family and lawyers being kept in the dark?”







Niazi again demanded that Imran’s family, personal doctors and lawyers be allowed to meet him, adding that “make his complete medical reports public”.
“This is no longer a request, it is a final warning!” she stated.
Asserting that Imran was “not just another prisoner”, his sister alleged, “To endanger his health is nothing less than an attempt to blind the entire country.”
“Remember, if even the slightest harm comes to Imran Khan’s eye, this injustice will not be buried in silence. After that, no one else’s eyes will remain safe,” Niazi added.
Separately, Imran’s son Kasim Khan claimed that “authorities continue to block his treatment and deny him the doctors he trusts”.
“I am even denied the right to speak to him. This is not governance. This is authoritarian cruelty,” he said on X.
Claiming that his father had now spent over 900 days in a “death cell with no family visits and no access to his personal doctors, Kasim stressed that CRVO could “lead to permanent vision loss if not treated through urgent medical intervention in a proper hospital”.
The son called on human rights defenders to “act before it is too late”.
“The world must see that in Pakistan today, democracy is hollow and basic human rights are being crushed,” he added.

In his verdict, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka had noted: “Currently there are four countries designated as terrorist states, which are Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Korea, Iran and Syria.”
Asked about that judgment during his weekly press briefing in Islamabad on Thursday, FO spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said, “This judgment […] is the view of the learned judge. Pakistan, of course, does not subscribe to this opinion.
“And frankly, this kind of designation does not exist either under the United Nations (UN) or under international law,” he said.

 

Judge Majoka had made the observation while noting that Pakistan was “not included in the list of terrorist states”.
It is worth mentioning that the UN does not maintain a list of “terrorist states”.
The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has a “Consolidated List” of individuals, entities and other groups that it subjects to certain measures, such as sanctions, due to various reasons. While it may include certain government-affiliated departments, it does not name any country in its entirety.
Imaan and Hadi were sentenced on January 24 under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act’s (Peca) sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyberterrorism), and 26-A (false and fake information).
They were handed a total of 17 years in jail, with the longest sentence being 10 years, and fined Rs36 million each collectively.
In his judgment, Judge Majoka had remarked about the four countries while noting that the couple had “intentionally in their tweets mentioned the [sic] Pakistan as a terrorist state”.
Earlier on Thursday, the European Union’s (EU) Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Anouar El Anouni raised concerns over the conviction of Imaan and Hadi.
In a post on X, the EU official said their convictions “over social media activity goes against freedom of expression and independence of lawyers”.
“These are not only key democratic principles but also part of [Pakistan’s] international human rights commitments,” Anouni said.







Andrabi was asked to comment on Anouni’s remarks during the briefing, to which he said: “This is a domestic affair of Pakistan, the trial and conviction took place under our local laws through a judicial process.
“The relevant individuals have a right to appeal and have a right to a judicial recourse,” he said.
“As such, there is a domestic remedy available to these individuals. Whilst we remain engaged with the EU on all issues, we do make a distinction about our domestic affairs,” he said.
On Iran-US rift
The FO spokesperson was also asked about whether Pakistan was making any efforts to ease tensions between Iran and the US in view of a threat of war between the two.
In his response, Andrabi said Pakistan had always advocated for peace and diplomacy to settle all outstanding issues.
“Pakistan remains firmly opposed to interference in the internal affairs of our brotherly country, Iran. We have opposed the use of force; we have opposed the imposition of sanctions,” he added.
The FO spokesperson recalled that earlier this week, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had telephone conversations with his Iranian counterpart twice and Pakistan had also engaged with the US at the World Economic Forum.
“So, our advocacy for peace diplomacy continues and this remains our stated position. This region cannot afford war or turmoil because this, in essence, stops the economic development and prosperity. So, we hope that peace and diplomacy will prevail,” he said.
Board of Peace
Multiple questions were also asked about the Board of Peace, which is led by US President Donald Trump.
Trump announced the establishment of the Board of Peace on January 15 as part of his broader plan for Gaza, under which the ceasefire agreement was reached. The board was authorised by UN Security Council Resolution 2803 in November 2025.
The board was originally conceived to oversee the ceasefire and reconstruction of Gaza, but its charter expands its mandate to peace-building in all areas affected by or at risk of conflict.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was among the world leaders who signed the board’s charter on January 22 in Davos.
Andrabi was asked on Thursday whether the FO had “prohibited” the premier or the government from signing the charter “for the time being” when the premier was leaving for Davos.
The FO spokesperson dismissed the reports, saying: “This news is incorrect.”
Responding to other questions on the matter, he said: “Pakistan has joined the Board of Peace in good faith. Our basic objective in joining the Board of Peace is threefold.
“One, to consolidate and sustain the ceasefire in Gaza; second, to support reconstruction; and thirdly, to advance a just and lasting peace based on the Palestinian right to self-determination.”
The FO spokesperson also pointed out that seven other Muslim countries had joined the board as well.
“As such, Pakistan joining the Board of Peace should be seen in the continuum of the initiative by these eight Arab Islamic countries to promote peace in Gaza, leading towards a lasting solution to the Palestinian question — and this initiative dates back to September and August last year.
“All eight countries have joined the Board of Peace with a single collective voice. The Board of Peace offers a viable glimmer of hope for Gaza and for the wider Palestinian question,” he asserted.
Andrabi further stated that for over two years, the people of Gaza had witnessed unprecedented suffering, death and destruction.
“The UN Security Council remained deadlocked on this issue. The International Court of Justice issued three advisory opinions, and the General Assembly adopted a number of resolutions, all of which failed to prevent the Israeli onslaught.
“So, in this backdrop, the Board of Peace is a glimmer of hope for Palestine,” he said.
Andrabi also clarified that it was a misconception that joining the board was in any way “connected to any Abraham accord or any sidetrack to this issue”.
“Pakistan’s positions remain unchanged, and we will not become a party to the Abraham Accord,” he said. He said the board “does not replace the United Nations”.
“It has been established with a specific mandate authorised by the UN Security Council resolution 2803. We understand that the Board of Peace is intended to complement and not undermine the UN system,” he said, adding that Pakistan had not decided to join the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) and the membership of the Board of Peace did not imply contributing to troops to ISF.
As for the decision to join the board itself, he said, the foreign ministry and all stakeholders held joint consultations.
“This was a collective decision taken with all procedural formalities completed in terms of the ‘Rules of Business’ of the federal government.”
Andrabi further stated: “We hope that the framework established by the Board of Peace will lead to concrete steps towards permanent ceasefire, expanded humanitarian assistance, the reconstruction of Gaza and will advance Palestinians people’s right to self-determination through a credible, time bound political process in line with international legitimacy and the relevant UN resolutions, culminating in an independent, sovereign, contiguous state of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.”
He said Pakistan looked forward to continuing to play a constructive role as part of the Board of Peace in achieving these goals and in ending the suffering of Palestinian brothers and sisters.
The FO spokesperson explained that representation at the Board of Peace depended on “at what level the meeting is taking place. I mean, there could be a summit level, or a ministerial level. So, on this issue, we will know, as we advance in this process”.
“As for the status of the membership, there is basically a three-year membership. And after three years, there is a certain payment. There is no permanent and non-permanent category, as such, linked to the financial contribution,” he added.
Andrabi was also asked about the steps taken for the removal of Pakistan from a list of countries facing recently imposed restrictions by the US on immigrant visas.
In his response, the FO spokesperson said, “This matter has been under discussion in Islamabad as well as in Washington through our diplomatic channels. This is an ongoing review. Our understanding is that eventually Pakistan will be excluded from this list.
“Our talks with the US, our diplomatic exchanges with the US are geared towards this objective.”</p><small>2026-01-29 15:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29171757b414bac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969735/sindh-govt-announces-judicial-inquiry-into-deadly-gul-plaza-blaze' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt announces judicial inquiry into deadly Gul Plaza blaze</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon on Thursday announced that a judicial inquiry will be conducted into the Gul Plaza fire.
“To further probe this and to promote departmental transparency, the sub-committee decided … a letter is being penned to the honourable Sindh High Court (SHC) chief justice,” Memon told a press conference in Karachi.
He added that the SHC top judge will be requested to appoint a serving judge to “review everything and decide on it”.
A cabinet sub-committee — chaired by Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and including ministers Memon, Nasir Hussain Shah, Saeed Ghani, and Ziaul Hassan Lanjar — reviewed a report submitted by a two-member team.
“The meeting with the chief minister went on for four to five hours and important decisions were made in light of the commissioner and additional IG’s report,” Memon noted.



The senior minister then listed the decisions taken by the sub-committee.
He observed that the Civil Defence department conducted fire safety audits of Gul Plaza and other buildings since 2023, but “no effective, corrective, precautionary or legal action was enforced to prevent such incidents of such nature”.
Memon said the Civil Defence director and its South district additional controller “did not bring the matter up to authorities nor took any appropriate action against violators”.
The minister highlighted that Gul Plaza’s management had received notices twice after fire safety audits, informing them they did not have adequate safety arrangements in place in case of an emergency.
Hence, both Civil Defence officials were suspended immediately as they were unable to implement either of the letters.

 

“Departmental action has been initiated against them under the relevant regulations,” he said, adding that action would also be taken if negligence on the part of any other official was proven.
“If it is revealed that a higher officer was asked to take action but they did not do so, they will be suspended as well,” the minister asserted.
‘Delay in supplying water to fire tenders’
The cabinet sub-committee also noted that there was a “delay in the supply of water to the fire tenders”, affecting the operations of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) fire brigade and Rescue 1122.
Therefore, Memon said, it was decided to suspend the chief engineer (bulk) and the hydrants’ incharge of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC).
“Departmental action will be initiated against them,” he said, adding that action would also be taken if “negligence or failure of any senior officer or authority” is found.
“KMC Municipal Commissioner Afzal Zaidi was removed from his post on the first day [of the incident],” the minister revealed.
“The sub-committee found that KMC Fire Brigade and Rescue 1122’s equipment, training and capabilities to deal with an incident of this nature were insufficient.”
However, Memon emphasised, KMC firefighters acted with courage despite severe equipment shortages and difficulties, noting that firefighter Furqan Shaukat lost his life in the operation.
The minister further announced that the KMC municipal service senior director will also be immediately suspended and departmental action will be taken against him for “failing to ensure the preparation of firefighting staff”.
Providing details of January 17, when the blaze erupted, Memon said there were between 2,000 and 2,500 people present in the building, including workers and visitors.
“As the fire broke out, many people escaped. Government employees managed to rescue them. Eighty people fell victim and were affected,” the minister added.
Sharjeel further said that the relevant departments must immediately conduct a needs assessment, so that provincial and municipal institutions can improve and strengthen their firefighting capabilities. He said that the assessment would focus on equipment, training, manpower and infrastructure.
“A deadline will be established for this process to prevent similar incidents in future,” the minister said, adding that CM Murad had several meetings about consolidating the city’s rescue institutions.
“The chief minister has had two or four meetings and said that rescue institutions — Rescue 1122, KMC Fire Brigade, civil defence — must be brought together,” Sharjeel explained.
“He (CM Murad) is bringing them under one roof, so that they can get state-of-the-art equipment and improved training and are ready to respond to future incidents with no shortage of resources,” he said.
‘No adequate firefighting systems’
According to the minister, the sub-committee found that Gul Plaza’s building management did not have adequate firefighting systems in place.
“This was highlighted in writing, but not implemented, so two civil defence officers were suspended,” he stated. “The building managers had a responsibility to make these arrangements after being informed and audited.
“The constructed building violated the approved building plan, which limited firefighting options and endangered public safety,” he added.
Sharjeel noted that since the management at Gul Plaza did not take measures, their role and conduct at the time of the incident will be scrutinised, amid the police investigation.
“If negligence or violations of the law are found, then legal action will be taken against those responsible,” he warned.
Sharjeel added that the sub-committee also found “serious discrepancies” in the lease and approval granted by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) and KMC in 1979, 1983, 1986, 1991, 1998, 2003 and 2015.
“Anti-corruption has been instructed to assess these discrepancies in minute detail and take legal action,” he stated.
‘Government accepted its mistakes’
After reading through the sub-committee’s report and listing the important decisions made, Sharjeel noted that the government is not above accountability and highlighted its own errors.
“Wherever there were assessments, they were carried out by the government,” he said, adding that the mistakes of other institutions were also highlighted in the report.
“We also highlighted the responsibility of building management; it is being claimed that they were never warned, but letters were written to them explaining what needed to be done,” the minister stated. “If something like this happens, there need to be arrangements in place, but they weren’t made by building management.”
The minister said that there was also detailed information available with the SBCA about the original number of shops at Gul Plaza and those added over time, as well as “the size of the staircase, which people would use to escape in the event of a fire or emergency”.
He stated that the government highlighted these issues and determined those responsible, reiterating that the SHC was approached for a judicial inquiry.
Fielding questions, Sharjeel expressed his displeasure that political parties were politicising the issue, not mentioning them by name.
“From day one, we said we would not take pressure from any political parties,” he said, adding that compensation cheques had been delivered to those affected by the blaze.
“When the cabinet made this decision, we said that we would examine all angles and bring them forward in a transparent manner,” Sharjeel added. “We have acknowledged our own mistakes in the report, as well as the illegal ways in which previous administrations blindly handed out leases and on what basis.”
He added that the anti-graft body would conduct an inquiry and summon the relevant people and interrogate them, to ensure transparency and “prevent finger-pointing”.
“We are answerable to the public, not a political party,” Sharjeel stated.
In response to a question about whether the incident was an accident or arson, the minister noted that the fire started in a flower shop.
Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Azad Khan then explained the circumstances of the fire, saying that a shopkeeper had left his 11-year-old child at a shop.
“A 13-year-old child was also there. While they were playing, they took matches and lit them, which caused the fire,” he said. “People witnessed this and the children admitted to it.
“We ruled out any causes other than an accident in our committee’s findings,” he added. “We did not identify any other factors.”
Replying to another question, Sharjeel reiterated that the Sindh government was not under any pressure and that it is “doing its job”.
“This is not the first time this has happened. There have been 1,100 such incidents in one year, and our fire brigade has responded to them well,” he explained.
“This is a major incident and we are not being dictated to, nor will we be. This is about 80 valuable lives, and we want to make it as transparent as possible.”
When asked about the BRT Green Line project obstructing firefighting efforts, Sharjeel replied that the question “would be answered by the judicial inquiry”.
He noted that at the time of the incident, the government responded immediately and machinery, fire tenders, water bowsers and officials and police rushed to the scene.
“Wherever we were lacking, we will take responsibility for it,” he said.
“Look at what happens in Pakistan: whenever something like this happens, we play the blame game. Let the judicial commission’s report come out, then if any institution is at fault, they will come forward,” Sharjeel maintained. “Let the court decide.”
The minister added that this was “a serious matter that needs to be taken seriously” and reiterated that it would not be politicised.
“We’re not blaming anyone else, we have outlined the causes and there is strong evidence. If you want the evidence, it will be shared, but it should be gathered in court for the judicial commission,” he added.
AIG Khan responded to a question and said that a first information report had been filed “after a delay”, but noted that it would determine individual responsibility and damages, and whether there was negligence and if fire safety measures were in place.
“When discussing how many fire tenders and cylinders, we were given a number. There were only cylinders deployed, as there was no other equipment to effectively respond,” AIG Khan explained.
“There also needs to be fire exits and whether people can be guided, or if there are signs. There are no emergency exits and the existing exits are very narrow,” he added.
“You saw that the fire started on the ground floor, but people died mostly on the mezzanine floor. There were very few exits and people there could not react. All of these things will be investigated.”
Asked if the government had taken the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) on board, Sharjeel replied in the negative, adding that the judicial commission would not be constituted upon their request.</p><small>2026-01-29 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647892-pm-renews-commitment-to-working-with-eu-on-trade-initiatives-including-gsp' target='_blank'><strong>PM renews commitment to working with EU on trade initiatives, including GSP+</strong></a><br><p>

Such a shift would pull India in line with a growing global trend, after Australia became the first nation last year to ban social media for children younger than 16.
On Monday, France’s National Assembly backed legislation to ban children under 15 from social media and Britain, Denmark and Greece are studying the issue.

 

The adviser, V. Anantha Nageswaran, recommended in India’s annual economic survey that families promote screen-time limits, device-free hours and shared offline activities.
“Policies on age-based access limits may be considered, as younger users are more vulnerable to compulsive use and harmful content,” he wrote in the survey, which was published on Thursday.
“Platforms should be made responsible for enforcing age verification and age-appropriate defaults.”
The recommendations are not binding, but are reflected in policy discussions in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.
Past recommendations have prompted tax reforms, easing rules on Chinese investment and stronger digital infrastructure.
India, the world’s No. 2 smartphone market with 750 million devices and a billion internet users, is a key growth market for social media apps, and does not set a minimum age for access.
Research firm DataReportal says YouTube has 500m users in India, Facebook 403m, while Instagram has 481m.
Facebook operator Meta, YouTube-parent Alphabet and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Meta has previously said it backs laws for parental oversight while adding: “Governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites.”
New Delhi has repeatedly clashed with social media companies like Meta and X over the years over content moderation, local data storage, user safety and not complying with content takedown orders promptly.

 

In a press briefing, Nageswaran on Thursday called the platforms “predatory” in their approach to maximise user engagement and time spent by users, adding that “such algorithms are particularly targeted at youngsters between the ages of 15 and 24”.
Cheap telecom data plans have boosted use of social media apps in recent years, with 75 per cent of young smartphone users on the apps, the survey report said.
“Digital addiction negatively affects academic performance and workplace productivity due to distractions, ‘sleep debt’, and reduced focus,” Nageswaran added.
Children slipping into relentless usage
The recommendation follows growing efforts among Indian states to rein in screen time for young people.
The coastal state of Goa and the southern state of Andhra Pradesh have said they are studying Australia’s regulatory framework, with an eye to similar bans for children.
“Trust in social media is breaking down,” Nara Lokesh, the infotech minister in Andhra Pradesh, wrote on X on Thursday, saying the state would study legal frameworks for age-appropriate access.







“Children are slipping into relentless usage, affecting their attention spans and education.” Nageswaran said “we are very happy” the two states are considering restrictions for children.
