The development came a day after Barrister Salman Safdar submitted a report in the Supreme Court, which stated that the former premier had only 15 per cent vision in his right eye due to a delay in imparting treatment.
The resolution, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was moved by PTI Senator Aon Abbas Buppi. It demanded that the ex-premier be moved to a “premier, high‑standard hospital for comprehensive medical examination and treatment”.
It also demanded that Imran’s personal physicians and private medical team be granted immediate and regular access to evaluate his health and oversee his clinical care.
It also sought to ensure Imran’s family had consistent access to him and was kept fully informed of his medical status and treatment progress.
However, the resolution was rejected through a voice vote. The opposition demanded a vote count but that request was also rejected by the presiding officer, Shahadat Awan.
Subsequently, opposition lawmakers gathered in front of the chairman’s podium in protest and chanted slogans against the government for what they called the inhumane treatment of a high-profile prisoner.
During the session, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah claimed that the PTI founding chairman complained for the first time about an eye issue in the first week of January, contrary to the claim of PTI that their founder had been complaining about this for the past four months.
He emphasised that medical treatment was provided promptly, without any delay. He further noted that the treatment administered was properly documented. Sanaullah advised PTI not to do politics on the health of its founding chairman.
“Jail doctors examine the PTI founding chairman every second day as part of routine medical care,” he asserted. He said separate medical boards had reviewed his health condition 25 times.
Sanaullah said there was no reference to his eye ailment in the medical board held on December 9, 2025.
He further said that the counsels met the PTI founding chairman on December 20 on the occasion of the Toshakhana-II Case verdict and at that time, he did not refer to the eye ailment. He pointed out that PTI lawyer Safdar was also present on the occasion.
“If the PTI has any suggestions regarding the medical care of its founding chairman, it should approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan,” the PML-N leader said, assuring that any directions issued by the apex court would be fully implemented.
Sanaullah said the report submitted to the Supreme Court clearly established that the PTI founding chairman himself was satisfied with the living conditions in the prison.
Senate opposition leader, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, noted that the PTI founder’s health issue should be viewed on humanitarian grounds.
“Let’s go together and meet him. We will go see him and report back to the Senate. Let people meet him, things will normalise,” he remarked.
Abbas called for burying dirty politics and said new traditions should be set. He insisted that criminal negligence had been committed while treating Imran.
He asserted that the doctor who examined the PTI founder was not a retina specialist.
However, PTI Senator Ali Zafar, who is also the party’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, said, “Enough is enough.”
He said that at first, illegal and false cases were instituted against Imran, lamenting that the situation had now escalated beyond legal proceedings to deliberately endangering the PTI founder’s physical health.
Citing the report submitted by Safdar in the court on Thursday, he said Imran had first complained about an eye problem three months ago.
Despite repeated complaints and the worsening of his condition, the prison superintendent failed to ensure proper medical treatment and merely provided ordinary over-the-counter eye drops, Zafar said.
“Even when his condition deteriorated significantly and he reportedly lost vision in one eye, he was quietly taken to a hospital and brought back without transparency or proper disclosure,” he said.
Zafar stated that such conduct amounted to gross negligence and a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
He referred specifically to Article 9 (the right to life and liberty), Article 14 (the inviolability of the dignity of man) and Article 25 (equality before the law and equal protection of the law).
He emphasised that the right to life included the right to proper medical care, particularly when a person was in state custody.
“When the state detains an individual, it assumes full constitutional responsibility for his life, safety, and health. Any failure in this regard is a direct breach of the Constitution,” he said.
He demanded that Imran be immediately transferred to a fully equipped hospital where qualified specialists, including his personal doctors, could examine and treat him properly.
He also demanded immediate and regular access to Imran for his family, and transparent and independent monitoring of his medical condition and care.
“This is not a political issue but a constitutional obligation. The protection of life and human dignity is a fundamental right, and the state must be held accountable for ensuring it,” he remarked.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl parliamentary leader Senator Kamran Murtaza said that the former prime minister’s eyesight was under threat. He endorsed the proposal that representatives from the opposition and government meet him.
Murtaza said that while injustices may have been committed in the past, they should not be committed now.
He said the options available included parole, bail, moving Imran to a hospital or declaring his house a sub-jail.
“Take the path that earns us respect in global democracies,” he said.
He said medical treatment was the constitutional right of every citizen, including the former prime minister under Article 9.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI’s Senator Dost Muhammad said he wanted to donate one of his eyes to the PTI founder. He also expressed serious concern over the health of the former premier.</p><small>2026-02-13 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13182929d7430b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972913/ttap-stages-sit-in-outside-parliament-house-amid-govt-reassurances-over-imrans-health' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP stages sit-in outside Parliament House amid govt reassurances over Imran’s health</strong></a><br><p>A day after revelations emerged about the vision loss of PTI founder Imran Khan, the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP) reached Parliament House on Friday to stage a sit-in.
On Thursday, the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that PTI founder Imran Khan’s right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the party. Subsequently, the TTAP announced the sit-in outside the Parliament House on Friday (today).
In a post on X, the opposition alliance said that “a sit-in has started outside the parliament house,” vowing that it will “continue until Imran is admitted to Al-Shifa Hospital“.
“No compromise will be made on Imran Khan’s health,” the TTAP said, adding that all PTI parliamentarians were set to join the sit-in.







Meanwhile, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said that PTI lawmakers reached the parliament “after overcoming all the obstacles in their way” ahead of the sit-in.
Qaiser said that he, along with the leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Shahram Khan Tarakai, and Shandana Gulzar, reached the assembly.
He added that the “group discussed the present situation and deliberated on the future course of action”.







He later shared a video of the sit-in outside Parliament House, saying that they were demanding the provision of medical facilities for Imran in the presence of his family and personal physician.
“Providing the best medical facilities is Imran Khan’s legal and constitutional right. No compromise will be made on Imran Khan’s health. If our demands are not met, we will announce our next course of action,” he said.







Earlier in the day, TTAP chief Achakzai vowed to continue a sit-in outside the parliament— announced in the wake of claims regarding Imran’s vision a day earlier — “until all demands are met”.
He made the demand in a video message posted on TTAP’s X account.







Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was also in Islamabad, but his Focal Person on Digital Media Yar Muhammad Khan Niazi alleged in a post on X in the evening that “Islamabad police forcibly stopped” the CM and other members of the provincial assembly from reaching the Parliament House.
Consequently, they staged a sit-in outside the KP House in the federal capital, he said.
It was also alleged in the post that police personnel “pushed and roughed up” the protesters.







The PTI also alleged in a post on X that Special Assistant to the KP CM on Information Shafi Jan “had his collar grabbed by a police officer.”







TTAP leader, Mustafa Nawaz Khokar, had earlier claimed that the government “has cordoned off all roads leading to Parliament” ahead of the sit-in.
Khokhar had also claimed that “gates of parliamentary lodges have been shut, trapping MNAs and Senators inside.”
He stressed that the measures were being taken to “stop opposition MPs from protesting and demanding medical access to Imran Khan.”
“This doesn’t reflect strength, rather weakness,” he added.







Imran will be taken wherever he prefers for medical treatment: Tariq Fazal Chaudhry
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry spoke to the media ahead of the sit-in. He was asked about the blockade during the media talk, at which he maintained that the opposition had a right to protest. He went on to claim that the “blockade was not from the government’s side.”
He held that the government has “repeatedly” assured the opposition that “no negligence will be tolerated regarding Imran’s health”.
“There is no need to deal with it politically; it is a medical issue,” he added.
Chaudhry, during his media talk, gave assurance that the PTI founder would be taken “wherever he prefers” for medical treatment amid claims regarding the incarcerated leader’s vision, stating that there would be “no negligence in the matter”.
Addressing the media outside Parliament, Chaudhry said: “Wherever he (Imran) wants to go for a check-up, he will be taken. If he wants to go to Al-Shifa Eye Trust, then he will be taken there. There will be no negligence in the matter.”
“If the CJP recommends a doctor, he will be taken there,” Chaudhry added.
He called on the opposition to refrain from politicising the issue. “This is a sensitive issue; politicising it and misrepresenting facts is completely unfair.”
He added that the incarcerated leader would “now be examined by eye doctors or super-specialists, and we will try to ensure he receives every possible treatment available”.
Addressing the claims of Imran’s deteriorating vision, the minister dismissed the reports and stated, “The issue did not surface when Imran’s sister met him on Dec 2 or on Dec 9 when he was examined by a medical board or on Dec 20 when the Toshakhana verdict was announced.”
“The complaint was not brought up anywhere before,” the minister said.
He further recalled that, “On January 16, it was recommended by a doctor that Imran be shifted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) for an eye checkup. It is also on record that he was not shifted at the request of PTI, but the jail authorities and the government”.
He said that following Imran’s procedure on Jan 24, a medical report was issued by the doctors, “and then there is a ‘report’ by the lawyer” — referring to PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar’s report submitted to the SC.
He added that a new medical report will be issued soon.
The minister said that the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Yahya Afridi, was “himself looking after the case”.
PTI asks SC to issue written orders
Separately, PTI, in a post on X, addressed the CJP, demanding “formal written directions” for the PTI founder’s health examination.
“CJP, we require formal written directions to ensure that Imran Khan is examined by specialists and treated under the supervision of his own doctors at Shifa International Hospital,” the party said.
It called on the CJP to “issue and release the written orders,” stressing that Imran needed “urgent eye treatment.”
“This is not politics, this is not about power. This is about Imran Khan’s life,” PTI added.







Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, in a post on X, also said that the family had not yet received a written order from the SC regarding the PTI founder’s eye inspection.
“It is 1pm on Friday the 13th, and we still have not received the written order from the Supreme Court of Pakistan. We require formal written directions to ensure that Imran Khan is examined by specialists and treated under the supervision of his own doctors at Shifa International Hospital,” Aleema said.
She said that despite the court’s deadline of February 16, the “directive cannot be implemented without a written order from the court.”
“Given the urgency and the risk to his eyesight, why has the CJP delayed issuing the written orders?” she added.







Awaam Pakistan to join TTAP’s sit-in
Separately, the leadership of Awaam Pakistan — Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Miftah Ismail — announced that it will participate in TTAP’s sit-in outside Parliament House.
“The peaceful protest is being staged in response to the alleged deprivation of vision in Imran Khan’s one eye, and the government’s refusal to allow access to his personal doctors and family.”







The TTAP further said the decision was made last night in a meeting also attended by Awaam Pakistan’s leadership.
“Denying any prisoner timely and appropriate medical care is immoral, inhumane and illegal,” the opposition alliance said, adding that Imran Khan was Pakistan’s former prime minister and the leader of the “country’s largest political party”.
“The Awaam Pakistan party will join TTAP’s sit-in outside Parliament immediately after Friday prayers today.”
“We firmly believe in the rule of law, the people’s constitutional rights, free and fair elections, and true democracy, and we will always stand with the people in their struggle for these principles,” the post said.
Dr Zafar Mirza, central spokesperson of Awaam Pakistan party, in a social media post on X, said, “Imran Khan’s eyesight is at risk without urgent medical treatment! Awaam Pakistan is part of the peaceful protest of Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan and will stay until he receives the medical care he legally deserves.”







Later, Ismail shared on X that Mirza had “rushed to Lahore to attend the Namaz-i-Janaza of our party’s founder and Punjab Convenor Syed Zaeem Hussain Qadri sb. But, he will attend the dharna tomorrow morning”.

“It’s not true,” he said in response to Dawn’s query about reports circulating on social media.
The 96- and 48-hour transit visas are sponsored by the UAE-based airlines — Emirates and Etihad Airways — and must be processed and approved before entering the UAE, according to the information available on the government’s website.
“If you are not eligible for a visa on arrival or a visa-free entry to the UAE, and intend to step out of the airport, then you need a pre-arranged transit visa,” the website says.
Several users shared screenshots on social media that stated: “As per the latest information from USE immigration transit visas (96 Hours and 48 Hours Visa) for PAKISTAN nationals has been temporarily suspended. Hence, kindly do not apply for this 96 Hours and 48 Hours visa category.”
Others, meanwhile, just mentioned the reported suspension of the transit visas on X, citing a “notice”.
Past visa issues
Pakistanis have faced difficulties obtaining UAE visas over the past year. In January 2025, Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig told the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”.
He said that the UAE had concerns about Pakistanis travelling on visit visas and resorting to begging. However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, said there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the UAE.
In April, UAE Ambassador Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al Zaabi said visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could avail a five-year visa.
However, in early July, reports of visa rejections prompted Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart. In a meeting that month, UAE Interior Minister Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens, according to an official account of the talks.
On November 27, 2025, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chau­dhry told a Senate functional committee that the UAE was not issuing visas to Pakistanis. He had also said Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”.
But that same day, UAE Amba­ssador to Pakistan Salem M. Salem Al-Bawab Al-Zaabi shared what was described as “major UAE visa facilitation refo­rms for Pakistanis” with Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb, according to a statement issued by the finance ministry.
The reforms discussed during their meeting in Islamabad included online visa processing, e-visas without passport stamping and faster system-to-system linkages, the finance ministry said.
Last month, Pakistan and the UAE agreed to pursue a formal agreement on “pre-immigration clearance” for Pakistani nationals travelling to the Gulf country, the interior ministry said.
Under the proposed arrangement, immigration formalities wo­u­ld be completed in Pakistan before departure, allowing passengers to avoid routine immigration processing on arrival in the UAE.</p><small>2026-02-13 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/131832225a9527c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972932/11-killed-in-oil-tanker-passenger-bus-collision-on-m9-motorway-in-karachis-gadap' target='_blank'><strong>11 killed in oil tanker, passenger bus collision on M9 Motorway in Karachi’s Gadap</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Eleven people were killed in a collision between an oil tanker and a passenger bus on the M9 motorway in Gadap, according to officials.
A statement by Malir police said that the accident took place within the limits of the Gadap city police station. According to the statement, the passenger bus was travelling in the wrong direction, which led to the collision.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed the number of casualties to Dawn. She said that nine bodies were brought to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and two others to Civil Hospital, Karachi.
A separate statement by Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Javed Alam Odho directed police to reach the scene immediately and oversee response efforts. IGP Odho directed that the accident site and surrounding areas be secured without delay.
“In view of the oil spillage and potential risks, instructions were issued to ensure all necessary safety and precautionary measures in coordination with relevant departments,” he said in the statement.
The Sindh police chief also directed authorities to keep the route clear for timely access of ambulances and rescue personnel, and to divert traffic to alternate routes to prevent congestion.
In a statement, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar expressed deep sorrow and grief over the accident. Lanjar directed authorities to ensure immediate and the best possible medical treatment for the injured.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed deep sorrow and grief over the accident, according to a statement by the President’s Secretariat.
“The president prayed for the forgiveness of those who lost their lives in the incident and extended heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families,” it said.
It further added that President Zardari also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured and directed the Sindh government to ensure the provision of immediate and best possible medical treatment to those wounded in the accident.</p><small>2026-02-13 14:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1318485752857f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972927/ramazan-2026-this-planner-helps-you-slow-down-and-stay-balanced' target='_blank'><strong>Ramazan 2026: This planner helps you slow down and stay balanced</strong></a><br><p>This planner blends weekly structure with daily mindful actions, helping you move through Ramazan with balance, intention, and calm. Each day offers practical guidance alongside a gentle spiritual nudge.

Week 1: Adjusting the rhythm
In a world where notifications never stop, and timelines dictate our moods, the first week of Ramazan is about consciously slowing down.

Social media may be filled with elaborate iftar spreads and productivity checklists, but this week reminds us that Ramazan is not a performance.

It is a personal reset. Step back from comparison, ease into the month gently, and focus on setting intentions rather than chasing perfection.
Day 1 – Set the pace
Plan sehri and iftar timings and aim for an early night. Begin the month with a sincere intention, reminding yourself why this month matters to you.
Day 2 – Stock and simplify
Buy fruits, dates, and vegetables that will sustain you through the week. Accept an invitation for iftar or share a meal, as Ramazan is also about connection.
Day 3 – Light iftar living
Prepare simple, homemade iftar items to avoid heaviness. Share food with someone fasting, even if it’s just a small portion.
Day 4 – Gentle movement
Take a short walk after iftar to aid digestion and clear your mind. Feed a stray animal or leave water outside. Remember, small acts of mercy matter.
Day 5 – Cut back carefully
Reduce tea and coffee to prevent dehydration. Be mindful of your words and actions, and keep every promise you make today.
Day 6 – Eat with awareness
Slow down at iftar and stop before feeling full. Show appreciation to someone serving you by giving a little extra or offering kind words.
Day 7 – Reflect and reset
Notice which foods suit your body best and adjust your meals accordingly. Spend time supporting or visiting children in need or an orphanage, if possible.

Week 2: Building Balance
By now, Ramazan has found its rhythm, but modern life continues to compete for attention. Online sales, Eid outfit launches, and social invitations begin to pick up pace. This week is about staying relevant and prepared without letting shopping or social obligations overshadow the spirit of the month. Plan mindfully, buy early if needed, but remember that balance is the goal.
Health focus: Add light exercise and focus on hydration between iftar and sleep.
Day 8 – Nourish better
Add a fresh salad to your iftar for balance. Forgive someone and feel the emotional weight lift.
Day 9 – Hydration check
Sip water regularly throughout the evening. Be conscious of your speech and guard your tongue from gossip or negativity.
Day 10 – Moderation day
Limit fried foods to one portion. Check in on an elderly relative or neighbour who may be feeling overlooked.
Day 11 – Home-cooked comfort
Plan one fully homemade iftar this week. Lend a hand in the kitchen and share the workload with family.
Day 12 – Quiet minutes
Spend ten calm minutes after taraweeh in reflection. Offer a couple of extra rak’ahs, focusing on presence rather than speed.
Day 13 – Rest intentionally
Sleep earlier to avoid burnout. Give charity quietly, without seeking recognition.
Day 14 – Simple sehri
Prepare a nourishing, uncomplicated sehri. Make du’a for someone who has hurt you. This is a powerful act of healing.

Week 3: Mindful Living
As the days move faster and Eid-related content fills screens and storefronts alike, this week invites conscious disengagement from constant stimulation. Endless scrolling, impulse buying, and comparison can quietly drain spiritual focus.

This is a good time to shop only with intention, reduce digital noise, and redirect attention inward as the most sacred nights approach.

The focus now shifts to awareness, kindness, and preparation for the last ten days.
Day 15 – Waste less
Be mindful of portions and avoid food waste at iftar. Appreciate every bite.
Day 16 – Digest and smile
Choose fruits after meals for digestion. Remember that a sincere smile is also an act of charity.
Day 17 – Ease the sugar
Reduce sugar in drinks and desserts. Share useful knowledge or advice kindly with someone who needs it.
Day 18 – Screen break
Step away from screens earlier at night. Practice listening patiently without interrupting others.
Day 19 – Gentle stretching
Do light stretching or walking before sehri. Offer water or snacks to workers you encounter.
Day 20 – Light iftar, clear mind
Keep iftar simple to improve focus during taraweeh. Reflect deeply on one Qur’anic verse.
Day 21 – Enter the last ten
Adjust your schedule for late-night prayers. Seek Laylatul Qadr on odd nights with sincerity.

Week 4: Reflection and continuity
The final days often arrive with a rush — last-minute shopping, tailoring deadlines, travel plans, and social expectations.
While preparation for Eid is necessary and joyful, this week is a reminder not to let consumption overpower contemplation.

Keep celebrations modest, hearts attentive, and intentions anchored in gratitude.

Day 22 – Plan rest
Schedule short rest periods during the day. Walk away from anger whenever it arises.
Day 23 – Simplify further
Keep meals minimal to conserve energy. Help someone financially if you are able.
Day 24 – Stillness
Spend extra time in quiet reflection or prayer. Make heartfelt du’a for those facing hardship.
Day 25 – Organised giving
Finalise zakat or charity distribution plans. Thank someone whose efforts often go unnoticed.
Day 26 – Digital detox
Limit social media after iftar. Try to avoid complaining throughout the day.
Day 27 – Rest for the night
Prioritise rest before long night prayers. Gently wake or remind someone for sehri or prayer.
Day 28 – Carry it forward
Reflect on habits you want to keep after Ramazan. Seek forgiveness from someone you may have hurt.
Day 29 – A modest Eid
Plan a simple, thoughtful Eid celebration. Pray for acceptance of all your efforts this month.
Day 30 – Beyond Ramadan
Reset your routine gently for life after Ramazan. Commit to carrying at least one Ramazan habit forward.

Palestine Action was proscribed in July, having increasingly taken “direct action” against Israel-linked defence companies in Britain, often blocking entrances or spraying red paint.
Britain argued the group’s actions amounted to terrorism, citing a 2024 raid on a factory of Israel’s largest defence firm Elbit Systems, in which prosecutors said activists caused around £1 million ($1.4 m) of damage and a police officer was hit with a sledgehammer.
Ban followed break-in at air base
Palestine Action was banned shortly after a June break-in at the Royal Air Force’s Brize Norton air base, in which activists damaged two planes, an action described by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as “disgraceful”.
Lawyers representing Huda Ammori, who co-founded Palestine Action in 2020, argued at a hearing last year that the move was an authoritarian restriction on the right to protest.
Judge Victoria Sharp said Palestine Action “promotes its political cause through criminality and the encouragement of criminality”.
The High Court nonetheless ruled the ban was a disproportionate interference with the right to freedom of expression, though the ban was not lifted ahead of a further hearing to decide whether it should remain pending an appeal.
Interior minister Shabana Mahmood said in a statement: “I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal.”
Government defeat follows ‘not guilty’ verdicts
The ban put Palestine Action on a par with Islamic State or al Qaeda and made it a criminal offence to be a member, carrying a maximum 14-year prison sentence.
More than 2,000 people have since been arrested for holding signs in support of the group though Friday’s ruling could lead to any criminal charges being dropped.
London’s Metropolitan Police said following the judgment that it would focus on gathering evidence where people expressed support for Palestine Action rather than making arrests.
Civil liberties groups, including Amnesty International, had called for the ban to be lifted and Irish novelist Sally Rooney said it could even lead to her books being withdrawn from sale due to her public support for Palestine Action.
The British government argued proscription only prevented support for Palestine Action and had not prevented people from protesting in favour of the Palestinian cause.
The High Court, however, said it could cause pro-Palestinian protesters to “exercise self-restraint in terms of what they say and what they do”.
The judgment was announced two weeks after six people charged over the 2024 raid on Elbit were all acquitted of aggravated burglary.

“DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as chairman of its Board of Directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as Group Chief Executive Officer,” the group said in a statement published by the Dubai media office.
The statement did not mention Sulayem.
Described by Jeffrey Epstein as one of his “most trusted friends”, Sulayem was group chairman and chief executive officer of DP World, one of the largest port operators on the globe.
He is cited more than 9,400 times in the documents recently released by the US Department of Justice, which revealed close ties between the two men.
They maintained regular correspondence from 2009 to 2018, exchanging messages on intimate matters, meetings, introductions and business opportunities.

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, “The newly commissioned, state-of-the-art Pakistan Navy ship Khaibar,  during its maiden voyage from Turkiye to Pakistan, visited Aksaz Naval Base, Turkiye, and participated in exercise Turgutreis-XIII and joint patrols with ships of the Turkish Navy.”
The statement said that during the stay at the naval base, the commanding officer of PNS Khaibar called on the Turkish Southern Sea Area commander.
“During the meeting, discussions focused on enhancing bilateral naval cooperation and fostering regional stability through collaborative efforts,” the statement said.
It added that later, the Southern Sea Area commander and the commander of the Aksaz Naval Base, along with other Turkish naval forces officers, visited PNS Khaibar.
After the port visit, the Pakistan Navy ship participated in the bilateral exercise Turgutreis-XIII with Turkish naval forces ship TCG Heybeliada and a SH-70 helicopter.
“The exercise featured a variety of sea evolutions to rehearse joint maritime operations and enhance interoperability. Upon culmination of the exercise, PNS Khaibar and TCG Heybeliada conducted a coordinated patrol in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea,” he said.
The statement said that the successful conduct of the bilateral exercise Turgutreis-XIII and the coordinated patrol stood as a “testament to the enduring strategic partnership and brotherly ties shared between Pakistan and Turkiye”.</p><small>2026-02-13 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13165013bed13e1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972925/short-term-inflation-decreases-059-per-cent' target='_blank'><strong>Short-term inflation decreases 0.59 per cent</strong></a><br><p>Short-term inflation in Pakistan, measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) for the week ending on February 12, decreased 0.59 per cent, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.

The Pakistan National Report 2025 was released by the GMMP’s Pakistan partner, Uks Research Centre. It was based on the monitoring of the news landscape on May 6 last year — a day “marked by severe military and political tensions along the Line of Control with India” — which shaped the news content and the visibility of women across different platforms.
“The data captures not just a single day’s news, but the outcome of decades of institutional and societal factors that shape women’s visibility in Pakistani media,” the report said, adding, “On a day that was dominated by overwhelming national security coverage, these findings show broader systemic trends.”
According to the report, the monitoring was based on nine print newspapers, six television channels, the state-owned Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation radio channel, and four news-based websites. Thirteen volunteers participated in the monitoring, including Uks staff and students from various universities.
It found that women constituted only 11 per cent of news subjects across traditional media (print, television and radio), reflecting “their marginalisation in the coverage of politics, economy, crime, and sports”.
Across these platforms, they appeared most frequently in arts, culture, and celebrity reporting (60pc) and science and health (28pc), but were nearly absent in the hard-news areas highlighted above, ranging from 0-10pc in each area as well as in Gender-Based Violence (GBV) coverage.
However, digital media platforms highlighted greater inclusivity, as women made up 26pc of subjects in internet news. They were also visible in politics (23pc), science and health (33pc), social and legal issues (33pc), and were “central” to all monitored GBV stories (100pc).
“These findings illustrate a consistent platform-based gap, with online news offering women a higher likelihood of visibility,” the report stated.
It further said that the role of women in news production remained “extremely limited”, with men dominating reporting roles across all media.
Notably, in print, bylines by women comprised 5pc of the total, while radio showed 100pc female reporting on the monitoring day — although the report warned against generalisation due to a small sample size.
The report added that of the 29pc of news reported or presented by women, 96pc of them served as anchors or presenters and only 4pc were field reporters.
“Women reporters were largely absent from producing stories about men as subjects. On the other hand, men reported almost all the stories that featured women subjects,” it added.
GBV coverage on the monitoring day was limited, with only a single story recorded in traditional media. Online outlets, however, addressed sexual harassment and technology-facilitated violence and often also talked about broader gender inequality and rights-based perspectives, it said.
Meanwhile, women’s visibility as central subjects was limited, with only 15pc of news stories featuring women as the main focus, according to the report. Women’s news subjects primarily represented government officials or politicians and were rarely in roles providing personal experience or as experts.
In addition, the report highlighted that women were identified by their family roles or status in 15pc of cases compared to only 2pc for men.
A greater percentage of men were reported as victims, while photographs “disproportionately showed men” over women, and direct quotes were overwhelmingly given by men, with only 10.5pc of quotes attributed to women.
“Overall, only 1pc of the news content challenged gender stereotypes, and only 1pc of stories highlighted issues of gender equality or inequality between women and men,” it said.
According to the report’s executive summary, the findings “confirm patterns that have continued to endure in Pakistani news”.
However, they also highlighted the potential of digital media platforms to “create professional opportunities for women in journalism and to frame issues through a gendered and rights-based lens”, which in turn would improve their visibility and representation in media.</p><small>2026-02-13 11:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/13150604a50758d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972917/first-day-of-ramazan-likely-to-fall-on-february-19-suparco' target='_blank'><strong>First day of Ramazan likely to fall on February 19: Suparco</strong></a><br><p>The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said on Friday that the first day of Ramazan is “likely to fall” on February 19, 2026.
The new moon is expected to be born on Feb 17, 2026, at 5:01pm, according to the statement by the space agency.
“At the time of sunset on Feb 18, 2026, the age of the new moon will be approximately 25 hours and 48 minutes. The time duration between sunset and moonset is expected to be 59 minutes along the coastal areas of the country,” added the Suparco statement.
“Consequently, the 1st of Ramazan may likely to fall on 19 Feb 2026.”
However, the agency said the final announcement regarding the beginning of the Islamic holy month will be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, “which is the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country”.
Earlier this week, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) stated that there is a “fair chance” of sighting the new moon of Ramazan on the evening of February 18.
“According to astronomical parameters, there is a ‘fair chance’ of sighting the new moon of Ramazan 1447 AH on the evening of February 18, 2026,” it said.
Furthermore, the weather is expected to be partly cloudy or fair in most parts of the country on Feb 18, it added.</p><small>2026-02-13 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650617-any-lapse-in-imran-khans-treatment-would-amount-to-criminal-negligence-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>Any lapse in Imran Khan's treatment will amount to criminal negligence: Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>

But final official results are yet to come and BNP’s main rival Jamaat-i-Islami — leading a wider coalition — said it had “serious questions about the integrity of the results process”.
The Jamuna television channel projected that the BNP had secured 212 seats.
It said Jamaat had won 74, a huge leap from its past results but far short of the outright win it had campaigned for. Somoy TV broadcast similar figures.

According to PMD’s National Seismic Monitoring Centre, the earthquake struck at 6:30am at a depth of 13 km, 86km northeast of Khuzdar.
It was preceded by another earthquake — magnitude 3.8 — that struck 75km southeast of Khuzdar at 5:52am at a depth of 33km.
Tremors were felt in several districts of Sindh as well, APP reported, including Sukkur, Qambar, Shahdadkot, and Dadu, while Jhal Magsi, Jaffarabad and Nasirabad in Balochistan reported tremors as well.

Latest counts in a vote seen as the South Asian nation’s first truly competitive election in years gave the BNP and its allies at least 212 of the 299 seats up for grabs, domestic TV channels said.

The opposition Jamaat-i-Islami and its allies won 70 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.
The Election Commission put the BNP at 181 seats, the Jamaat-i-Islami at 61 and others at 7, with full official results not expected before noon (11am PKT) on Friday.
The BNP, which returns to power after 20 years, thanked the people soon and called for special prayers on Friday for the nation and its people.
“Despite winning … by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said in a statement.
The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who played a key role in toppling Hasina and was a part of the Jamaat-led alliance, won just five of the 30 seats it contested.
A clear outcome had been seen as key for stability in the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million after months of deadly anti-Hasina unrest disrupted everyday life and industries such as garments, in the export of which Bangladesh is No.2 globally.
“A strong majority gives BNP the parliamentary strength to pass reforms efficiently and avoid legislative paralysis. That alone can create short-term political stability,” Selim Raihan, an economics professor at the University of Dhaka, told Reuters.
BNP leader Tarique Rahman is widely expected to be sworn in as prime minister. The son of the party’s founder, former president Ziaur Rahman, he returned in December to the capital, Dhaka, from 18 years abroad.



In its manifesto, the BNP promised to prioritise job creation, protect low-income and marginal households and ensure fair prices to farmers.
“If the factories run regularly and we get our wages on time, thats what matters to us. I just want the BNP government to bring back stability so more orders come to Bangladesh and we can survive,” Josna Begum, 28, a garment worker and mother of two, told Reuters after the results.

BNP supporters celebrate overnight
The Islamist Jamaat-i-Islami conceded defeat late on Thursday night once trends became clear, but said in a statement on Friday that it was “not satisfied” with the process and asked its followers to stay patient.
Now in exile in New Delhi, Hasina long dominated Bangladesh politics along with Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, while his father was a leading independence figure who ruled from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.
The BNP win with more than 200 seats is one of its biggest, surpassing its 2001 victory with 193, although Hasina’s Awami League, which ruled for 15 years and was barred from contesting this time, secured a bigger tally of 230 in 2008.
But elections of other years were boycotted by one of the main parties or were contentious.
Overnight, throngs of supporters cheered and shouted slogans at the BNP headquarters in Dhaka as the scale of the party’s landslide became clear.
Turnout exceeded the 42 per cent of the last election in 2024, with media nearly 60pc of registered voters participated in the election on Thursday.

More than 2,000 candidates, many independents among them, were on the ballot, which featured a record number of at least 50 parties. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.
Broadcaster Jamuna TV said more than 2 million voters chose “Yes”, while more than 850,000 said “No” in a referendum on constitutional reforms held alongside the election, but there was no official word on the outcome.
The changes include two-term limits for prime ministers and stronger judicial independence and women’s representation while providing for neutral interim governments during election periods, and setting up a second house of the 300-seat parliament.
President, PM felicitate BNP on election win
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday extended their felicitations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader, Tarique Rahman, on securing a landslide majority in the national elections and receiving the mandate to form the next government.
According to the Presidency, the president congratulated the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the polls across 299 seats with the participation of over 127 million registered voters.







Reaffirming Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh, the president said Pakistan looks forward to working with the new government to strengthen cooperation in trade, defence, cultural exchanges, and regional forums.
President Zardari said the elections in Bangladesh mark an opportunity for South Asia to move beyond past phases in which regional cooperation, including within SAARC, was held hostage by India, which continues to paralyse the great forum that was born in Bangladesh in 1985.
He expressed the hope that the new political environment in Dhaka would contribute to more balanced, independent, and mutually respectful engagement across the region.
The president conveyed his best wishes for the continued stability, progress, and prosperity of Bangladesh.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate message on X, said: “I extend my warmest felicitations to Mr. Tarique Rahman on leading the BNP to a resounding victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. I also congratulate the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the elections.”







The premier said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership further to strengthen our historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations and advance our shared goals of peace, stability, and development in South Asia and beyond.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also congratulated the BNP leader on his victory.
“I am confident that, under your able stewardship, Bangladesh will continue its journey towards peace, progress, and prosperity,” he said in a post on X, congratulating the people of Bangladesh on a successful democratic transition.







India’s Modi congratulates Bangladesh’s BNP
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulated the BNP led by Tarique Rahman on Friday on its “decisive victory” in elections.
“This victory shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership,” Modi said in a statement posted on social media, referring to Rahman.







“India will continue to stand in support of a democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh.”

Authors of the draft legislation from the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD) say it is needed to protect children from cyberbullying, harmful content and predatory individuals.
A public system known as Digital Mobile Key (DMK) will be used by parents to give consent, also helping to enforce the existing ban for children under the age of 13 to access digital social media, video- and image-sharing platforms, or online betting sites.

 

Tech providers are also required to implement an age verification system compatible with the DMK.
The bill, approved by 148–69 votes with 13 abstentions, can still be modified before the final vote.
France’s lower house last month backed legislation to ban children under 15 from social media amid growing concerns about online bullying and mental health risks.
Australia’s world-first ban for under-16s on social media platforms including Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube came into force in December.
The Portuguese bill says it will fill a regulatory gap that has allowed “multinational digital platforms to set rules unilaterally”, affecting children’s cognitive and emotional development, particularly with early or excessive exposure.
It says that over the past two decades, social media have assumed roles long held by families and schools without regulation.
“We have to protect our children…we don’t intend to prohibit for the sake of prohibiting, we intend to create a norm to give more power to parents and families, to accompany and control,” PSD lawmaker Paulo Marcelo said before the vote.
He said that tech companies ignoring the restrictions could face fines of up to 2 per cent of their global revenue.</p><small>2026-02-13 06:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/131048340edf126.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972900/policeman-kidnapped-in-bannu-house-set-on-fire' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman kidnapped in Bannu, house set on fire</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Militants allegedly kidnapped a CPEC policeman and set his house on fire in the Dogar Umarzai area in Bannu district, destroying three rooms and household belongings.
Local sources reported that around 40 to 50 armed militants entered the house, abducted the constable, and later set the house ablaze.
According to police sources, the kidnapped constable has been identified as Qadeer who was serving in the CPEC Police.
The incident caused panic and fear among the family members and residents of the area.
Authorities stated that investigations are underway from multiple angles.
Firing incident at journalist’s residence
In a separate incident, unidentified motorcyclists opened fire at the residence of the former president of Bannu Press Club and ARY News correspondent Ihsan Khattak late on Thursday night.
Fortunately, no casualties were reported.
Khattak stated that suspicious motorcyclists had previously been seen around his residence, after which he had submitted an application against unidentified individuals at Saddar Police Station.
He clarified that he has no personal enmity or dispute with anyone.
The journalist further revealed that in the past, he had received threatening phone calls from Afghan numbers in connection with his reporting duties.
Journalistic circles strongly condemned the incident and demanded an immediate and transparent investigation from the police to bring those involved to justice and ensure the safety of journalists.</p><small>2026-02-13 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650575-ex-army-chief-bajwa-stable-after-treatment-for-heart-block-related-fall' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-army chief Bajwa stable after treatment for heart block-related fall: source</strong></a><br><p>

All 15 council members voted in favor of the US-drafted resolution, renewing the Monitoring Team’s mandate until February 17, 2027. The extension comes amid mounting international concern over Afghanistan’s deteriorating security situation, the growing influence of multiple terrorist groups, and the potential for regional destabilisation.
Pakistan, which supported the resolution, stressed the ongoing threat posed by Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K), Majeed Brigade, and Al-Qaeda.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, said these groups “have been responsible for some of the most heinous terrorist attacks against Pakistan,” citing recent attacks that killed 80 people this month alone.







“Once again, Afghan soil was used by these groups to plan and orchestrate attacks against neighbouring countries,” he said, urging the Taliban to prevent the use of Afghan territory for terrorist operations.
“It is for the Taliban to decide what path they wish to choose for Afghanistan: whether the path to isolation or the path to peace and prosperity as a responsible member of the international community,“ he said.
The ambassador also highlighted the council’s concerns over the wider humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. “The resolution rightly emphasises the dire human rights conditions, particularly for women and girls, economic collapse, political exclusion, and the challenges posed by drug trafficking,” he said.
“Through this resolution, the council has sent a clear message that Afghan territory should not serve as a safe haven for terrorists and that all member states must prevent ransom payments or political concessions benefiting hostage-takers or terrorist groups.”
The UN Monitoring Team’s 37th report, released this week, paints a grim picture of Afghanistan as a base for multiple terrorist organisations. It noted that the de facto Afghan authorities continue to provide a “permissive environment” for groups, particularly TTP.







The report cited rising regional anxiety over cross-border attacks, the radicalisation of vulnerable communities, and the exploitation of commercial satellite communications and artificial intelligence by militant groups.
While Afghan authorities insist no terrorist groups are present in the country, the Monitoring Team stated that “no UN member state supported that assessment.”
Although the authorities have taken action against ISIL-K and control some external activities of other groups, TTP has enjoyed greater freedom, resulting in an escalation of attacks against Pakistan and heightened regional tensions.
On Al-Qaeda, the report said the group’s intent and capability for external operations remain unchanged. It continues to serve as a training and advisory hub, particularly for TTP, and “favors spectacular attacks aimed at attracting global media attention,” highlighting the continued threat beyond the immediate region.
Al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), not listed under UN sanctions, remains active in southeastern Afghanistan, especially in areas influenced by the Haqqani Network. The report indicated AQIS leaders Osama Mahmoud and deputy Yahya Ghauri are believed to be in Kabul, with the group’s media cell operating from Herat.
Member states warned that AQIS increasingly focuses on deniable external operations, possibly under cover groups such as Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan, likely to avoid causing difficulties for the Taliban.
TTP, one of the largest terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan, has intensified attacks on Pakistani security forces and state institutions. A November 11 attack on an Islamabad courthouse killed 12 people, marking the first such strike in the capital in several years. Despite operational setbacks, including the killing of deputy emir Mufti Muzahim in October, the group remains a serious threat.
The Monitoring Team warned that TTP could deepen cooperation with Al-Qaeda-aligned groups, potentially expanding the threat beyond the region.
ISIL-K, though under pressure from Taliban actions and regional security operations, retains significant combat capability, particularly in northern Afghanistan near Badakhshan and along the Pakistani border. The group continues to replenish its ranks through online recruitment and seeks alliances with other armed factions.
Other groups of concern include the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM/TIP), which reportedly enjoys Afghan patronage, including identity documents, and raises funds through poppy cultivation and mining. Approximately 250 ETIM/TIP members joined Taliban police forces in 2025, and some have called for fighters in Syria and neighboring countries to relocate to Afghanistan in preparation for operations in China’s Xinjiang region.
The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), which is not listed under UN sanctions, has carried out attacks against Pakistani security forces and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects, including a September 16 ambush that killed 32 soldiers. While Pakistani counter-terrorism operations have constrained the group’s activities, it remains operational, with some member states reporting coordination between BLA, TTP, and ISIL-K through shared training and resources.
The Monitoring Team’s findings are expected to shape further deliberations at the Security Council on Afghanistan’s security trajectory and the effectiveness of the existing sanctions regime.
Pakistan and other member states have emphasised that the resolution underscores the need for the Taliban to take “sustained and verifiable” action against terrorist groups, prevent Afghan territory from being used for external attacks, and uphold commitments to international peace and security.</p><small>2026-02-13 05:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/130911042137a88.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972786/railways-nlc-to-upgrade-ml-2-as-dedicated-freight-corridor' target='_blank'><strong>Railways, NLC to upgrade ML-2  as dedicated freight corridor</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Pakistan Railways (PR) and the National Logistics Corporation (NLC) have joined hands to upgrade the Main Line-2 (ML-2) as dedicated freight corridor, enabling the authorities to transport goods to several cities in the country within short time.
The dedicated freight corridor project will cost around $2 billion, according to Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi.
“We had an important meeting with the NLC authorities on Thursday wherein we both agreed to start working for developing a dedicated freight corridor at the ML-2 starting from Kotri and ending at Attock. For this, we agreed to appoint an international consultant to carry out feasibility and other preparatory works ahead of executing this vital project,” Mr Abbasi explained while talking to Dawn on Thursday.
“The project will cost around $2bn that will be arranged by NLC on its own by getting financed through banks or funding agencies,” he revealed.
It merits mentioning that the ML-2 is an important route measuring nearly 1,250 kilometers. There are over 90 operational railway stations from Kotri to Attock, including many in interior Sindh. The important stations situated on the route include Kotri, Sehwan Sharif, Dadu, Mohenjodaro, Larkana, Shah Nawaz Bhutto, Habibkot, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Kandkot, Kot Mithan, Rajanpur, Jampur, DG Khan, Shadan Lund, Bhakkar, Piplan, Mianwali, Jand and Attock City.

NLC to arrange $2bn through banks or funding agencies

The minister said the ML-2 [upgrade] project would have a new and a dedicated track for the goods/freight trains with various other modern facilities.
Talking about the launch of the phase-1 (Karachi-Rohri) of the ML-1 project, he said the PR is trying hard for the ground breaking of this mega scheme in July this year. “The phase-1 of ML-1 projects consists of 480km. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has already agreed to finance the ML-1’s phase-1. The financing arrangements for rest of the phases of ML-1 scheme are also being done in collaboration with other international funding institutions,” he maintained.
Mr Abbasi said the work on the rehabilitation/upgrade of the ML-3 project (Rohri-Taftan via Sibbi and Quetta) is expected to begin in April, this year. This route measuring over 1,000km is very important especially in terms of international freight operations (Pakistan to Turkiye via Iran).
Meanwhile, PR’s Chief Executive Officer Mr Amir Ali Baloch confirmed that various teams of the ADB had visited the ML-1’s phase-1 project sites (Karachi-Rohri) three times, advancing the pace of funding-related works. “The detailed discussions have already been held with the bank authorities. And now we are very hopeful of starting work in July this year,” he told Dawn when contacted.
He said the $6.7 billion ML-1 project would be executed in phases, starting from Karachi-Rohri section first.

The remains of the 16th century historical building were situated roughly 200 meters from the British-era obelisk, at an archaeological site in Rehara village.
A few days ago, the World War I memorial that stood here was razed by developers to make way for a private housing society.
According to the Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM), the structure was possibly built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar, and was the oldest historical ruin in this region.
A DOAM official told Dawn the building’s above-ground arch (façade) and the remaining structure (the 8x4.5 meters main chamber and its 1.5 meters thick walls), constructed with limestone and sandstone blocks, which required careful excavation, had been demolished.

Demolition comes days after British-era World War I monument was felled by developers in the same area

A departmental team that later visited the site found that the remnants of the historical structure, which are clearly visible in photographs taken earlier, had been entirely wiped out.
According to documents seen by Dawn, DOAM had written to the Capital Development Authority (CDA), which is the developing partner of the housing scheme, to provide records that would enable the department to protect the historical sites.
DOAM claimed it had been writing to CDA’s revenue department since 2020, seeking a record of the war memorial and a few other historical sites, including the Mughal-era Rehara structure.
“The CDA has not once responded to the numerous letters DOAM has written in the last six years,” an official from the Ministry of National Heritage and Culture told Dawn.
Dawn reached out to CDA spokesperson Shahid Kiyani. After initially seeking time to prepare a response, the spokesperson did not answer further queries or provide a comment.
Interestingly, a number of DOAM officials when approached for their comments remained tight-lipped on the issue. A senior official, however, requesting anonymity, said that a report of the destruction of the monuments had been sent to the Prime Minister’s Office a couple of days ago.
It is worth noting that DOAM has also taken a U-turn on the felling of the World War I monument, saying that it was not protected under the Antiquities Act 1975 and, therefore, a no-objection certificate (NOC) was not required for tearing it down.
Earlier, DOAM had claimed that it did not permit CDA to demolish the monuments.
The department said that although the monument was located within Islamabad Capital Territory, efforts were being made to bring it under formal protection. However, due to the non-availability of required finances and other legal prerequisites, the memorial could not be notified as a protected site.
“Nevertheless, the monument possesses cultural and historical significance. In line with internationally recognised best practices for commemorative and historical structures, DOAM was consulted and provided advisory guidance to let first protect the monument under the Antiquities Act 1975, but it was not done.
The department emphasised that any handling of the memorial should be undertaken with due care, dignity, and conservation sensitivity to preserve and safeguard its historical value,” DOAM had said in its statement earlier, adding, “It is better to re-erect the monument at the same place with grace and dignity as it was erected for the same village of Rehara”.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday urged the United States and Iran to move towards direct negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme.
“Whilst we stand ready to participate in any format of dialogue and diplomacy on Iran, we encourage the relevant parties to have as direct a negotiation framework as possible,” Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Andrabi said at the weekly media briefing.
The indirect Iran-US talks took place in Muscat on Feb 6 amid heightened regional tensions, including an expanded US military presence and warnings from President Donald Trump of severe consequences if no deal is reached.
The session was mediated by Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who shuttled between the two sides. Both sides described the discussions as a “good start”.
A follow-up visit by Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, took place in Muscat around Feb 9-10 to discuss next steps.
No date or venue has been for­mally announced for the next rou­nd of talks, though both sides have signalled their intention to continue discussions pending consultations in their respective capitals.
On Thursday, Mr Andrabi said Islamabad hoped the momentum generated in Muscat would continue. “We hope the positivity (in Oman talks) would be carried forward by the parties in the conduct of these talks,” he noted.
Diplomatic efforts
“Pakistan welcomes the talks in Oman between relevant parties. We support all initiatives of dialogue and diplomacy to settle
outstanding issues, including this question of nuclear talks,” Mr Andrabi said. He called the development “a positive progression towards a negotiated solution”. During the briefing, Mr Andrabi was asked specifically about Pakistan’s role in the Muscat process, but he did not directly address whether Islamabad had facilitated contacts or participated behind the scenes. However, he reiterated that Pakistan supports dialogue and would be ready to participate “in any format”, if requested.
Before Oman, talks between the US and Iran were originally slated to be held in Istanbul, where a host of regional players were also expected to take part. When Tehran asked for a change of venue and sought to limit the agenda of the talks, it also limited the scope for engagement by regional players, such as Turkiye, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
Diplomatic sources said that a top Pakistani official had visited Oman, and met with US envoy Steve Witkoff on the sidelines of the dialogue process, but there was no official confirmation in this regard.
Since June last year, Pakistan has acknowledged acting as a messenger between Tehran and Washington, something which was also confirmed by the Foreign Office.
Immediately after the Muscat talks, Iran’s ambassador in Islamabad had called on Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to brief him on Tehran’s position. Days later, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and Mr Dar spoke by phone.
According to Iranian accounts of the call, Mr Araghchi explained Tehran’s positions regarding what it described as a fair and just agreement and elaborated on the process of indirect negotiations in Muscat. Mr Dar wished success for the negotiations and emphasised Pakistan’s readiness to support diplomacy.
The spokesman also pointed to recent high-level contacts between Islamabad and Tehran. “Our deputy prime minister and foreign minister spoke twice with his Iranian counterpart. We are maintaining close contact at the leadership level,” he said, adding that the prime minister had a conversation with the Iranian president in the recent past. “Our support for dialogue and diplomacy continues,” he added.
‘Board of Peace’ meeting
Mr Andrabi also confirmed that PM Shehbaz Sharif will attend the inaugural meeting of President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ next week, saying Pakistan would use the platform to push for a just and lasting solution to the Palestine issue.
The leaders-level meeting of the Board of Peace is scheduled for Feb 19 in Washington. It will mark the first formal gathering of the multinational body since its charter was signed during a ceremony at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Jan 22.
“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister,” Mr Andrabi told the weekly media briefing.
“As regards the other members of the delegation and on engagements of the delegation in the US, we will inform you in due course of time,” he said when asked to comment on reports that Field Marshal Munir would also join the prime minister at the session.
US officials and media reports suggest the Feb 19 summit will focus on fundraising for Gaza’s reconstruction, implementation of ceasefire phases including transitional governance and security arrangements, and clarification of the board’s broader mandate and structure.
“We have joined the Board of Peace in good faith. We are in it, not in isolation, not as one voice, but as a collective voice of eight Islamic-Arab countries,” Mr Andrabi said, referring to two statements that were issued by these countries, not just on Gaza, but also on the West Bank.
“Our collective voice is resonating in the Board of Peace, and we will continue to strive for the rights, peace and prosperity of the people of Palestine, aimed at the long-term solution of the Palestine issue — to create a state of Palestine, in accordance with the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.”
“So, our engagement is for short-, medium- and long-term solution of the plight of the Palestinian people,” he maintained.

ISLAMABAD: The PTI raised alarm over the treatment meted out to former prime minister Imran Khan in jail in light of a health report submitted to the Supreme Court, with its leaders calling out the “medical neglect” that worsened the situation.
On the other hand, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar used the report to point out that the PTI chief had been enjoying all facilities in jail, as evident from his diet plan outlined in the document submitted to the apex court.
PTI lawyer Salman Safdar had submitted the report, which claimed that Mr Khan had lost 85 per cent of the vision in his right eye, after meeting Mr Khan in jail on the directions of the SC.
Amid these reports about their leader’s health, PTI leaders, including Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, held a press conference at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, terming the situation alarming.
The CM said Imran Khan had informed au­­thorities a number of times about the problem with his vision, but no one bothered ab­­out it. “When his eyesight was lost, he was ta­­ken to the hospital. It was nothing but a criminal act because, had they allowed the meeting with the family and lawyers, the hea­lth issue would have been highlighted,” he said.
The CM said Mr Khan had never demanded relief on the basis of health, but “now we are saying this because there is a possibility of irreversible loss”.
He said that when the health of Nawaz Sharif was discussed during his imprisonment, the judiciary and media had raised their voices for him.
“At that time, Imran Khan had allowed him [Nawaz Sharif] to go for treatment. At this time, we are unable to hear similar voices from the judiciary and the media. One media outlet had raised the health issue (of Mr Khan), due to which a federal minister had to confirm it,” he said.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that he had never seen such a thing in the history of Pakistan.
“…When eyesight was lost, the administrator of the jail was changed, and the new administrator also took 10 days to send him [Imran Khan] to the hospital.” He demanded that Mr Khan be allowed to be examined by his personal physician, saying that they did not trust the government with his treatment.
PTI leader Junaid Akbar Khan warned that while the party leadership had asked its supporters to exercise restraint, it could not control them indefinitely. “The day our workers come out without our call, you will not be able to run,” he warned, cautioning that frustration among PTI’s youth base was fast approaching a tipping point.
Mr Akbar said Imran Khan had never publicly complained about his health, but the party now considered his medical condition a matter of utmost urgency.
Moreover, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram demanded that cases be registered against the officers concerned, including the former Adiala superintendent and senior prison officials, for medical neglect so that they could be held accountable. “Negligence in Imran Khan’s treatment is unacceptable. Public anger is rising and the situation could soon get out of control,” he said in a statement.
‘Direct consequence’
Meanwhile, Imran’s son Kasim Khan, in a post on X, termed the development “a direct consequence of solitary confinement and medical neglect”.
“We have been informed that my father, Imran Khan, has lost most of the vision in his right eye, with reports indicating that only 15pc eyesight remains,” he said.







“This is the direct consequence of 922 days of solitary confinement, medical neg­lect (denied blood tests), and the deliberate denial of proper treatment in jail,” he stressed, maintaining that the “responsibility lies squarely with the regime in power, the army chief and the puppets enabling this cruelty”. He said that Imran’s “physical deterioration is happening under their orders, their watch and their responsibility”.
“They have manipulated and warped the justice system in order to keep my father in solitary confinement,” he added.
He claimed that he and his brother Sulaiman were “still being denied a visa to see our father as his health deteriorates”.
Separately, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, along with opposition leaders, said that the report presented before the Supreme Court was deeply alarming. He demanded that meetings be allowed with the family, party leaders and doctors and that medical treatment be ensured.
‘Fallen flat’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaul­lah Tarar said the narrative being “propagated” by the incarcerated ex-premier’s family had “fallen flat on its face” in light of the report.
In a post on X, he said: “The narrative which was being propagated to international media by Aleema Khan and other members of Imran Khan’s family regarding mistreatment and shabby conditions in prison has fallen flat on its face. “The report regarding daily routine and diet plan has cleared all ambiguity. All facilities are available to him and he has privileges more than any other prisoner,” he added.

In an income tax reference, titled Commissioner Inland Revenue versus Sajid Hussain Gondal and others, Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf and Justice Jawad Hassan laid down guidance on the scope and limits of amendment powers under Section 122, bringing long-awaited doctrinal clarity to a provision frequently invoked by tax authorities.
The reference application, filed under Section 133 of the ordinance, challenged an order of the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR), which had set aside an amendment made to a taxpayer’s deemed assessment for tax year 2019. The tribunal had earlier ruled that the FBR’s use of Section 122(5A) in the case was unlawful.

 

The taxpayer, Sajid Hussain Gondal, had filed an income tax return for 2019, which became a deemed assessment under Section 120 of the ordinance. Subsequently, the Additional Commissioner of Inland Revenue issued a show-cause notice under Sections 122(9), 111(1), and 122(5A), alleging discrepancies in declared gross revenue, purchases under Section 236A, deductions under Section 153, profit and loss expenses, and capital declarations.
The tax department claimed that these discrepancies rendered the deemed assessment erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of revenue, justifying an amendment under Section 122(5A). Despite the taxpayer’s explanation, the assessment was amended in June 2022, an action later upheld by the Commissioner (Appeals) but ultimately struck down by the ATIR in November 2023.
In a detailed ruling, the LHC reaffirmed that a deemed assessment under Section 120 cannot be unsettled lightly and drew a clear legal boundary between Section 122(5) and Section 122(5A).
It said Section 122(5) applies where an amendment is based on audit findings or definite information indicating escaped income, under-assessment, misclassification or excessive relief. By contrast, Section 122(5A) is revisional in nature and can be invoked only when the assessment order is both erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of revenue.
The bench stressed that both conditions must coexist, and that mere suspicion, arithmetic mismatch or perceived revenue loss does not meet the statutory threshold.
Justice Rauf observed that Section 122(5A) does not grant open-ended authority to revisit assessments. Rather, it is meant to correct glaring and apparent errors committed by the assessing officer where such errors are demonstrably harmful to revenue.
“The revisional jurisdiction under Section 122(5A) is not a licence for roving or fishing inquiries,” the high court held, adding that the alleged error must be evident from the record, and the claimed prejudice must be legally demonstrable, not conjectural.

The minister acknowledged that the high electricity tariffs had been pushing the consumers away from the grid and solar penetration had created a serious challenge to the grid. Therefore, the government was considering restructuring of the power sector debt, besides taking measures for curtailing peak demand.
Over the past few months, the government has taken up the restructuring of power sector debt with multilateral lenders, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, including a $30bn Chinese debt for longer duration. A circular debt of Rs1.6 trillion and a Rs1.225tr recent financing with local commercial banks are also on the agenda.
Pakistan’s repeated direct requests to Chinese institutions for extension in debt repayment period have remained fruitless for well over five years. The authorities have therefore been looking at refinancing of even the Chinese debt and domestic commercial debts with the banking sector to longer terms — 15-20 year concessional multilateral debt.

Power minister says rapid switchover to solar power has created ‘serious challenge’ for national grid

They estimated such a large-scale refinancing of power sector debt could bring down overall tariffs, particularly for industry, to 8-9 cents per unit from 11.5 cents per unit at present.
Mr Leghari said clean energy contribution to the national generation basket had reached 55pc in FY2025 and was estimated to cross 90pc by 2035. He said solar penetration had created a challenge for the national grid where daytime demand dipped to around 8,000MW, but went beyond 26,000MW during peak hours as the government policy encouraged households to invest their incomes and belongings in rooftop solar systems.
In such a situation, power plants are required to be kept on standby to meet peak demand. He said this “people-led solar revolution” had earned global accolades for Pakistan in leading a clean energy transition. He, however, noted that unfair pricing transfer was converting solarisation into a burden for other consumers and this “needs to be rationalised”.
The power minister said electricity prices had come down by 20pc over the last 18-20 months and despite imposition of fixed charges on households, residential tariff was still 35-40pc subsidised. In addition, the industrial power tariff had been cut by 35pc and brought down to around 11.5 cents per unit, which required to be brought down further to be internationally competitive.
The managing director of the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority said the government had given a target for launching the fan replacement scheme within 90 days and his agency had been able to complete all preparation for formal operationalisation in 81 days.
The project involves the State Bank and commercial banks through a tripartite agreement for the launch of the Prime Minister’s Fan Replacement Programme with a government rolling guarantee of Rs2bn to insure first installment default.
Minister for Climate Change Musadik Malik said the scheme would help reduce carbon footprint, reduce energy costs to consumers and reduce peak summer demand and contribute to climate resilience. He said replacement of an old fan with new efficient plant could help reduce energy bill by Rs12,000 per year.
