• Pakistan, Russia keen to boost trade; Putin invites Shehbaz to visit
ISLAMABAD: Chinese President Xi Jinping in a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday pledged support for Pakistan’s home-grown capacity for development, expressing readiness to build China-Pakistan Economic Corridor 2.0 and upgrade the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, and step up cooperation in industries, agriculture, and mining sectors.
Separately, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that bilateral trade between Pakistan and Russia required to be enhanced and stressed on taking steps in this regard, while also extending invitation to PM Shehbaz to visit Russia in November.
The PM, who held separate meetings with President Xi and President Putin in Bejing during his visit to China to attend SCO summit, expressed gratitude to both countries for what he called ‘unflinching support to Pakistan’s territorial integrity, sovereignty’ and hope that the strong ties would add to the progress and prosperity of the region.
According to PM Office, Pakistan and China on Tuesday reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening the iron-clad and all-weather strategic cooperative partnership through enhanced cooperation, reflecting their unique bilateral relationship.
The bilateral ties and cooperation were discussed in a meeting between PM Shehbaz and Chinese President Xi at the Great Hall of the People, wherein they agreed that the relationship between both countries was unique and unparalleled, which should be reflected in their enhanced cooperation.
PM Shehbaz appreciated “China’s unflinching support to Pakistan’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and socio-economic development, as well as the significance of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as a flagship project of President Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to help both countries to build an even stronger Pakistan-China community with a shared future”.
He reaffirmed the desire to continue working closely with China for the successful implementation of the next phase of upgraded CPEC, with its five new corridors.

The PM Office quoted President Xi as saying that China would continue to assist Pakistan in all fields of economic growth and development, especially as the two countries were now ushering in second phase of CPEC that would focus on Pakistan’s most important economic sectors.
 
 

PM Shehbaz renewed his “most cordial” invitation to President Xi to undertake an official visit to Pakistan next year when both countries would celebrate the 75th anniversary of establishment of Pakistan-China diplomatic ties.
Security issue
Also, President Xi said China supports Pakistan’s efforts to combat terrorism and hopes “effective measures” would be taken to “ensure the safety and security of Chinese personnel, projects, and institutions in Pakistan, to create a secure environment for bilateral cooperation”.
According to Reuters, China pressed Pakistan to improve security of Chinese nationals, who have been repeatedly attacked by militants while working on Beijing-funded multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects in the South Asian country.
However, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who joined the PM in China and attended the meeting with President Xi, confirmed to Dawn that the Chinese head of state has raised the issue of Chinese nationals’ security in Pakistan. “He (President Xi) said security is important,” the minister quoted the Chinese president as saying.
Meeting with Putin
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz met President Putin and expressed gratitude to the Russian president for supporting Pakistan, saying that was viewed as ‘a balancing act in the region’.
Both leaders agreed to further enhance the bilateral ties and cooperation between the two countries in diverse fields.
 
 

PM Shehbaz said Pakistan respected Russia’s ties with India and wanted to establish very strong relations of its own, which would be “supplementary and complementary”.
Responding to Putin’s invitation to attend the SCO Heads of Government Summit in November, the premier replied that he was looking forward to it.
President Putin said, “Pakistan has always been a traditional partner and remains as such in Asia, and we cherish these ties,” adding that both sides had agreed to intensify their bilateral relations.
He noted that their bilateral trade needed to be enhanced and stressed taking steps to address the issue.

A sixth round of Iran-US talks was suspended after Israel and the US struck Iranian military and nuc­lear facilities and Iran ret­aliated with waves of ballistic and hypersonic missiles against Israel.
“We indeed pursue rat­ional negotiations. By raising issues such as missile restrictions, they set a path that negates any talks,” the secretary of Iran’s Sup­reme National Sec­­­urity Cou­­ncil, Ali Lar­ijani, said in a post on X.
 






Western countries cla­im Iran’s uranium enrichm­ent programme could yield material for an atomic warhead and that it seeks to develop a ballistic missile to carry one.
Iran says its nuclear programme is only for ele­ctricity generation and other civilian uses and that it is enriching uranium as fuel for these purposes.
It has denied seeking to create missiles capable of carrying nuclear payloads and says its defence capabilities cannot be open to negotiation in any talks over its atomic programme.
Larijani’s comments follow last week’s launch by France, Germany and Bri­tain of a “snapback mechanism” that could re-impose UN sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear programme.
The three countries  have urged Iran to engage in nuclear negotiations with the US, among other conditions, in order to have the imposition of the snapback sanctions delayed for six months.

Narendra Modi won’t be there, perhaps because saluting China’s military prowess just five years after border clashes, and barely four months after Chinese technology gave Pakistan an edge in the post-Pahalgam hostilities, would not have played well at home. But at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin over the weekend, he was holding hands with Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping on what was the Indian prime minister’s first visit to China in seven years.
Apart from talks with Xi, he spent more than 45 minutes in Putin’s limousine. Obviously, we don’t know what they discussed. There was never much of a chance that Modi (if he was so inclined) could sway the Russian president from his aggression against Ukraine. The Chinese leader, meanwhile, held out the prospect of partnership in place of rivalry, and Modi expressed no disagreement.
This could be notched up as yet another triumph for the first seven months of Trump’s presidency. The non-alignment that India’s first PM judiciously favoured has left its marks, notwithstanding all of the relatively recent hostility against ‘Nehruvian socialism’.
While maintaining cordial ties with three US administrations, Jawaharlal Nehru was also attached to the idea of friendship with the Soviet Union and China. There have been fractures over the decades with Washington and Beijing, but the Moscow connection has survived the demise of the USSR.

China knows how to play the long game.

Russia, however, wasn’t a key source of crude oil until the sanctions following its attack on Ukraine. The irony is that until last year the US pretty much encouraged India to purchase Russian crude to maintain oil prices, and had no objection to the refined product being sold on to Europe or America, so that they could claim they weren’t buying it from Russia. The largest refinery belongs to Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries, which helps to explain why a sudden halt to Russian imports would be a non-starter for the crony capitalism that has helped to sustain the BJP regime.
Previous US presidents wooed India as a counter-balance to China, as part of a strategy that has only persuaded the latter to extend its military prowess. Trump presumably knows that China imports more Russian crude than India, yet his aides have described the Ukraine conflict as ‘Modi’s war’ and derided India as a ‘laundromat’ for Russia. That’s absurd, given that Moscow would be disinclined to shift its aggressive stance as long as Beijing and Delhi are on board. The Ukraine war would not screech to a halt if India stopped purchasing Russian oil.
It might be different if China withdrew its support from Russia, but that too is unlikely. Inadvertently or otherwise, the US has facilitated rapprochement between India and China. ‘Hindi-Cheeni bhai bhai’ might remain a historical memory, but the South Asian region would no doubt benefit from unexpected bonhomie between the world’s two most populous powers. The days of ‘Howdy Modi’ and ‘Namaste Trump’ seem to be long gone.
Around the time of Trump’s second inauguration, a global poll indicated that India was among the very few Global South nations that saw his return to power as positive. Opinions have been shifting, though, and even the 52 per cent of Indians who approved of Trumpianism in June might be differently inclined after the 50pc tariffs threatening to strangle India’s economy.
That’s yet an­­ot­her obstacle in the path of India’s economic illusions, and it re­­m­ains to be seen whe­ther a prospective partnership with China mi­­ght prove transformative. But Modi is also struggling domestically, after the disappointing last election and credible accusations of fraud. That may seem Trumpian in some ways, but the US and India are very different entities.
Both Modi and Trump benefit from largely ineffectual oppositions. That might change, and the aftermath could remain troublesome. It must be said, though, that Modi’s reported refusal to chat with Trump over the phone was more assertive than Pakistan’s deference to Washington. Neither side has offered a credible explanation for why the war stopped. Whatever the details, the outcome stretches beyond regional circumstances.
China’s transcendence might be a long time coming, but, unlike Trump, Xi knows how to play the long game. Could a better world order emerge? It’s not impossible, but the scant mention in the Tianjin agenda of the genocide in Gaza and beyond serves as yet another reminder that trade trumps transgressions against human rights. China’s trajectory as a US rival remains shrouded in mystery, but Trump might solve it sooner than we expect.

The new judicial year began in the IHC on Tuesday with Justice Dogar convening a full court meeting attended by all judges. Officials said the chief justice scheduled another full court session for 2pm today (Wednesday), issuing formal notices directing all IHC judges to attend.
Although the detailed agenda was not made public, such meetings are generally convened at the start of the judicial year to review the court’s performance, discuss administrative affairs, and set priorities for the coming months.
The full court meeting, to be chaired by Justice Dogar, will bring together all serving judges of the IHC for collective deliberations on judicial and administrative matters.
Justice Sattar’s letter, seen by Dawn.com, said the full court meeting was “long overdue but welcome step towards correcting the illegalities that have seeped into the administration of Islamabad High Court”, pointing out that the process had begun during the term of the previous top judge.
“I am writing to you in request inclusion of the matters listed below for discussion in the full court meeting. I have only included here brief explanations or questions to articulate their relevance, but I am sure you’ll get my drift.
“Some might counsel that this is an exercise in futility in view of the egregious disregard for judicial independence, institutional norms and the principle of comity amongst judges that has been witnessed in our midst since your transfer to Islamabad High Court. But one must never lose hope in the innate capacity of human beings to assume control of their agency and do the right and decent thing,” Justice Sattar wrote.
IHC’s diminishing role as a guardian of fundamental rights: Justice Sattar said the primary responsibility of the judiciary in a rule of law polity was to protect constitutionally-guaranteed fundamental rights against the abuse of power by the state.
He questioned whether IHC judges truly believed that was discharging that “pivotal constitutional duty” today and whether they believed that citizens perceived them as protectors and defenders of fundamental rights.
Failure to exercise supervision and control over subordinate judiciary: On this issue, Justice Sattar asked if the IHC was discharging its obligation to supervise and control courts subordinate to it in a manner so that judges manning such courts could discharge their judicial functions without fear, as required by Article 203 of the Constitution.
“Should the Islamabad District judiciary continue to look like a game of musical chairs played predominantly by deputationists or does IHC have the responsibility to develop district judiciary as an independent institution possessed of integrity and efficiency?”
Lack of transparency and logic in fixation of cases and preparation of rosters: About this issue, Justice Sattar said that as opposed to respecting institutional norms, Justice Dogar had created rosters excluding senior judges, including the senior puisne judge, from heading divisional benches.
“Should fixation of cases rest on the whims of the Cl or should there be transparency in who hears what case, while matching expertise of judges to the work they are asked to do? We write in our judgments every day that public officials aren’t kings and their administrative powers are neither unfettered nor should be exercised in a colorable manner. The cause lists issued under your watch reflect that cases are mostly marked to transferred judges and additional judges, leaving out permanent judges of IHC who found your transfer to IHC disagreeable. While exercising the administrative powers of IHC should one not remember that judges, including the CJ, are public officials too and not kings?”
Use of administrative powers to undermine judicial independence: Justice Sattar lamented that under Justice Dogar’s leadership and watch, “we have seen the office refusing to issue cause lists in breach of judicial orders, we have seen cases being transferred from the docket of one court to another despite the lack of any power in the office of the CI to do so, and most recently we have seen issuance of rosters to deprive two judges (including me) of their dockets in a move to render them dysfunctional vis-à-vis their single-bench dockets”.
The judge said that the above might be successful manoeuvers in “rendering some judges irrelevant” and the country’s judicial history was replete with “similar malevolent practices that spread during authoritarian times”. He, however, questioned whether such “subversion of judicial independence” was justifiable.
Composition of committees to undermine high court’s collegiate character: On this issue, Justice Sattar said Justice Dogar had constituted committees “such that they exclude most of the senior judges of IHC from participating in its administrative functions.
“You’ve excluded the two senior-most judges of IHC from the Administration Committee in breach of IHC rules and entrenched institutional norms abided by all High Court, including the LHC from where you’ve come.
“Do you think manning IHC committees with additional judges appointed earlier this year and judges transferred from other provinces along with you strengthen IHC as an Institution and promote collegiality amongst judges?”
**Assumption of powers to transform chief justice’s office into a monocracy: The judge said the IHC chief justice had “assumed powers to issue a circular requiring judges to seek an NOC (no-objection certificate) from you to travel out of the country, essentially placing judges on the Exit Control List”.
Justice Sattar said neither the Constitution nor the law vested such rule-making power in the office of the chief justice to “lord over his peers”.
“The draft rules circulated for consideration during the full court meeting also seek to concentrate all administrative powers in the office of the chief justice. You might have read Lord Acton’s words that power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Will transforming the office of chief justice into an autocracy, in an effort to reduce the judiciary to a regiment, bolster judicial independence essential for the discharge of our adjudicatory duties?” Justice Sattar pondered.
Performance evaluation of judges and reporting of judgments: Regarding this issue, Justice Sattar said judges were the highest paid public officials and should be strenuously held to account for their performance by the public.
However, he questioned if should not there be an agreed objective framework for their performance evaluation.
“Under your watch IHC has issued skewed statistics regarding discharge of judicial work at IHC. These statistics are designed to cultivate an impression that some judges work super efficiently, while others don’t work at all. What if a curious researcher were to investigate the nature (and number) of cases marked to the ‘performing’ judges versus others, and the nature, quality and length of orders that make up their disposal figures? Should we not put together a consensual performance-evaluation criteria as well as guidance for which judgments are to be reported, to earnestly seek to enhance our performance and hold ourselves to account, instead of engaging in deceptive advertising?”
Concluding his letter, Justice Sattar said: “You will appreciate that it takes decades to build institutions, but they can be destroyed exponentially.  We have seen this happen to Islamabad High Court in the last couple of years.
“While I may be accused of letting hope trump experience in writing to you to encourage and facilitate intra-institutional debate to stem the rot that is reducing this judicial organ into nothingness, I am partial to Rousseau’s opinion regarding the capacity of human beings for virtue. History doesn’t remember kindly those who only make hay while the sun shines. And history also reminds us that all good (and bad) times come to an end sooner rather than later.”
Justice Sattar expressed hope that the IHC chief justice would read the letter to “appreciate the spirit in which it is written”.
He added: “I apologise in advance if the content causes any offence, for that is not the intent. We are all grown adults who should be able to speak candidly about the state of our institution’s disrepair. Without honest identification and admission of our failings, there can be no corrective action.”
It may be mentioned that Justice Sattar previously wrote letters to the Justice Dogar on multiple issues, including amendments in the IHC Rules and formation of administrative committees, among others.
Recently, IHC Chief Justice constituted a division bench exclusively for clearing the backlog of nearly 2,000 tax references.
Both the judges, Justice Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz, are the members of this special bench.
IHC administration transferred all the cases pending in the dockets of both the judges to the other available judges.</p><small>2025-09-03 04:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/030900045b05171.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939244/90pc-of-world-lives-on-degraded-land-unhealthy-air-water-stress-wb' target='_blank'><strong>90pc of world lives on degraded land, unhealthy air, water stress: WB</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Ninety per cent of the world lives with either degraded land, unhealthy air, or water stress, according to a new World Bank report, which says that restoring natural systems is possible and can yield high returns.
In low-income countries alone, eight of out ten people live without all three — healthy air, water, and land — according to the report, ‘Reboot Development: The Economics of a Livable Planet’. New evidence shows that the loss of forests disrupts rainfall, dries soils, and worsens droughts, costing billions of dollars.
The report also identifies a nitrogen paradox where fertilisers boost yields, but overuse in some regions harms crops and ecosystems, costing as much as $3.4 trillion annually. And air and water pollution silently damage health, productivity, and cognition, thereby sapping human potential, the report estimates.
If managed well, however, nature can create jobs, drive economic growth, and build resilience.  Using natural resources more efficiently could reduce pollution by as much as 50 per cent. Improving farm-level practices of nitrogen fertiliser use can deliver 25 times greater benefits than their cost, while boosting crop yields.
Improving water and sanitation services could be lifesaving: chlorinating water at point of use could save a quarter of the children that prematurely die from water-related issues. “Pollution markets” not only reduce air pollution, they are also cost effective: each dollar spent yields about $26 to $215 in benefits.
Around 80 pc of the people in low-income countries live with all three environmental stressors — degraded land, polluted air, and water stress. By contrast, in high-income countries 43 per cent of people are not exposed to any of the three stressors.
The report says the scale of impacts is so vast that humans have transitioned from being passive beneficiaries of the planet to becoming the dominant force in its transformation.
Today humans and their livestock account for an astonishing 95 per cent of total mammalian biomass (by weight) on Earth, leaving wild mammals a vanishing 5 per cent.
The Earth has transgressed six of the nine environmental thresholds — termed “Planetary Boundaries” — needed for human progress, the report says.

• Suicide causes one in every 100 deaths; mental health disorders cost the world economy an estimated $1tr annually
ISLAMABAD: More than one billion people suffer from mental health disorders, with suicide claiming over one in every 100 lives and leaving families worldwide to cope with its devastating impact, the WHO has warned.
Speaking to reporters, Devora Kestel, the interim head of the WHO’s non-communicable disease and mental health department said, “Globally, suicide accounts for more than one in every 100 deaths, and for each death, there are 20 suicide attempts.”
She added that those suicides “affected countless more lives and livelihoods, as friends, carers and loved ones were forced to grapple with unimaginable hardship.
Conditions such as anxiety and depression are taking an immense human and economic toll. While many countries have bolstered their mental health policies and programmes, greater investment and action are needed globally to expand services to prote­­ct and promote people’s mental well-being.
Mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression are highly prevalent in all countries and communities, affecting people of every age and income level. They are the second leading cause of long-term disability, contributing significantly to the loss of healthy life. They drive up healthcare costs for affected people and families, while inflicting substantial economic losses on a global scale.
Meanwhile, the new findings published in two reports — World Mental Health Today and Mental Health Atlas 2024 — highlight some areas of progress while exposing significant gaps in addressing mental health conditions worldwide.
These reports serve as critical tools to inform national strategies and shape global dialogue ahead of the 2025 United Nations High-Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being, scheduled for September 25 in New York.
“Transforming mental health services is one of the most pressing public health challenges,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebre­yesus, WHO Director-General. “Investing in mental health means investing in people, communities, and economies — an investment no country can afford to neglect.
Every government and every leader has a responsibility to act with urgency and to ensure that mental healthcare is treated not as a privilege, but as a basic right for all.”
Key data
The reports show that while prevalence of mental health disorders can vary by sex, women are disproportionately impacted overall. Anxiety and depression are the most common types of mental health disorders among both men and women.
Suicide remains a devastating outcome, claiming an estimated 727,000 lives in 2021 alone. It is a leading cause of death among young people in all countries and across socioeconomic groups.
Despite global efforts, progress in reducing suicide mortality is too low to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of a one-third reduction in suicide rates by 2030. On the current trajectory, only a 12 per cent reduction will be achieved by that deadline.
The economic impact of mental health disorders is staggering. While healthcare costs are high, the indirect costs — particularly from lost productivity — are even greater. Depression and anxiety alone cost the global economy an estimated $1 trillion each year.
The reports reveal a concerning stagnation in mental health investment. Median government spending on mental health remains at just 2pc of total health budgets — unchanged since 2017. Disparities between countries are stark; while high-income countries spend up to $65 per person on mental health, low-income countries spend as little as $0.04. The global median number of mental health workers is only 13 per 100, 000 people, with extreme shortages in low- and middle-income countries.
Reform and development of mental health services are progressing slowly. Fewer than 10pc of countries have fully transitioned to community-based care models, with most still in the early stages of transition.
Encouragingly, most countries report having functional mental health promotion initiatives such as early childhood development, school-based mental health programmes and suicide prevention strategies.
Over 80pc of countries now offer mental health and psychosocial support as part of emergency responses.

Flooding across the northwestern state killed at least 29 people and affected over 250,000 last month, with the state’s chief minister calling it “one of the worst flood disasters in decades”.
The region is often dubbed India’s breadbasket, but more than 940 square kilometres (360 square miles) of farmland are flooded, leading to “devastating crop losses”, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
PM Modi on Monday assured him of the federal government’s “full support”.

Over 1,000 boats, 30 helicopters deployed to rescue the stranded, supply food

Authorities have said they fear a “huge loss of livestock”, the full extent of which will only be clear when the waters recede, according to a bulletin issued by the state authorities late Monday.
India’s army and disaster teams have carried out vast rescue operations, deploying more than 1,000 boats and 30 helicopters to rescue the stranded or supply food. “The most important thing is to save the lives of people and helpless animals trapped in the water,” Mann said in a statement.
Rivers in the region cross into Pakistan, where floodwater has also engulfed swathes of land.
Floods and landslides are common during the June-September monsoon season in the subcontinent, but experts say climate change, coupled with poorly planned development, is increasing their frequency, severity and impact.
Northwest India has seen rainfall surge by more than a third on average from June to September, according to the national weather department.
In the capital Delhi, relentless rains have swollen the Yamuna river — which breached its danger mark on Tuesday, inundating several areas and creating traffic snarl-ups lasting for hours.
Deadly floods triggered by record-breaking rain also killed dozens in India-held Kashmir last month.

• Belgium to recognise Palestinian state at UNGA
JERUSALEM: Israel intensified its military build-up on Tuesday as reservists began responding to call-up orders ahead of a planned offensive to capture Gaza City, nearly two years into a devastating war.
Despite mounting pressure at home and abroad to end its campaign in the Palestinian territory, Israel is gearing up to seize Gaza’s largest city — intensifyi­­ng bombardments and operati­ng in the outskirts in recent days.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 56 people on Tuesday, including 10 in an air strike on a residential building in the southwest of Gaza City.
AFP footage from the aftermath of the strike in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood showed Pa­­­lestinians carrying a dead girl from the rubble of the top floor.
“We were sleeping safely in our homes and suddenly we wo­­ke up to the sound of bombing and destruction and found most of our neighbours murder­­ed and injured,” said Sanaa al-Dreimli.
The United Nations estimates that nearly a million people live in Gaza City and its surroundings, where a famine has been declared.
In a statement, the Israeli military said it had been preparing in recent days “ahead of expanded combat operations and the large-scale mobilisation of reservists”.
Speaking at an event in Jeru­salem, Defence Minister Israel Katz said: “Tens of thousands of reservists have left their homes, families and jobs to once again answer the national call — the return of all prisoners and the neutralisation of Hamas.”
Approving the military’s pla­ns for the conquest of Gaza City in late August, Katz said he had authorised the call-up of about 60,000 reservists.
Israeli media reported that some 40,000 reservists were being called up in the first mobilisation wave.
On the ground in Gaza City, weary Palestinians told AFP they felt helpless and desperate ahead of the looming offensive.
“There is no place for us to go, and no means to get there. We are exhausted physically and mentally from displacement and from the war,” 60-year-old Amal Abdel-Aal, who lives in a tent in western Gaza City, told AFP by telephone.
“We have come to wish for death.”
Palestinian state
Belgium on Tuesday became the latest Western country to say it will recognise the State of Palestine at the UN General Assembly this month, following similar announcements by Australia, Canada and France.
“Palestine will be recognised by Belgium at the UN session! And firm sanctions are being imposed against the Israeli government,” Foreign Minister Maxime Prevot wrote on X.
In July, French President Emmanuel Macron said France would recognise a Palestinian state at the UN meeting, due to be held from September 9 to 23 in New York. More than a dozen other Western countries have since called on others to do the same.
Prevot said the decision came “in view of the humanitarian tragedy” unfolding in Gaza, where Israeli offensives have displaced most of the population at least once and the UN has declared a famine.
“In the face of the violence perpetrated by Israel in violation of international law, given its international obligations, including the duty to prevent any risk of genocide, Belgium had to take strong decisions to increase pressure on the Israeli government and Hamas terrorists,” Prevot wrote.
“This is not about punishing the Israeli people, but rather about ensuring that its government respects international and humanitarian law and taking action to try to change the situation on the ground,” he added.
In a post on X on Tuesday, the military’s Arabic-language spo­kesman warned Gazans of the upcoming “expansion of comb­­at operations towards Gaza City”.
“We wish to remind you that in Al-Mawasi enhanced services will be provided, with an emphasis on access to medical care, water and food,” Avichay Adraee said, referring to an area in the south which Israel designated a humanitarian zone in the early months of the war but which has been hit by repeated strikes.
In mid-August, UN human rights office spokesman Thame­­en al-Kheetan said Palestinians in Al-Mawasi had “little or no access to essential services and supplies, including food, water, electricity and tents”.

The recently concluded SCO summit in the Chinese city of Tianjin brought together countries with competing interests in times of great turmoil in global governance.
Initially formed as a security cooperation group over two decades ago, the SCO has evolved into a formidable forum for trade and economic development. Described as ‘SCO-Plus’, the conference was attended by more than 20 heads of state and government, as well as leaders of international organisations. The Tianjin summit reinforced China’s leading role in the emerging multilateral international order.
In his speech, President Xi Jinping called for “equal and orderly multipolarisation”. The Chinese leader stressed the need for the organisation to work towards a “more just and equitable global governance system” and urged regional leaders to shun a “Cold War mentality”.
 
 

It was pointed out that member states faced complicated security and development challenges in a “chaotic and intertwined” world. These remarks set the tone of the conference. His speech indicated China’s emphasis on geo-economics and connectivity.
As per media reports, “The organisation covers approximately 24 per cent of global land area and 42pc of the world’s population, with member states accounting for roughly one-quarter of global GDP and trade increasing nearly 100-fold in two decades.” China’s trade with SCO members, observers and dialogue partners reportedly totalled $890 billion in 2024. Donald Trump’s reckless trade war has massively increased SCO’s potential, as the bloc provides an alternative to America’s economic domination.

The Tianjin summit reinforced China’s leading role in the emerging international order.

The conference also brought the leaders of Pakistan and India face-to-face for the first time after their four-day conflict in May that had pushed the two nuclear-armed nations close to a wider conflagration. The tension was palpable with the two leaders not even shaking hands, let alone any possibility of meeting on the sidelines. Pakistan’s offer for a dialogue on all disputed matters between the two countries had gone unheeded by the Indian prime minister.
Without taking names, both leaders accused the other of perpetrating terrorist activities in their respective countries. New Delhi has hardened its position and does not want any bilateral talks with Islamabad after it was humiliated during its military action against Pakistan. India’s belligerence remains the main source of tension, hampering regional economic and trade cooperation. There seems to be no change in its stance despite foreign policy setbacks.
However, the conference provided an opportunity for China and India to ease the tensions in their relationship. It was the first trip of the Indian prime minister to China in seven years. Relations between the world’s two most populous nations remained strained after bloody border clashes in 2019 following India’s unilateral and illegal decision to annex the disputed state of Jammu and Kashmir and declare Ladakh as federal territory.
Although a ceasefire has been in place for some time, other issues have continued to strain their relationship. India has been part of a US-led anti-China coalition in the Indo-Pacific region. But the latest dispute with the Trump administration on trade tariffs seems to have forced India to mend fences with China. Interestingly, the 50 per cent tariff on exports to the US had come into force just before the summit. Once America’s so-called strategic ally, India now faces some of the highest tariffs imposed by the US. This factor, together with political reasons, has caused relations to sour between Washington and Delhi.
Although the Chinese and Indian leaders agreed they were not “rivals but partners in development”, unresolved issues remain between them, which can widen the existing trust deficit. These include the border dispute, which the Chinese president indicated should be put aside to focus on improved trade and economic relations.
 
 

Interestingly, despite their strained relations over the past years, trade between the two countries in 2024-2025 totalled $118bn, though with India’s trade deficit with China reaching $99.2bn.
The thaw in their relations has already resulted in the resumption of direct flights between the two countries and improved business environment. But China’s strategic relations with Pakistan continue to cast a shadow over any further breakthrough.
The summit also reinforced Russia’s return to the global stage after being ostracised by the West for invading Ukraine. President Putin blamed the West for triggering the war. The Russian president has also been invited to the military parade in Beijing this week to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War (World War II) and the founding of the United Nations. “It is a milestone prompting us to remember the past and create a better future together,” declared President Xi.
The gathering of leaders and observers from across Eurasia reflected the emerging alignment in the shifting sands of regional geopolitics. The bloc represents the emerging power of the Global South, which is challenging the unjust Western international global order.
The Tianjin Declaration, issued after the two-day parleys, reaffirmed the commitment to sustainable international peace and called for joint efforts to counter traditional and new security challenges. While resolving to fight against terrorism, separatism and extremism, the conference recognised the leading role of sovereign states and their competent authorities in countering terrorist and extremist threats.
The conference also adopted a 10-year SCO Development Strategy, which “defines the priority tasks and main directions for deepening multifaceted cooperation in the interests of ensuring peace and stability, development and prosperity in the SCO space”.
After the summit concluded, President Xi had a bilateral meeting with Pakistan’s prime minister and his delegation in Beijing, reaffirming the strategic and economic partnership between the two countries. They also agreed to initiate the second phase of CPEC. The SCO provides a great opportunity for Pakistan’s economic development.

In Pakistan, even calamitous events struggle to do so. Floods have swept through KP, drowned swathes of Punjab after water was released from across the border, and displaced thousands. The destruction is immense. Yet the country’s politicians, rather than rallying together, remain stuck in their habitual quarrels.
A fleeting glimpse of unity came at the opening of the National Assembly session on Monday, when members suspended routine business to focus on the unfolding disaster. The spirit evaporated almost instantly. On the orders of Imran Khan, PTI legislators boycotted a scheduled NDMA briefing. Their absence turned what should have been a vital forum into yet another stage for political one-upmanship.
 
 

The instinct to politicise calamity is not confined to one side. A couple of months ago, PTI lawmakers in Punjab tried to present the floods as proof of the provincial government’s failures, only to face worse devastation in KP.
And now, during the NA debate, ministers used up precious time to trumpet their own ‘effective’ responses or to cast blame on rivals and contractors. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, while correctly pointing to encroachments and poor planning, also singled out a company in his home constituency, turning part of his speech into a political broadside. Even amid a shared tragedy, leaders reach for familiar tactics of point-scoring.
Nevertheless, the defence minister was right to call the situation a “man-made disaster”. Successive governments have allowed hotels to sprout on riverbeds, sanctioned housing societies on floodplains and neglected to enforce building codes. Big dams remain mired in politics; small reservoirs and local drainage schemes, which could be completed in a year or two, are ignored. Weather-monitoring is abysmal: Pakistan has 85 stations to cover nearly 800,000 sq km, when thousands would be needed to meet international standards.
No wonder the country lurches blindly from one storm to the next. There are precedents for doing better. During the 2010 floods, leaders did at least convene all-parties meetings and discussed creating an independent relief commission. The spirit was imperfect, but it showed some recognition that disaster could not be fought through mudslinging.
This year’s floods ought to provoke similar realism. Unity is now a matter of survival. Politicians must come together to debate the hard questions: how to complete existing dam projects, build smaller water-storage structures, empower local governments and invest in forecasting capacity. They must also strengthen disaster-resilient infrastructure, enforce zoning laws against construction on riverbeds, upgrade drainage in cities, and expand social protection for displaced families. Climate change is redrawing the map. Three major floods in three provinces this summer alone should be warning enough. The waters have shown no partisanship. Neither should the politicians.

The KP CM’s support for the long-proposed-but-never-built project stirred a veritable hornet’s nest, with even his own party leaders opposing his endorsement for the controversial project.
However, the maverick politician’s views prompted endorsement from unlikely quarters — the Punjab government, led by PML-N.
A day earlier, at rain-hit event held at KP House in Islamabad, the KP CM had expressed ‘conditional support’ for projects like the Kalabagh Dam, saying they were necessary for the sake of future generations.
However, in the same bre­­­ath, he said that the reservations of all stakeholders, including provinces, should be addressed prior to its construction.
Political circles have been abuzz since then, with many struggling to decide whether to view his remarks as courageous or foolhardy.
In another interaction with journalists in the capital on Tuesday, CM Gandapur referred to international studies that favoured the construction of the controversial Kalabagh Dam.
He said he had brought up the issue during a recent meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI), but claimed that some “foolish people” were against it.
Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari on Tuesday said that for the first time, the Punjab government had found itself in agreement with the KP CM on this issue. Speaking at a presser, she said that Punjab endorsed what Mr Gandapur had said about the Kalabagh Dam.
She said that Pakistan was among the countries most severely affected by climate change, making the construction of new dams a national necessity. She even suggested that all provinces should work on a joint action plan.
But the KP CM’s statement had his own party puzzled. PTI leader and former National Assembly speak Asad Qaiser told Dawn Mr Gandapur’s statement did not reflect party policy.
“The party has always made it clear that there should not be any controversial project in Pakistan. At the moment, there is need to strengthen the federation. The policy of Imran Khan is very clear, no such project can be started without consensus and the same has been suggested by the party’s Central Executive Committee,” he said.
Asked why he thought the chief minister would make such a statement, Mr Qaiser said that Gandapur should not have discussed the controversial issue.
“I cannot fathom how he has made the statement without discussing it within the party. I would say that it is his personal opinion and not party policy”, he added.
Meanwhile, PTI Sindh leader Haleem Adil Sheikh called the proposal a “dead horse” which the party has never supported.
In a statement, Mr Sheikh said that jailed PTI founder Imran Khan had repeatedly opposed the controversial dam’s construction during his tenure, making the party’s stance clear.PPP leader Nisar Khuhro also expressed his annoyance over the KP CM’s statement, recalling that Sindh, KP and Balochistan have opposed the project in the past.

• PTI boycotts NA proceedings, holds parallel ‘public assembly’ outside Parliament House
ISLAMABAD: Differences within the federal cabinet surfaced on Tuesday during a National Assembly debate on the flood crisis when Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi openly criticised Defence Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif for his remarks on the government’s handling of the disaster.
Although he did not name his cabinet colleague, Mr Abbasi made multiple references to the defence minister’s speech on the floor of the house a day earlier.
He even suggested that Mr Asif resign from the cabinet instead of “levelling allegations against parliament and abusing bureaucracy only to gain [media] publicity”.
Meanwhile, members of the opposition PTI boycotted the proceedings and staged a parallel “public assembly” outside Parliament House to protest alleged political victimisation.
Speaking in the debate, Mr Abbasi accused some politicians of attacking institutions simply to go viral on social media. “If this is all they have to say, they should leave the government benches and sit in the opposition, because such language does not suit treasury members,” said Mr Abbasi, who was elected MNA from Rawalpindi.
On Monday, Khawaja Asif had described the recent devastation as a “man-made disaster”, blaming politicians and bureaucrats for unchecked encroachments on waterways and for allowing housing societies and hotels on riverbeds.
He also urged local government elections, criticising his own party’s government in Punjab for failing to hold them.
He also blamed a “contracting company” for the flood devastation in his home constituency, Sialkot.
Responding to the defence minister’s speech, Mr Abbasi said that those who had been a part of the system for the past 40 years were now criticising the system and “demanding local government elections”.
Mr Abbasi took the floor when Mr Asif had already left the assembly hall after briefly attending the proceedings.
“Does a contractor dare to carry out substandard work and run away with money in Rawalpindi?” said Mr Abbasi, stating that it was the responsibility of the MNAs to keep a check on such activities.
He said blaming the entire bureaucracy was unfair, noting that the obsession with going viral in politics had become a “disease”. “I have seen politicians resigning from the cabinet whenever a finger is raised at them. They left the ministry but stayed in the party,” he said while indirectly suggesting the defence minister resign from the cabinet.
Federal Minister for Water Resources Mueen Wattoo said surveys were underway to assess flood-related losses, including damage to crops, livestock, and houses, with compensation to be provided to all affected families. He said estimates were being finalised to ensure timely financial assistance.
PTI’s protest
Earlier, before leading a walkout, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said his party was standing with the flood victims and the leadership had already directed the party workers to visit the affected areas.
However, he said the party had decided to boycott the National Assembly proceedings to protest the policies of the “fascist” government, adding that the PTI members had already submitted their resignations from the standing committees.
 






Meanwhile, talking to reporters after his meeting with former prime minister Imran Khan at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party’s decision to resign from standing committees was “final and irreversible”.
Quoting the jailed former prime minister, he reportedly said that Imran Khan fully endorsed the party’s decision to boycott by-elections and supported the resignations submitted by members from parliamentary committees.

LAHORE: The authorities started breaching dykes as the raging Chenab and Ravi rivers threaten to unleash an unprecedented deluge towards the densely populated cities of south Punjab as the water levels reach critical gauges near the headworks of Sidhnai and Muhammad Wala.
In a statement released after midnight on Wednesday, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said the Ravi River at Head Sidhnai had entered an extremely high flood stage.
To avert a major disaster, controlled breaches were carried out at the Mai Safura dyke near Head Sidhnai. PDMA officials confirmed that two cuts were made using explosives to release pressure on the embankment.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the breaches were executed under emergency circumstances to protect vital irrigation structures. He stressed that the decision was unavoidable, as rising floodwaters posed a severe threat to the safety of the embankment and surrounding infrastructure.
The breaches came as the Punjab government took emergency measures, including placing explosives at three strategic locations to conduct controlled breaches and prevent catastrophic urban flooding.
The convergence of the Ravi with the Chenab at Ahmadpur Sial is expected to significantly raise water levels in the Chenab, amplifying flood threats for the districts of Khanewal, Multan and Muzaffargarh. Authorities installed dynamite upstream of Sidhnai Headworks, at Head Muhammad Wala, and near Sher Shah to protect critical infrastructure.
The Sidhnai breach will affect Pirmahal, Khanewal, Kot Diwan, Kund Sargana, Kund Malkani, Kabi­rwala Maqsoodpur and Behrampur.
 
 

The breach before Head Muhammad Wala will submerge more than 100 villages and mouzas of the district Multan, including Muhammad Pur Ghota, Sorij Miani, Qasim Bela, Muzaffarabad and mouza Wolwat.
While the breach at Sher Shah will submerge mouza Jungle Wala, Gadar Kachumer, mouza Buch, Sehri Wala, Sultanpur Hamar, mouza Jamoor, Khanpur Qazi and others.
High flood in River Tawi
Earlier, the PDMA chief said that high flooding might occur in the Tawi River. Speaking at a press conference in Lahore, Mr Kathia said: “An alert was issued by the Indian High Commission and a high flood may occur in the River Tawi.”
The Chenab River’s flow has increased by 60,000 cusecs in one hour, he added. Heavy rains were lashing India-held Jammu’s Tawi, and heavy showers were also happening in northern Punjab, he said, adding that the water flow would increase.
Water flow
According to the Flood Forecasting Division’s data released at 1am on Wednesday, the Chenab River at Marala Headworks was in high flood and flowing at 237,678 cusecs, with a rising trend.
Head Khanki was in medium flood and was flowing at 166,529 cusecs (rising trend), while Qadirabad was in low flood and was flowing at 128,078 cusecs (steady). Head Trimmu was also in high flood at 385,911 cusecs, but the flow was falling.
On the Ravi River, Head Sidhnai was in exceptionally high flood with a flow of 173,734 cusecs and rising. Upstream, Balloki was in high flood at 125,930 (steady), Shahdara in low flood at 49,280 (steady), and Jassar also in low flood at 63,720 (rising).
On the Sutlej River, Head Ganda Singh Wala was in exceptionally high flood at 269,501 cusecs (steady), Head Sulemanki was in high flood at 124,913 cusecs (steady) while Head Islam was in medium flood at 95,727 cusecs (steady).
At Panjnad, where five rivers — the Sutlej, Beas, Ravi, Jhelum, and Chenab — converge, the water flow was 169,207 cusecs (steady) and fell into the category of low flood.

Multan under threat
Multan Commissioner Amir Kareem Khan said the city is still under the threat of flood, and explosives were installed to breach the Head Muhammad Wala protective dyke if it attained the maximum gauge level of 417.
He said that a committee of experts would decide whether to conduct a controlled breach in any dyke after reviewing three major factors: whether the water level is reaching a critical gauge, whether the water is creating a threat to infrastructure (such as the Head Muhammad Wala Bridge), and whether the rising water will damage the protective dyke.
Mr Khan said that the water flow from Trimmu Barrage was slow and the water level reached the critical gauge at Jhok Vaince, from where the Multan district starts.
The rescue operation in the district was complete, and the water level did not reach the critical gauge at Head Muhammad Wala yet and was flowing at 409 feet from sea level, he added.
Meanwhile, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said that around one million people and over 700,000 livestock had been relocated to safer areas. In total, 3,243 villages and a population of more than 2.4m had been affected by the floods,” she said.
“The government has set up 395 relief camps, providing shelter and food to affected families, along with 392 medical camps and 336 veterinary camps to ensure the protection of both human and animal lives.”
Homes, crops damaged in Jhang
Floodwaters from the Chenab have devastated crops and homes across Jhang district, particularly in Chund Bharwana, Daduana Kuhna and Ahmadpur Sial, where rice and sugarcane fields and mud houses were destroyed.
While a breach near Rivaz Bridge helped divert water and protect some areas, locals said no government relief reached them, with aid instead coming from nearby philanthropists.
In Ahmadpur Sial, residents accused the authorities of creating a breach on the wrong side of the Sultan Bahoo Bridge to protect influential landowners’ crops, which they said worsened the destruction in Garh Maharaja.
However, district officials rejected allegations of favouritism, insisting the breach decision was made after consultation.
More rains forecast
The Pakistan Meteorological Department predicted scattered thunderstorms and isolated showers over the next 24 hours in river catchments and divisions, including Islam­abad, Rawalpindi, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sahiwal, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan and Bahawalpur.
The Pakistan Commission of Indus Waters reported a high flood in the Tawi River, warning that it would impact downstream districts via the Chenab, including Gujrat, Gujranwala, Sialkot and Narowal.
The Flood Forecasting Division has also cautioned that the Chenab at Marala, Khanki and Qadirabad is likely to reach high flood levels within 24 hours, with associated tributaries and nullahs expected to swell across multiple divisions and districts.
PM reviews flood response
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a high-level review meeting on the country’s flood situation and rescue and relief efforts from Beijing, where he is on an official visit.
The premier briefly set aside his engagements to receive a detailed briefing from the chairman of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), chief secretaries of Punjab, Sindh and Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, and other relevant departments.
The NDMA reported close coordination with provincial governments and disaster management authorities to monitor river flows at Trimmu, Balloki, Sidhnai, Ganda Singh Wala and Sulemanki, while flood peaks were expected at Panjnad before mo­­ving downstream to Guddu Barrage in Sindh by Sept 6.
PM Shehbaz directed the National High­way Authority and the Ministry of Energy to prioritise restoration of damaged communication routes and electricity transmission systems. He stressed that federal and provincial governments must work in full coordination to ensure the timely eva­c­u­­­­­ation of families, distribution of relief goods, and rehabilitation of affected infrastructure.

• Five security men martyred in Kech IED blast
QUETTA: At least 13 people were killed and 35 others injured in a suicide bombing near Shahwani Stadium in the Sariab area here on Tuesday night, shortly after the conclusion of a public meeting of the Balochistan National Party (BNP-Mengal) held to mark the death anniversary of the late Sardar Attaullah Mengal.
BNP President and MNA Sardar Akhtar Mengal, who presided over the gathering, remained unhurt as the blast occurred when he was leaving for home. Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Asghar Khan Achakzai of the Awami National Party (ANP), and former senator Mir Kabeer Muhammad Shai of the National Party were also present, but escaped unhurt.
However, former BNP MPA Mir Ahmed Nawaz Baloch and the party’s central labour secretary Musa Jan were among those injured along with several party workers and supporters.
“We have received 13 bodies and 35 injured at the hospital,” Dr Wasim Baig told Dawn, adding that the condition of several injured was critical.
Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Hamza Shafqaat, however, confirmed the death toll at 11 at that time. “So far, 11 people have lost their lives while over 30 are injured,” he said, warning that the toll could rise as many were in serious condition.
 
 

Officials confirmed it was a suicide attack. The bomber detonated his explosives-laden jacket in the parking area as participants were leaving the meeting.
According to police, the explosion occurred about 15 minutes after the meeting ended, when crowds were dispersing.
“The blast took place in the parking area of the stadium,” said BNP’s senior vice president Sajid Tareen, adding that Sardar Mengal was still present at the time but later reached home safely.
Six vehicles, including bulletproof cars belonging to politicians, were damaged in the explosion. Mir Kabeer Muhammad Shai survived as he was inside his bulletproof vehicle when the blast occurred.
In a late-night statement, the Balochistan Home Department said a high-level investigation had been ordered. Authorities had collected evidence from the site, it said, adding that the injured were being provided the best possible medical care.
The deceased were identified as Muhammad Ishaq, Najeebullah, Shan, Muhammad Hanif, Madad Khan, Waqir Ahmed, Hafeez, Abdul Nabi, Nasarullah, Allah Bakhsh, Najeebullah, son of Asadullah, Allah Bakhsh and Muhammad Waqar.
Kech IED blast
Separately, five security personnel were martyred and three others injured on  Tuesday when a convoy of security forces was targeted in a blast in the  Buleda area of Kech district, near the Pakistan-Iran border.
Officials said the convoy of Frontier Corps personnel was passing near Babar Post when a powerful explosion struck one of the vehicles.  Five soldiers lost their lives in the attack, while three others sustained injuries.
A senior security official confirmed that the blast occurred close to the convoy. He said an improvised explosive device (IED),  planted by unidentified miscreants on the roadside, was detonated when the convoy was passing through the area.

Both teams observed a minute of silence for the flood victims in Pakistan and the earthquake victims in Afghanistan before the match.
Afghanistan skipper Rashid Khan said that they would aim for crossing 170 after winning the toss and batting, but his team fell just short of that mark as Pakistan’s bowlers, led by Faheem, kept the lid on scoring.
However, the Pakistani reply never got going as the Afghan bowlers kept taking wickets at regular intervals, with pacer Haris Rauf being the highest scorer for the Green Shirts.
 






Faheem was the pick of the bowlers for Pakistan, picking a career best of four wickets for 27 runs and picking up the prized scalps of player of the match Ibrahim Zadran and Sediqullah Atal as both batters scored 50s for their side.
Pakistan still top the table in the tri-series, with both sides scheduled to play the UAE ahead of the final on Sunday.
The Afghan batting innings suffered an early blow as Saim Ayub got rid of Rahmanullah Gurbaz in just the second over of the innings after the Afghan opener hit him for the first maximum of the match.
The part-time spinner gave away just 18 runs in his quota of four overs, keeping the Afghan batters in check.
Pakistan’s fast bowlers hit back of a length at the start of the innings, being wary of not bowling too full on the high-scoring Sharjah pitch.
Haris, who took four wickets in the previous encounter, was welcomed to the crease with a maximum by Zadran in the fifth over, courtesy of a pull shot off a short delivery that went over the mid-wicket boundary.
Pakistan’s bowlers kept a lid on Afghanistan’s scoring in the powerplay — with the Afghan Atalan getting just 34 in the first six overs for the loss of one wicket.
Zadran and southpaw opener Atal kept the scoreboard ticking, reaching 73-1 at the halfway mark of the Afghan innings.
Both batters subsequently upped the scoring rate for Afghanistan — taking 20 off the 14th over bowled by Sufyan Muqim, with Atal bringing up his second 50 of the tournament.
The left-handed opener finally fell for 64 of 46 deliveries in the 16th over when he misqued a shot trying to hit Faheem Ashraf over long-on.
Zadran continued to hit boundaries, reaching the 50-run mark in 38 balls and hitting back-to-back fours to end the 17th over by Haris.
Azmatullah Omarzai fell to Faheem, who took a catch of his own bowling after the Afghan all-rounder top-edged a ball after being dropped earlier. Zadran was the next to follow, mistiming a slower ball to Muhammad Nawaz at deep mid-wicket.
The Afghan batters continued to get the odd boundary and finished on 169-5 at the end of the first innings.
Pakistan’s chase suffered early setbacks as both openers were back in the dressing room with just 27 on the board, courtesy some sharp bowling by Afghan pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi.
Both Saim and Sahibzada Farhan fell to him as the left-arm pacer bowled tight lines and lengths in his first spell.
Pakistan’s innings momentum returned in the sixth over of the innings, courtesy a six by skipper Salman Ali Agha and one by Fakhar Zaman that ended up on the enclosure roof.
That was short-lived as Fakhar fell to the wily off-spin of Muhammad Nabi and the Pakistan skipper got run out in a casual manner while returning for a second run.
The Afghan spinners then took wickets at regular intervals as none of the Pakistani batters crossed the 30-run mark, barring Haris — who top-scored with four sixes to bring some respectability to the Green Shirts’ final tally.
Pakistan had brought in Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris in place of Hasan Ali and Salman Mirza — the latter duo having played against the UAE in the previous encounter for the Green Shirts.
In the tournament being played as a warm-up ahead of the Asia Cup — which starts on September 9 — Pakistan started with thrashings of Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates, thanks to several players chipping in with impactful contributions. The tournament’s final is set for Sept 7.
After seasoned pacer Haris Rauf and skipper Salman Ali Agha led Pakistan to a 39-run win over Afghanistan in the opener, Saim Ayub and Hasan Nawaz scored half-centuries each to see the side down UAE by 31 runs.
The UAE fixture saw Pakistan cross the 200-mark as Hasan Nawaz launched a late onslaught after opener Saim Ayub had set the stage. Experienced fast bowler Hasan Ali then wrapped up the proceedings with 3-47 as UAE’s Asif Khan’s blistering 77 off 35 went in vain.
Under white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, Pakistan are building up to next year’s T20 World Cup without now discarded senior pros Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan.
Pakistan shuffled their bowling line-up in the previous match against the UAE to bring in Hasan Ali and Salman Mirza in place of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris — the latter duo having played against Afghanistan in the previous match.
Teams:
Pakistan: Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, Fakhar Zaman, Salman Agha (captain), Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf and Sufyan Moqim.
Afghanistan: Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Ibrahim Zadran, Sediqullah Atal, Darwish Rasooli, Karim Janat, Azmatullah Omarzai, Rashid Khan (captain), Mohammad Nabi, AM Ghazanfar, Noor Ahmad and Fazalhaq Farooqi.</p><small>2025-09-02 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/02224149f543b9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939202/at-least-5-dead-29-injured-in-blast-at-bnp-rally-in-quettas-shahwani-stadium' target='_blank'><strong>At least 5 dead, 29 injured in blast at BNP rally in Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium</strong></a><br><p>At least five people were killed and 29 were injured in a blast at a rally of the Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium on Tuesday night.
A statement from the Balochistan Health Department said the blast occurred at a rally of the BNP-M and listed five dead and 29 injured in the incident. It said the injured were brought to the Quetta Civil Hospital for treatment and were provided first aid before being admitted to the trauma centre for further medical attention. Quetta Civil Hospital spokesperson Dr Waseem Baig also confirmed the same toll.
In a media talk at the hospital, Advocate Sajid Tareen, acting president of the BNP-M, said 13 party workers were killed in the blast and several were injured, adding that the attack occurred in the parking lot after a party rally to observe the death anniversary of party founder Attaullah Mengal.
He had earlier posted a picture on X of the crowd gathered for the rally.
 






Tareen said the party already had apprehensions of such an incident and had contacted the district administration in advance for security. He added that former MPA Ahmed Nawaz and party leader Musa Baloch were among the injured.
A statement from the Balochistan Home Department said rescue teams had reached the scene and the injured were being taken to the hospital for treatment, adding that security forces had cordoned off the area and begun collecting evidence.
It said the government ordered a high-level investigation into the incident and appealed to the public not to heed rumours and to cooperate with institutions.
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the incident and termed it a “cowardly act of enemies of humanity”.
He said that “malicious elements” were “playing with the blood of innocent citizens”, vowing that the “evil intentions of terrorists” would be thwarted at all costs.
“Instructions have been given to provide the best medical facilities to the injured. Hospital administration and medical staff should remain alert, there should be no negligence in the treatment of the injured,” he said.
Saying that the investigation committee had been ordered to submit its report soon, the chief minister said those involved in the incident would be brought to justice and security agencies had been instructed to immediately apprehend the perpetrators.
“Protection of people’s lives and property is the first responsibility of the government. Malicious elements will not be allowed to succeed in their designs against the peace. The federal and provincial governments will work together to ensure the protection of people’s lives and property.”
 






Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar reached Civil Hospital on the chief minister’s instructions and was personally overseeing all medical relief activities.
 






He said that an emergency was imposed in all hospitals after the blast and all doctors and medical staff had been called for duty immediately.
Kakar further said that the regional blood centre was functional and emergency measures were underway to ensure the supply of blood, adding that the best medical facilities were being provided to the injured and operation theatres and ICUs in all hospitals were on alert, along with ambulance services and paramedical staff.
 






The minister expressed solidarity with the injured and assured all possible support to their families.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the blast.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the blast and extended his condolences to the injured.
“The terrorists and their facilitators of Fitna-al-Hindustan are targeting innocent people to create instability through a nefarious conspiracy. With the support of the nation, we will crush the sinister designs of Indian-sponsored terrorists,” he said.
 






In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticised the state over the incident, terming it a case of “incompetence and negligence”.
 






Opposition coalition Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan strongly condemned the attack and termed it the “worst form of cowardice”.
“We express grief and anger over the martyrdom of political workers. The federal and provincial governments have failed badly in protecting the lives and property of the people.
“The enforcement of the Constitution and law has ended in the country, and every citizen feels insecure. We are assessing the situation and will soon present a detailed stance of the alliance before the public,” the alliance said.
 






Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Pakistan (MWM) central chairman Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas Jafri said the incident was not only an attack on a democratic political party and its leadership but also a “direct assault on Pakistan’s constitutional and democratic framework”.
“I strongly demand from the federal and provincial governments and law enforcement agencies that the perpetrators of this attack be immediately arrested and brought to a deterrent end, and that the protection of the lives and property of political leaders and workers across the country be ensured,” he said.
 






Sardar Akhtar Mengal and other participants of a BNP-M protest sit-in had survived a suicide attack near the Lakpass area of Mastung district in March.
Officials had said the suicide bomber had detonated the explosives strapped to his body away from the sit-in site after security guards intercepted him, preventing him from reaching the stage where the BNP-M leaders were present.
“Sardar Akhtar Mengal, party workers and supporters remained unharmed in the attack,” police had confirmed, adding that no casualties were reported. However, Mengal claimed that at least four party members were injured in the blast.</p><small>2025-09-02 19:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621638-at-least-five-killed-29-wounded-as-explosion-rocks-quettas-sariab-road' target='_blank'><strong>Suspected suicide attack in Quetta leaves 13 dead, dozens injured</strong></a><br><p>

The halting of supply from the two Gulf exporters means Nayara, majority-owned by Russian entities including oil major Rosneft, relied entirely on Russia for its crude oil imports in August, according to sources and LSEG shipping data.
Nayara typically receives around two million barrels of Iraqi crude and 1m barrels of Saudi crude each month, but did not receive shipments from either of the two suppliers during August, shipping data from Kpler and LSEG showed.
SOMO and Nayara did not respond to requests for comment. Saudi Aramco declined to comment.
Two of the sources said that the sanctions had created payment problems for Nayara’s purchases from SOMO, without providing further details.
The most recent cargo of Basra crude from SOMO was discharged for Nayara by the Kalliopi, a very large crude carrier (VLCC), at Vadinar port on July 29, according to Kpler and LSEG data as well as data obtained from industry sources.
The private refiner received 1m barrels of Arab Light carried by the VLCC Georgios co-loaded with a similar quantity of Basrah heavy on July 18, its last Saudi delivery, according to LSEG data.
Nayara is receiving direct supplies from Rosneft, an official from the Russian Embassy in New Delhi said last month.
The private company is operating its 400,000 barrel-per-day refinery at Vadinar in western India at about 70-80 per cent capacity due to difficulties in selling its products resulting from the sanctions, sources have said.
Nayara Energy, which controls about 8pc of India’s 5.2m barrel-per-day refining capacity, has been struggling to transport fuel since the EU sanctions, relying on so-called dark fleet vessels after other shippers backed out, according to shipping reports and LSEG data.
The company’s CEO resigned in July. Last week, Nayara announced the appointment of a senior executive from Azerbaijan’s national oil company SOCAR as its chief executive.</p><small>2025-09-02 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621628-six-security-personnel-martyred-five-terrorists-killed-in-bannu-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Six security personnel martyred, five terrorists killed in Bannu attack</strong></a><br><p>

A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) issued tonight said: “During early hours of September 2, 2025, in a cowardly terrorist attack, khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khwarij targeted FC Headquarters in Bannu district.
“The Indian sponsored kharjis attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response by own troops. In their desperation, the kharjis rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the perimeter wall. The suicide blast resulted in the partial collapse of the perimeter wall and damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, inflicting injuries to three innocent civilians.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The ISPR added that in a display of “unwavering courage and professional excellence”, troops engaged the terrorists with precision and eliminated all five of them. The ISPR said six soldiers belonging to the FC and Pakistan Army were martyred in the intense exchange of fire after “putting up a heroic fight”.
The ISPR said the clearance operation in the area would continue and the perpetrators of the “heinous and cowardly act” would be brought to justice.
“The security forces of Pakistan in step with nation remain steadfast in their resolve to eradicate Indian sponsored terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further strengthen our unwavering commitment of safeguarding our nation at all costs,” it concluded.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu.
Bannu Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan earlier told Dawn.com that five policemen were injured during the operation that was led by Bannu District Police Officer Saleem Abbas inside the FC lines.
Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed said during a media briefing that police, army and FC personnel swiftly responded to the attack and killed four within an hour of the attack and later the fifth was also eliminated.
The IG said a clearance and search operation was carried out at the site. The operation’s conclusion was later confirmed by RPO Khan.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the TTP ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
Last month, police, alongside security forces in Hoveed and Wazirabad areas of Bannu, arrested “14 terrorist facilitators“ and destroyed their hideouts.
On August 3, a police constable was martyred in a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in Bannu, where an exchange of fire also left three terrorists dead and three policemen injured.
In July, ter­rorists used a quadcopter to attack a police station in Miryan, Bannu, making it the fifth such attack at the installation in a month.
According to data released by the Islamabad-based think tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), the country witnessed an alarming spike in militant violence in August this year, registering a 74 per cent increase in militant attacks compared to July, becoming the “deadliest month in over a decade“.</p><small>2025-09-02 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621606-cm-gandapur-says-mistrust-between-establishment-imran-khan-persists' target='_blank'><strong>CM Gandapur says mistrust between establishment, Imran Khan persists</strong></a><br><p>

A press release from the PMD said the 5.4-magnitude earthquake occurred at 5:30pm in southeastern Afghanistan at a depth of 22 kilometres with tremors felt all the way in Peshawar, Mansehra, Islamabad, Abbottabad and Swat.
Meanwhile, the US Geological Survey reported it as a 5.2-magnitude earthquake 34 kilometres northeast of Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province.
The epicentre of the tremor was close to where a magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit late Sunday night, devastating remote areas in mountainous provinces near the border with Pakistan.
The “quake was felt in the same areas which were affected in Kunar [province] in the first earthquake”, Ehsanullah Ehsan, the disaster management spokesman in the hard-hit province, told AFP.
“These aftershocks are constant, but they have not caused any casualties yet.”
The number of victims from Sunday’s earthquake has mounted steadily, with 1,411 people dead and 3,124 injured in Kunar alone, chief Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said today, making it one of the deadliest to hit the country in decades.
Another dozen people were killed and hundreds were injured in neighbouring Nangarhar province.
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, with dwindling aid since the Taliban seized power in 2021, undermining its ability to respond to disasters.
The devastation could affect “hundreds of thousands”, said United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan Indrika Ratwatte.
The PMD earlier reported three more minor quakes in the day: a magnitude 4 in southeastern Afghanistan at 2:50pm at a depth of 97km, a magnitude 5.4 in China’s Xinjiang at 12:59pm at a depth of 10km and a magnitude 4.4 in southeastern Afghanistan at 12:25pm at a depth of 20km.
Later in the day, the PMD reported another earthquake of magnitude 3 with the epicentre 24km northeast of Pattan at a depth of 46km at 7:10pm.</p><small>2025-09-02 16:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/02205034a0b6570.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939196/plea-for-help-after-landslide-wipes-out-sudan-village-kills-1000' target='_blank'><strong>Plea for help after landslide wipes out Sudan village, kills 1,000</strong></a><br><p>An armed group that controls part of western Sudan appealed on Tuesday for foreign help in recovering bodies and rescuing residents from torrential rain, after it said at least 1,000 people were killed when a landslide buried a mountain village.
Only one person survived the destruction of the village of Tarseen in the mountainous Jebel Marra area of the Darfur region, said the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army (SLM/A).
SLM/A, which has long controlled and governed an autonomous portion of Jebel Marra, appealed to the United Nations and international aid agencies to help collect the bodies of victims, including men, women and children.
“Tarseen, famed for its citrus production, has now been completely levelled to the ground,” the group said in a statement. Continuing rains have made travel in the region difficult and could impede any rescue or aid efforts.
“Nearby villagers are overwhelmed with fear that a similar fate might befall them if the … torrential rainfall persists, which underscores the urgent need for a comprehensive evacuation plan and provision of emergency shelter,” the group’s leader, Abdelwahid Mohamed Nur, said in a separate appeal.
A statement by the UN’s resident coordinator put the death toll at between 300 and 1,000, citing local reports.
Nine bodies were recovered by volunteers, said Abdelhafiz Ali from the Jebel Marra Emergency Room, who noted that the village had hosted hundreds of people displaced by fighting.
 
 

The SLM/A has remained neutral in the battle between the main enemies in Sudan’s civil war, the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The two foes are fighting over control of al-Fashir, the capital of North Darfur state, which is under siege from the RSF and has suffered famine.
Residents of al-Fashir and nearby areas have sought shelter in Jebel Marra, though food, shelter, and medical supplies are insufficient and hundreds of thousands have been exposed to the rains. Tawila, where most have arrived, is in the throes of a cholera outbreak, as are other parts of Darfur.
The two-year civil war has left more than half of Sudan’s population facing crisis levels of hunger and driven millions from their homes, leaving them especially exposed to the country’s damaging annual floods.
Sudan’s army-controlled government expressed its condolences and willingness to assist.
The prime minister of a newly-installed RSF-controlled rival government, Mohamed Hassan al-Taishi, said he would be coordinating with the SLM/A on the delivery of aid supplies to the area.
Pope Leo sent his condolences and said he was praying for those affected, according to a Vatican statement.</p><small>2025-09-02 15:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0220343496e35b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939194/govt-announces-public-holiday-on-saturday-for-eid-miladun-nabi' target='_blank'><strong>Govt announces public holiday on Saturday for Eid Miladun Nabi</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Tuesday announced a public holiday for September 6 on account of Eid-i-Miladun Nabi.

In recent years, Russia and Pakistan have engaged in strengthening bilateral ties with each other. In July, Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk said Islamabad and Moscow were “natural allies”. On June 3, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in a meeting with PM’s aide Syed Tariq Fatemi, reaffirmed Russia’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan, following a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed last September on multi-sector collaboration.
The meeting between the two leaders took place in Beijing today amid their visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of States (CHS) summit a day ago.
Addressing the Russian president, PM Shehbaz said: “Relations between the two countries have improved in recent years due to your personal commitment and interest.”
He expressed the resolve that Pakistan was also keen to strengthen the bilateral relations further, adding that they were moving in the right direction.
The premier added that after their meeting in Astana last year, both countries witnessed a flurry of delegation visits at the higher level, adding they also signed protocols to promote the agriculture, iron, steel, energy and transport sectors.
The prime minister also underlined the significance of the trade corridor connecting Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan, noting that this initiative would boost regional connectivity and prosperity.
Expressing his satisfaction, he said both sides were keenly committed to building their relations.
The prime minister also expressed gratitude to the Russian president for supporting Pakistan, which was viewed as “a balancing act in the region”.
 






He said Pakistan respected Russia’s ties with India and wanted to establish very strong relations of its own, which would be “supplementary and complementary”.
PM Shehbaz expressed that these beneficial ties would add to the progress and prosperity of the region and assured President Putin of working closely in this context, as he had found him to be a “dynamic leader”.
Responding to Putin’s invitation to attend the SCO Heads of Government Summit in November, the premier replied that he was looking forward to it.
Meanwhile, President Putin said, “Pakistan has always been a traditional partner and remains as such in Asia, and we cherish these ties,” adding that both sides had agreed to intensify their bilateral relations.
The president noted that their bilateral trade needed to be enhanced and stressed taking steps to address the issue.
He also expressed his grief and extended his condolences to the people and the government of Pakistan on the losses suffered from catastrophes and natural disasters, including the recent flooding.
 






President Putin expressed optimism that Pakistan would overcome such challenges under the current leadership.
He also opined that the two countries kept cooperating at the inter-parliamentary levels, adding, “Pakistan is a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and both countries are keeping contacts within the framework of the United Nations, which is an important platform.”
Prior to their meeting, the prime minister appreciated Putin’s leadership for making sincere efforts to promote bilateral relations with Pakistan.
He observed that after their meeting in Astana during last year’s SCO-CHS summit, they had agreed to work closely to bolster the bilateral cooperation.
PM Shehbaz expressed confidence that together, both countries would make further efforts to promote bilateral ties and cooperation, particularly in commerce and trade.
He added that Pakistan-Russia bilateral trade witnessed a spike as Islamabad imported oil from Moscow last year that led to an increase in the trade volume.
PM, Tajik president express satisfaction with ongoing bilateral cooperation
Separately, PM Shehbaz met Tajikistan’s president and both leaders expressed their satisfaction with the ongoing cooperation between their countries in all areas of mutual interest.
The two leaders agreed to enhance collaboration in diverse fields, including trade and investment, connectivity, energy, regional security, culture, and people-to-people exchanges.
 






Both also reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations rooted in shared cultural, historical, and religious ties.
They further shared perspectives on regional and global issues of common concern.</p><small>2025-09-02 15:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/021921128898631.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939179/ppp-pti-leaders-take-exception-to-kp-cm-gandapurs-personal-support-for-kalabagh-dam' target='_blank'><strong>PPP, PTI leaders take exception to KP CM Gandapur’s ‘personal’ support for Kalabagh Dam</strong></a><br><p>PPP and PTI leaders took exception on Tuesday to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur conditionally backing the construction of Kalabagh Dam, pointing out that three provincial assemblies had adopted resolutions opposing the project in the past.
Gandapur said a day earlier that projects like the construction of Kalabagh Dam were necessary for the “sake of the future generation”, but also added that prior to such initiatives, reservations of all stakeholders, including provinces, should be addressed. Doubling down on his comments, today, he said that the very important national project was being stopped because of politics.
“Not building the Kalabagh Dam is unfair to the country and to our children’s future,” he said. Gandapur explained that the dam would be good for not just Punjab, but also for Sindh and KP. He called for all parties to talk together and find a solution.
Reacting to his remarks, PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro said that Kalabagh Dam’s construction was not just an issue for the PPP and that the Sindh, KP and Balochistan assemblies had passed resolutions against it in the past.
“This is not just about the PPP, but the entire province. Maybe Ali Amin sahib is unaware of this history or maybe he was not [active] in politics back then,” he added. Khuhro said Sindhis considered the waters of the Indus their lifeblood and any mention of Kalabagh elicited negation.
He said CM Gandapur should be questioned why the PTI government did not fast-track and complete the Bhasha dam and other such projects
PTI leader Asad Qaiser also downplayed Gandapur’s support as his “personal opinion” and not the party’s policy in a post on X.
“We do not believe that there is any need for Kalabagh Dam at this time. At this time, smaller dams can also be built … I think that it is not good to unnecessarily stir up controversial issues.”
 






The Awami National Party (ANP) and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) also rejected Gandapur’s remarks.
ANP chief Aimal Wali Khan stated that the Kalabagh Dam was not a solution to recurring floods in the country.
 






JUI-F KP spokesperson Abdul Jalil Jan termed the project a “dead horse” and questioned CM Gandapur about his earlier claim of constructing 350 dams.
Meanwhile, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan welcomed CM Gandapur’s proposal, emphasising that Kalabagh, along with other new dams, should be built with the consensus and consultation of all provinces.
He asserted that all four provincial assemblies and chief ministers must jointly find a solution to this pressing national issue.
Appreciating Gandapur’s support for the Kalabagh Dam, he noted that the construction of new dams was vital to safeguard against future water shortages and natural disasters as well as floods.
 






He stated that new dams would help to save trillions of rupees worth of water from going to waste. “Floods are no longer the issue of a single province; it has become a challenge for the entire country,” he added.
The minister highlighted that Pakistan as a whole was facing the adverse impacts of climate change, while the recent torrential rains in Gilgit-Baltistan, KP and Punjab had caused massive loss of lives and property.
He stressed that the immediate construction of small dams in all four provinces had become unavoidable and must be pursued on an urgent basis.
The minister further said that the construction of small dams required a collective national effort and a comprehensive policy framework at the national level, as fragmented approaches could not resolve such critical national challenges.

A triple gold medalist at the Paris 2024 Olympics in the Women’s 200m, 4x100m and 4x400m, Thomas has dealt with an Achilles injury since May. It exacerbated in July, NBC Sports reported.
“I understand that it will be disappointing for some track fans to hear this news, but I’ve finally come to the realisation that it’s OK to be human and take care of myself,” she said in a statement, NBC Sports quoted her as saying.
“As an athlete, you always want to keep grinding, but sometimes you simply can’t outwork an injury,” the 28-year-old said.

“Sometimes it’s about patience and making the right decision for the long term.

“All the best to my Team USA teammates fighting for medals in Tokyo.”
The world championships run from Sept 13-21.

At least 1,411 people have died, 3,124 have been injured and over 5,400 houses have been destroyed, Taliban administration spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said.
 






More people are feared trapped under rubble, said the Afghan Red Crescent Society, a humanitarian group working in the region. The United Nations coordinator in Afghanistan said the toll was likely to rise.
A magnitude 5.2 earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan later today, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). The epicentre of the quake was 34 kilometres northeast of Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province, according to the USGS.
Afghanistan is prone to deadly earthquakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.
The earthquake, with a magnitude of 6.0, struck around midnight local time on Sunday, at a shallow depth of 10km, with the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangarhar being the worst hit.
Rescue operations were carried out in four badly hit villages in Kunar on Monday and efforts will now be focused on reaching more remote mountain areas, said Ehsanullah Ehsan, the provincial head of disaster management.
“We cannot accurately predict how many bodies might still be trapped under the rubble,” said Ehsan. “Our effort is to complete these operations as soon as possible and to begin distributing aid to the affected families.”
Emergency “operations continued throughout the night”, Ehsan separately told AFP.
He said there were “still injured people left in the distant villages” in need of evacuation to hospitals.
Meanwhile, villagers joined the rescue efforts, using their bare hands to clear debris from mud and stone homes built into steep valleys.
Obaidullah Stoman, 26, who travelled to the village of Wadir to search for a friend, was overwhelmed by the level of destruction.
“I’m searching here, but I didn’t see him. It was very difficult for me to see the conditions here,” he told AFP. “There is only rubble left.”
The dead, including children, were wrapped in white shrouds by villagers who prayed over their bodies before burying them.
Some of the hardest-hit villages remain inaccessible due to blocked roads, the United Nations migration agency told AFP.
Mountainous terrain and inclement weather have hindered rescuers from reaching remote areas along the border with Pakistan, where the quake flattened hundreds of mud-and-brick homes.
Access for vehicles along narrow mountain roads was the main obstacle, said Ehsan, adding machinery was being brought in to clear roads of debris.
On Tuesday, a line of ambulances was on the damaged mountain road trying to reach Kunar villages, as helicopters flew in, bringing aid supplies and taking the injured to hospitals, according to a Reuters witness.
Some of those injured have been transferred to hospitals in Kabul and the adjacent province of Nangarhar, said Ehsan.
Thousands of children were at risk, the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef) warned on Tuesday.
Unicef said it was sending medicines, warm clothing, tents and tarpaulins for shelter, and hygiene items such as soap, detergent, towels, sanitary pads, and water buckets.
Taliban soldiers were deployed in the area, providing help and security.
Rescue teams and authorities were trying to dispose of animal carcasses quickly so as to minimise the risk of contamination to water resources, a UN official said on Monday.
“Damaged roads, ongoing aftershocks, and remote locations of many villages severely impede the delivery of aid,” the World Health Organisation said, adding that over 12,000 people had been affected by the quake.
“The pre-earthquake fragility of the health system means local capacity is overwhelmed, creating total dependence on external actors,” it said.
Food and tents were desperately needed, said Safiullah Noorzai from Aseel, a humanitarian tech platform with networks around Afghanistan. With their houses in ruins, many people were living in the open amid a fear of aftershocks, Noorzai added.
Aid cuts and promises of assistance
After decades of conflict, Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world, facing a protracted humanitarian crisis and the influx of millions of Afghans forced back to the country by neighbours Pakistan and Iran in recent years.
Since the Taliban seized power in 2021, foreign aid to the country has been slashed, undermining the already impoverished nation’s ability to respond to disasters.
The United States was the largest aid donor until early 2025, when all but a sliver of funds were cancelled after President Donald Trump took office.
In June, the United Nations said it was drastically scaling back its global humanitarian aid plans due to the “deepest funding cuts ever”.
On Monday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a statement the organisation was working with authorities to “swiftly assess needs, provide emergency assistance and stand ready to mobilise additional support”, and announced an initial $5 million.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also expressed deep condolences to the families who lost their loved ones in the earthquake.
Meanwhile, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government decided to immediately dispatch a consignment of essential medicines to earthquake-stricken reg­ions of Afghanistan, with Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announcing that the provincial government was fully prepared to deploy medical staff.
Today, adviser to KP CM on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif further assured that the provincial government “will extend full support to the affected Afghan families, emphasising solidarity in this hour of hardship.”
“We stand shoulder to shoulder with our Afghan brothers during this difficult time and assure them of all possible assistance,” state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported on Tuesday.
The report quoted him as saying that “hospitals across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are open and ready to treat injured Afghan victims of the earthquake. Relief teams, rescue workers, medicines, tents, and food supplies are prepared for immediate dispatch to the affected areas.”
 
 

Earlier, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also held a phone call with his Afghan counterpart Amir Khan Muttaqi and assured him of Pakistan’s “readiness to extend all possible support”.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), Dar held a phone call with Muttaqi on Monday “to convey condolences on the tragic loss of lives, with thousands injured in last night’s earthquake in Afghanistan.”
 






Meanwhile, Britain has allocated 1 million pounds to support the efforts of the UN and the International Red Cross in delivering critical healthcare and emergency supplies to Afghanistan.
India delivered 1,000 tents and was moving 15 tonnes of food supplies to Kunar, with more relief materials to be sent on Tuesday.
Other nations such as China, the United Arab Emirates, the European Union and Iran have also pledged help, but aid is yet to arrive.
Deadly earthquakes
Afghanistan is frequently hit by earthquakes, especially in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near the junction of the Eurasia and India tectonic plates.
In October 2023, western Herat province was devastated by a 6.3-magnitude earthquake, which killed more than 1,500 people and damaged or destroyed more than 63,000 homes.
A 5.9-magnitude quake struck the eastern province of Paktika in June 2022, killing more than 1,000 people and leaving tens of thousands homeless.</p><small>2025-09-02 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621565-russia-wants-to-strengthen-ties-with-pakistan-putin-tells-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>'Russia wants to strengthen ties with Pakistan', Putin tells PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

The company’s shares were indicated 1.9 per cent lower in premarket activity in Zurich following Freixe’s sudden dismissal on Monday following a board meeting to discuss the findings of an investigation into the relationship.
The downturn is another blow for Nestle investors who have been frustrated with three years of share price declines between 2022 and 2024 and no signs of a recovery this year.
Freixe will be replaced by Philipp Navratil, a rising star at the maker of Nescafe coffee and KitKat chocolate bars, which has been struggling with sales volumes since the pandemic.
The dismissal of Freixe follows an investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate, which breached Nestle’s code of business conduct, Nestle said late on Monday.
Freixe, who spent 39 years with Nestle, will receive no exit package following his departure, the company told Reuters.
The Nestle veteran’s abrupt removal comes a year after predecessor Mark Schneider was axed, and two and a half months after longstanding chair Paul Bulcke announced he would step down in 2026 in one of the most turbulent periods in the company’s 159-year history.
In a short statement, Bulcke thanked Freixe for his years of service at Nestle, but said the dismissal was a “necessary decision”.
Management stability sought
Nestle’s shares, a bedrock of the Swiss stock exchange, have lost almost a third of their value over the past five years, underperforming European peers.
Freixe’s appointment failed to halt the slide, with the company’s shares shedding 17pc during his leadership, disappointing investors.
In July, Nestle launched a review of its underperforming vitamins business that could lead to the divestment of some brands after first-half sales volumes missed expectations.
“The market did not particularly like Freixe, and the restructuring goals were also put on the back burner,” said Maurizio Porfiri, chief investment officer at trading firm Maverix.
“Another fresh start is needed, and it is time for more stability to return to the management at this global corporation,” he told Reuters.
Freixe’s dismissal was featured on the front page of Swiss newspapers, with Neue Zuercher Zeitung noting that Nestle had lost its “legendary stability” where CEOs stayed for years before eventually becoming chairmen.
The latest change is likely to leave questions unanswered about Nestle’s mid-term direction and “keep a lid on the equity story until we hear more about Mr Navratil’s plan,” JP Morgan analysts said in a research note.
The bank’s analysts said the news of Freixe’s ouster was unlikely to reassure investors because it was the second time in a year that the company had appointed a new boss without carrying out a thorough search for a replacement.
The note also expressed concern that incoming CEO Navratil looked as though he would be “boxed in” by Freixe’s turnaround strategy for now at a time when the market remained unconvinced.
Jon Cox, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, said he expected Nestle’s shares to come under pressure due to the latest upheaval at Nestle’s HQ in Vevey, next to Lake Geneva.
“This is not the Nestle way to do things, to have two CEO replacements in just over a year,” Cox said. “Hopefully this will get them back on the straight and narrow.”</p><small>2025-09-02 08:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/021208021c52345.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939128/pakistan-china-vow-to-deepen-all-weather-strategic-cooperative-partnership' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China vow to deepen ‘all-weather strategic cooperative’ partnership</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and China on Tuesday reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening their “iron-clad and all-weather strategic cooperative partnership” through enhanced cooperation, reflecting their unique bilateral relationship.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with ties ranging across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence, and infrastructure.
The bilateral ties and cooperation were discussed in a meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Council of Heads of State (CHS) summit, held from August 31 to September 1.
“During the meeting, the two leaders agreed that the relationship between their countries was unique and unparalleled, which should be reflected in their enhanced bilateral cooperation,” the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) said.
“Both leaders also discussed important regional and global developments and agreed to continue close cooperation between Pakistan and China in this regard.”
 






PM Shehbaz reaffirmed the desire to continue working closely with China for the successful implementation of the next phase of the upgraded China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), with its five new corridors, the report said.
“He congratulated President Xi on the success of the SCO Council of Heads of State Summit in Tianjin and offered his felicitations on the 80th anniversary of the World Anti-Fascist War.”
 
 

Lauding President Xi Jinping for his visionary and transformational leadership that has inspired China’s remaining journey towards modernisation and progress, the prime minister said that Pakistan took great pride in Beijing’s achievements and would always stand ready to work together with China in this great journey.
He also appreciated China’s unflinching support for Pakistan’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and socio-economic development, as well as the significance of CPEC as a flagship project of President Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to help both countries build an even stronger Pakistan-China community with a shared future.
The prime minister hailed President Xi’s strong commitment to strengthening multilateralism and said Pakistan fully supported China’s landmark steps in this regard, including the Global Governance Initiative, Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative, as well as Global Civilisation Initiative.
“These initiatives would serve the collective global good and contribute to regional as well as global peace, stability and development,” the PM was quoted as saying in the report.
President Xi said that China would continue to assist Pakistan in all fields of economic growth and development, especially as the two countries were now ushering in the second Phase of CPEC, which would focus on Pakistan’s most important economic sectors.
PM Shehbaz renewed his “most cordial” invitation to President Xi to undertake an official visit to Pakistan next year, when both countries would celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Pakistan-China diplomatic ties.</p><small>2025-09-02 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621516-man-arrested-for-attempted-abduction-of-social-media-influencer-samiya-hijab' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested for attempted abduction of social media influencer Samiya Hijab</strong></a><br><p>
