Kuldeep returned figures of 3-18 and along with fellow spinner Axar Patel kept Pakistan down to 127-9 in a key Group ‘A’ T20 clash in Dubai.
India lost two wickets after a fiery 31 off 13 balls from opener Abhishek Sharma, but skipper Suryakumar Yadav hit an unbeaten 47 to achieve the target with 25 balls to spare.
Suryakumar, who turned 35 on Sunday, put on 56 runs with left-hander Tilak Varma, who hit 31 before being bowled by Saim Ayub.
 
 

The captain stood firm and hit the winning six as Indian fans celebrated at a stadium, which had a lot of empty seats, and the players from both teams went off without handshakes.
India resisted calls to boycott the match between the nations, who have not played in any bilateral series since deadly attacks in Mumbai in 2008 were blamed on Pakistan militants.
The hostilities in May this year left more than 70 people dead in missile, drone and artillery exchanges, before a ceasefire.
The conflict was triggered by an April 22 attack on civilians in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir that New Delhi accused Pakistan of backing — a charge Islamabad denies.
Suryakumar, in the presentation, said India took the match against Pakistan as “just another game” and dedicated the win to the Indian army.
“We stand with the victims of the families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity,” Suryakumar said. “We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.”
 






After hitting the winning shot, Suryakumar and his team-mates refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts. The captain said in the post-match press conference that the move was in alignment “with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) and the government”.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha did not show up in the post-match ceremony as a reaction to the Indian team’s move.
“It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Pakistan coach Mike Hesson said later.
SHAHEEN’S CAMEO IN VAIN
Abhishek came out roaring as he hit Pakistan pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi for a four and a six and, despite the fall of Shubman Gill in the next over, kept up the charge.
Swashbuckling Abhishek cracked four boundaries and two sixes before he mistimed another attempt for a maximum to be caught at long-off off spinner Saim.
India’s bowlers set up the dominant win as Axar, who took 2-18, and Kuldeep combined to rattle the opposition batting, which suffered from a lack of partnerships.
Hardik Pandya struck in the first over to dismiss opener Saim for a golden duck and fellow quick Jasprit Bumrah sent back wicket-keeper-batsman Mohammad Haris for three.
 
 

Sahibzada Farhan, who top-scored with 40, attempted to rebuild the innings along with Fakhar Zaman, who made 17, in a partnership of 39.
Axar broke the stand with his left-arm spin as he got Fakhar caught out and in his next over had skipper Salman out for three.
Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep came into the attack and struck twice on successive balls to pack off Hasan Nawaz (5) and Mohammad Nawaz (0) as Pakistan slipped to 64-6 inside 13 overs.
Kuldeep was named player of the match for the second successive time after he starred in India’s opening win over hosts United Arab Emirates.
Wickets kept tumbling, but number nine Afridi took on the opposition attack with four sixes in his unbeaten 33 off 16 balls to push the total past 120 and play out Pakistan’s full 20 overs.
India, with two wins from two, are nearly through to the next Super Fours stage of the tournament with their final group match against Oman on Friday.
Pakistan play UAE next on Wednesday and despite the defeat to India are expected to make the next stage.

• Promises farmers emergency support packages for next sowing season
• Says loss assessment surveys likely to be completed within 15 days
TOBA TEK SINGH: As Pakistan grapples with devastating floods, a senior Inte­rnational Monetary Fund official confirmed an upcoming mission will evaluate if the country’s financial and emergency plans are adequate to handle the crisis, shortly after the finance minister signalled talks with the lender for relief.
An IMF team is expected in Pakistan by the end of the month for a review mission, Federal Minister for Finance and Reve­nue Muhammad Aur­angzeb said on Sunday, stressing that discussing flood-related financial needs with the IMF was a necessary step.
“There is nothing wrong with asking the IMF about the relief, because we are in the fund programme,” Mr Aurangzeb said during a visit to flood-affected areas in Kamalia. “The IMF responded very responsibly and the prime minister announced the relief.”
The minister’s comments came as damage assessments from the catastrophic floods, which have killed at least 972 people, are underway across the nation.
 


“Damage assessments are currently under way, and these are very important — not only for our talks with the IMF but also with other financial organisations,” he said.
While Pakistan plans a comprehensive discussion with the IMF, Aurangzeb noted that the cabinet has decided to first utilise the nation’s own resources to provide immediate aid to the millions affected.
“We have resources available for now. When the IMF team arrives, we will hold a comprehensive discussion with them about what we need at this stage, especially concerning rehabilitation and reconstruction,” he added.
 
 

Key relief measures already announced include a decision that flood victims will not be charged for their August electricity bills, with adjustments made for those who have already paid. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also set a 100-day deadline for the rehabilitation of all flood victims.
The government is also closely monitoring the economic fallout, including inflation. “Since international oil prices are falling, imported inflation is not very high,” Mr Aurangzeb said.
However, he acknowledged a discrepancy between farmers’ reports of severe crop damage and initial government assessments.
He assured that the government would not permit hoarding or price gouging and was considering special packages for farmers to help them sow their next crops on time, adding that farmers and the general public would be facilitated in every possible way so they could resume their livelihoods at the earliest.
He said the government was considering to announce special packages for farmers to enable them to sow their next crops on time.
He pointed out that both a climate emergency and an agriculture emergency had already been declared to protect agricultural productivity and ensure timely rehabilitation of the flood victims
During his visit, Mr Aurangzeb distributed aid to affected families and emphasised the need for better future planning to avoid similar devastation.
“We must learn lessons from past floods and improve planning to avoid such devastation in the future,” he remarked, adding that the location of housing schemes needed serious reconsideration.
IMF to review fiscal agility
Confirming the upcoming mission under the country’s existing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, the IMF’s resident representative in Pakistan, Mahir Binici, said the review would be critical in assessing the country’s financial capacity to respond to the disaster.
“The mission will assess whether the FY26 budget, its spending allocations and emergency provisions remain sufficiently agile to address the spending needs necessitated by the floods,” Binici said in a statement on Saturday.
In May, the IMF’s board approved a $1.4 billion loan to help Pakistan strengthen its economic resilience to climate vulnerabilities, but the disbursement of funds is contingent on the successful completion of reviews under the EFF.

The president expressed this resolve during a visit to top Chinese aerospace and defence conglomerate, the state-owned Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), which manufactures the J-10C aircraft.
According to the President’s Secr­etariat, he is the first foreign head of state to visit the facility. He was accompanied by his children, PPP Chairman Bilawal and MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari.
During the visit, President Zar­dari met with the company’s engineers and scientists and pra­ised the Chinese-made aircraft’s capabilities, which he said were amply demonstrated during the recent Maarka-i-Haq and Opera­tion Bun­yanum Marsoos against India.
 







Head of state gets a peek at stealth fighter production; praises J-10C, JF-17 for strengthening aerial defences

The president lauded AVIC as a “symbol of China’s technological advancement and of the end­uring strategic partnership bet­ween Pakistan and China”.
He was briefed on AVIC’s capabilities, including the J-10, the co-production of the JF-17 Thun­der with Pakistan, the J-20 stea­l­th fifth-generation fighter airc­r­aft, and unmanned aerial vehicles.
Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, Paki­stan’s Ambassador to China Khalil Hashmi and China’s Amb­assador to Pakistan Jiang Zaid­ong also accompanied the president.
High-speed train
President Zardari also travelled from Chengdu to Mianyang via high-speed train.
 
 

During the half-hour journey, he praised China’s achievements in developing sustainable transport, calling its pollution-free electric propulsion and earthquake early warning technologies “a marvel of railway engineering”.
He noted that such innovations offered “valuable lessons for other countries including Pak­istan”. Officials highlighted that China operates the world’s largest high-speed rail network of over 45,000 kilometres, carrying more than 2 billion passengers annually on trains that run up to 350km per hour.
With trains running at up to 350km/h, the network links almost all major Chinese cities. China has built a standardised, dedicated passenger system that became a model of modern connectivity, they said.

He expressed these views on the eve of an emergency summit of Arab and Islamic leaders organised by Qatar after Israel carried out an unprecedented air strike on Hamas peace negotiators in Doha.
“The time has come for the international community to stop using double standards and to punish Israel for all the crimes it has committed, and Israel needs to know that the ongoing war of extermination that our brotherly Palestinian people is being subjected to, and whose aim is to expel them from their land, will not work,” the prime minister said.
According to Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman, Majed al-Ansari, Monday’s meeting of Arab and Islamic leaders will consider “a draft resolution on the Israeli attack on the State of Qatar”.

Israeli actions won’t stop Doha from Gaza mediation, says Qatari PM

The Arab-Islamic summit — held under the umbrella of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation — is expected to draw heads of state and governments, along with senior officials, from across the Muslim world. PM Shehbaz Sharif is also set to attend the high-level moot, while Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar actively participated in a meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday to craft the draft resolution in Doha.
The summit, cosponsored by Pakistan, has been convened in the wake of Israel’s strikes on Doha and the escalating developments in Palestine — following Israeli attempts to occupy Gaza, expand settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and forcibly displace the Palestinians, according to the Foreign Office of Pakistan.
Diplomats said more than 50 OIC member states are expected to attend the Doha summit, where leaders may also weigh in on pushing Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York.
Among the leaders attending will be Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was also expected to attend, Turkish media reported.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas arrived in Doha on Sunday, on the eve of the summit.
 
 

It remained to be seen whether Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, would attend, though he visited Qatar earlier this week in a show of neighbourly solidarity.
Monday’s summit in Doha is expected to rally support for Qatar in the wake of last week’s Israeli attack targeting Hamas in the Gulf state.
A draft of the resolution that will be considered by heads of state condemned Israel’s attack as a destabilising escalation and said the states opposed Israel’s “plans to impose a new reality in the region”.
However, the draft, which was seen by Reuters, did not mention any diplomatic or economic moves against Israel. The resolution may change before the leaders meet in Doha on Monday.
The attack has prompted US-allied Gulf Arab states to close ranks, adding to strains in ties between the UAE and Israel, which normalised relations in 2020.
The gathering is a message that “Qatar is not alone … and that Arab and Islamic states stand by it,” Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit told the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.

The air hangs heavy and a hot afternoon sun beats down on the flood-ravaged neighbourhood littered with heavy boulders left by torrents.
Most of the village is in ruins, and mangled steel bars, broken roofs, and columns are peering out from under the rubble.
On Aug 15, flash floods tore through this hamlet, leaving a trail of destruction and trauma in their aftermath.

Still reeling from trauma of calamitous flooding, meagre compensation hampers Beshonai residents’ recovery

Still reeling from the shock, the villagers are even unsure about the number of their dead: everyone gives a figure. Some say it’s 84, while others believe 74 people died. However, many claim that several of their community members remain missing.
Besides physical destruction, the villagers also speak of mental scars inflicted by the deluge.
Jalal Ahmed, a student at the University of Buner, said they are paralysed by fear. “A large number of women from the area are still living with their relatives and refusing to come back, fearing more floods,” he added.
Hussain Shah, who lost his brother in the flood, told Dawn that when their local stream flooded on Aug 31, everyone in the village rushed to the nearby mountain in panic. “Women clutching their babies ran crying hysterically,” he says.
According to Dr Afsar Ali, a medical officer with the NGO Muslim Hands, at least 10pc of 200 patients examined by them suffer from anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). “After counseling, we refer them to the district headquarters hospital for psychological rehabilitation,” Dr Ali told Dawn.
Dr Siraj Kamal agrees with his colleague, saying the situation will get worse once the shock wears off. “Now people are too busy with reconstruction, taking care of the injured and running after aid, and when all this is over, they will be hit harder by the depression and trauma,” Dr Kamal added.
But reconstruction also has its challenges. The villagers are particularly concerned about the compensation package offered by the government. Sahibullah, a resident, calls for their relocation to some other location, fearing the villager “could never rise from its ashes”.
Traders and shopkeepers aren’t happy as well, as they try to make repairs in the Pir Baba Bazaar, one of the busiest commercial centres in the district. A thick pall of dust follows every passing car, as traders install new shutters and shelves in their shops. Al Khidmat Foundation, the welfare arm of the Jamaat Islami, has painted the exterior of the damaged shop in its own blue colour.
Syed Wahid, president of Pir Baba Bazaar traders, estimates damages to the tune of Rs30 million, which the government’s aid package hardly addressed.
“Government is treating those who lost million and those who loses are in thousands with the same yardstick,” he complained. “How, those who have lost millions, are going to get their life on track with merely Rs500,000,” he questioned, while criticising the government for its unilateral approach.
“I am president of this bazaar where over 800 shops have been affected due to the floods and the authorities did not even bother to ask me for a meeting,” he rues. For Mr Wahid, interest-free loans by the government could help restart their businesses.
 
 

Khairullah Khan, a pharmacy shop owner, lost medicines worth Rs1.3 million besides damages to his shop. “Four shutters alone cost me Rs50,000 and I have to install shelves and do other repairs,” he told Dawn.
As the government response remains sluggish, Mufti Fazal Ghafoor the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl has made efforts to fill the vacuum.
A large number of locals were seen heading to a hujra at some distance from the Pir Baba Bazaar, where Mufti Ghafoor distributed sewing machines, photocopiers, and equipment for welders, electricians and carpenters besides other material.
The project, being executed through donations, also includes the construction of several two-room houses for orphans and widows as well as distribution of vans and rickshaws for those who have lost their means of livelihoods.
“We are working on construction of 40 houses and have laid foundation of 12 so far in various parts of the district,” Mufti Ghafoor told Dawn. He said that in some instances, they have also arranged land for construction of these houses. He said that they have also distributed walkie-talkies among locals of Beshonai for easy communication, as cellphone coverage was still patchy in the area.
Following the evening prayers, a large number of party’s activists gathered at a service station in the bazaar, which they had repurposed as a relief coordination centre, reporting about their activities.Mufti Ghafoor said that with the help of 5000 seminary students, they cleaned the Pir Baba Bazaar and residential areas in the surrounding neighbourhoods.
“There are many roads still not fully restored… I would have cleared them by now if I had the machinery,” Mufti Ghafoor added.

Nonetheless, the stadium wasn’t full, and India’s fans did outnumber their rivals. Much to the chagrin of warmongers, the crowd enjoyed a friendly rivalry and the players just got on with doing their jobs. Business as usual also meant that Pakistan were thoroughly outplayed by India — as is the custom in international tournaments.
In fairness, the pitch had settled down by the time India batted. However, their all-round supremacy was clear, much to the annoyance of Pakistan supporters.
Pakistan simply scored too few runs, and India chased them down with ease and ominous competence. Even two early wickets for Saim Ayub failed to create any doubt about the outcome.

The most consistent performers in Pakistan’s innings seemed to be the umpires, given their readiness to deliver verdicts in India’s favour

Much will be made of how India’s batsman hammered boundaries and judiciously rotated the strike. It will be argued that Pakistan are transitioning into the modern version of T20 cricket that requires an unrelenting assault on bowlers.
The problem for Pakistan is that you can’t re-engineer a batting line-up under the bright lights of international cricket. You need to prepare the players best suited for that strategy outside international cricket, before unleashing them as the finished article.
After winning the toss and deciding to bat, Pakistan were going at under five runs an over at the halfway mark. They had lost Ayub from the first legitimate ball of the innings. Half their side, all their top order except Farhan, was gone for 64 runs. The sixth fell on the next delivery.
 
 

The most consistent performers in Pakistan’s innings, although it did not affect the result, seemed to be the umpires, given their readiness to deliver verdicts in India’s favour.
The only win was that a batsman wearing green hit Jasprit Bumrah for six.
Pakistan had previously faced 399 balls from the world’s foremost pace bowler without clearing the ropes. On his 400th, Sahibzada Farhan, the lone standard-bearer of his country’s batting hopes, smote Bumrah back over his head with an effortlessness that made you wonder how it had never happened before. Let’s celebrate that because there wasn’t much else to enjoy about Pakistan’s batting performance.
The only other bright spark in the gloom was the sight of an Afridi hitting sixes with abandon in the desert’s fields of green. Shaheen took a leaf from his father-in-law’s playbook by choosing beast mode for this innings, and it suits him, too. Better for him to thrash a few sixes than to muck around looking inept.
Batting woes
Batting depth in international cricket should be a statement of domination; for Pakistan it is an admission of failure. For experienced watchers of Pakistan’s batting misadventures, two things are clear. Firstly, this current crop lacks quality. Secondly, they are inexperienced in their general experience of batting and the situations that a batsman might be exposed to. The few experienced cricketers in the lineup, including the captain Salman Agha, failed to adjust to the conditions and the match situation.
This latest version of Pakistan’s batting order is meant to be an attacking one. Yet, the number of dot balls remains worryingly high. Pakistan have swapped an experienced group of batsmen majoring in dot balls for a mob of inexperienced batsmen majoring in dot balls. This situation won’t be fixed until Pakistan cricket understands that the Pakistan Super League does not a batsman make.
Even Pakistan fans have stopped pretending that their team are serious contenders. However, the inexperience in India’s batting line-up offered a little reason for optimism. But India’s newer batsmen always look perfectly ready for the challenges of international cricket — witness Abhishek Sharma’s dismantling of Afridi at the start of India’s innings.
On a pitch that helped bowlers of all persuasion, India’s attack showed its greater experience and ability. The spinners, in particular, ran riot. Kuldeep Yadav is capable of troubling any batsman, but the truth is that only cricket fans of Gen X and older will remember an age when Pakistan’s top order was able to dominate spin bowling.
All of this confirms once again that the developmental and structural failures in Pakistan cricket are not in good health. And, those failures are most obviously manifested in what the country’s batsmen produce.
The Pakistan Cricket Board, the hangers-on who rely on Pakistan cricket for their own benefit, and many fans are in absolute denial on this point.
Pakistan’s batsmen, as a group, cannot play spin. Heroics in the Pakistan Super League are merely an illusion of competence.
The tournament is far from over for Pakistan but, given what we have seen, it’s hard to imagine this particular Pakistan team, at this stage of its development, winning the Asia Cup.
The events in this cricket match will not linger in the memory, however, it will be remembered as the match that restored cricketing relations between India and Pakistan soon after the countries competed in the air with jet fighters. Pakistan might argue that they won the one that mattered.

Mass protests, overwhelmingly popul­a­t­ed by young people, have led to the ouster of the government, after initial retaliation by security for­­ces left behind a large number of casualties. At the time of writing, protest leaders were negotiating with the military for a transitionary governm­ent. It will take some time before things settle down.
The form of these events resembles what happened in Bangladesh in July last year. Without equating the essence entirely, there too events involved mass street protest by young people, retaliatory violence, regime ouster, and an eventual settlement through a transitionary government. Sri Lanka experienced something similar in the year earlier.
As Khurram Husain detailed on these pages last week, there are some common material triggers of these mass uprisings/ protests. High inflation and unemployment, macroeconomic tumult, visible corruption of ruling party elites and pervasive resentment towards the political status quo. These are at play alongside institutional and ideational factors, such as stifling of dissent, repression of political opposition, state heavy-handedness, and as seen in the case of Nepal, internet and social media shutdowns.
As with the Bangladesh and Sri Lanka episodes earlier, the protests in Nepal have generated significant discussion in Pakistan. There are two types of views that I think are worth addressing in a bit of detail.

To see conspiracy at play in every episode of mass political rebellion is poor analysis.

The first, by no means unique to Pakistan, is that these represent ‘colour revolutions’ of some form, ie, regime change operations but with mass mobilisation providing a veneer of legitimacy. In contexts where nominally left-populist governments are dismissed (as is the case in Nepal), sections of the global left tend to see imperial motivations and interventions at work.
The fact that foreign powers, regional and global, play a part in encouraging and shaping political dissent towards out-of-favour regimes is not tinfoil hat thinking. There is a long history of precisely this form of intervention, which can take the shape of selective financial/ material support to protesting organisations and patronage provided to certain types of leaders.
But to see conspiracy at play in every episode of mass political rebellion is poor analysis. Given the range of material factors, people’s frustration with the status quo is tangible and real. In the absence of functioning institutions that allow this frustration to be resolved through the political process, street protests become a common way to showcase dissent. Younger people are also politicised in a variety of ways, many of which are connected to their digital life-worlds. What they see, consume and share on social media has profound political implications that many are yet to fully comprehend and grapple with.
Additionally, there are always underlying organised elements that sustain protests. Student unions in Bangladesh, smaller leftist parties in Sri Lanka, and now youth groups in Nepal are all reflective of the same phenomenon. A particular event — a valiant individual act of protest, such as in Tunisia, or the banning of YouTube, as in Nepal — can act as the trigger for political outpouring, but organised power is what sustains these movements.
 
 

A second point worth discussing here is the common tendency in Pakistan to lament the absence of similar mass mobilisation in our own context and to find some fundamental or essential reason — usually cowardice or laziness — as an explanation for why these are not replicated here.
To this, there are two responses. The first, and the most obvious one, is that Pakistan has a fairly rich history of political protest against authoritarian rule and state excess of various forms. The major events, such as anti-dictatorship struggles, should be familiar to all. Street protests, overwhelmingly by young people, were essential in undermining the power of authoritarian governments, even if their eventual removal came through other mechanisms (such as an in-house change in the military). In more recent years, parties, such as the PTI, have led mobilisation on political issues, including on election rigging and unjust incarceration of activists.
Alongside these episodes, there are plenty of other smaller protest movements — from ethno-nationalist ones in the Baloch and Pakhtun peri­pheries, to struggles over land rights among tenant farmers in central Punjab, to water and ecological struggles being waged both in the northern areas and along the coastal belt. These too represent traditions of resistance to the status quo.
Where Pakistan does differ from a number of the other cases is the absence of mass protest on pu­­­rely economic issues. Loadshedding and electricity prices led to localised protest episodes in 2011 and 2012, but nothing that achieved sustained national scale. Similarly, high inflation and unemployment of the past few years hasn’t elicited street mobilisation, even though it shaped electo­r­­al outcomes and impacted government legitimacy.
One explanation for this could be that the perceived cost of protest is too high, given the strength of the security apparatus. But there is another element at play too: the military and civilian establishment remains fully entrenched, not just in the state, but also in society through political tactics, social networks and kinship connections. These networks create a large pool of connections and beneficiaries, which extends well beyond a very narrow ruling elite (otherwise a common problem in many authoritarian societies).
 
 

Such shared connections are replicated at nearly every tier of society, not just among the elites. Every household — rich or poor — exists as part of a patronage chain that ultimately culminates in access to the state.
If we accept this context, then it’s fair to assume that the incentives to upend the system through mass rebellion are a lot more limited, compared to societies where large sections of the population are completely locked out of state power.  Perhaps this, rather than accusations of laziness or cowardice, is a better explanation of why politics takes the shape it does in Pakistan.

This despite stepped up diplomatic engagement by Pakistan this year to reset ties with Kabul after heightened tensions and a prolonged hiatus in high-level diplomatic exchanges in the previous year.
Two days ago, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly called on Kabul to choose between Pakistan and the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan). He said cross-border attacks from Afghanistan were unacceptable. This was the latest manifestation of renewed tensions.
Earlier, officials of the two countries had exchanged hot words. In late August, the Afghan foreign ministry accused Pakistan of launching air strikes on two of its eastern provinces, Nangarhar and Khost, calling this a “provocative act” that claimed the lives of several civilians. Afghan Defence Minister Mohammed Yaqoob said Pakistan was shifting blame for militant attacks on its soil to Afghanistan to hide weaknesses of its own security apparatus. Pakistan’s foreign ministry spokesman dismissed Yaqoob’s assertions, describing them as an effort to mask the seriousness of the situation.
Attacks in Pakistan by the TTP rose sharply after the Taliban returned to power four years ago. The Taliban takeover enabled the outlawed militant group to reorganise and escalate cross-border attacks, posing a serious threat to Pakistan’s security. Countless rounds of talks on the TTP between Pakistani officials and Taliban authorities yielded little. Pakistan repeatedly urged Kabul to disarm the TTP, detain its leaders and rein in its violent activities. Taliban leaders offered assurances and pledged to act, often asking for time. But they did nothing. Despite increasingly tough public warnings by Pakistan to Kabul, the Taliban took no meaningful action.
 
 

Heightened militant activity from across the border, a spike in terrorist attacks and rising casualties among security personnel then compelled Pakistan to launch kinetic strikes targeting TTP figures and hideouts in Afghanistan.
In April 2024, in a departure from the past, Islamabad publicly acknowledged Pakistan had carried out air strikes against militant sanctuaries in Afghanistan. This met with a toughly worded response from Kabul and rise in border tensions. Islamabad, however, warned such actions would continue unless the Taliban changed course. In December 2024, Pakistani fighter jets carried out unannounced air strikes against TTP hideouts at four locations in Paktika province. This followed an audacious TTP attack on a border post in Makin which left 16 security personnel dead. This forced Pakistan to retaliate.

Taliban’s lack of response to Pakistan’s security concerns is a source of mounting frustration for Islamabad.

At the same time, Pakistan tightened restrictions on transit trade, which involved a ban on many items that could be imported by Afghanistan via Pakistan, as well as imposed limits on bilateral trade. This was aimed at raising the costs for the Taliban for their non-compliance with Islamabad’s TTP demands. Pakistan also began expelling undocumented Afghans residing in Pakistan and deporting those holding Afghan citizen cards that were issued by Pakistani authorities a few years ago. Around 1.2 million Afghan refugees have been repatriated so far in what many see as an accelerated process.
This year, however, Pakistan switched course from this purely coercive approach to a carrot-and-stick policy. It hoped that resumption of diplomatic engagement with several confidence-building trips to Kabul by Special Representative Mohammed Sadiq and a visit by the Afghan Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi to Islamabad in April would encourage Taliban leaders to respond to its TTP concerns.
The high point of the revived diplomatic engagement was the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Kabul in late April 2025. Much progress was made during that visit on bilateral and transit trade issues, including the Preferential Trade Agreement and the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement, with the Pakistani side acceding to many Taliban requests in this regard. The Taliban promised to take steps to effectively ‘contain’ the TTP. But these again turned out to be empty promises.
Pakistan nonetheless continued with its diplomatic strategy of engaging the Taliban authorities. It invited Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Mutaqqi for talks to Islamabad and made preparations for his visit just ahead of the trilateral meeting in August between Pakistan, China and Afghanistan in Kabul. Muttaqi’s visit did not take place because of the UN travel ban on him. Pakistan had sought but was unable to get a waiver from the Security Council’s sanctions committee to allow him to travel. In July, Dar visited Kabul to sign a framework agreement between Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan for the feasibility of a railway project aimed at promoting regional connectivity,
Dar went again to Kabul for the trilateral meeting — his third visit in five months. Despite positive public statements issued by all sides, the meeting proved to be inconclusive on the most important issue on its agenda: security. Both the Pakistani and Chinese delegations were disappointed by the outcome. No joint statement was issued because the Taliban refused to name TTP and ETIM (East Turkestan Islamic Movement) in it. This was in contrast to the previous trilateral held in Pakistan in 2023, when these terrorist organisations were named in the joint declaration that was issued. This suggested that the Taliban, far from committing to take concrete steps against these militant organisations, were backtracking.
While Pakistan’s frustration with the Taliban is probably at a record high in the face of continuing cross-border terror attacks from Afghanistan there is no suggestion of any disengagement by Islamabad with Kabul. This could risk a breakdown in relations which does not serve Pakistan’s interests. It will also not persuade the Taliban to change course given what happened the last time this approach was tried.
This leaves Pakistan with a policy dilemma. It has already conveyed to Kabul that cross-border attacks that produce heavy casualties will invite a kinetic Pakistani response. It is possible that ‘hot pursuit’ by Pakistan might involve air strikes deeper into Afghan territory; so far, they have been limited to border areas. The complex relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan will continue to face challenges even as Islamabad mulls over what else it can do beyond the carrot-and-stick policy it is following.

The latest State Bank debt bulletin shows that the government had added Rs9.3tr in new debt during the last fiscal year, with the total public debt stock surging to a record Rs80.5tr at the end of June. It means that the government had added a staggering Rs25.4bn every single day.
This relentless rise not only breaches the limits set by the Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act, but also undermines the budget as interest payments consume most of the latter.
 
 

The SBP data underlines that public debt has increased both in absolute terms and relative to the size of the economy, a combination that would require more borrowings for making debt payments.
The resurgent debt-to-GDP ratio increasing to 70.2pc from 67.8pc in one year should be of concern to policymakers due to multiple reasons. One, the rise in debt underscores the reversal of a trend that saw the ratio dropping significantly to 67.8pc in FY24 from 75.2pc the previous year, in spite of stringent fiscal consolidation under the IMF funding programme. Two, it points to a widening gap between tax and other resources and growing expenditures as reflected in the fiscal deficit despite austerity measures. Three, it indicates the state’s eroding capacity to finance development and future growth.
Given this backdrop of rising debt and shrinking fiscal space, many now doubt the government’s ability to assist the millions affected by the recent floods. With little international support, we face the grim prospect of displaced citizens bearing their losses alone — another reminder that its fiscal profligacy has brought the state to a stage where it is unable to protect Pakistanis when disaster strikes. Indeed, the present floods may not rival the devastation caused by the 2002 deluge. Yet the economic toll of the current disaster is still severe and widespread enough to shave off growth, fan inflation and further strain public finances.
Cotton, rice, sugarcane, vegetables and livestock fodder have been wiped out in parts of Punjab and other areas in the country hit by floods. Tens of thousands of households are displaced, while damaged roads, bridges, irrigation channels and housing will require billions for rehabilitation — resources Pakistan does not have.
 
 

The country finds itself constrained by a tight budget and heavy debt obligations, leaving it yet again dependent on external aid. Unfortunately, the muted global response to this year’s devastation suggests that even if help arrives, it will be too little to meet the need.
For the government, the options are bleak: diverting scarce domestic resources — which would require the IMF’s consent — or borrowing more to add to an already high debt mountain. In both scenarios, the flood victims risk becoming collateral damage of successive governments’ fiscal mismanagement.

The 21-year-old Seville crossed the finish line in a 9.77 personal best ahead of Thompson in 9.82 and the USA’s reigning champion Noah Lyles, who won bronze with a season’s best 9.89.
“It was a good run because these two actually pushed me to run a personal best,” Seville, the youngest 100m champion, said at the post-race press conference. He became the third Jamaican sprinter to win this title.
“To come out here and run a 9.77 is something amazing, and in Japan is where I made my debut; to get a medal is something great for me.”
 






Jefferson-Wooden came in as the world lead and left Tokyo with a gold medal, proving her superiority to round off a season unbeaten. Tina Clayton continued Jamaica’s podium finish just minutes earlier when she blasted a 10.76 personal best while Olympic champion Julien Alfred took bronze with 10.84.
“This year has been nothing short of a dream. I’ve been working so hard for this moment to come out here and focus on my execution,” 24-year-old Jefferson-Wooden said. “To put on the perfect race at the perfect time, I’m just so happy and grateful.”
 






For Clayton, a medal wasn’t even a goal coming into her first senior championships.
“The goal was to execute,” Clayton told the press conference with a shyness poles apart from the confidence that won her a medal an hour earlier. “Silver was not in my thoughts, but God did so, and I’m grateful.”
The American women led the country’s gold medal rush as Olympic Champions Tara Davis-Woodhall and Valarie Allman were crowned world champions for the first time in the long jump and discus throw, respectively.
 






The men’s 10,000m also saw a rewriting of the script with two European medalists in a sport long dominated by the Ethiopians and Ugandan Joshua Cheptegi. France’s Jimmy Gressier eclipsed Ethiopia’s Yomif Keljecha in the last 10 metres to win gold, with Sweden’s Andreas Almgren taking bronze.
World championship silver medalist Jakob Ingebrigsten suffered a shock exit in the men’s 1500m heats due to an injury.
“I gave it my best today. It just wasn’t enough. I knew this could happen,” the 24-year-old Norwegian said in a post on Instagram soon after. “But giving up isn’t in my nature. I will be back.”
Much like his run at the Paris Olympics, Ingebrigsten could bounce back in the 5,000m — the heats scheduled on his 25th birthday — and win a third world title in the event.
 






Uruguay won their first medal of the competition and Julia Paternain didn’t even realise it when she crossed the finish line in third.
Earlier in the night in the women’s 100m semi-finals,there was a false start by reigning champion Sha’Carri Richardson. Veteran sprint queen Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce was a shock entrant into the final after a second place finish in her semis.
Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon cruised into the women’s 1500m final (4:00.34) ahead of countrywoman Dorcus Ewoi in 4:00.65. Ethiopia’s Freweyni Hailu fell in the first 100m of her semi-final but caught up to the pack in a flash and qualified for the final in 4:01.03.

• 48 Palestinians killed
• Netanyahu calls Rubio  ‘extraordinary friend’, says his visit shows strength of US-Israel ties
JERUSALEM: Israeli forces destroyed at least 30 more residential buildings in Gaza City and displaced thousands of residents, according to Palestinian officials, as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in the region on Sunday to hold talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
At least 48 more Palestinians were killed since Sunday dawn as artillery shelling and gunfire by Israeli forces reported in Gaza City, as well as shelling from boats, according to Al Jazeera.
Israel has already announced its plan to seize the city, where more than a million Palestinians have been sheltering, and has intensified attacks on what it has called Hamas’ last bastion.
The Israeli army issued a new forced evacuation order for another building in Gaza City.
The military “will attack the building soon” due to the presence of Hamas infrastructure inside or adjacent to it, read a statement on X.
Israeli soldiers have been levelling one by one high-rise buildings in the northern city since starting a major offensive to occupy it.
Two more Palestinians died of malnutrition and starvation in Gaza in the past 24 hours, the territory’s health ministry said on Sunday, raising deaths from such causes to at least 422 people, including 145 children.
Israel blocked all food from entering Gaza for many months, before allowing some aid into the enclave despite the famine declared by the United Nations, which warned that far more was needed.
Thousands of people are estimated to have left Gaza City, but mostly the Palestinians are reluctant to leave, saying there is not enough space or safety in the south, where Israel had asked them to go after designating it as a ‘humanitarian zone’. People say that Israel has repeatedly hit so-called humanitarian zones.
In a post on X, UNRWA says Israel’s bombardment of Gaza City has been “constant” on Sunday, adding that there is “no safe place” in the besieged enclave.
Many Palestinians say they cannot afford to leave while others have pinned hopes on the Doha summit to pressure Israel to scrap its planned offensive.
 






14,000 buildings, shelters destroyed in a month
Hamas said that Israeli forces have destroyed at least 1,600 residential buildings and 13,000 tents since August 11.
In one of the latest strikes, Israeli forces stormed al-Khader Girls Elementary School in Jerusalem’s Old City and assaulted the mayor, Ahmad Salah, the head of the Parents Council, and a municipality member, Issam Naim, the Wafa news agency reports.
 
 

Mahmoud Abdullah, head of the Parents Council at al-Khader Unified Schools, said Israeli forces stormed the elementary school as students were leaving.
Abdullah added that soldiers beat him, Salah and Naim with rifle butts and their hands, causing bruises. He added that the troops threatened to “close all seven schools”.
The school complex has been repeatedly attacked by Israeli forces who target both female and male students.
At least 64,871 people have been killed and 164,610 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza while millions have been displaced since October 2023.

The countries agreed on the draft framework, which is part of the peace deal, a source familiar with the matter said, adding that the draft was now being discussed by stakeholders, including the private sector, multilateral banks, and some donor agencies of other countries.
Congo and Rwanda will likely meet in early October to finalise the framework, the source added. It would be signed by heads of state at a later date. The 17-page framework comes after the countries signed a peace deal in Washington in June at talks held by US President Donald Trump’s administration.
The deal aims to end fighting that has killed thousands and attract billions of dollars of Western investment to a region rich in tantalum, gold, cobalt, copper, and lithium. The draft builds on an outline for the framework reached in August and sets out implementation measures and coordination mechanisms.
The August outline called for cooperation on energy, infrastructure, mineral supply chains, national parks, and public health.
According to the draft, the parties would pledge to work with the United States and other international partners to develop additional regulatory initiatives and reforms “necessary to de-risk private sector investment in a cost-effective manner,” to reduce illicit trade and increase transparency.
They would also adopt outside transparency mechanisms, including committing to implement guidance from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, among others.
 
 

The draft framework calls for third-party inspections of mine sites and working with private sector partners to develop cross-border special economic zones, according to the draft.
The framework also sets out coordination mechanisms, including timelines for an annual high-level summit on regional economic integration and meetings of a steering committee and technical working groups.
Kinshasa and Kigali, as part of the deal reached in Washington in June, had agreed to launch the regional economic integration framework within 90 days.

The demand came after a recent report by the independent news outlet Drop Site News claimed that the Comm­on­wealth Observer Group (COG) group had “buried their report” after finding the Feb 8 general elections to be riddled with problems.
Although the group’s report on Pakistan has yet to be officially released, media outlets claimed to have obtained leaked copies of the report.
In a statement issued on Sunday, the COG said it was aware that a version of its report on the 2024 Pakistan general elections was circulating online, adding that they did not comment on leaked documents as a matter of policy.

C’wealth says report shared with govt, ECP; will be released this month

“The government and the Election Commission of Pakis­tan have already received the report. The full report, as we had communicated earlier,  will be released later this month, along with a number of COG reports currently in the publication pipeline,” the statement said.
The COG also maintained that its work is “carried out free from any interference”.
While announcing its preliminary findings on Feb 10, 2024, the COG had said that its findings and recommendations would be submitted to the Commonwealth secretary general, before being shared with the Pakistani government, and shared publicly.
 
 

The mission’s report has faced an inordinate delay, as most observation missions compile their findings and publish them within days or weeks of their compilation.
According to an excerpt from the leaked copy — whose authenticity could not be independently verified by Dawn — the report stated that: “Despite the fact that early vote counts indicated a landslide victory for candidates aligned with… the banned PTI… saw their polling leads rapidly reversed…”
In a statement issued on Sunday, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the leaked report validated PTI’s longstanding reservations about widespread pre- and post-poll rigging.
Zulfi Bukhari, a former aide to ex-PM Imran Khan, also raised questions about why the report was never released.
“Tomorrow, I will be consulting legal counsel to initiate proceedings aimed at securing disclosure, both of the report itself in full and of the decision-making processes that led to its suppression,” he wrote on X.

• Report warns green channel clearances shrinking scope of pre-clearance controls
ISLAMABAD: The Faceless Customs Assessment (FCA) system, inaugurated by the prime minister last year in Karachi to combat corruption, has incurred a revenue loss of about Rs100 billion in three months.
This was revealed in a detailed analysis by the Pakistan Customs Audit — an internal arrangement of the Federal Board of Revenue — spanning December 16, 2024 to March 15, 2025.
“The scrutiny of 13,140 goods declarations (GDs) led to detection of several discrepancies in 2,530 GDs that raise serious concerns about quality of assessments, indicating revenue and compliance risks,” said the 161-page report, which did not cover 100pc operations.
Of the reviewed GDs, the audit looked into 18pc cleared through the green channel, 76pc through the red channel, and 6pc through the yellow channel, highlighting weaknesses of the system, inefficiency of the human resource, under/overinvoicing, as well as widespread trade-based money laundering.
In some cases, importers of solar panels imported shipments in 2023 and brought containers for clearance more than a year later, prima facie having advance knowledge of the launch of the faceless system.
The audit found duty/tax evasion of Rs5 billion in 1,524 GDs, alongside loss of statutory fines worth Rs2.43bn, besides clearance of restricted goods valued at Rs10.54bn in 1,006 GDs, in violation of intellectual property conditions.
Another potential revenue loss of statutory fines worth Rs30.364bn was reported due to non-framing of contravention cases — based solely on GDs involving duty/tax evasions of Rs1 million or more.
The audit also highlighted fiscal fraud involving cancellation of asse­ssed or finalised GDs (involving duty/tax evasions) and fraudulent clearances of solar panel containers on unauthorised tax numbers “involving trade-based money laundering concerns”.
The analysis revealed that by applying the lowest statutory fine slab of 20pc, under SRO 499(I)/2009, the total fine worth Rs53.549bn sho­uld have been imposed and collected.
“In contrast, only Rs3.480bn was actually imposed/collected…in the 308 cases where contraventions were framed.” Even if cases involving higher duty/tax evasions (worth Rs1 million or above) were considered, the potential revenue loss would still amount to Rs30.364bn.
Transactional audits
The Directorate General of Pak­istan Customs said that due to human resource and time constraints, the directorate primarily relied on transactional audits rather than undertaking entity-based scrutiny, which is more comprehensive in identifying revenue-sensitive factors.
 
 

Moreover, the directorate restr­icted its audit scope to those red, yellow and green channel transactions/GDs that involved payment of duty and taxes.
The massive misuse of the system could be gauged from the fact that a Rs10 million worth of used Toyota Land Cruiser was cleared for a valuation of about Rs17,635, revealing an attempt to significantly misdeclare import values.
“The case reflects a serious risk of Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML). By declaring such a nominal purchase amount, the importer appears to have circumvented financial scrutiny, potentially paying the true cost through unofficial or illicit channels as declared value of vehicle had to be paid through remittances originating from foreign countries.”
In case of failure to substantiate that the actual value of the vehicle was paid through foreign country sources, it can raise concerns with regard to funds transferred through illicit channels involving hawala/hundi — a common hallmark of TBML schemes.
Discrepancies
The discrepancies included misclassification of HS Code, misdeclaration of value/non-application of valuation rulings (VRs), violations of SROs involving inadmissible concessions/exemptions, short payment of sales tax on retail price etc.
During the post-clearance audit of cancelled GDs, a fiscal fraud phenomenon was detected where assessed/finalised GDs were cancelled and refiled to evade duty/taxes. The modus operandi were such that GDs were filed by misdeclaring descriptions, HS codes, values, etc.
During examination/assessment when adverse findings were reported involving evasion of duty/taxes, instead of making payments, the importers requested the cancellation of GDs which was allowed. After a gap of a few days/weeks, the same importer again filed GD with same misdeclarations, but this time GDs were assessed at lower duty/taxes in favour of the importers. In this manner, the importers managed to evade duty/taxes while also avoiding fines.
The audit also found glaring examples of using vague descriptions, which eve­n­t­ually culminated in lower value asse­ssments. In such cases, at post-clearance stages, it becomes very difficult to detect misdeclaration beca­use primary lapse lies with the dep­artment/assessing officer who asse­ssed goods at a lower value, thus shi­fting the burden of proof to the department to prove any misdeclaration.
It said 54 solar panel containers belonging to five bogus importers were manifested in the year 2023, but fraudulently cleared through 28 GDs between Dec 2024 and Feb 2025, under different/unauthorised NTNs and Customs User IDs, reflecting exploitation of the FBR’s Registration Module and Customs Computerised System.
Even worse, some of these importers were previously arrested in similar cases and reported themselves as petty employees drawing Rs30,000 in salary. “This forms part of the broader solar panel money laundering scam—already a high-profile case—reflecting a serious systemic lapse”.
The audit highlighted that the increasing quantum of green channel clearances—now covering nearly 60pc of imports and 85pc of exports—is gradually shrinking the scope of pre-clearance controls.
Additionally, limiting visibility of GD particulars under the FCA undermined pre-clearance assessment quality. The audit observed that modern customs administrations operated on the principle of “front-end facilitation with back-end control”, maintaining an optimal balance between the two is critical.
“In Pakistan Customs’ case, front-end facilitation without proportionate back-end oversight has created a structural lag in the taxation framework, escalating both revenue and compliance risks,” the audit said, adding that the green channel had itself turned into a risk area.

RAWALPINDI / LAHORE: The Pakis­tan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has forecast rain, wind and thunderstorms across the upper parts of the country from Sept 15 to 19, warning of possible flash floods, landslides and damage to weak structures.
Authorities have been asked to remain vigilant and make necessary arrangements.
The Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) also issued an alert for the 11th spell of monsoon rains from Sept 16 to 19 in the catchment areas of all major rivers in the province.
According to the Met Office, moist currents of moderate intensity from the Arabian Sea are penetrating the northern regions, while a westerly wave is likely to approach from the evening of Sept 15, persisting until Sept 19.
Under these conditions, rain with thunderstorms is expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Char­sadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak and Waziristan between Sept 16 and 19, with occasional gaps.
In Kashmir, scattered showers are forecast from the night of Sept 15 to 19, with heavy falls likely on Sept 16 and 18. Similar conditions are expected in Gilgit-Baltistan, including in Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche and Shigar, between Sept 16 and 19.
In Punjab and Islamabad, rain and thunderstorms are predicted in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal and Jhelum from Sept 16 to 19, with showers likely in Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazirabad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikh­upura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Sahiwal, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh and Faisalabad on Sept 18 and 19. Isolated heavy falls are also expected.
Sindh and most of Balochistan will remain largely dry, with partly cloudy skies in coastal areas.
The PMD warned that windstorms, hailstorms and lightning could damage weak structures such as Katcha houses, billboards, electric poles, vehicles and solar panels.
It also cautioned of landslides in vulnerable hilly areas of KP, GB, Murree, Galiyat and Kashmir.
Heavy rainfall may trigger a rise in local nullahs and streams in Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbo­ttabad, Charsadda, Nowshera, Swabi, Mardan, Murree, Galiyat, Islam­abad, Rawalpindi and Kashmir on Sept 18 and 19.
The department advised the public, travellers and tourists to avoid unnecessary exposure to vulnerable areas and stay updated on the latest weather advisories.
Flood threat in Sindh
With floodwaters moving downstream from Punjab, authorities in Sindh are on high alert as Guddu and Sukkur barrages brace for rising inflows. On Sunday, Guddu Barrage was passing a peak of 627,000 cusecs, with irrigation officials warning the figure could climb to between 650,000 and 700,000 cusecs in the coming days.
The Sindh Irrigation Department has identified vulnerable points on both banks of the Indus between Kashmore and Sukkur, particularly in the kutcha (riverine) areas of Ghotki, Shikarpur and Khairpur.
 
 

Officials say constant monitoring and reinforcement work is under way, though they remain cautiously optimistic that the flood peak will pass Sukkur without causing major damage.
Meanwhile, Sindh Senior Mini­ster Sharjeel Inam Memon has said so far over 163,000 people have been moved from riverine areas to safer location in view of the exp­ected flood.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, he said during the last 24 hours 5,269 people were evacuated from Katcha area.
He added that 252 people from riverine areas were shifted to relief camps, where a total of 469 people are currently staying.
Mr Memon said that 11,569 cattle were moved to safe areas during the last 24 hours, raising the total number of relocated cattle to 438,835.
He added that 51,308 cattle were provided with vaccines and treatment in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number treated to 1.2 million.
He said that the Sindh government has established 177 fixed and mobile health sites, where 6,596 patients were treated in the last 24 hours. So far, a total of 84,118 patients have received medical assistance, he added.
Motorway closure
Meanwhile, Motorway Police said that due to the possibility of damage to the Multan-Sukkur Motorway (M-5) as a result of floodwater near Jalalpur Pirwala, it has been closed to traffic.
“Northbound traffic is being redirected from Uch Sharif, Jhangra and Jalalpur Interchange,” Mot­orway Police spokesman Syed Imran Ahmad said in a statement. “Southbound traffic is being diverted from Shah Shams, Sher Shah and Shujaabad South to alternative routes.”
Mr Ahmed added that NHA personnel are placing sandbags and stones to block floodwater.
In Alipur tehsil of Muzaffargarh district, water was continuously flowing in its union council, Azmatpur, Mullanwali, Bazwala, Khangarh Doma, Sarki, Muradabad, Binda Ishaq, Mudwala, Lati Mari, Kundrala and Seetpur and submerged several villages.

Cotton zones hit
Moreover, for the first time in the country’s history, all major cotton zones in Pakistan have been affected by simultaneous rains and floods.
Though initial assessments suggest no significant damage to the crop nationwide, with the exception of severe losses in the Bahawalnagar district of Punjab, this week is critical for the country’s economy as a major flood surge from south Punjab enters Sindh, with continued rains in some Sindh districts set to determine the fate of cotton and other crops.
Ihsanul Haq, chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, said in a statement that Pakistan faces its biggest crisis due to Indian water aggression and unexpected rains. The full extent of crop damage, especially to cotton, will not be clear until the end of September.
He noted that the climate changes caused by the rains and floods have led to a minor virus attack on most cotton varieties in many cotton zones. He believes that a spray of urea fertiliser or boron could help mitigate this initial virus attack.
A high-level meeting on cotton rehabilitation, chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, was held last week. It was attended by four federal ministers and various stakeholders.
While different proposals were reviewed, it’s widely believed that cotton rehabilitation will be difficult without enforcing crop zoning laws, which include a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones.
Sugarcane cultivation in cotton zones is a major concern. According to Mr Haq, it leads to environmental pollution that not only reduces the quantity of the cotton crop but also negatively impacts its quality. This is evident in regions like Balochistan and areas of Sindh and Punjab bordering Cholistan, where sugarcane is not grown.
The cotton produced in these areas sells for at least Rs500 per maund more than regular cotton because of its longer, stronger fibres and higher oil content in the seeds.
Last week, cotton trading in Pakistan was limited, and prices remained stable at Rs15,500 to Rs16,500 per maund.
Flooding continues
Meanwhile, catastrophic flooding continues to ravage south Punjab as broken dykes along the Sutlej and Ravi rivers have submerged hundreds of villages, disrupted major transport routes and displaced millions.
The PDMA and local administrations were managing evacuations and relief efforts amid rising water levels due to broken dykes and controlled breaches.
The evacuation operation continued in Khanewal, Kabirwala, Pir Mahal, Multan, Jalalpur, Jhangra, Uch and Alipur tehsil in Muz­affargarh district.
In Khanewal, several more villages were submerged after a canal dyke of Chak 58 was broken on Saturday night, while the government could not seal the Mai Sufuran dyke at the Ravi River near Head Sidhnai, and the water was inundating villages in Pir Mahal, Khanewal and Kabirwala.
In Multan’s Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil, the administration carried out a breach at Gillani Road to divert the flood from entering the city two days ago and it submerged several villages of Uch Sharif.
The controlled breach was also not filled after two days, and water continuously passed through it, causing a flood in the Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts.
Jalalpur city also lost its road connection with the Lodhran district after all the roads were submerged after the Noraja Bhutta dyke was broken three days ago. The Sutlej River water changed its direction and submerged several villages near Jalalpur Pirwala city and also reached the motorway exchange.
Relief operations
Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said that 4.57 million people of 4,700 mouzas were affected due to floods in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers in the province.
Sharing details about Pakistani and Indian dams, Mr Javaid said that Mangla Dam was 93 per cent full, Tarbela 100pc, while the Indian Bhakra Dam at the Sutlej River was 88pc full, Pong Dam 94pc and Thein Dam 88pc.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia on Sunday visited a relief camp in Seetpur union council of Alipur tehsil in Muzaffargarh district.
He told the media that evacuations were continued in flooded areas of Alipur, Jalalpur Pirwala and Rahim Yar Khan.
He predicted that the flood situation would ease significantly over the next two days, with only the Chenab at Panjnad Headworks currently in an extremely high flood at 411,000 cusecs. The Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala was flowing at a medium flood level of 98,000 cusecs, while Head Sulemanki reported a low flood with a discharge of 78,000 cusecs.
Four children drown
Four children, including three siblings, drowned in a rainwater-filled pit in the suburban area of Killi Faiz Muhammad Charmai, Kohlu district, police said on Sunday.
According to police, the children were playing near the pit when they slipped in and were unable to get out. Despite efforts to rescue themselves, all four drowned.
Police and residents rushed to the site after the incident and retrieved the bodies, which were shifted to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Kohlu. All had died before reaching the hospital, officials confirmed.
The bodies were later handed over to the families after legal formalities. Residents said they had repeatedly warned the landowner to fill the deep pits, cautioning that they posed a danger to children. However, the owner allegedly continued excavating soil for sale, ignoring the warnings.

The match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to ‘boycott’ the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands, as is customary, at the toss and after the match.
Then, at the post-match ceremony, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav seemingly ‘politicised’ the victory by bringing up the Pahalgham terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, over which the two countries fought a four-day military conflict in May, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country.
“We stand with the victim’s families of the Pahalgam terror attack, and we express our solidarity, and we want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces,” the Indian skipper said.
Speaking at the post-match press conference, Yadav said: “Our government and the BCCI were aligned. We took a call and came here just to play the game and gave them (Pakistan) a proper reply.”
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha was not present at the post-match ceremony.
 






Pakistan’s white-ball head coach Mike Hesson explained that the reason the Pakistani captain was absent from the ceremony was because of the Indian team’s “disappointing” conduct at the end of the match.
“It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Hesson said.
 


The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed to Dawn.com that Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema, “registered a protest against the Indian team’s inappropriate behaviour.”
“Manager Cheema has also registered a formal protest against the match referee’s behaviour as well for requesting the captains not to shake hands during the toss,” the PCB said.
Earlier, it was a clinical performance by the Men in Blue after the Indian spinners ruled the roost in the first innings and Pakistan stumbled to 127-9 thanks to an excellent cameo by Shaheen Afridi down the order.
 
 

The pick of the bowlers for India was Kuldeep Yadav, who ended with figures of 3-19 as the Indian spinners never let the Pakistani batters settle.
He was ably supported by the left-arm spin of Patel and pacer Bumrah on a pitch that did not have any demons throughout the match.

Over 15 — Ind - 123-3
Yadav looking to finish things off quickly as he lifts Saim for four. Dube ends the over with a massive six and it looks likely Saim will finish as Pakistan’s most successful bowler with figures of 3-35 off four overs. India need five more to win.

Over 14 — Ind - 110-3
13.4: The Indian skipper Yadav cuts Nawaz for four in a statement of authority!
Frustration for Pakistan on the second ball as Yadav flashes, but the ball falls short of point and goes for four. The India skipper adds to the misery by cutting Nawaz for four past the same fielder two balls later. Pakistan seem to have no answer.

Mid-innings analysis by Umaid Wasim:
Pakistan need a miracle. India are coasting in the chase, there is no run-rate pressure, and Pakistan are having difficulty in exerting spells of sustained pressure. The Green Shirts need quick wickets if they are to have any chance.

Over 10 — Ind - 88-2
9.1: Verma launches Sufyan for six!

India is eating into Pakistan’s total. Required rate dips below five as the powerplay ends with Men in Blue at 61.

Over 4 — Ind - 42-2
3.4: Saim has struck again!
Just when Abhishek Sharma looked like becoming a thorn in Pakistan’s ambitions of getting wickets and stopping the run flow, Saim struck. It was a case of one too many for the left-handed. Having hit back-to-back fours off Saim, he went for another and was caught at long-off.
 


Tilak Verma now at the crease. Only eight runs off the over. Saim looks keen to turn it around for Pakistan with the ball.

Over 3 — Ind - 33-1
Sharma v Shaheen again, and the Indian opener gets a four first-ball, slashing a wider delivery, and before hitting a monstrous six two balls later.
 


Suryakumar Yadav makes a quiet start. He comes into this match with a patchy record against Pakistan.

Over 2 — Ind - 22-1
Saim Ayub is into the attack; let’s hope he can emulate what the Indian spinners did in the first innings.
1.6: Saim has struck with his carrom ball yet again!
Pakistan is attacking with spin from the get-go, with Saim bowling the second over. Shubman Gill hits him for consecutive fours, but it’s one too many as he is stumped off the last ball. Pakistan have the wicket they wanted!

Over 1 — Ind - 12-0
0.1: Newbie Abhishek Sharma welcomes Shaheen Afridi with a boundary off the very first ball of the over.
India get off to a flier. Sharma smashed the first ball back past Shaheen for four and deposited the second ball for six over long-off.

Mid-match summary by Abyan Amir: The Indian spinners ruled the roost as Pakistan stumbled past 120 thanks to an excellent cameo by Shaheen Afridi down the order.

He was ably supported by the left-arm spin of Patel and pacer Bumrah on a pitch that did not have any demons in the first innings.
The Green Shirts have something to defend on board, courtesy of four sixes by Shaheen to end the innings.
India will have to contend with Pakistan’s spin trio of Abrar, Sufyan and Nawaz
Will this be an Afridi cameo to remember, or will India gallop home easily? Only time will tell!

Pakistan have something to defend.
Over 19 — Pak - 110-8

Sufyan got back-to-back fours off Bumrah to start the over — the first a punch down the ground and the second an upper-cut. Bumrah got back by cleaning up his stumps on the last ball. Pakistan are nine runs away from 120.

Over 18 — Pak - 99-8
17.2: Shaheen smacks another six over long-off off Chakravarthy!
Pakistan suffered another blow when Faheem fell lbw two deliveries later. Shaheen keeps strike for the next over.

55 dot-balls in the Pakistan innings so far
With three overs to go, Pakistan risk falling short of even a run-a-ball total!

Five runs off the over as India keep things tight. Pakistan need to push on with just four overs left

Over 15 — Pak - 78-6
14.3 Calls of shot in the newsroom as Pakistan’s only hope at the moment, Sahibzada pulls Yadav for a single.
Faheem finished the over with a four, but runs continue to be hard to come by for Pakistan.

Sahibzada saw a lbw decision overturned on review and finished the over with a four.
 



Over 13 — Pak - 64-6
12.4: Hassan Nawaz departs cheaply!
12.5: Mohammad Nawaz is gone first ball!
India will probably feel they can bowl Pakistan out in quick time. Kuldeep has once again tormented Pakistan. Two wickets in two balls — first Hasan Nawaz caught and then Mohammad Nawaz lbw. Sahibzada has been in from the start and now has all-rounder Faheem Ashraf for support. They are Pakistan’s last recognised batting pair.

Over 12 — Pak - 62-4
Sahibzada broke the shackles and launched the first ball down the ground for six. But two dot balls followed before Pakistan got two more singles. Runs are coming slowly for Pakistan.
 



Over 11 — Pak - 54-4
Singles off the first four balls in Abhishek Sharma’s first over, another off the last ball.
50 up for Pakistan in the 11th over of the innings.

Mid-innings analysis: In the four overs after the powerplay, Pakistan have only got seven runs whilst losing two wickets.
If Fakhar’s departure wasn’t enough, Salman never got going and in an attempt to get quick runs, fell to Patel, who now has two wickets.
Pakistan have to hit out of the spin trap if they are to post a match-saving total. Up to Hasan Nawaz to provide the impetus.

Over 10 — Pak - 49-4
Patel back into the attack as Salman cuts him.
It gets worse for Pakistan. Skipper Salman is caught in the deep.
Salman tried to hit out of the pressure, and only succeeded in getting a top edge off Patel. Pakistan are struggling.

Over 9 — Pak - 47-3
8.2: Salman was adjudged lbw second ball off the over as Chakravarthy changed ends, but Pakistan breathed a huge sigh of relief when it was overturned on review.
Chakravarthy continued bowling a nagging line to Salman with just two runs coming off the over.
Over 8 — Pak - 45-3
7.4: Fakhar is gone!
Axar Patel was brought on into the attack and got the big wicket of Fakhar Zaman off the fourth ball he bowled. Fakhar tried to hit him out of the park, but could only find Tilak Verma running in from long-on.
The onus is now on captain Salman Ali Agha to stabilise the innings.

Over 7 — Pak - 43-2
Only two runs off the over as India’s left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav comes into the attack. Pakistan have to start accelerating.

Over 6 — Pak - 42-2

Over 5 — Pak - 34-2
India brings on their first spinner — Varun Chakravarthy
4.3: Fakhar slots Chakravarthy for four down the ground
 


India brought spin to the attack in the shape of Chakravarthy but Sahibzada and Fakhar seem to have now settled down. Fakhar hit him down the ground for four as Pakistan’s rebuild continues.

Over 4 — Pak - 26-2
3.3: Sahibzada smacks Bumrah over wide long-on for a six!
Pakistan’s first six of the innings comes in the 4th over. The early inning jitters are now gone.
 


Another good over with no losses as Sahibzada and Fakhar look to rebuild Pakistan’s innings. Bumrah bowled two good balls to open the over before Sahibzada smashed him for six over long-on. Those were the the only runs in the over but crucially, Pakistan have not lost another wicket.

Over 3 — Pak - 20-2
Pandya is pulled away for a single by Fakhar.
2.3: Pakistan get their first boundary courtesy a pull by Fakhar.
Good over for Pakistan. Two singles came off the first two balls before Fakhar pulled a short one from Pandya for four — Pakistan’s first boundary. Fakhar got another with a drive through the legside off the fifth ball while three runs came from wides.

Over 2 — Pak - 7-2
1.2: Haris gets a top edge and Bumrah strikes. Pandya catches, running in from fine leg.
Pakistan have got off to the worst possible start. India have their tails up. Haris was the standout in the side’s tournament-opener against Oman but now he departs.
 


1.4: It gets worse for Pakistan. Fakhar has been adjudged lbw. The left-hander immediately reviewed
Pakistan get a reprieve, the review shows ball pitching outside leg.
Bumrah bowls a splendid first over with some searing yorkers. Gets the dangerman Haris and also had Fakhar, only for it to be overturned on review.

Saim Ayub falls on the very first ball of the match.
Saim Ayub’s troubles with the bat continue. He was also out first ball against Oman.

Haris flashes and misses on the next ball. He blocks the penultimate ball off the over.
He hits out on the next ball and gets two.

Anthems
The Pakistani national anthem is being played first at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.
 


The Indian anthem is being played next.
Pakistan openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan make their way to the crease.

Analysis by Dawn’s Umaid Wasim: Pakistan wanted to bat first and set an above-par total. India wanted to bowl first. Both sides will be quite happy with the outcome of the toss. Pakistan, though, face a trial by spin. The pitch is the same as the one for India’s opening match against the UAE. India skipper Suyakumar Yadav said at the toss that batting got easier in the second stanza of the UAE game, and perhaps that is why he wanted his side to be batting second.

An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster, but emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who engaged in a four-day military conflict earlier this year.
Even before the clashes in May, which nearly escalated into a full-blown war, bilateral cricket ties had been suspended. The arch-rivals now play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
Political relations have deteriorated further since the clashes, with several former Indian players urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking at the toss, said: “We’re very excited for the match.”
According to the captain, Pakistan’s rationale behind batting first is that the surface looks to be on the slower side.
His Indian counterpart, Suryakumar Yadav, said this team was really looking forward to this game.
Both teams are unchanged since their last encounters in the tournament.
Pakistan batter Saim Ayub said on Saturday that the team was not just focusing on the Pakistan-India match, but winning the men’s Asia Cup.
 


While reigning T20 world champions India are the firm favourites to retain their title, Pakistan are on a high, having convincingly beaten Afghanistan to win the final of a tri-series and Oman in the lead-up to the contest.
The two teams last faced each other in February, in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in the ODI format.

Fair to say Pakistan are a young side undergoing transition under a new captain and a newer team management, but there were enough instances throughout the fixture that highlighted a bigger problem: big-match nerves.
One of those few instances was Shaheen Shah Afridi’s late onslaught of 33 off 16, which included four clean hits for sixes. He and Sufiyan Muqeem added 43 off 22 balls — a strike-rate of 195-plus — to drag Pakistan to 127-9 when it looked like the team wouldn’t even get into three figures. If tailenders can do that, why not the specialist batters?

To put it simply, the pressure of the big occasion got the better of them before India, obviously a well-oiled T20 machine, faced no challenge whatsoever during the chase, which ended with 25 balls to spare.
Backfiring intent
Early wickets may be the unwanted consequence of attacking intent, but against quality oppositions, they pile pressure on the incoming batters, putting them in a shell — shouldn’t be an excuse for them, however.
 
 

It was Saim again who gave the opponents the sniff before they dug in to prey on Pakistan. The left-handed opener should now be worried. The “impact” he is expected to make early on has remained a mere expectation in most of his outings.
Casually driving Jasprit Bumrah on the up didn’t look like a shot that should be played in such a big match after falling on a first-ball duck in the previous game against Oman as well.
Mohammad Haris followed suit not long after, trying to drag Hardik Pandya from outside the off-stump to get caught in the circle and failing to build on to his half-century against Oman.
Sahibzada: lone warrior
Bumrah prevailed as one of, if not the best, exponents of yorkers in the world, but Sahibzada Farhan (40 off 44) came up to the task, taking on the right-armer whenever he erred even slightly.
That six, creamed over long-on, and the other, pulled with ease over square-leg, spoke volumes about Sahibzada’s quality — the batter coming into the national side after toiling in domestic cricket. But as wickets fell around him, the right-hander slowed down and the seniors faltered.

Horrendous shot selection
The seniors — Fakhar Zaman with his experience and Salman Ali Agha as captain — were two of six Pakistan batters who threw away their wickets thanks to horrendous shot selection.
While Fakhar went after Axar Patel’s straighter one, Salman failed to execute a sweep shot against the left-arm spinner as both were out caught. Hasan Nawaz met the same fate, playing Kuldeep Yadav across, while Faheem Ashraf’s rash reverse-sweep gave Varun Chakravarthy a wicket.
What Shaheen did towards the end was a big proof that the pitch offered value for genuine shot-making and Pakistan failed to capitalise.
Mighty-dangerous India
Pakistan’s frailties were such that a team like India would punish brutally, and they did.
Suryakumar Yadav’s men back their intent with superb skill level and Abhishek Sharma smashing Shaheen for a four on the first ball of their chase showed they meant business.

Saim did make up for his poor batting once again with three big wickets with the ball, including that of Abhishek, Shubman Gill and Tilak Varma, whose 56-run partnership with Suryakumar took India over the line.
Earlier, it was all about Kuldeep, who has haunted Pakistan with his left-arm wrist-spin over the past few years.
Despite the thumping, it’s not completely over for Pakistan.

Cox said the accused gunman, Tyler Robinson, 22, will be formally charged on Tuesday. He remains in custody in Utah.
Investigators have yet to piece together why Robinson allegedly scaled a rooftop at Utah Valley University during an outdoor event and shot Kirk in the neck at long range on Wednesday.
Kirk, a staunch ally of United States President Donald Trump and co-founder of the conservative student group Turning Point USA, was killed by a single rifle shot during the event attended by 3,000 people in Orem, about 65 kilometres south of Salt Lake City.
  @dawn.today US conservative activist Charlie Kirk, an influential ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah University, sparking a manhunt for a lone sniper who the governor said had carried out a political assassination. Authorities said they still had no suspect in custody as of Wednesday night, some eight hours after the midday shooting at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah, during an event attended by 3,000 people. The lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper’s nest on campus, remained “at large,” said Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, at a news conference four hours later. #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com  
The killing ushered in newfound fears of a spike in political violence in the United States and an ever-deepening divide between the left and the right.
Robinson has not confessed to investigators, Cox told the ABC programme ‘This Week’.
“He is not cooperating, but all the people around him were cooperating, and I think that’s very important,” the Republican governor said.
 


One person who is apparently talking to investigators is Robinson’s roommate, who was also a romantic partner, Cox said, citing the FBI. Cox described the roommate as “a male transitioning to female,” and said the roommate has been “incredibly cooperative”.
Reuters has not been able to locate the roommate or representatives for the roommate to seek comment. Reuters could not determine who is serving as Robinson’s legal representative.
Asked on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ programme whether the roommate’s gender identity is relevant to the investigation, Cox said, “That’s what we’re trying to figure out right now. It’s easy to draw conclusions from that, and so we’ve got the shell casings, other forensic evidence that is coming in — and trying to piece all of those things together.”
 


Investigators found messages engraved into four bullet casings, which included references to memes and video game in-jokes. An affidavit filed by authorities in the case described these messages.
One of the inscriptions, according to the affidavit, read: “Hey fascist! Catch!” followed by a combination of directional arrows, an apparent reference to a sequence of button presses that unleashes a bomb in popular video game Helldivers II.
Kirk’s charged rhetoric, which often involved anti-LGBT and anti-immigrant comments, attracted legions of conservatives, but also engendered strong feelings from liberals and drew widespread criticism.
Robinson, a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College, part of Utah’s public university system, was taken into custody at his parents’ house, about 260 miles (420 km) southwest of the crime scene, after a 33-hour manhunt.
Investigators search for motive
Relatives and a family friend alerted authorities that he had implicated himself in the crime, Cox said previously.
While Robinson was raised by religious parents in a deeply conservative region of the state, “his ideology was very different than his family,” Cox said on Sunday on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ programme, without going into specifics.
 


State records show Robinson was a registered voter but not affiliated with any political party. A relative told investigators that Robinson had grown more political in recent years and had once discussed with another family member their dislike for Kirk and his viewpoints, according to the arrest warrant affidavit.
Robinson was “not a fan” of Kirk’s, Cox said on Sunday.
 
 

The killing has stirred outrage among Kirk’s supporters and condemnation of political violence from some across the ideological spectrum.
Many Republicans, including Trump, have been quick to lash out at the political left, accusing liberals of fomenting anti-conservative vitriol that would encourage a kindred spirit to cross the line into violence — even as the president and his allies have often invoked violent imagery against their opponents.
Mike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the US House of Representatives, urged calm on Sunday.
“We’ve got to turn the rhetoric down,” Johnson said on the ‘Fox News Sunday’ programme.
 


In conversations he has had with Republican and Democratic House members since Kirk’s killing, Johnson said, “There’s this recognition that people have got to stop framing simple policy disagreements in terms of existential threats to our democracy.” But Johnson also criticised Democrats.
“You can’t call the other side fascists and enemies of the state and not understand that there are some deranged people in our society who will take that as cues to act and do crazy and dangerous things. And that’s what we’ve seen in increasing frequency,” Johnson said.
On ‘Meet the Press,’ Cox assigned some blame to social media, saying it has “played a direct role in every single assassination and assassination attempt that we have seen over the last five, six years.”
Trump has credited Kirk with driving young voters to conservatism. His Turning Point movement says it has more than 800 chapters across college campuses. Kirk’s widow on Friday said the movement’s efforts would go forward.
A memorial event for Kirk will be held on September 21 in Glendale, Arizona, his organisation said.</p><small>2025-09-14 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14222042515fbb6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941961/rain-has-final-say-as-england-and-south-africa-share-t20-series' target='_blank'><strong>Rain has final say as England and South Africa share T20 series</strong></a><br><p>The third and final Twenty20 International between England and South Africa was abandoned without a ball being bowled at Trent Bridge on Sunday as rain had the final say in the series that finishes 1-1.

Israel targeted Hamas leaders on Tuesday in strikes on the Qatari capital, killing five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer. The attack drew widespread international condemnation, including from Gulf monarchies allied with the United States, Israel’s main backer.
Attending a ministerial meeting in the Qatari capital, Dar delivered a speech where he highlighted that the frequency of meetings to discuss Israel’s activities in the region underlines “how Israel has become a persistent irritant and a danger to world peace and security”, according to the Foreign Office (FO).

“Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the illegal and unprovoked Israeli aggression against the brotherly State of Qatar,” Dar was quoted as saying.
“This reckless and provocative attack constitutes a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar, contrary to the fundamental principles of international law, including the UN Charter, in particular its Article 2(4) prohibiting the threat or use of force.”
Calling the attack “unwarranted, unjustified and appalling”, the foreign minister highlighted that this activity is emblematic of Israel’s rogue mindset, which disregards international law and norms.
“No state is safe from such an unhinged entity that defies all precepts of civilised behaviour, Dar stated. “The question of Israeli accountability is a test for the credibility of the global system.”
The foreign minister highlighted urgent steps that need to be taken “to safeguard the global order”:


Israel must be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should not be allowed to get away with attacking Islamic countries and killing people with impunity.


Creation of an Arab-Islamic task force to monitor the Israeli designs in the region and adopt effective deterrent and offensive measures in a synchronised manner to ward off Israeli expansionist designs.


Pursue the suspension of Israel’s membership in the United Nations. Following up on this step would be a clear message on seriousness by the Ummah.


Member states should actively consider implementing additional punitive measures against Israel, as a means to reinforce accountability and deter further violations of international law.


The UN Security Council must urgently demand [from] Israel, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter … an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire, release of hostages and exchange of Palestinian prisoners.


Unfettered, sustained and secure humanitarian access to all civilians in need, and the protection of aid workers, medical teams and UN personnel in the [Occupied Palestinian Territories].


The revival of a genuine and time-bound political process to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting two-state solution in accordance with international law and relevant UN and OIC resolutions.


 






Monday’s summit in Doha is expected to rally support for Qatar in the wake of last week’s Israeli attack targeting Hamas in the Gulf state.
A draft of the resolution that will be considered by heads of state condemned Israel’s attack as a destabilising escalation and said the states opposed Israel’s “plans to impose a new reality in the region”.
The draft, which was seen by Reuters, did not mention any diplomatic or economic moves against Israel. The resolution may change before the leaders meet in Doha on Monday.
The attack has prompted US-allied Gulf Arab states to close ranks, adding to strains in ties between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel, which normalised relations in 2020.
The emergency summit, bringing together members of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), began with a meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday to craft the draft resolution.
 






The gathering is a message that “Qatar is not alone … and that Arab and Islamic states stand by it,” Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit told the Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.
Dar will “lead Pakistan’s delegation to the ministerial meeting ahead of the Emergency Arab-Islamic Summit”, a statement by the FO said.
Upon arrival, the deputy PM was received by Pakistan’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Aamer, Pakistan’s envoy to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), and senior officials of the Qatari government.
 






The Arab-Islamic summit — held under the umbrella of the 57-member OIC — is expected to draw heads of state and governments, along with senior officials, from across the Muslim world. PM Shehbaz Sharif is also set to attend the high-level moot.
“The summit, cosponsored by Pakistan, has been convened in the wake of Israel’s airstrikes on Doha and the escalating developments in Palestine — following Israeli attempts to occupy Gaza, expand settlement activities in the occupied West Bank and forcibly displace the Palestinians,“ an FO statement said yesterday.
 
 

Diplomats said more than 50 OIC member states are expected to attend the Doha summit, where leaders may also weigh in on pushing Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York.
On the sidelines of the preparatory foreign ministers’ meeting, Dar today met with Egypt’s FM Dr Badr Abdelatty.
“They condemned illegal Israeli strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations, terming them blatant violations of sovereignty and international law. Both reaffirmed their unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and stressed the urgent need for unity across the Muslim ummah,” FO said in a statement.
 






Dar aslo with his Iranian counterpart, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, on the sidelines of the meeting.
According to the FO, they strongly condemned Israel’s unprovoked strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations, terming them grave violations of sovereignty, international law, and the UN Charter.
“Both (leaders) underscored the pivotal role of the Arab League and the OIC in uniting the Muslim Ummah at this critical juncture and reaffirmed their unwavering support for the Palestinian people’s just struggle for freedom and self-determination,” the FO statement read.
 






Dar further met with with Malaysia’s Foreign Minister Dato’ Seri Mohamad Hasan on the sidelines of the meeting.
“They strongly condemned Israeli strikes on Qatar and other Muslim nations as gross violations of sovereignty and international law,” the FO said.
“They reaffirmed unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and emphasized the vital importance of unity across the Muslim Ummah. They welcomed the Arab Islamic Summit as timely and essential for collective action at this critical juncture.”
 






‘Matter of grave concern’
Analysts say tomorrow’s Arab-Islamic summit is meant to send Israel a clear signal. Pakistan has been vocal in its criticism of Israel, especially taking the centre stage at a recent United Nations Security Council meeting, where it engaged in a heated debate with Israel.
“Repeated Israeli attacks against sovereign states in the region are a matter of grave concern, not only for the Muslim ummah but also for the wider international community,” FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan told reporters on Friday.
Following the attack, PM Shehbaz undertook a one-day visit to Doha, where he met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to denounce the Israeli action and show solidarity with the Gulf state.
 
 

Qatar plays a mediation role in Israel’s recent war on Gaza alongside the US and Egypt. It hosts the largest US base in the region, and also recently gave US President Donald Trump a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet to use as his presidential plane.
For the first time in recent memory, the US joined all 15 UNSC members in condemning the Israeli strike during Thursday’s emergency meeting. The US has historically shielded Israel from statements of condemnation by not endorsing them, but on Thursday, it opted not to veto the joint statement.
Despite ongoing tensions, Trump on Friday held a dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York.
The US president has said he was “very unhappy” about the Israeli attack on Qatar. However, earlier today, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said it was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.</p><small>2025-09-14 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/142030390f5c56a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941952/karachi-police-warn-citizens-against-aerial-firing-amid-pak-india-asia-cup-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police warn citizens against aerial firing amid Pak-India Asia Cup clash</strong></a><br><p>As excitement builds for Sunday’s highly anticipated Pakistan-India Asia Cup cricket match, law enforcement authorities in Karachi have issued a strong warning against celebratory aerial firing, citing concerns over public safety and law and order.
Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Javed Alam Odho has directed all senior police officers across the city to implement strict measures to prevent such incidents. In a statement released by his office today, the AIG emphasised that aerial firing will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
“Those found involved in this illegal act will be arrested immediately, face legal proceedings, and be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” the police official added.
The Karachi police have appealed to citizens to celebrate responsibly and avoid any form of celebratory gunfire. Authorities warned that aerial firing is not only a criminal offence under the law but can also lead to tragic loss of life and injury.
Citizens have been urged to report any instances of aerial firing by immediately calling the police helpline at 15.
“The cooperation of the public is essential to maintaining peace and order in the city,” said a police spokesperson.
An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster, but emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who engaged in a four-day military conflict earlier this year.
Even before the clashes in May, which nearly escalated into a full-blown war, bilateral cricket ties had been suspended. The arch-rivals now play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
Political relations have deteriorated further since the clashes, with several former Indian players urging the Board of Control for Cricket in India to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities.</p><small>2025-09-14 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623680-pak-vs-ind-asia-cup-match-karachi-police-issue-stern-warning' target='_blank'><strong>Pak vs Ind Asia Cup match: Karachi police issue stern warning</strong></a><br><p>

Zardari, who is on a 10-day trip to China, asserted this during a visit to the  the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) — the country’s aerospace and defence conglomerate engaged in the design and production of a wide range of military and civilian aircraft,  including J-10C fighter jets that Pakistan employed during an escalation with India in May.
The use of these aircraft is said to have played a crucial role in shooting down India’s fighter jets, including Rafales, during the four-day escalation that ended with a ceasefire on May 10.
The statement by the President’s Secretariat today said: “On the 128th day since the ceasefire with India, President Asif Ali Zardari, constitutionally the supreme commander of the armed forces of Pakistan, visited the Aviation Industry Corporation of China”.

According to the statement, the president toured the sprawling complex in its entirety and met the AVIC’s engineers and scientists, “listening to their insights on innovation, production and future technologies”.
He was briefed on the AVIC’s “advanced capabilities, including the J-10 fighter jet, the co-production of the JF-17 Thunder with Pakistan, as well as progress in the J-20 stealth 5th-generation fighter aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, fully automated units, and integrated command-and-control systems for modern multi-domain operations”.
The statement quoted the president as saying that “J-10 and JF-17 have greatly strengthened the Pakistan Air Force, a fact clearly demonstrated during May 2025’s Maraka-e-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.

He hailed the AVIC as “a symbol of China’s technological advancement and of the enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and China”.
The statement said Zardari’s visit to the facility was also historic as “no foreign head of state had previously visited the AVIC complex”.
Zardari was accompanied by his son PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, his daughter MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, Pakistan’s Ambassador to China Khalil Hashmi and China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong, who will be travelling with the president throughout the visit, it added.

The president later arrived in Shanghai. On his arrival at the airport, the president was warmly received by Chen Qun, vice chairman of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference Shanghai Committee, and Ma Yinghui, director general of the Foreign Affairs Office of Shanghai Municipality, according to another statement.
President Zardari reached China on Friday, where he will hold meetings with the Chinese leadership and senior officials to further strengthen Pakistan-China relations, enhance cooperation in diverse fields, and advance shared objectives.
He will also visit Shanghai and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and hold meetings with the leadership there, according to an earlier statement by the Foreign Office.
The discussions will encompass Pakistan-China bilateral relations, with a particular focus on economic and trade cooperation, China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and future connectivity initiatives, the statement said, adding that the visit underscores the tradition of high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China, reflecting the deep commitment of the two countries to strengthen their relations.</p><small>2025-09-14 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623667-pm-unveils-relief-package-waives-power-bills-for-flood-hit-households' target='_blank'><strong>PM unveils relief package, waives power bills for flood-hit households</strong></a><br><p>

An India-Pakistan cricket match is always a blockbuster. Still, emotions will run even higher in today’s Asia Cup clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours, who fought a four-day military conflict in May. The countries have been at odds in various matters since then, including claims of downing jets, ceasefire requests, geopolitical narratives and of course, cricket.
Several former Indian players and politicians have urged the BCCI to boycott what will be the first meeting between the teams since the recent hostilities. New Delhi only cleared the match in a recently announced sports policy, saying the Indian national team can play Pakistan in multi-national events but not in bilateral competitions.
Former Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, head of the Shiv Sena-UBT party, has announced that his party will organise protests across the state against the game, Hindustan Times reported.
“Our prime minister said blood and water cannot flow together, so how can blood and cricket flow together? How can war and cricket be at the same time? They have done business in patriotism. The business of patriotism is only for money. They are going to play the match tomorrow also because they want all the money they will get from that match,” he was quoted as saying.
 






Later, Indian news agency ANI shared on X a video, with a caption saying, “Shiv Sena (UBT) burns Pakistani national flag in front of Thiruvananthapuram AG’s office in protest against India vs Pakistan match today in Asia Cup.”
Ahead of today’s game, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal posted on X: “Playing a match with Pakistan is treason against the country. Every Indian is extremely angry about this.”
He was commenting on a post by AAP’s Delhi unit president Saurabh Bharadwaj, who wrote: “Blood and sports cannot go together.”
 


ANI also talked to a Congress leader, Ajay Rai, on that matter, who urged the Supreme Court of India to stop the country’s team from playing against Pakistan in accordance with “public sentiment”.
A day ago, the AAP protested against the match between Men in Blue and Green Shirts, with Bharadwaj and party workers burning an effigy symbolising Pakistani players, The Hindu reported.
Former cricketer Kedhar Jadhav, also a part of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said the India-Pakistan fixture should not go ahead.
“I don’t know what will happen, but I have already said that according to me, this match should not be played,” Jadhav was quoted as saying by The Times of India.
The matter had also reached the Indian top court as four law students filed a petition against the match, contending that it was “against national interest”. But the Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the plea.
Indian news anchor Shiv Aroor said Asia Cup was “precisely the opportunity the [Government of India] should have taken to signal that Pahalgam & [Operation] Sindoor = new rules on terror”, referring to New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which Pakistan strongly denied.
“‘Multilateral tournament’ excuses are pathetic, embarrassing. We make the rules,” Aroor said on X.
 


Meanwhile, a video clip of Indian anchorperson Arnab Goswami has been doing rounds on social media where he is calling for the match’s boycott and and saying that this match should garner the lowest television rankings. He went on to question the Indian cricket board and Sony TV, which has the broadcasting rights for the Asia Cup, that who gave “permission for the match”.
Ex-cricketer and politician Manoj Tiwary told ANI he was boycotting the match, as well as the entire Asia Cup. “It needs to be understood that this is just a sport; this is not life. We are comparing human lives to sports; this should never be done.”
He also questioned the BCCI’s “justification” for playing the matches, adding that the team could have forfeited today’s face-off and reached the finals by winning other games.
 






‘A compulsion’
On the other hand, BJP lawmaker and former sports minister Anurag Thakur defended the BCCI’s stance on playing against Pakistan in the Asia Cup.
“When multinational tournaments are organised by ACC or ICC, it becomes a compulsion, a necessity for nations to participate,” he told ANI.
“If they don’t do that, they will be eliminated from the tournament, they will have to forfeit the match, and the other team will get the points,” he added, before pointing out that India does not play bilateral tournaments with Pakistan.
 






Actor Suniel Shetty, father-in-law of cricketer KL Rahul, echoed similar sentiments: “It’s a world sporting body. They have to abide by those rules and regulations because there are a lot of other sports and a lot of athletes who are involved in them.
“As Indians, I think that is our personal call that we have to take, whether we want to see it, whether we don’t want to see it […] and that’s a call India has to take, but you cannot blame cricketers for playing because they are sportsmen, they are expected to represent the country,” he told reporters.
 






On this side of the border, former captain Wasim Akram has urged Pakistani and Indian cricketers to ignore the noise and “enjoy” the game. “Forget about everything other than cricket. One team will win, and one team will lose,” he told AFP.
BCCI defends stance, citing future hosting risks
However, Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) Secretary Devajit Saikia defended his country’s decision to play against Pakistan. He told Hindustan Times that it was an international tournament and that a boycott would “bring a lot of negativity for all our future endeavours of hosting any multinational tournament”.
“Had it been a bilateral tournament, we could have always said that we would not play against any hostile country. And so far as Pakistan is concerned, we are not playing any bilateral tournament since 2012-13 onwards,” he added.
 
 

India’s fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate said the team has been instructed to strictly follow the directives of the BCCI and the Indian government. He added that head coach Gautam Gambhir, who in May had also called for a boycott, has called for focus on cricket.
“Our thing is, you separate sports and politics,” he said. “I understand the sentiment, but we are following the directives of BCCI and the government. We are going by what the government and BCCI told us.
“The Asia Cup was in limbo for a long period of time, and we didn’t think we’d be coming at one stage, but obviously the Indian government stance in it and now you have to put the sentiment and emotions behind … it’s something we addressed in the team meeting today,“ ten Doeschate added.
Still, Hindustan Times, citing a report in Dainik Jagran, said “most” BCCI officials have decided to distance themselves from the upcoming India-Pakistan match. The report claimed that a BCCI official would only be seen on-camera if India won.
Today’s clash could be the first of three as both India and Pakistan are favourites to qualify for the Super Four stage and possibly for the September 28 final.
In May, the BCCI had denied reports of withdrawal from all Asian Cricket Council (ACC) events amid recent tensions with Pakistan.</p><small>2025-09-14 13:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14181232b2a1976.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941947/chinese-officials-hold-talks-in-spain-on-trade-irritants-tiktok-deadline' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese officials hold talks in Spain on trade irritants, TikTok deadline</strong></a><br><p>United States and Chinese officials began talks in Madrid on Sunday on their strained trade ties, a looming divestiture deadline for Chinese short video app TikTok and Washington’s demands that its allies place tariffs on China over its purchases of Russian oil.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer arrived shortly before Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and China’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, at the baroque Palacio de Santa Cruz, which houses Spain’s foreign ministry in the Spanish capital.
The talks mark the fourth time in four months that the delegations have met in European cities to try to keep a fractured US-China trade relationship from collapsing under US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

The delegations last met in Stockholm in July, where they agreed in principle to extend for 90 days a trade truce that sharply reduced triple-digit retaliatory tariffs on both sides and restarted the flow of rare-earth minerals from China to the United States.
Trump has approved the extension of current US tariff rates on Chinese goods, totalling about 55 per cent, until November 10.
Trade experts said there was little likelihood of a substantial breakthrough in the talks hosted by Spain, which has sought to improve ties with Beijing in recent years.
The most likely result of the Madrid talks is seen as another extension of a deadline for the popular TikTok app’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest its US operations by September 17 or face a US shutdown.
A source familiar with the Trump administration’s discussions on TikTok’s future said that a deal was not expected, but that the deadline would be extended for a fourth time since Trump took office in January. Trump last month launched a TikTok account.
TikTok has not been discussed in previous rounds of US-China trade talks in Geneva, London and Stockholm.
But the source said the issue’s public inclusion as an agenda item on the Treasury’s announcement of the talks gives the Trump administration political cover for another extension, which may annoy both Republicans and Democrats in Congress who mandated TikTok’s sale to a US entity to reduce national security risks.

Wendy Cutler, a former USTR trade negotiator and head of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, said she expected more substantial “deliverables” to be saved for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later this year, perhaps at an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Seoul at the end of October.
These may include a final deal to resolve US national security concerns over TikTok, and a lifting of restrictions on Chinese purchases of American soybeans and reduction of fentanyl-related tariffs on Chinese goods, and the Madrid discussions may help lay groundwork for such a meeting, Cutler said.
But she said resolving core US economic complaints about China, including its demands that China shift its economic model toward more domestic consumption and rely less on state-subsidised exports, could take years.
“Frankly, I don’t think China is in any rush to do an agreement where they don’t get substantial concessions on export controls and lower tariffs, which are their key priorities,” Cutler said. “And I don’t see the United States in a position to make major concessions on either, unless there’s some breakthrough on its demands to China.”
Russian oil pressure
The treasury has said the Madrid talks also would cover joint US-Chinese efforts to combat money laundering, a reference to its longstanding demands that China clamp down on illicit shipments of technology goods to Russia that aid its war in Ukraine.
Bessent urged Group of Seven (G7) allies on Friday to impose “meaningful tariffs” on imports from China and India to pressure them to stop buying Russian oil, a move aimed at bringing Moscow into Ukraine peace negotiations by curbing its oil revenues.

The G7 finance ministers said on Friday they discussed such measures and agreed to speed up discussions to use frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine’s defence. Bessent and Greer said in a separate statement that G7 allies should join the United States in imposing tariffs on buyers of Russian oil.
“Only with a unified effort that cuts off the revenues funding Putin’s war machine at the source will we be able to apply sufficient economic pressure to end the senseless killing,” Bessent and Greer said, referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The US has imposed an extra 25pc tariff on Indian goods over the country’s purchases of Russian oil, but has so far refrained from imposing such punitive duties on Chinese goods.
China’s Ministry of Commerce has said the Madrid talks will cover economic and trade issues such as US tariffs, the “abuse” of export controls and TikTok.
Spain’s moment
Spanish Foreign Minister Jos Manuel Albares publicly greeted the two delegations before the start of talks.
A Spanish government source said the choice of Spain for the latest round of the “delicate” talks was evidence that Madrid was consolidating itself as a seat of high-level and strategic negotiations. Madrid has sought to be a venue for an international peace conference to resolve the Israel-Palestinian conflict.

The source said Spain’s government also takes advantage of the event to reinforce its own bilateral relations with the US following a series of tense engagements with the Trump administration.
Spain has criticised Israel’s offensive in Gaza and refused to commit to spending 5pc of its budget on defence, along with other Nato members.
Bessent himself has also criticised Spain for declaring Beijing a “strategic partner” at the height of Trump’s tariff offensive in April, saying that a closer relationship with the Asian giant was akin to “cutting your own throat”</p><small>2025-09-14 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/14173545c15f523.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941943/former-world-boxing-champion-ricky-hatton-dies-at-age-46' target='_blank'><strong>Former world boxing champion Ricky Hatton dies at age 46</strong></a><br><p>British boxer Ricky Hatton has died at the age of 46, the BBC reported on Sunday.
Former world champion Hatton won titles at light-welterweight and welterweight, before retiring in 2012. He had been due to make a comeback for an event in Dubai later this year.
Greater Manchester Police said in a statement that a body had been found on Sunday morning at an address in Hyde in the northern English city.
A police spokesman said: “Officers were called by a member of the public to attend Bowlacre Road, Hyde, Tameside, at 6:45am (0545 GMT) today (Sunday) where they found the body of a 46-year-old man. There are not currently believed to be any suspicious circumstances.”
Hatton had 45 wins in 48 bouts over his career but in the years after he retired he said he had tried to kill himself several times and had been open about his struggle with depression, drink and drugs.
“I was coming off the rails with my drinking and that led to drugs. It was like a runaway train,” he told BBC radio in 2016.
Hatton’s best performance came in 2005 when he stopped Australian Kostya Tszyu to add the IBF light-welterweight title to the WBU belt he already held.
He had a perfect 43-0 record until he was floored by Floyd Mayweather Jr in Las Vegas in 2007 and was never the same again.
Britain’s former world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury paid tribute to Hatton.
“Rip to the legend Ricky Hatton may he rip,” Fury posted on Instagram.
“There will only ever be 1 Ricky Hatton. Can’t believe this so young.”
Another former world champion, Britain’s Amir Khan, described Hatton on X as a “mentor, warrior and one of Britain’s greatest boxers”.
 






Khan added: “As fighters, we tell ourselves we’re strong – we train, we sweat, we take hits, we get up. But sometimes the hardest fight happens in silence, in the mind.
“Mental health isn’t weakness. It’s part of being human. And we must talk about it. We must reach out. We must lean on each other.
“Ricky, thank you for everything. For your fights, your moments of glory, your grit. Thank you for pushing us, showing us what’s possible.
Matchroom Boxing said: “(We are) saddened to hear the news of Ricky Hatton’s passing. Our thoughts and condolences are with Ricky’s friends and family at this tragic time. There’s only one Ricky Hatton.”</p><small>2025-09-14 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623660-pakistan-china-to-continue-expansion-in-defence-aviation-collaboration-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China to continue expansion in defence, aviation collaboration: Zardari</strong></a><br><p>

He was 80 and died after a prolonged illness.
Sufi is survived by his wife and four sons.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), among others, expressed grief and sorrow over Sufi’s death in a condolence message.
“The PCB management, along with its staff, extends heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved family and prays that the Almighty grants the departed soul eternal peace and gives strength to the family and loved ones to bear this irreparable loss.”
Separately, PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi also paid a tribute to the late journalist,
describing his passing as the end of a golden era in sports journalism.
Naqvi lauded Sufi’s lifelong dedication to promoting sports, particularly cricket, and said that his journalistic legacy would be cherished and remembered.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah also expressed grief over Sufi’s death in a statement.
Former cricketer Shahid Afridi also condoled his death, remembering him as a “man of fine personality”.
He posted on X that Sufi had always been vocal for the betterment and promotion of the game and the betterment of players.
“Personally, he was always very supportive of me. His death marks the end of a great chapter in sports journalism in Pakistan,” he added, praying for the veteran journalist.
 






Similarly, sports journalist Faizan Lakhani also dubbed Sufi’s death an “end of an era”.
“Syed Muhammad Sufi, Geo’s Sports Editor and a towering figure in sports journalism, has passed away. For 60 years, he served the profession with dedication, guiding and mentoring generations of journalists. A huge loss. May Allah bless his soul,” he posted on X.
 






According to Geo News, where Sufi was a sports editor, the veteran journalist  had worked with several media outlets. These included Geo News and Daily Jang, with which he had been associated for more than 30 years, according to the news website.

Sushila Karki, the 73-year-old former chief justice, has been tasked with restoring order and addressing protesters’ demands for a corruption-free future ahead of elections in six months.
Protests, sparked by a ban on social media and feeding into long-standing economic woes, began on Monday and quickly escalated, with parliament and key government buildings set ablaze.
 
 

“We have to work according to the thinking of the Gen Z generation,” Karki said in her first public comments since taking office on Friday.
A fifth of people in Nepal aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita standing at just $1,447, in the Himalayan nation of 30 million people.
“What this group is demanding is the end of corruption, good governance and economic equality,” she added.
‘From the streets’
Karki held a minute’s silence on Sunday for those killed in the unrest, before meetings began in the key government complex of Singha Durbar — where several buildings were set on fire during mass protests on Tuesday.
At least 72 people were killed in two days of protests and 191 were injured, the government’s chief secretary Eaknarayan Aryal said Sunday, increasing an earlier toll of 51. It was the worst unrest since the end of a decade-long civil war and the abolition of the monarchy in 2008.

The appointment of Karki, known for her independence, came after intense negotiations by army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and President Ram Chandra Paudel, including with representatives of “Gen Z”, the loose umbrella title of the youth protest movement.
Thousands of young activists had used the Discord app to name Karki as their choice of leader.
“The situation that I have come in, I have not wished to come here. My name was brought from the streets,” Karki said.
Parliament has been dissolved and elections set for March 5, 2026.
“We will not stay here more than six months in any situation; we will complete our responsibilities and pledge to hand over to the next parliament and ministers,” she added, in a speech to the nation.
Ordinary Nepalis said they were hopeful the government would bring change, but were aware the challenges were heavy.
“This government’s list of responsibilities and issues to address isn’t easy,” said grocery shopkeeper Satya Narayan, 69, in Pharping village, about an hour outside the capital.
“It also needs to ensure unity and harmony in the country by taking all sections along”.
‘Challenging times’
President Paudel, who swore Karki into office, said late Saturday that “a peaceful solution has been found through a difficult process”.
Soldiers have scaled back their presence on the streets, where they had been deployed in large numbers after the protests. But more than 12,500 prisoners who escaped from jails during the chaos are on the run, and present a daunting security headache.

Regional leaders have congratulated Karki, including Nepal’s two giant neighbours, India and China.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said New Delhi supported “peace, progress and prosperity” in Hindu-majority Nepal, while Beijing’s foreign ministry said it wanted to “push China-Nepal relations steadily forward”.
Buddhism is the country’s second-largest religion, and the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, wished Karki “every success in fulfilling the hopes and aspirations of the people of Nepal in these challenging times“.</p><small>2025-09-14 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623618-pakistan-envoy-to-convey-stern-message-against-ttps-facilitation-on-kabul-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan envoy to convey stern message against TTP's facilitation on Kabul visit</strong></a><br><p>
