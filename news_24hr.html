<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68e1e4d8b069a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946719/unfulfilled-promises' target='_blank'><strong>Unfulfilled promises</strong></a><br><p>IT was clear that the government would eventually accept the demands of protesters in Azad Kashmir, and re-initiate talks with the Joint Awami Action Committee (JAAC) after the loss of lives and economic and infrastructural damage.
It remains to be seen when and if the promises are fulfilled. Had the government made good progress on earlier demands, the region might have been spared the recent tumult.
In fact, the pattern so far shows that the government, in other parts of the country too, engages in negotiations with protesters merely to pacify the immediate situation, rather than look for permanent solutions to honour its commitments. In some cases, voices of protest fall on deaf ears.
For instance, just days before the JAAC protest, the families of Baloch missing persons once again ended their sit-in and returned from the federal capital. The peaceful families of the missing persons were not fortunate enough to receive even minimal attention from state institutions.
One must move beyond dealing with such situations through force, temporary negotiations and eventual disregard for the demands once ‘normalcy’ is restored. This modus operandi is a relic of colonial times. Many Commonwealth states inherited this pattern, but Pakistan is among the few that appear to have stuck to the old line, without distinction or reform. Regrettably, this is the approach the government took when the JAAC launched its protest this time and earlier in Azad Kashmir.
There have been many protest movements in the country, including the Gilgit-Baltistan Awami Action Committee, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement, the Haq Do Tehreek in Gwadar, the Sindhu Bachao Tehreek, and the Baloch Yakjehti Committee. Their demand has been simple: constitutional, economic and political rights, and most importantly, the right to live with dignity. What is common to all such rights movements is that they are essentially anti-elite and challenge entrenched political and economic privileges. The state, however, responds with force against dissent.

The issue of elite capture has come to dominate rights struggles.

Protest can also be seen from a global perspective and applied locally. What took place in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nepal were anti-elite protests that were confronted by state repression. We have seen similar disaffection with elite privileges here as well, its most recent iteration being in AJK.
Yet the authorities in Pakistan, like those in India, have an advantage: the country’s ethnic, racial and religious diversity ensures that movements in the peripheries seldom capture the attention of the mainstream public discourse. The state tends to exploits this by ensuring that such movements remain disconnected from one another and do not reach the heartlands or urban centres where public opinion truly matters.
The recent incident at the National Press Club in Islamabad, where police brutally beat Kashmiri protesters, stormed the premises, and tortured journalists, is part of this same tactic: keeping rights movements, especially peripheral ones, away from the mainstream. The government and state elements not only deploys strong-armed measures but also manipulates narratives on both mainstream and social media. News is censored, and smear campaigns are launched against these movements, which are termed as foreign-funded conspiracies.
Half-page advertisements in the national media and TV screenings by the information ministry have recently been ‘warning’ that a new war is being fought in our minds. They are, in fact, a reflection of the state’s own mindset regarding justifiable dissent, which it reframes by overplaying the theory of hybrid warfare.
Dissenters are tagged as foreign agents and include NGOs, freelancers and media persons who ask critical questions. The public is warned not to share secret information with anyone. It is not certain what kind of sensitive information an ordinary citizen in the country can possess. However, the authorities insist it is a part of narrative warfare and try to create a barrier between areas where the protests take place and the rest of the country.
The recent protests can be seen as a continuation of a rights struggle that began several years ago. The protests were directly linked to promises the state made to the protesters in 2023, pledges that have remained unfulfilled. Meanwhile, the wealthy elite continue to thrive, aligned with power centres in the mainland. Ordinary people believe that privilege and fortune come only through corruption and collusion with these elites, a conviction that fuels their grievances.
The recent deadlock in talks between the government and JAAC, before resumption, centred on the issue of elite capture. Forced by the stalemate, the JAAC proceeded with its protest plan. At the core of JAAC’s 38-point charter was the elimination of elite privileges, especially the 13 reserved seats for Kashmiri refugees. The JAAC views these seats as a source of corruption and political manoeuvring, and thus playing a decisive part in forming governments in AJK.
The comparison with the (former) Fata seats in Pakistan’s parliament is evoked aptly to voice concerns regarding horse-trading and government-making and unmaking at Islamabad’s whim. The government counters that abolishing these seats would weaken Pakistan’s Kashmir case, as India also reserves seats for AJK and GB. It argues that removing them would signal acceptance of India’s Aug 5, 2019, abrogation of Kashmir’s special status.
The JAAC dismisses this claim. It insists that reserved seats have nothing to do with UN resolutions and do not affect Pakistan’s legal stance. Both AJK and GB want constitutional rights as citizens. Instead, critics assert, the state imposes taxes and removes subsidies but does not give them the constitutional cover that would allow citizens to benefit fully, without undermining UN resolutions.
Most of the JAAC’s demands were essentially municipal-level issues, including health, education and sanitation. Yet Pakistan’s ruling elites, particularly in the provinces, have destroyed the local government system, retaining revenues for themselves and spending like monarchs.

After nearly two years of relentless bombardment, the prospect of a truce — following Hamas’s conditional acceptance of US President Donald Trump’s peace plan, which includes releasing all hostages and handing Gaza’s administration to a technocratic Palestinian body, and Israel’s readiness to implement its first phase — offers a sliver of hope.
For a population living amid mass displacement, collapsed infrastructure, and the loss of over 66,000 lives, even a pause in the violence carries meaning. Yet history teaches that such truces often collapse under Israel’s obstinacy. If this opening is to amount to more than a tactical lull, it must be anchored in lasting commitments.
The Netanyahu government has already signalled it will calibrate operations rather than halt them outright. Reports from Gaza confirm bombardment continuing despite Mr Trump’s demand for Israel to “immediately stop bombing.”
 
 

Mr Trump has also set Hamas a deadline, warning that if it fails to accept the deal by Sunday night, “all hell” will break out. Such ultimatums underscore both the fragility of the moment and the dangers of coercion in a process that should prioritise justice and peace. Israel is notorious for backtracking once international attention drifts. This time must be different.
The guarantors of the truce — Washington, Arab capitals, and the UN — must ensure commitments are not quietly abandoned, and that violations invite consequences. Without sustained pressure, Tel Aviv has little incentive to comply beyond exchanging hostages for prisoners.
 
 

Accountability cannot be sacrificed for expedience. According to Gaza’s health ministry, more than 66,000 Palestinians have been killed since October 2023 — figures the UN considers credible. That most of the dead are women and children underscores the monstrous scale of Israel’s actions. International law obliges states to investigate such crimes.
If there is no accountability for the massacre of tens of thousands, peace will rest on sand, and impunity will pave the way for repetition. Equally central is Gaza’s future. The blockade that has strangled the Strip for nearly two decades must be permanently lifted. Aid convoys cannot replace the right of Palestinians to move freely, rebuild homes, and recover their economy. Without freedom of movement, Gaza remains an open-air prison.
 
 

In the end, no ‘technocratic committee’ or transitional board will address the root cause. Only a two-state solution, long sabotaged by Israeli settlement expansion, can provide dignity and security. Yet Israel’s leadership has already said it does not accept Palestinian statehood, pledging to retain “security control” while denying Palestinians sovereignty.
Unless Palestinians are granted the means to build a viable state, violence will recur. This fragile pause may offer a chance. But unless it is built on accountability, freedom, and self-determination, it will remain just that — a pause before the next round of devastation.

• MP Iqbal Mohamed defends such marriages as culturally significant, urges genetic screening over bans
LONDON: Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) has found itself at the centre of a political and cultural row after a government-backed education programme published — and then quietly removed — online guidance describing the potential benefits of first-cousin marriage.
UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting called the advice “shocking” and demanded an apology, saying first-cousin marriages are “high-risk and unsafe.” MP Iqbal Mohamed, however, defended such unions as culturally significant for many families.
Speaking in the Commons, he acknowledged health risks but said many families see such unions as positive for building bonds and financial security, urging genetic screening instead of a ban.
 
 

The document, published by NHS England’s Genomics Education Programme last week, stated that consanguineous unions can bring “stronger extended family support systems and economic advantages” even as it acknowledged the increased risk of certain genetic conditions among children of related parents.
Tory MP Richard Holden, who has proposed legislation to ban cousin marriages, condemned the document, calling on the NHS to “stop taking the knee to damaging and oppressive cultural practices.” Holden also linked cousin marriage to immigration and women’s rights, saying the practice “should be ended for good.”
By Monday September 29, the guidance appeared to have been taken down from the NHS website.
New YouGov research shows that three quarters of Britons (77 per cent) say first cousin marriage should not be legal, with only 9pc thinking the law should remain as it is. Prohibiting first cousin marriage is popular across the main parties, with 76-77pc of Labour, Lib Dem and Tory voters opposed to the practice, as well as 82pc of Reform UK voters.
The study
The Genomics Education Programme which is run by Health Education England aims to improve the “genetic literacy” of healthcare professionals and the public. Its 22 September blog post titled “Should the UK Government Ban First-Cousin Marriage?”, stressed that while children of first cousins do face a higher risk of certain inherited disorders, the increase is small and should be tackled through education and voluntary screening rather than bans.
The document emphasised that first-cousin marriage remains legal in the UK under the Marriage Act 1949 and that the government has “no current plans” to change this.
It noted that while the risk of a child being born with a genetic condition rises from about 2–3pc in the general population to 4–6pc for children of first cousins, “most children of first cousins are healthy.”
The guidance also cited research from Bradford suggesting that “endogamy” (marrying within a tight-knit community) may be a more significant factor in genetic risk than cousin marriage itself.
It further warned that stigmatising the practice can deter couples from seeking help, with the British Society for Genetic Medicine instead advocating premarital genomic testing, targeted education and voluntary counselling as more effective ways to reduce risk.
In February this year, a BBC investigation showed how cousin marriage plays out on the ground. Its reporting from Bradford, which is home to one of the UK’s largest Pakistani communities found that first-cousin marriage remains “fairly common” but is slowly declining.
The Born in Bradford study, tracking over 13,000 children, found that about one in six had parents who were first cousins. Researchers found that children of first cousins were more likely to have speech and language problems (11pc versus 7pc for unrelated parents); that they were less likely to reach a government benchmark for “good development” at age five (54pc versus 64pc); and they visited primary care doctors more frequently i.e. about four times a year on average compared to three for unrelated-parent children.
Professor Sam Oddie of Bradford Teaching Hospitals told the BBC “I’ve seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions”.
He said such conditions were notably more common in Bradford, recalling families who lost several children to the same genetic disorder — “deeply upsetting and hard to comprehend.”
But the same BBC story underscores that many health professionals, including Prof Oddie, argue it is “an oversimplification” to blame cousin marriage alone. Endogamy, not just direct blood ties, can cluster genetic variants.
Endogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK’s Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians.
Prof Oddie said it’s simplistic to blame co­usin marriage alone, noting that shared ge­­n­­es within close communities — or endoga­­my — play a major role in inherited disorders.
BBC interviews found more young women choosing “love marriages” as education and social exposure grow, with cousin marriages among Pakistani-origin mothers in Bradford falling from 40pc to 27pc in a decade.

• India may release over 150,000 cusecs of water into Punjab rivers within 48 hours
• PDMA warns of potential flooding in some regions
• Survey of flood damage in 69 tehsils likely to be complete by 27th
LAHORE: The Punjab government on Saturday approved financial assistance of Rs20,000 per acre for compensation of crop losses, with the provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) warning of potential flooding in some regions amid rain forecast for many districts and expected release of over 150,000 cusecs from India into the Chenab, Sutlej and Ravi rivers within a day or two.
While chairing a meeting in Multan to review the condition of cotton, rice, sugarcane and other standing crops, Punjab Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo said about 2,000 teams were conducting surveys of flood-related damages, though Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had already approved financial assistance of Rs20,000 per acre to compensate for crop losses.
He said a comprehensive action plan had also been prepared to achieve wheat sowing target, noting that measures aimed at boosting cotton production had yielded encouraging results. So far, he said, 2.65 million bales equivalent of seed cotton (phutti) were picked this year as compared to 1.846m bales obtained during the same period last year according to Crop Reporting Service statistics.
 
 

Earlier, the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued an alert for rains in Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan over the next 12 to 24 hours, specifically in the upper catchment areas of Jhelum, Ravi and Sutlej rivers.
On the other hand, PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia told a presser that the country was bracing for a shift in the weather, with rains expected over the next few days which may worsen the flood situation in Punjab.
Light to heavy rains are expected in various districts of Punjab from Rawalpindi to Lahore over the weekend, followed by showers on Monday in south Punjab. In the upper regions of Punjab, up to 100mm of rainfall was expected, he added.
Rising level of river waters
At Head Marala, Mr Kathia said, the Chenab River is carrying 20,000 cusecs, with an additional 100,000 cusecs expected from India in the next 48 hours. Marala’s current outflow is 23,000 cusecs. Considering that 900,000 cusecs water passed through Head Marala on Aug 26, he said it was not as big a challenge.
Besides, the Sutlej River may receive 50,000 cusecs from India, and 35,000 cusecs of water are expected to enter the Ravi River from the Thein Dam, he said.
On the other hand, Mangla Dam reported high water levels, though Jhelum may not face a massive flood situation.
Survey in 27 districts
The PDMA DG said a survey for flood damage assessment was underway in 27 districts of Punjab, with as many as 11,000 people being engaged in the exercise. A joint survey team includes officers from the Pakistan Army, district administration, and various other departments, he said, adding that a total of 2,213 teams were in the field.
With real-time monitoring through an online dashboard, survey is being conducted by the joint teams in 27 districts, he said. The exercise would be completed in 69 tehsils by Oct 27, he added.
 
 

Mr Kathia said the Bank of Punjab would establish counters in each tehsil to ensure provision of maximum facilities to flood victims. He said that flood survivors could receive Rs50,000 immediately after receiving cards.
Complaint resolution
For complaints related to the survey, he said, the PDMA in collaboration with Punjab’s IT Board had formed a platform, which would resolve complaints within seven days.
The DG recalled that there were over 350,000 flood victims in 2010, 38,196 in 2012, 359,000 in 2014 while a total of Rs14 billion was distributed among them.
Again in 2022, he said, 56,000 people affected by floods were provided a sum of Rs10 billion compensation.
He said that over the past 15 years, Rs51 billion was distributed among flood victims but the damage from the current flood was bigger than all previous floods.
Weather advisory
Meanwhile, NEOC issued the weather alert, warning that rains have been forecast for Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Islamabad, Punjab and southern part of Sindh, with the possibility of landslides in mountainous areas.
In Punjab, Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Hafizabad, Sargodha, and Khushab may receive showers, while in Sindh, rain is likely in Karachi, Jamshoro, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal, Tharparkar, and Umerkot.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, intermittent rains are expected in Chitral, Dir, Haripur, Kohat, Kohistan, Khyber, Kurram, and Mansehra. Thunderstorms with rain are also likely in Peshawar, Nowshera, Malakand, Charsadda, Swabi, Hazara, Abbottabad, Mohmand, Bannu, Buner, Waziristan, and adjoining areas.
The NDMA said the NEOC was actively coordinating with relevant departments to ensure timely updates and effective emergency response. It urged people to avoid unnecessary travel in mountainous areas due to landslide risks, stay informed via radio, TV, and the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert app, and follow instructions of local authorities.

The state designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Security officials said the forces launched the operation on the basis of intelligence reports about the presence of the group’s militants in the mountainous area of Zehri tehsil.
According to the officials, the area was cordoned off before the action was launched. Heavy firing took place between the security forces and the terrorists, which continued for several hours.
“As many as 14 terrorists were killed in the gun battle, while 20 others were injured,” the officials said, adding that a large quantity of arms, ammunition, and other equipment was seized from their possession.
The Zehri operation, they added, was carried out days after security forces killed seven India-sponsored terrorists in an intelligence-based operation in Sherani district of Balochistan.
 
 

They said several hideouts established by the militants in the mountainous terrain were destroyed during the operation.
“Residents of the Zehri area praised the operation, acknowledging the efforts of the security forces in restoring peace and order to the region, which had been disturbed for a long time,” the officials said, adding that the terrorists had been harassing and blackmailing local residents.
Officials reaffirmed that the security forces remain fully committed to elimina­ting the remaining milita­nts of Fitna al-Hindustan.
On Oct 1, security forces had killed 13 other alleged terrorists in separate operations in Quetta and Kech districts of Makran.
The operation in Aghbarg, on the outskirts of Quetta, was conducted a day after a car suicide attack on the headquarters of Frontier Corps (North) that claimed 10 lives, including four security personnel, and left 33 others injured.
Security forces foiled the attackers’ attempt to enter the FC headquarters and killed all five terrorists.
FIR registered
Meanwhile, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Balochistan Police has registered an FIR against the terrorists involved in the car suicide attack outside the FC headquarters and has lau­nched an investigation.
Official sources said the CTD has identified two terrorists who were killed by security forces as they attempted to enter the FC headquarters.
According to CTD sources, one of the terrorists belonged to the Mazai Adha area of Qila Abdullah district, bordering Afghanistan, and was identified as Sharifullah. The other terrorist was a resident of Chagai district, but his name has not yet been established.
 
 

Sources said CTD officials, along with other investigators, have been questioning Sharifullah’s family members. “The terrorist from Mazai Adha was also wanted by security forces in Karachi for his involvement in a previous terrorist attack there,” an official said.
Investigators have also approached the family of the other terrorist from Chagai. Security officials said the CTD identified both terrorists with the help of Nadra’s fingerprint records.
“The remains of the other terrorists killed in the gun battle with security forces have been sent to the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore for analysis,” the official added.
Meanwhile, security forces have sealed the area where the FC headquarters is located. Buildings badly damaged by the powerful explosions have also been sealed, and no one is being allowed to enter to access their offices.
The offices of Daily Mashriq and the private TV channel HUM were among those badly damaged and have been sealed by security forces.
Heavy traffic congestion was reported on several key roads due to the closure of routes passing near the FC headquarters.

The meeting that took place at their Jati Umra residence covered governance issues, including the ongoing acrimony with the PPP-led Sindh government over flood and canal issues.
“The premier told the PML-N president that the PPP was its coalition partner and for smooth functioning of the government bickering between the two parties should not linger on,” a source privy to the meeting between the two brothers told Dawn.
The source said PM Shehbaz wanted his elder brother to speak to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and convince her “to let go and reconcile with the PPP”. He said the premier “urged Nawaz Sharif to ask Maryam Nawaz to adopt a reconciliatory approach and end the ongoing acrimony with the PPP leadership over flood and canal issues.

Shehbaz, Dar to leave for Malaysia today

“Nawaz Sharif was also briefed on the PPP’s grievances over administrative and development-related matters, with both leaders agreeing that unity within the coalition was essential to sustain the government’s stability.”
However, in its official statement, the PML-N said the prime minister briefed the party chief on his recent foreign visits and provided a detailed update on the situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, including the outcome of successful negotiations with the protesters.
The war of words between the two coalition partners began over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River (six canals issue).
Maryam Nawaz told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself, while the latter had its lawmakers stay away from the National Assembly and Senate sessions to protest her diatribe and demanded apology from her.
However, CM Maryam declared she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst over flood and canal issues.
As the tensions escalated further, the PPP publicly repeated Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) allegations that Maryam Nawaz did not represent the people of Punjab stating that her government was a “by product of Form 47”.
PPP’s central information secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan said Maryam Nawaz, who called those raising public issues ‘the enemies of Punjab’, was herself the real problem of Punjab.
“The CM Punjab is demonstrating racist thinking to hide her failure to save the people from floodwaters,” he remarked.
PM’s Malaysia visit
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz would leave for Malaysia for a two-day visit at the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim from Oct 5 to 7, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday.
The FO said PM Shehbaz, Foreign Minister and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, federal ministers and senior government officials will depart for Malaysia on Sunday. “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” it added.
A PML-N statement said Mr Ibrahim had also extended an invitation to party chief and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif to visit Malaysia, but he said he would consider the visit at a more suitable time.

Israel did not immediately comment on the latest allegation, but its foreign ministry earlier described reports that detainees had been mistreated as “complete lies”.
The 137 activists who landed at Istanbul Airport included 36 Turkish nationals, as well as citizens from the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Morocco, Italy, Kuwait, Libya, Malaysia, Mauritania, Switzerland, Tunisia and Jordan.
Two of them, Hazwani Helmi, a Malaysian citizen, and Windfield Beaver, an American, said at the airport that they had witnessed Thunberg being mistreated, saying she was shoved and forced to wear an Israeli flag.
“It was a disaster. They treated us like animals,” said Helmi, 28, adding that detainees were not provided with clean food or water and that medication and belongings were confiscated.
Beaver, 43, said Thunberg was “treated terribly’’ and “used as propaganda”, describing how she was pushed into a room as Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir arrived.
Israel has faced international condemnation after its military intercepted all of about 40 boats in the Gaza-bound aid flotilla and detained more than 450 activists.
 
 

Its foreign ministry wrote on X that all detained activists were “safe and in good health”, adding it was keen to complete the remaining deportations “as quickly as possible”.
 






Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said 26 Italians were on board the Turkish Airlines flight, with another 15 still held in Israel and set to be expelled over the next few days.
“I have once again given instructions to the Italian embassy in Tel Aviv to ensure that the remaining compatriots are treated with respect for their rights,” Tajani wrote on X.
A first group of Italians from the flotilla — four parliamentarians — arrived in Rome on Friday.
“We were brutally stopped … brutally taken hostage,” said Benedetta Scuderi, one of the parliamentarians.
‘Zip-tied for five hours’
According to Adalah, an Israeli group offering legal assistance to flotilla members, some detainees were denied access to lawyers, water and medications.
They were also “forced to kneel with their hands zip-tied for at least five hours, after some participants chanted `Free Palestine’,” Adalah said.

Global equities in Sept­ember climbed 3.4pc. An index of developed market sovereign bonds rose around 0.7pc last month.
The JPMorgan note, which tracks hedge fund trading, said positioning in US stocks was only  “somewhat bullish”, indicating an expectation for equities to rise.
Crowding in the biggest “Magnificent Sev­en” tech stocks, which include Apple, Amazon and Nvidia, remained near historical highs, the note said.
In Europe, stock-pickers tended to bet that equities would rise. But multi-strategy funds — those that trade many strategies — and quantitative funds, which use algorithms, tended to wager that stock prices would decline.
In Asia, where stocks rose, hedge funds had more bets on a decline than a rise, the note said.

CAIRO: Over 60 people were killed in Gaza on Saturday as Israel went ahead with its bombardment in defiance of US President Donald Trump’s demand it stop bombing in response to a declaration by Hamas that it was ready to free prisoners under his plan to end the two-year-old conflict.
According to witnesses on the ground, 11 people died in sporadic incidents, while 10 people, including children, were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli strike on a house in Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City. The attack damaged several other buildings nearby.
The Gaza health ministry said in a morning update that Israeli fire had killed at least 66 Palestinians across the enclave over the past 24 hours.
Despite the Israeli action, President Trump said “I appreciate Israel has temporarily stopped the bombing”, and he urged Hamas to move quickly on his plan “or else all bets will be off”.
“I will not tolerate delay, which many think will happen, or any outcome where Gaza poses a threat again. Let’s get this done, FAST. Everyone will be treated fairly!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
 
 

Hamas had drawn a welcoming resp­onse from Trump on Friday by saying it accepted certain key parts of his 20-point peace proposal, including ending the conflict, Israel’s withdrawal and the rele­ase of prisoners, both Israeli and Palestinian.
In Washington, a White House official said Trump was sending his envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Egypt to finalise technical details regarding the release of Israeli prisoners and discuss a lasting “peace deal’.
Egypt’s state-affiliated television channel Al QaheraNews said Palestinian and Israeli delegations would also be present for “indirect talks” on the Trump plan.
Hamas’s response to the plan drew a chorus of optimistic statements by world leaders, who urged an end to the conflict.
Another possible boost to hopes came with a supportive statement from the Iran-backed Palestinian Islamic Jihad group, which is smaller than Hamas but seen as more hardline. The group, which also holds Israeli prisoners, endorsed Hamas’s response — a move that could help pave the way for the release of Israelis still held by both parties.
‘Immediate implementation’
Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli prisoners following Hamas’s response.
Shortly after, Israeli media reported that the country’s political echelon had instructed the military to reduce “offensive activity” in Gaza. Trump has invested significant political capital in efforts to end a conflict that has left Israel increasingly isolated on the world stage.
Dozens held in London
Police arrested an unspecified number of protesters for supporting a banned pro-Palestinian group at a demonstration in London on Saturday which went ahead despite requests to call it off after a deadly attack at a synagogue in Manchester two days ago.
Two people were killed in the attack in the north-western English city on Thursday and police shot dead the suspect, a British man of Syrian descent.
Organisers refused requests by police to call off Saturday’s demonstration, which had been announced before the Manchester attack, to protest the banning of pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action under anti-terrorism laws.
Calling for calm on X, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: “I urge anyone thinking about protesting this weekend to recognise and respect the grief of British Jews.
“This is a moment of mourning. It is not a time to stoke tension and cause further pain. It is a time to stand together.”
 






Police arrested protesters at Trafalgar Square, in central London, as they wrote slogans on placards declaring support for Palestine Action, which was proscribed in July after its members broke into an airbase and damaged military planes.
Hundreds gathered for the protest, applauding and cheering those arrested as they were carried through the crowd by police without resisting. Onlookers chanted “shame on you” at officers.
“I’m disgusted by the police actually, they shouldn’t be arresting non-violent protesters here,” said Angie Zelter. “We have a right to protest and Palestine Action is not a violent organisation, should never have been proscribed in the first place.”
The demonstration is the latest in a series of protests, during which hundreds have been arrested for defying the ban which makes it an offence to show support for Palestine Action. Police said Saturday’s protests would draw resources away from security they have tightened around synagogues and mosques following the attack in Manchester.

However, different countries have implemented various strategies to balance consumer demand, environmental concerns, and industrial priorities.
Experiences from India, Bangladesh, Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and the Philippines provide practical insights. Measures such as age limits, pre-export inspections, phased implementation, fiscal incentives, and administrative controls can guide Pakistan in maintaining quality, safeguarding the environment, and balancing consumer access with industrial protection.
As per a report of the Institute of Cost and Management (ICMA), Pakistan’s average import of used cars per year stood at 34,000 units followed by 21,802 by Thailand, 532 by Vietnam and 235 units by India.
Bangladesh permits the import of used cars under specific conditions to balance consumer demand with quality control and revenue generation. As of June 2025, vehicles must be no more than four years old, imported directly from the country of origin, and accompanied by a previous registration or de-registration certificate. The importation process involves customs duties, VAT, and mandatory inspections to ensure compliance with national standards.

Neighbours curb influx of old vehicles through age caps and safety checks

Sri Lanka lifted its five-year ban on private car and motorcycle imports in February 2025, allowing personal use vehicle imports under specific conditions. Individuals are permitted to import one vehicle per year, provided they use a registered vehicle importer. This phased reopening aims to stabilise the market and manage foreign exchange reserves while meeting consumer demand.
India enforces stringent regulations on the importation of used vehicles to protect its domestic automotive industry and ensure compliance with safety and environmental standards. As of 2024, used vehicles must be under three years old, right-hand drive, and meet specific engine capacity restrictions. The import ­process involves extensive documentation, high import duties (up to 125pc for used cars), and mandatory compliance testing. Additionally, a minimum ­roadworthiness period of five years is required from the date of ­importation.
Kenya has implemented a controlled liberalisation approach to used car imports, aiming to balance affordability with environmental and safety considerations. As of July 2025, only vehicles manufactured from July 2018 onward are eligible for import, effectively enforcing a rolling seven-year age limit. This policy is designed to improve air quality, reduce reliance on older vehicles, and support local vehicle assembly. Importers must comply with pre-export inspection requirements and domestic roadworthiness certification.
South Africa restricts used car imports to protect its domestic automotive manufacturing sector. Importation is generally allowed only under specific circumstances, such as for returning nationals or immigrants with permanent residence status.
These individuals may import one vehicle per family, subject to compliance with import duties and VAT. The importation process requires obtaining a permit and adhering to documentation requirements.
Nigeria has tightened its used vehicle import regulations to reduce the influx of older, potentially polluting cars. As of May 2025, only vehicles manufactured in 2015 or later are eligible for import without facing punitive duties. Vehicles older than 10 years are either barred or subjected to heavy import penalties. The import process requires specific documentation, including a bill of lading, bill of entry, marine insurance, and evidence of VAT payment.
 
 

In the Philippines, only qualified individuals may import used vehicles, and they must secure a Certificate of Authority to Import (CAI) from the Fair-Trade Enforcement Bureau (FTEB) of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) before the actual importation. Imported vehicles are subject to a 40pc customs duty, 10pc VAT, and an ad valorem tax ranging from 15pc to 100pc, depending on the vehicle’s piston displacement.
In the early 1990s, commercial imports of cars were largely prohibited to protect local assemblers. This resulted in fewer cars in the market, higher prices, and limited options for buyers.
In the early 2000s, growing demand for affordable cars led the government to allow imports under special schemes such as the Gift Scheme, Baggage Scheme, and Transfer of Residence Scheme, mainly for overseas Pakistanis. While these cars were meant for personal use, many entered the local market through dealers. Consumers gained more choice and prices dropped slightly, but local carmakers protested, saying these imports hurt their sales and investment.
In 2,005, the government reduced duties, making it easier to import used cars. Consumers accessed small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars, and imports rose quickly. By 2,008, local carmakers lobbied for tighter restrictions, leading to increased duties and a lower age limit for imports. This reduced imports and strengthened local manufacturer protection.
In 2012, the maximum age of imported used cars was cut from five years to three years, sharply reducing inflows. Simultaneously, the Automotive Development Policy (ADP) encouraged investment in local assembly. Some new entrants joined, but car prices remained high and choice limited.
During 2012-2020s, ongoing push and pull consumers continued to complain about high prices, limited choice, and lower safety standards than regional peers. Industry groups warned that too many imports could reduce local investment, slow parts production, and increase pressure on foreign exchange. The government alternated between relaxing and restricting imports, creating a cycle of
policy shifts.
In September 2025, the federal government had allowed commercial imports of used cars up to five years old. Duties will be reduced gradually.
The policy aims to protect local manufacturers, offer consumers more affordable choices, and ensure imported cars meet safety and environmental standards. This is a key step toward a more balanced automotive market.
Passenger vehicles under five years old can be imported commercially until June 30, 2026. A 40pc regulatory duty applies in the first year, reducing by 10pc each year until it reaches zero by FY30.
This phased approach helps balance consumer benefits with protection for local manufacturers. All imported vehicles must meet safety and emission standards, ensuring that older, unsafe, or inefficient vehicles do not enter the market.

A two-member bench, comprising Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech and Justice Sardar Ahmed Halimi issued the order while hearing a petition filed by Advocate Munir Ahmed Kakar on Saturday. Advocate Kakar contended in his petition that despite the passage of considerable time, the Bostan Special Economic Zone had yet to be completed and made fully operational.
During the hearing, Saadullah, Chief Finance Officer of the Industrial Estate Development and Management Company of BSEZ, informed the court that the zone has already become partially operational.
He said that three factories were currently functioning in the zone, while 12 others were under completion and would soon begin operations.

CJ Barech designates two special appellate courts for inheritance cases in Quetta

He further informed the court that upon completion, these projects would create 15,520 jobs, marking the start of a new era of industrial development in Balochistan.
He further said that all necessary facilities, including water and power supply, were being ensured. 
The BHC bench, after hearing arguments from both sides, directed the authorities concerned to expedite the remaining work and make the Bostan Special Economic Zone fully operational by Dec 15 deadline.
Officials said that a large number of industrialists were ready to set up industries in the Bostan Special Economic Zone once it became fully functional.
Appellate courts
Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech has also taken an important administrative step to ensure the effective, timely, and transparent hearing of inheritance cases by designating two special appellate courts in Quetta.
According to an official notification, under the directive of the Chief Justice, the courts of Additional District and Sessions Judge-VIII, Quetta, and Additional District and Sessions Judge-X, Quetta, have been assigned to exclusively hear and decide inheritance-related cases.
As per the decision, all pending inheritance cases previously under other Additional District and Sessions Judges in Quetta will now be transferred to these two designated courts.

Despite a mild appreciation of the rupee against the US dollar, uncertainty surrounding the exchange rate continues to prompt exporters to lock in future rates, as they fear potential volatility once current controls are eased.
Dealers in the inter-bank market said the exchange rate could shift if exchange rate management is relaxed. The prospect of International Monetary Fund (IMF) scrutiny over currency controls also adds to market concerns.
The Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan reports daily gains in the rupee’s value against the dollar, typically in the range of one to three paisas. However, currency dealers noted a sharp drop — between 50 to 60pc — in cash dollar sales by exchange companies.

Open market greenback inflows fall sharply

Some major open-market dealers said that dollar inflows have nearly dried up. Overseas Pakistanis, who previously sold dollars in the open market, are now holding back — a trend dealers describe as new and concerning. One dealer speculated that dollars intended for the open market may be diverted to informal channels.
 
 

Authorities remain vigilant. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the government have maintained strict oversight to prevent illegal currency activity. Dealers said sales of dollars by exchange companies to banks have also declined sharply, while inflows through authorised money changers are down. However, remittance inflows via formal banking channels have remained stable compared to the same period in FY25.
Bankers stated that the decline in dollar sales in the open market is not linked to changes in government incentives for banks and exchange companies. Official data shows no decrease in remittances during July and August.
While the government has made efforts to lower the exchange rate, it has not achieved the desired results. Following crackdowns earlier in the current fiscal year, the dollar has weakened against the rupee in both the inter-bank and open markets.
Currency stability has been supported by the SBP’s higher foreign exchange reserves, steady remittance inflows, and improved diplomatic relations with the United States and China.
However, exporters’ growing use of forward contracts suggests ongoing concerns about exchange rate management.
The SBP has maintained market liquidity rather than suppressing it to lower the rupee-dollar rate artificially.
Dealers said the central bank has slowed its dollar purchases from the inter-bank market to avoid putting pressure on the exchange rate. Still, the risk of renewed central bank buying remains a factor prompting exporters to hedge in the forward market.

Speaking to the police officers and personnel during his first visit to Khuzdar on Saturday, the IGP said that enforcing the law and maintaining order were police’s top priorities. He said Balochistan’s identity is built on mutual respect and traditions that uphold justice, and  values of honour, courage, and hospitality.
 
 

IG Tahir said that the people have rendered great sacrifices for peace, and the history written by the martyrs through their sacrifices is commendable. “The forces we are confronting may have deep roots, but we are determined to uproot them completely,” he added.
He emphasised that Balochistan is a bouquet of diversity, and its beauty lies in upholding the rule of law. “It is essential to distinguish between criminals and ordinary citizens, as in this age, the real strength lies with the people,” he stated.

Unlike commodity exports, services exports have recorded positive growth since the beginning of FY26. In July, services exports rose by 18.27pc year-on-year.
According to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the growth was primarily driven by telecommunication, computer, and information services in July FY26.
In August, services exports reached $671.98 million, up from $619.94m in the same month last year. However, on a month-on-month basis, services exports declined by 7.30pc.

Trade deficit widened amid rising imports in 2MFY26

In rupee terms, exports increased by 9.85pc to Rs189.662 billion in August FY26, compared to Rs172.651bn in August FY25. This indicates a steady upward trend in services exports during the current fiscal year.
During the first two months (July-August) of FY26, services exports totalled $1.396bn, showing an increase of 11.73pc from $1.250bn in the same period last year.
In FY25, Pakistan’s services exports grew by 9.23pc to $8.39bn from $7.68bn a year earlier.
The services sector has shown consistent growth since February 2024, largely due to a surge in IT and other business services exports. However, there was a 6.50pc decline in August 2024.
According to State Bank of Pakistan data, exports of telecommunications, computer, and information services rose to $691m in July—August FY26 from $584m in the same period last year, reflecting a growth of 18.32pc.
Exports of other business services increased by 16.66pc to $301m in 2MFY26, compared to $258m last year. However, transport services exports fell by 4.62pc to $124m from $130m.
Travel services exports declined sharply by 18.91pc to $90m in July–August FY26, compared to $111m in the corresponding period last year.
On the import side, services imports surged by 13.36pc to $1.108bn in August FY26, compared to $978.19m a year ago. Month-on-month, imports rose by 11.43pc.
In the first two months of FY26, services imports reached $2.104bn, up 13.43pc from $1.855bn during the same period last year.
Transport services imports declined by 7.03pc to $766m in 2MFY26, down from $824m last year. In contrast, travel services imports more than doubled, reaching $735m in 2MFY26 from $361m — a growth of 103.6pc.
As a result, the services trade deficit widened by 16.94pc to $707.23m in 2MFY26, compared to $604.79m in the same period last year.

KHUNJERAB Top sees season’s first snowfall, blanketing area near Pakistan-China Gate.—Courtesy GB tourist police

GILGIT: The upper areas of Gilgit-Baltistan on Saturday received the first snowfall of the season, which is seen as a positive sign after years of delayed snowfall linked to climate change that has disrupted the fragile ecosystem and worried local communities.
The lower areas rec­eived scattered rain on Friday and Saturday, bringing a noticeable drop in temperature. According to locals, the areas situated above 12,000 feet, including Khunjerab Top and Babusar Top, received the first snowfall of the season. The snow-covered landscape pushed temperatures below freezing.
 
 

Tourist police said traffic at Babusar Top had been closed at night due to fears of slippery conditions. The Babusar Road, which usually remains open from June to November, is a key route for tourists and local passengers travelling between Gilgit-Baltistan and other parts of the country.
Similarly, the Khunjerab Top area also received up to three inches of snowfall, disrupting travel for vehicles moving between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass. Many areas of Gilgit, Hunza, Nagar, Diamer, Astore and Baltistan divisions received scattered rain, forcing residents to wear warm clothes and make heating arrangements at homes.
 
 

Gilgit-Baltistan experienced devastating floods this summer caused by rapid glacier melt, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), cloudbursts, and landslides. Over 50 people, including tourists, lost their lives, while infrastructure, agricultural land, forests, and private properties worth billions of rupees were destroyed.
In July, temperatures in Chilas soared to 48.5°C — the highest since July 17, 1997, when it reached 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature hit 46.1°C, the highest since 1971. Experts believe that the region, one of the most environmentally sensitive in the world, has been experiencing severe climate change impacts in recent decades. Over the past decade, snowfall in GB has been delayed until late December or even March.
Experts warn that this shift in weather patterns prevents snow from compacting into stable ice, and with the onset of heatwaves, unstable snow melts rapidly, triggering flash floods and Glof events.
Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn that climate change has severely affected the fragile ecosystem of GB, home to over 8,000 glaciers, 30,000 glacial lakes, countless mountains, and vast pastures.
He said unplanned development, rapid tourism, and construction in forested and green-belt areas are damaging the region’s environment. He stressed GB’s vulnerability to climate change and its crucial role as Pakistan’s “water tower,” feeding the Indus River, which supports 70 per cent of the country’s agriculture and 40pc of its hydropower.

According to a notification issued by the cabinet division, Mr Sadiq will perform the functions of the acting president under Article 49(2) of the Cons­titution. He will continue to discharge these responsibilities until the president and Senate chairman return to the country.
After taking charge, Mr Sadiq welcomed the successful negotiations between the government’s negotiation committee and the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee in AJK.
He described the agreement between the two sides as a positive and constructive development, stressing that the restoration of peace and normalcy in the region was a matter of great satisfaction.
Mr Sadiq said that with the successful negotiations, all baseless rumours and conspiracies against Pakis­tan had been laid to rest.
He commended both the government’s negotiation team and the committee for their responsible and result-oriented approach.
The acting president reiterated that public welfare and peace remain the government’s top priority. He urged all stakeholders to focus on unity and national development rat­her than giving attention to unfounded rumours.
“Pakistan and Kashmir are inseparable. The protection of the rights of the Kashmiri people will always remain our foremost priority,” he added.

The index gained 6,733 points or 4.15pc on a weekly basis to settle at 168,990, according to data compiled by Arif Habib Ltd. The rally was primarily driven by continued buying by mutual funds and individual invest­ors, supported by limited returns on fixed-income instruments and optim­i­­sm around ­mac­roeconomic indicators.
The IMF, while acknowledging progress in fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, highlighted persistent vulnerabilities in the external account. The Fund emphasised the need for sustained reforms amid high inflation and external debt challenges. Markets remain closely attuned to the review’s outcome, which is critical for the release of the next $1.2bn tranche.
Investor sentiment was further buoyed by a high-profile meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and US President Donald Trump in Washington, interpreted by analysts as a signal of improving international engagement. AKD Securities noted that despite a 19.8pc drop in market participation, confidence remained intact, with average daily volume reaching 1.8bn shares and value at Rs72bn.

KSE-100 index rises over 6,700 points to 168,990 in a week

On the macroeconomic front, inflation rose to 5.6pc year-on-year in Sep­tember, up from 3pc in August — the highest level in 10 months. Ana­l­y­sts attributed the rise partly to post-flood effects and supply-side pressures.
In the government’s latest T-bill auction, yields increased across all tenors — one-month (up 41bps), three-month (20bps), six-month (21bps), and 12-month (19bps). The State Bank raised Rs730.4bn against a target of Rs750bn, with total participation at Rs1.49tr, indicating robust demand amid expectations of a stable policy rate in the near term.
Pakistan’s trade deficit widened to $3.3bn in September, up 46pc year-on-year and 16pc month-on-month. This took the 1QFY26 trade gap to $9.4bn — a 33pc increase from the same period last year. September exports stood at $2.5bn, down 11.7pc year-on-year, while imports rose to $5.8bn, up 14pc.
Foreign exchange reserves rose slightly to $19.80bn, including SBP-held reserves of $14.40bn, with the rupee appreciating marginally by 0.03pc to close the week at Rs281.37 against the dollar.
Sector-wise, cement dispatches totalled 4.25m tonnes in September, up 7.05pc year-on-year, driven by a 14pc rise in domestic demand. First-quarter FY26 dispatches reached 12.16m tonnes, up 16.3pc from 10.46m tonnes in the same period last year.
Petroleum sales rose 8pc year-on-year in September to 1.37m tonnes, led by higher demand for petrol and high-speed diesel. However, furnace oil volumes declined due to a reduction in power generation usage. Total petroleum sales in 1QFY26 rose 6pc to 3.89m tonnes.
In the fertiliser segment, urea sales rose 17pc year-on-year to 429,000 tonnes in September, while DAP sales fell 47pc to 71,000 tonnes, reflecting weak farm economics and lower imports.
The KSE-100 index is currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 8.5x for 2026, slightly below its 15-year average of 8.59x. Dividend yields remain attractive at around 6pc, close to the long-term average.
Brokerages expect the upward momentum to continue if the IMF review concludes smoothly and global credit agencies maintain their improved outlook on Pakistan. Limited alternative investment avenues and attractive equity valuations are likely to keep investor interest intact in the near term.

This year’s festivities for the 12th of Rabiul Awwal — the third month of the Islamic lunar calendar — gained greater prominence due to the milestone of 15 centuries having passed since the Holy Prophet’s birth.
India, with the world’s third-largest Muslim population, also saw the day being observed in areas with Muslim residents, such as the city of Kanpur in the state of Uttar Pradesh. And it is here, where the sequence of events began that subsequently triggered “crackdowns, FIRs (first information reports), detentions, arrests, internet shutdowns, political sparring and a wave of protests” from UP, Uttarakhand, Gujarat to Maharashtra, according to Indian media outlet The Wire.
The Frontline reported that Zafar Wali Gali, a lane in Syed Nagar in Kanpur’s Rawatpur area, was decorated for Eid-i-Miladun Nabi on Sept 4 and a lightboard with the slogan, “I Love Muhammad”, was installed at the entrance to the street.
Indian media outlets reported that the installation stoked tensions between the Muslim and Hindu communities, with some people from the latter objecting to the lightboard’s installation at the entrance due to it being a “new tradition”.
Police were subsequently deployed as tensions increased and the lightboard was eventually taken down and moved elsewhere.
Police alleged that unknown youngsters tore down Hindu posters on the path of a Muslim procession on Sept 5, but the event culminated peacefully without incident.
However, “on Sept 9, acting on a complaint by Sub-Inspector Pankaj Sharma, the local police lodged FIRs against 24 individuals for allegedly disturbing communal harmony,” Frontline reported, adding that the police said the cases did not target the slogan but the alleged attempts to disturb communal peace by installing tents and banners at a non-traditional location on a route traditionally used for Ram Navami processions.
The Kanpur police claimed the case was registered only after a review of the CCTV footage “confirmed deliberate acts intended to disturb communal harmony”, The Wire reported.
One of the individuals nominated in the FIR was quoted as saying by the outlet: “Police are harassing us. Why are they not showing videos, photos, or CCTV footage of us tearing any Hindu banners? Nothing unlawful happened, and many of the named accused were not even present there in procession.
“Last year, we displayed the same message on a cloth banner, and no one raised objections. This year, we used a light board, and suddenly, people started protesting. I don’t understand why.”
Another local booked by police, a prayer leader, expressed his befuddlement to the outlet, saying he was approached by the police during the communal negotiations and he did not understand why he was nominated in the case. “This FIR is completely baseless and fake, no Hindu religious posters were torn,” he told the outlet.
Free Press Kashmir reported that the issue gained increased attention when All India Majlis-i-Ittehadul Muslimeen President and lawmaker Asaduddin Owaisi chief Asaduddin Owaisi said in a post on X on Sept 15, “I love Muhammad”, adding that doing so was not a crime and tagging the Kanpur police directly.
 






“His post triggered more debate and drew national focus to the incident,” the outlet reported, adding that the slogan soon spread to other districts and states, including Uttarakhand, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Telangana.
According to The Wire, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR) documented nationwide cases and arrests related to the row, with the association recording at least 21 FIRs naming 1,324 people and resulting in 38 arrests by Sept 23.
“Most cases were in Uttar Pradesh, including Kaiser­ganj (355 accused people), Shahjahanpur (200), Baghpat (150), Kanpur (24), Kaushambi (3), Unnao (8), Maharajganj (64), Pilibhit (9), and Varanasi (1). Other states included Godhra, Gujarat (88), Kashipur, Uttarakhand (401), and Byculla, Maharashtra (1). These figures, shared by the APCR on social media and confirmed by its office bearer, did not include cases filed in Bareilly between September 26-27,” the outlet reported.
 






With several incidents of protests or communal clashes since then, the next major flashpoint that occurred was in Uttar Pradesh’s city of Bareilly, when a public demonstration called by Ittehad-i-Millat Council (IMC) chief Maulana Tauqeer Raza Khan was disrupted by violence.
The cleric had urged the Muslim community to join the campaign, professing the slogan and to gather at Islamia Ground before submitting a memorandum addressed to the president, but the call was taken back due to a lack of permission from the administrative authorities.
 






Despite this, “hundreds of people” gathered near Islamic Ground on Sept 26 after Friday prayers and began to converge at the assembly point. Clashes soon erupted as police faced off against the demonstrators, with stones being pelted, shots being fired and tear gas shelling and baton charges used to disperse the crowd. Several arrests were made, including the IMC chief.
 






The Wire reported that by Sept 27, internet services were suspended, arrests followed and a large police contingent was stationed in the town. It said the IMC chief had criticised the police action as being targeted towards Muslims, adding that the situation soon “quickly acquired a political dimension” when Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath condemned the clashes as a “well-orchestrated attempt to disrupt social harmony” at a public event the same day.
“Maulana had forgotten who is in power,“ the outlet quoted the right-wing CM as saying, adding that he asserted that the government would act firmly against those who hold the system hostage through street unrest.
 






“Whenever a Hindu festival or celebration approaches, they get overheated. To cool them down, we have to do some denting and painting … The lesson we have taught them will make future generations think twice before rioting,” he was quoted as saying by Frontline.
Meanwhile, police and officials said legal action was launched in connection with the clashes and 10 cases were registered across various police stations by Sept 27 with eight individuals sent to judicial custody and a total of 39 people detained in the crackdown.
The Uttar Pradesh chief minister’s comments and the state response generated criticism from both within party ranks and outside.
Jahanzaib Sirwal, a local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader from Indian-occupied Kashmir, called for an impartial investigation to hold all wrongdoers accountable and not just one community.
“What was a simple, heartfelt act of faith has been met with FIRs, detentions and inflammatory rhetoric, including Adityanath’s remarks about ‘denting-painting’ and teaching lessons to generations,” said the BJP leader.
He added that such statements were divisive and also an “affront to the constitutional right under Article 25 to freely practice and profess one’s religion”. Expressing his displeasure, Sirwal also threatened to resign from the party over Adityanath’s “unacceptable” remarks and the “vindictive” attitude of the state police against the Muslim community.
Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav criticised the government’s response soon after the crackdown. “The government’s display of power is a sign of its weakness. Governments run not through baton charges but through harmony and goodwill. Utterly condemnable!” he said on X.
 






Jamat-i-Islami Vice President Professor Salim Engineer slammed the police action in Kanpur and other instances against protesters as a “blatant attempt” to suppress the Muslim community’s voice.
“The statements by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath regarding Kanpur and its aftermath clearly indicate the ruling dispensation’s attitude. When people protested this government’s attitude and the administration’s unfair action in Kanpur, authorities attempted to suppress them. We witnessed the violence in Bareilly and the police brutality against protesters. They appear to want to send a message, to make this a lesson for Muslims,” Engineer was quoted as saying by Frontline.
Meanwhile, The Times of India reported that All India Muslim Jamaat President Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Bareilvi called the incidents “unfortunate” and urged people to uphold peace.
“The incident is unfortunate. Such incidents should not occur on either side. I appeal to everyone to uphold peace. The only way to love the messenger of Islam is to not hurt anyone, neither through words nor through actions and uphold peace. He has given a message of peace to the entire world. So, I urge all Muslims to maintain law and order, not take law into their hands and not cause conflicts with anyone —neither with the police nor with the administration… Follow what the messenger of Islam said and the path he showed. This is the biggest love,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-04 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04232936291465c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946578/three-held-by-nccia-in-abbottabad-for-alleged-gang-rape-blackmail-of-minor-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three held by NCCIA in Abbottabad for alleged gang-rape, blackmail of minor: police</strong></a><br><p>The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) on Saturday arrested three people suspected of gang-raping and blackmailing a minor in Abbottabad, according to a police official.
Haripur Sub-Inspector (SI) Basit Ashraf said in a statement that the suspects were part of a gang who allegedly raped a minor boy at gunpoint and filmed the assault, using the footage as blackmail.
“The NCCIA carried out an operation in Abbottabad,” he was quoted as saying. “The NCCIA registered a case against nine suspects … they assaulted the victim multiple times and blackmailed him and his family with the videos.”
SI Ashraf said that the suspects allegedly shared the videos on WhatsApp and used them to blackmail the victim’s family.
“Mobile phones and pornographic videos were recovered from the suspects during the raids,” he stated, adding that they would be used as evidence.
In July, Haripur police arrested a seminary teacher for allegedly sexually abusing a visually-impaired five-year-old child in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur area, police said.
A first information report (FIR) was filed by the victim’s uncle at Saddar police station on July 10 under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code (rape) and Section 53 (sexual abuse) of the KP Child Protection Act (CPA).
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, the Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in the year 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.</p><small>2025-10-04 19:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626973-rain-likely-in-karachi-within-next-24-hours-ndma' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi likely to receive rain in next 24 hours: NDMA</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, the FO said that a high-level delegation comprising the PM, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and other federal ministers and senior government officials will depart on Sunday.
“The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors,” the statement read.
 






According to the FO, PM Shehbaz will hold bilateral talks with Malaysian PM Ibrahim and discuss key regional and global developments, as well as enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, the Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people ties.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of Agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
Earlier this month, Malaysian High Commissioner to Pakistan Dato’ Mohammad Azhar Mazlan said that there is a great deal of commonality and potential for bilateral exchanges between Kuala Lumpur and Islamabad.
“Malaysia takes pride in its association with Pakistan since August 31, 1957, when we gained independence. Pakistan was one of the earliest countries to recognise Malaysia as a nation. Justice Abdul Hamid of Pakistan also helped Malaysia in drafting its constitution,“ Mazlan said at an event in Karachi.</p><small>2025-10-04 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04222201347e704.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946576/pakistani-film-bags-maiden-accolade-at-jackson-wild-media-awards' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani film bags maiden accolade at Jackson Wild Media Awards</strong></a><br><p>Pakistani film Moklani: The Last Mohanas has won the country’s first-ever award at the Jackson Wild Media Awards, according to a press release from production company Jawad Sharif Films.
Formed in 1991 as the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film Festival, the Jackson Wild Media Awards recognise achievements in wildlife filmmaking. According to the group’s website, it works to “maximise the impact of storytelling that highlights our urgent and collective responsibility to protect and restore our planet”.
According to the press release, the film — directed and produced by award-winning filmmaker Jawad Sharif — was chosen from a pool of over 500 entries and declared the winner in the Global Voices Category at the Awards Gala in Jackson, Wyoming, on October 2.
“Over 200 international judges screened more than 1,000 hours of media before selecting the film as [the] winner in the Global Voices Category,” the press release read.
“The film tells the story of the Mohanas of Manchar Lake, an indigenous fisher
folk community whose centuries-old way of life is disappearing,” the press release read. “Mohanas face shrinking waters, toxic pollution, and the erosion of their unique cultural heritage.”
Manchar Lake lies 18 kilometres west of Sehwan Sharif on the Indus Highway. It is claimed to be one of the biggest freshwater lakes in Pakistan, and the only lake that is home to fishermen living on wooden boathouses for hundreds of years.
 


The press release added that the film was produced with the support of the National Geographic Society and Climate Kahani.
“Moklani is both a visually striking and deeply human portrait of a community on the brink of cultural extinction,” the press release read. “Their struggle reflects the larger climate crisis Pakistan is experiencing.”
Sharif said that the film gave a voice to a community “the world is in danger of forgetting”.
“Their story reflects the urgent realities of climate change, cultural loss, and
the need to preserve both humanity and nature,” he was quoted as saying in the press release. “To see their story recognised on a global stage is deeply humbling. This recognition, above all, belongs to the Mohana community.”
Based in Islamabad, Jawad Sharif Films is an award-winning production house renowned for documentaries on culture, social justice, and climate change, including films such as 2015’s K2 and the Invisible Footmen, 2018’s Indus Blues and 2021’s Natari.</p><small>2025-10-04 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0421454355511cc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946574/43-magnititude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-kp-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>4.3-magnititude earthquake jolts parts of KP: PMD</strong></a><br><p>A 4.3-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday night, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said.

“The scenes that Pakistan’s ill-wishers wanted to see, the unrest, chaos and disorder in AJK, their conspiracy has failed. The federal government will fully implement the commitments it has made, and with the 15-day mechanism that has been established, I am confident that there will be no further opportunity for such grievances to arise again,” said the minister while addressing a press conference following the agreement between the two sides.
Iqbal was accompanied by Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam and PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira.
The signing of the agreement comes after two rounds of talks between the high-level government delegation and the JAAC in as many days.
Talks between the JAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers over elite privileges and reserved seats for refugees broke down last week. Since then, rival groups since staged protests, trading blame for violence that marred what began as a largely peaceful movement in AJK. Fierce clashes between protesters and law enforcers have left at least 10 people dead and scores critically injured in the territory.
Iqbal added that following the successful conclusion of talks between the two sides, peace has been restored in the region. Iqbal expressed satisfaction over the dialogue process and said it was “conducted keeping in view the interests of the people of Azad Kashmir and the interests of Pakistan”.
Acknowledging administrative weaknesses, the minister said government organs should be more responsive. “The people are now more aware, the media has made them more informed and their expectations have increased greatly.”
Kaira said following the agreement, the people of AJK “breathed a sigh of relief today” and added that the mechanism established must succeed as “we have no other option other than to ensure its success”.
A high-level federal government delegation earlier today signed an agreement with JAAC to end days of unrest in AJK, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying that “all issues have been resolved amicably”.
A day earlier, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) had said it was “deeply alarmed“ by the ongoing violence in AJK, and condemned the “use of excessive force” and the communications blackout.
In a post on social media platform X during the early hours of Saturday following day-long talks, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said — who was part of the government negotiating committee — said: “Our negotiation delegation has signed on a final agreement with the AJK Joint Action Committee. The protesters are returning to their homes. All roads have reopened.”
 
 

“This is a victory of peace. Long live Azad Kashmir,” the minister added. Chaudhry also shared a copy of the pact on X, which listed 12 “decisions” taken and 13 “additional points”.
Under the agreement, it was decided that first information reports (FIRs) would be registered under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) on the “incidents of violence and vandalism resulting into deaths of personnel belonging to LEAs (law enforcement agencies) and protestors”, with a judicial commission appointed where required.
“Persons killed in the incidents of October 1 and 2, 2025 shall be compensated with monetary benefits equivalent to LEAs,” the pact read, adding that gunshot injuries would be compensated with Rs1 million per person, while a government job would be granted to one of the family members of each dead person within 20 days.
 






Chaudhry, Kashmir Affairs Minister Amir Muqam, Interprovincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Religious Affairs Minister Sardar Yousaf, former adviser to prime minister on Kashmir affairs Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-AJK president Masood Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf were part of the government’s negotiating team.
 
 

From the AJK government’s side, Education Minister Diwan Ali Chugtai and Local Government Minister Faisal Rathore took part in the talks, according to a copy of the signed pact shared by Chaudhry.
Raja Amjad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir and Anjum Zaman Awan represented the JAAC.
On September 25, a deadlock emerged between the AJK government and the JAAC over the abolition of elite privileges and seats reserved for the Pakistan-based refugees from India-occupied Kashmir.
Subsequently, a shutter-down strike had paralysed AJK under a communications blackout since the start of this week as the JAAC continued for the acceptance of its 38-point charter of demands.
Conspiracies now stand buried as issues resolved amicably: PM Shehbaz
Welcoming the agreement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement said “all conspiracies and rumours now stand buried and issues have been resolved amicably”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
He appreciated the members of the federal government’s negotiation committee and the JAAC for signing the pact to “settle all issues”.
Terming it an achievement for Pakistan and AJK, the premier said the “restoration of peace and normalcy is a good gesture”, the report added.
 






PM Shehbaz asserted that the government “is ever ready to resolve issues of Kashmiri brethren as public interest and service are among our top priorities”.
He appealed to Kashmiris not to pay heed to rumours, affirming that the government had “always protected” their rights and will also ensure them in the future.
On Thursday, PM Shehbaz had expressed deep concern over the unrest in AJK, directing the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad and find an immediate and lasting solution to the issues.
‘Pakistan, AJK & democracy wins’: Ahsan Iqbal
Iqbal also welcomed the development, writing on X: “Pakistan, AJK and democracy wins.”
He stressed that the people of AJK had “always stood at the frontlines of Pakistan’s national cause, and their voice carries immense weight”.
 






Noting that the nation “saw a difficult situation emerge due to legitimate public concerns”, the planning minister commended the “wisdom of local and national leadership and the spirit of dialogue that enabled us to resolve this stand-off peacefully, without violence, without division, and with mutual respect”.
He highlighted that the resolution of the issue showed that “when the government listens, and when the people engage constructively, we can find solutions together”.
“The Joint Action Committee raised voice of citizens, and the government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took these voices seriously. Instead of confrontation, we chose consultation. Instead of egos, we chose empathy. We commit to work together for good governance and development in AJK,” Iqbal added.</p><small>2025-10-04 16:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626969-indian-forces-kill-injure-goats-near-zero-point-in-tharparkar' target='_blank'><strong>Indian forces kill, injure goats near Zero Point in Tharparkar</strong></a><br><p>

The war of words between the two sides, that kicked off over flood compensation, expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
In response, the PPP had lawmakers stay away from parliamentary proceedings to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs met in Islamabad on Wednesday to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces.
However, she declared a day ago that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47.
In a statement issued today, the PPP leader said her remarks regarding the controversial canal project were a “violation of the CCI’s decision and an insult to the constitutional forum”.
The party demanded that PML-N President Nawaz Sharif take notice of her remarks and clarify the party’s policy. It also demanded that the Punjab government disclose the aid provided to flood victims.
 






The now-shelved six-canals project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh, which are governed by the PML-N and PPP, respectively. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“The CCI, a constitutional forum, has already rejected and buried the controversial canal project,” reiterated the PPP leader.
“Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz is not above the CCI’s constitutional forum, and Maryam Nawaz holds no standing alone against the CCI.”
He said it was the CCI’s unanimous decision that no canal project would be built until all provinces agreed, adding that Sindh would not accept the project under any circumstances.
Khuhro further said that Maryam was violating the forum’s decision and insulting it with her remarks about the project, adding that she “lacks political wisdom”, which is why she was criticising a constitutional forum.
He said Nawaz was the PML-N’s leader and should take notice of his daughter’s remarks and clarify the party’s stance on the issue.
“Sindh will not allow anyone to plunder the water of its Indus River, nor will it allow any dam to be built on the Indus River.
“Constitutionally, the province of Sindh, being at the tail end, has the first right to water, and any attack on Sindh’s water share will be considered an attack on the unity of Sindh and the country.”
He further alleged that CM Maryam was “frightened by the growing popularity” of the PPP in Punjab, which is why she was opposing the process of providing relief to flood victims through the Benazir Income Support Programme.
“Punjab is not the fiefdom of any single party; the PPP, along with every political party, has the right to engage in political activities in Punjab.”
Criticising her administration’s flood relief and rescue efforts, he added her “hollow claims” about her performance are “limited to TV channels only” and stood “exposed”.
“Punjab’s flood victims are still waiting and yearning for aid and relief.”
“If the Punjab CM is providing complete relief and aid to flood victims, she should disclose it to the nation,” he said.
US commits $1m to Unicef flood response
Meanwhile, a press release from Uncief issued a day ago said the United States has committed $1 million to support the organisation’s emergency response for children and families affected by the recent floods in Pakistan.
Unicef said it would reach over 65,000 people, including pregnant women and children, with life-saving nutrition and water, sanitation, and hygiene support through the contribution.
It explained that it would screen 32,500 children for malnutrition, provide treatment to 2,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition and deliver multi-micronutrient supplements to 32,500 children and 32,500 pregnant and breastfeeding women and caregivers.
Furthermore, over 50,000 people would gain access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, including restoration of damaged water systems, installation of temporary toilets, and distribution of hygiene kits.
“Children are always the most vulnerable in emergencies, facing the compounded threats of malnutrition and deadly waterborne diseases. This timely support from the United States enables us to deliver life-saving services and help restore dignity and hope to families who have suffered loss and displacement, as they begin the difficult journey of recovery,” the press release quoted Pernille Ironside, Unicef representative in Pakistan, as saying.</p><small>2025-10-04 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/042007074f4be59.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946566/new-normal-of-response-army-warns-future-pak-india-conflict-might-lead-to-cataclysmic-devastation' target='_blank'><strong>‘New normal of response’: Army warns future Pak-India conflict might lead to ‘cataclysmic devastation’</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan military warned on Saturday that any future conflict with India could lead to “cataclysmic devastation” and the country will “resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint”.
The statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) comes in the wake of provocative remarks by top Indian civil-military leadership and stressed that Pakistan would “not hold back” in such a case.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint.”
 






Indian media outlet NDTV reported a day ago that Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi warned Pakistan that it must stop state-sponsored terrorism if it wanted to retain its place on the map. According to the report, Gen Dwivedi said Indian forces would “not show any restraint this time”, potentially hinting at another military incursion.
The same day, Indian Air Force Chief Amar Preet Singh also claimed, without evidence, that his country “downed five Pakistani fighter jets of the F-16 and JF-17 class” during the intense fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Meanwhile, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh delivered a speech earlier this week, with clips posted on his X account, in which he said: “Our soldiers have both weapons and high morale. No challenge can stand before us. Whether it is terrorism or any other kind of problem, we have the capability to deal with and defeat them all.”
In its statement today, the ISPR said that this time, “we shall shatter the myth of geographic immunity, hitting the farthest reaches of the Indian territory.
“As for the talk of erasing Pakistan from the map, India must know that if the situation comes, the erasure will be mutual.”
It added that “those seeking to establish a new normal must know that Pakistan has established a new normal of response , which will be swift, decisive and destructive”.
The military’s media wing warned that the nation and military had the “capability and resolve to take the fight to every nook and corner of the enemy’s territory” in the face of unwarranted threats and reckless aggression.
The ISPR further said the military had noted with “grave concern” the “delusional, provocative and jingoistic statements coming from the highest levels of the Indian security establishment”.
It added that such “irresponsible statements” indicated a “renewed attempt at fabricating arbitrary pretexts for aggression”, warning that any such prospect might lead to “serious consequences for peace and stability” in South Asia.
“For decades, India has benefitted from playing the victim card and painting Pakistan in negative light, while stoking violence and perpetrating terrorism in South Asia and beyond.”
The military’s media wing added that India’s narrative has been sufficiently debunked and “now the world recognises India as the true face of cross-border terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability”.
“Earlier this year, the Indian aggression against Pakistan brought two nuclear powers to the brink of a major war.  However, India seems to have forgotten the wreckage of its fighter jets and the wrath of Pakistan’s long range vectors. Suffering from collective amnesia, India now seems to be aching for the next round of confrontation.”
The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan has denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire. In the immediate aftermath of the conflict, Pakistan said it took down six Indian fighter jets during the conflict, including the French-made Rafale. New Delhi acknowledged “some losses” during the conflict but denied losing six jets.
In August, Pakis­tan added a new arm to its military, the Army Rocket Force Command, that was tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India.
The timing of the announcement was significant as it came almost three months after the four-day conflict. It was the Pakistan Air Force’s early successes that tipped the balance in Pakistan’s favour, but operational lessons learned during the conflict necessitated the formation of the new fighting arm within the army.
The new command is responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines. The idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger.</p><small>2025-10-04 15:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626960-military-warns-india-of-cataclysmic-devastation-over-provocative-jingoistic-statements' target='_blank'><strong>Military warns India of 'cataclysmic devastation' over provocative, jingoistic statements</strong></a><br><p>

This comes a day after the Pakistan High Commission in London announced that the national carrier would resume flight operations to the UK this month as PIA received its Foreign Aircraft Operating Permit from the UK Civil Aviation Authority and Third Country Operator approval, but no exact date was given.
PIA announced its “historic return” to British skies with a post on X today, which read: “The wait is finally over! Pakistan International Airlines proudly reconnects Manchester and Islamabad, bringing loved ones closer once again.”
 






In yesterday’s announcement, the high commission said flight operations to Manchester would be resumed during the first phase, after which Birmingham and London would follow suit.
In July, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
The development came after the UK Department for Transport concluded an aviation security ins­pection at Islamabad Inter­nat­ional Airport on Thursday, declaring Pakistan’s security arrangements “satisfactory and in line with international standards”.
The national carrier was banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the United States in June 2020, a month after one of its Airbus A-320s plunged into Karachi’s Model Colony, killing nearly 100 people.
The ban followed the grounding of 262 pilots whose licences then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan termed “dubious”.
The ban on operating in Europe was lifted in November 2024.</p><small>2025-10-04 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/04174114b7e118e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946557/islamabad-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-imran-riaz-khan-kp-anti-graft-officials' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court issues arrest warrants for Imran Riaz Khan, KP anti-graft officials</strong></a><br><p>A district and sessions court in Islamabad issued bailable arrest warrants for YouTuber Imran Riaz Khan and two officials from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s anti-corruption body, it emerged on Saturday.
The arrest warrants, issued by Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah yesterday and available with Dawn.com, were issued for Khan, head of the Directorate of Anti-Corruption Sadeeq Anjam and Adviser to the KP Chief Minister on Anti-Corruption Musaddiq Abbasi, over their alleged involvement in a social media campaign against Islamabad Judge Humayun Dilawar.
Dilawar was the judge who convicted PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan in the Toshakhana case in 2023 and sentenced him to three years in prison.
All three warrants were issued under Sections 20 (offences against dignity of a natural person), 24 (cyber stalking) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 and Sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), 505 (statement conducing to public mischief) and 506ii (punishment for criminal intimidation if threat be to cause death or grievous hurt, etc) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
There was no date given by which the three men needed to be produced before the court.
A day prior, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) dismissed a petition seeking to quash a cybercrime case registered against a petitioner accused of running the campaign.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas, in a detailed judgement, ruled that the first information report (FIR) could not be quashed at this stage since a challan had already been submitted to the trial court. He further observed that partially quashing an FIR to the extent of one suspect, while others remained nominated, was a legal impossibility.
Last September, a judicial magistrate in KP’s Bannu issued arrest warrants for Judge Dilawar at the request of the Anti-Corruption Establishment, who were probing the Islamabad magistrate’s family’s alleged involvement in a graft case.</p><small>2025-10-04 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/041136337e1778c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946513/hamass-response-to-gaza-plan-creates-window-for-ceasefire-must-not-let-it-close-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Hamas’s response to Gaza plan creates window for ceasefire, must not let it close: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that Palestinian group Hamas’s response to US President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan “creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again”.
Late Friday night, Trump told Israel to immediately stop bombing Gaza after Hamas agreed to release hostages and accept some other terms in a US plan to end the war, but vexing issues like disarmament appeared unresolved.
Subsequently, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Israel was preparing for an “immediate implementation” of the first stage of Trump’s Gaza plan for the release of Israeli hostages following Hamas’s response.
Meanwhile, the world welcomed Hamas’s positive response, with Pakistan also doing the same.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), the premier said: “Alhamdolillah, we are closer to a ceasefire than we have been since this genocide was launched on the Palestinian people. Pakistan has always stood by the Palestinian people and shall always do so.”
He also expressed gratitude to US President Trump, as well as the leaderships of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt and Indonesia, for their efforts during meetings on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).
The eight countries, including Pakistan, and the US had met on the sidelines of the UNGA to discuss the conflict in Gaza.
“The statement issued by Hamas creates a window for a ceasefire and ensuring peace that we must not allow to close again,” he said, adding that Pakistan would continue to “work with all its partners and brotherly nations to [ensure] everlasting peace in Palestine”.
 






Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said that Hamas’s response was a “welcome step”.
“This must now result in an immediate ceasefire, end to Palestinian suffering, ensure hostages release, and allow free flow of humanitarian aid. Israel MUST immediately stop its attacks,” he said.
 






“We reaffirm Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause and a sovereign, viable State of Palestine on the pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” he added.
Later in the day, Dar held a telephone conversation with Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, wherein they discussed regional developments, particularly the situation in Gaza.
According to a statement issued by the Foreign Office (FO), they reviewed ongoing diplomatic efforts, including engagements and consultations among the eight Arab-Islamic countries and the United States in New York, aimed at “achieving an immediate and durable ceasefire, ensuring unhindered humanitarian assistance, and to secure lasting peace in Gaza”.
It added that Dar appreciated the Saudi foreign minister’s continued engagement and constructive role in these efforts.
 






“They also discussed recent developments, including Hamas’s response to the proposal of President Donald Trump. Both ministers reaffirmed their firm commitment to the Palestinian cause and agreed to remain closely engaged with Arab and Islamic partners, as well as the international community, to advance a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace based on the two-state solution,” it concluded.
Meanwhile, another statement issued by the FO also welcomed the Palestinian group’s response, stating: “This offers an important opportunity to secure an immediate ceasefire, end the bloodshed of innocent Palestinians in Gaza, release of hostages and Palestinian prisoners, ensure unhindered humanitarian assistance, and pave the way for a credible political process toward lasting peace. Israel must immediately cease attacks.”
In the statement, the FO appreciated the efforts of the American president for peace in Gaza and hoped it would result in a durable ceasefire and a just, comprehensive and lasting peace.
“Pakistan will continue to contribute constructively and meaningfully to this process,” it said.
 






“Pakistan reaffirms its principled support for the Palestinian cause and stands in complete solidarity with the Palestinian people in their just struggle to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, leading to the establishment of a sovereign, viable and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international legitimacy and relevant UN resolutions,” the FO said.

Earlier, a statement issued on X by state broadcaster PTV News said security forces “foiled an attempt to harass peaceful people in the Zehri area” of the district and destroyed multiple terrorist hideouts during an operation while killing over 14 Fitna al-Hindustan members and injuring over 20.
 






In May, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna al-Hindu­stan — a new phrase aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
Congratulating the security forces, Naqvi hailed the operation as a “major success”, saying that the nation was “proud of the professional capabilities and courage of the security forces”.
He further said: “Security forces are determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorists in Balochistan. The people of Balochistan stand with the security forces. Indian-sponsored terrorists will not be allowed to hide anywhere.”
 






Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also said operational successes such as the above were “proof that the people of Balochistan and the forces are together grinding the nefarious designs of the country’s enemies into the dust. I am proud of the bravery of my youth and people. Long live Pakistan!”
 






Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakistan and Balochistan.
A day ago, security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the province’s Sherani district.
On Wednesday, four terrorists were apprehended during an IBO in Khuzdar district.</p><small>2025-10-04 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626920-14-indian-proxy-terrorists-killed-in-balochistans-khuzdar-sources' target='_blank'><strong>14 Indian proxy terrorists killed in Balochistan's Khuzdar operation: sources</strong></a><br><p>
