Opener Sameer Minhas led the way for Pakistan at the ICC Academy Ground in Dubai with a breathtaking 172 to set up a massive 191-run victory for his side.
“We began a process on June 17 [this year],” recalled Shahid at a news conference in Islamabad on Monday, following the team’s arrival and a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif where a Rs10million cash award was announced.
“It was an unprecedented step … we called up 70 players, conducted trials and gave each player four matches each and then they participated in a regional One-day tournament,” he added.
“The top performers, 20 of them, then took part in a five-month long camp … that’s how the team was made.
“We wanted to play fearless but not careless cricket. We wanted a united team and the result is in front of us.”

Kyiv has not commented on the incident, but Russian investigators said they were probing whether the blast was “linked” to “Ukrainian special forces”.
The attack was similar to other assassinations of generals and pro-war figures that have either been claimed, or are widely believed to have been orchestrated, by Ukraine.
Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head of the Russian General Staff’s training department, was killed when the bomb, which had been placed under his parked car, detonated in a residential quarter of southern Moscow.
AFP reporters at the scene saw a mangled white Kia SUV, its doors and back window blown out. The frame was twisted and charred from the blast.
The scene had been cordoned off by security forces, and investigators were sifting through the debris. Eyewitnesses reported a loud bang.
“We absolutely didn’t expect it. We thought we were safe, and then this happens right next to us,” local resident, Tatiana, 74, told AFP.
“The windows rattled, you could tell it was an explosion,” said Grigory, 70, who also declined to give his surname.
“We need to treat it more calmly. It’s the cost of war,” he added.
Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it was “working through various lines of enquiry into the murder. One of them involves the possible organisation of the crime by Ukrainian special services“.
Sarvarov fought in the Russian army’s campaigns in the North Caucasus, including Chechnya in the 1990s, according to his official biography on the defence ministry’s website.
He also commanded Russian forces in Syria in 2015-16.
Talks intensify
The Kremlin said Putin had been informed about Monday’s killing, which came after three days of talks in Miami as the United States intensifies its efforts to broker an end to the four-year war.
Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov and US special envoy Steve Witkoff hailed “progress” in the negotiations on Sunday.
Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev also met with the US team, which included Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law.
Witkoff had also called those meetings “productive and constructive.”
An initial 28-point plan to end the war put forward by Trump adhered to Moscow’s core demands, triggering panic in Kyiv and European capitals.
Ukraine and its allies have since been working to refine the plan, though Kyiv says it is still being asked to make massive concessions, such as giving up the entire eastern Donbas region to Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed scepticism over whether Russia really wants to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands and decimated eastern and southern Ukraine.
The Kremlin on Monday also denied that it wanted to recreate the Soviet Union, seize the whole of Ukraine and more land in eastern Europe after Reuters reported that US intelligence had concluded Putin seeks much more than just control over eastern Ukraine.
Since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has been blamed for several attacks targeting Russian military officials and pro-Kremlin personalities in Russia and in Russian-controlled Ukrainian regions.
General Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy of the General Staff, was killed in a car blast near Moscow in April.
In December 2024, Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian radiological, chemical and biological defence forces, was killed when a booby-trapped electric scooter exploded in Moscow, an attack claimed by Ukraine’s SBU security service.
A Russian military blogger, Maxim Fomin, was killed when a statuette exploded in a Saint Petersburg café in April 2023.
And in August 2022, a car bomb killed Daria Dugina, the daughter of ultranationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640846-pakistan-rolls-out-247-digital-monitoring-system-to-speed-up-passport-processing' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rolls out 24/7 digital monitoring system to speed up passport processing</strong></a><br><p>

Justice Neelum issued the ruling during a hearing of petitions by Abida Parveen and others that challenged decisions pertaining to property disputes taken under the ordinance. Through her interim order, she also suspended decisions taken under the new legislation to take away the possession of properties.
Expressing her disapproval of the law, she remarked: “Someone should inform the government that if this law remains in force, even Jati Umra (the Sharif family residence) could be vacated within half an hour.
“It appears that some people want to hold all powers.”
Questioning the purpose of the law, CJ Neelum asked how could a revenue officer hand over the possession of a property in a matter pending before a civil court.
The judge observed that the new law had dismantled the civil setup, civil rights and judicial supremacy.
“If it is up to the authorities, they would even suspend the Constitution,” she added.
Justice Neelum further pointed out that in case of a deputy commissioner handing over the possession of an individual’s house to someone else under the new law, the affected person did not have the right to appeal.
“The new law does not allow the high court to grant a stay in such matters,” she noted.
The Punjab chief secretary and other government officials were present at the hearing today, but the Punjab advocate general did not appear before the court. The court was told that the principal law officer was ill.
On this explanation, Justice Neelum remarked that she, too, was ill and had been advised bed rest, but was in the court presiding over proceedings.
The CJ then said that a full bench would be constituted to further proceed on the matter adjourned the hearing.
Separately, a Punjab law officer explained to Dawn that the Punjab government could challenge the LHC’s interim order before the Supreme Court under its appellate jurisdiction.
The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the provincial government could approach the Federal Constitutional Court as well, since that case involved a question of law.
“The government may also request the proposed full bench to review the stay order. However, its chances of obtaining relief through that route are relatively slim,” he added.
The ordinance in question was approved by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on October 31 and mandates the resolution of land disputes within 90 days.
It has been challenged before the LHC, and during a previous hearing on the matter, Justice Neelum had questioned the involvement of a newly-created force under the Punjab Enforcement Regulatory Authority (Pera) in such matters.
She had also commented that “patwaris (revenue officials) and ACs (assistant commissioners) seem to have developed a desire to become judges”, and questioned the jurisdiction of a patwari to take cognisance of a matter already pending before the Supreme Court.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22071815af0e74e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962594/cdf-field-marshal-munir-awarded-king-abdulaziz-medal-for-his-efforts-to-advance-pak-saudi-ties' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir awarded King Abdulaziz medal for his efforts to ‘advance Pak-Saudi ties’</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia’s Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz has conferred the King Abdulaziz Medal of Excellent Class on Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for his efforts to “advance Pak-Saudi ties”, it emerged on Monday.
According to a report by Saudi Gazette, the medal has five classes; excellent, first, second, third, and fourth. It is usually awarded to those who have rendered outstanding services to Saudi Arabia or one of its institutions.
The official Saudi Press Agency reported late on Sunday that CDF Field Marshal Munir was given the medal in honour of his “distinguished efforts to strengthen the strategic relationship and cooperation between the two nations”.
The report added that the ceremony took place during the Saudi minister’s reception of CDF Field Marshal Munir in Riyadh.
“Prince Khalid congratulated Field Marshal Munir on his appointment as Pakistan’s chief of defence forces, wishing him continued success in his new role,” the report added.
“During the meeting, the two sides reviewed the historical Saudi-Pakistani relations and the strategic cooperation in the defence field, discussing efforts to establish the foundations of international peace and security, as well as issues of common interest,” the publication reported.
Separately, in a post on the social media platform X, the minister said, “Upon the directive of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques [the title held by the Saudi king], I presented Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir with the King Abdulaziz Medal of Excellent Class for his distinguished efforts to enhance our cooperation and advance the Saudi-Pakistani relations.”







Later on Monday morning, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that during the meeting, the two sides held discussions on matters of mutual interest, including regional security dynamics, defence and military cooperation, strategic collaboration, and evolving geopolitical challenges.
“The interaction reaffirmed the deep-rooted, historic, and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it said.







It further said that the medal was the kingdom’s “highest national honour”.
“The honour recognises Field Marshal Munir’s distinguished military service and leadership, as well as his central role in advancing defence cooperation, strategic coordination, and institutional linkages between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it said.
“It also reflects his contributions toward regional peace and stability, including sustained collaboration in counter-terrorism and security,” it added.
Earlier this year, Islamabad and Riyadh had signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
In November, the Saudi armed forces chief had relayed the kingdom’s desire to elevate its defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.
On December 3, Field Marshal Munir had also expressed satisfaction with the “robust defence collaboration” underway between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/221231512594073.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623/bangladesh-rejects-indias-dismissal-of-protest-outside-its-high-commission-in-delhi-as-misleading-propaganda' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh rejects India’s dismissal of protest outside its high commission in Delhi as ‘misleading propaganda’</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh has rejected India’s dismissal of a protest outside its high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”, saying the incident was “highly regrettable“.
According to Bangladeshi media, around 20 to 25 protesters gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Saturday evening. According to mission officials, the protesters raised anti-Bangladesh slogans and issued threats against the Bangladesh high commissioner, Prothom Alo reported.*
In response, the Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal issued a statement on Sunday saying India had taken note of “misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident”.
“The fact is that about 20-25 youth gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on December 20 and raised slogans in protest against the horrendous killing of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, while also calling for the protection of all minorities in Bangladesh,” he said.
According to Prothom Alo, Das — a garment factory worker — was beaten to death on December 18 in Mymensingh, Bangladesh on allegations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire. It reported that 10 people had been arrested in connection with the incident.
“There was no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time. The police stationed at the spot dispersed the group after a few minutes,” the Indian official said.
“Visual evidence of these events is available publicly for all to see. India is committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions/posts in its territory in accordance with the Vienna Convention,” he added.
“India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities. We have also urged that the perpetrators of the barbaric killing of Das be brought to justice,” he said.
In response, the Bangldesh foreign ministry issued a statement, saying that the “unjustifiable incident at the Bangladesh High Commission residence in New Delhi on December 20 is highly regrettable and cannot be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’”.







“The miscreants were allowed to carry out their activities right outside the perimeters of the high commission, creating panic among the personnel inside the complex,” it said, adding that the commission was not made aware of the event beforehand.
The statement, however, took note of the Indian government’s “commitment” towards the safety of Bangladeshi diplomatic posts in India.
Bangladesh also rejected “an attempt of the Indian authorities to depict an isolated attack on a Bangladeshi citizen, who happens to belong to the Hindu community, as attacks on minorities“.
The statement said that the government “promptly apprehended the suspects in this incident“. It noted that “the intercommunal situation in Bangladesh is better than in many other parts in South Asia”.
“Bangladesh believes that it is the duty of all governments in the region to ensure protection of minorities in their respective countries,” the statement added.
Ties between the two countries have been frosty since former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising last year.
Dhaka has repeatedly asked for her extradition so that she could stand trial for her alleged crimes, with Delhi responding that it was examining the requests.
On Thursday, protesters, seeking the repatriation of Hasina, were stopped from marching towards an Indian diplomatic mission.
A day earlier, India’s foreign ministry had conveyed its concerns over the “deteriorating” security environment in the country, following protests triggered by the killing of a prominent youth leader.</p><small>2025-12-22 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640825-punjab-lg-polls-to-be-on-party-basis-govt-assures-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab LG polls to be held on party basis, govt assures LHC</strong></a><br><p>

In the video, the family members could be heard saying that the patient had passed away after doctors refused to give her a blood transfusion. When the video panned to the doctor in question, he raised his arm, showing his middle finger and walking away. A large crowd could also be seen in the video.
The doctor, identified as Qasim Jamal, was suspended from duty on Dec 19, a day after the incident occurred. Meanwhile, an inquiry committee was also formed to probe the incident.
Subsequently, the hospital issued a notification the same day stating that the doctor had been terminated with immediate effect for misconduct, and violating hospital rules and professional ethics.
In the incident report dated Dec 20, the director of the Accident and Emergency Department said that the patient was admitted to the hospital in a critical condition on Thursday. It said she was in the process of being stabilised after being treated at the department and was to be transferred to a different ward for blood transfusions.
However, the patient’s condition deteriorated to a point where transfusions were no longer feasible, leading to agitation among her attendants, it said.
“Attendants misbehaved with [the] doctor as well as staff on duty,” the report said. “After that, [the] doctor also misbehaved and [showed an] inappropriate gesture to the attendants,“ it said.
It added that treatment was given to the patient “properly and accordingly”.
Meanwhile, the doctor in question also issued a detailed statement on Dec 20 in response to the incident, saying that his reaction was merely a “symbol of protest” against what he called continuous attacks and harassment by the patient’s family.
Regarding the treatment of the patient, he said that her condition had been “very critical and active treatment was ongoing” but her condition deteriorated. He said that they attempted to resuscitate her but she was later declared dead.
He said that the patient’s attendants then started misbehaving with doctors and staff, creating chaos in the emergency room. He added that there was “complete negligence on the part of the security staff, who allowed over twelve men with mobile cameras to enter the restricted area of ​​the emergency room”.
He said that while he and the other staff were treating over a dozen other patients, the attendants continued to “shout, abuse, threaten and harass” him, including getting physically violent.
“After repeated humiliation, verbal abuse, physical threats and four consecutive attempted attacks, it was impossible for any human being to remain unaffected,” the doctor said.
“My reaction was the result of continued provocation, not an unprovoked act. I state clearly that I did not abuse, misbehave or physically attack anyone. I did not utter a single word of profanity. My response was calm and disciplined,” he said.
“I admit that I was under severe mental stress and anger at that time. Protesting is a fundamental right of every individual and employee, and I exercised this right peacefully and non-violently,” he said.
He added that the hospital rules did not clearly refer to silent gestures as violations of the law, saying, “If I had used abusive language or physical assault, it would certainly have been a violation of medical ethics, but that was not the case.”
The doctor said that suspension without investigation was unfair and requested that he be reinstated in order to complete his training.</p><small>2025-12-22 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640813-karachi-likely-to-experience-noticeable-drop-in-temperature-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi likely to experience noticeable drop in temperature from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>

Father and son Sajid Akram and Naveed are accused of targeting a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach, killing 15 people in the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in almost three decades.
Sajid, 50, was shot and killed by police during the attack. An Indian national, he entered Australia on a visa in 1998.
His 24-year-old son, Naveed, an Australian-born citizen, was moved from hospital to jail on Monday, police said.

 

Police documents released on Monday said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting.
Pictures were released showing the accused firing shotguns and moving in what authorities described as a “tactical manner”.
The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said.
And they made a nighttime “reconnaissance” trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed.
Australia observed a minute’s silence at 6:47pm (12:47pm PKT) on Sunday —exactly a week since the first reports of gunfire.
On Monday, Albanese said he would push for tough new laws creating “an aggravated offence for hate preaching”.
“We’re not going to let the ISIS inspired terrorists win. We won’t let them divide our society, and we’ll get through this together,” Albanese told reporters.
“As prime minister, I feel the weight of responsibility for an atrocity that happened whilst I’m prime minister, and I’m sorry for what the Jewish community and our nation as a whole has experienced,” he said.

 

“The government will work every day to protect Jewish Australians, to protect the fundamental right as Australians that they have to be proud of who they are, to practice their faith, to educate their children and to engage in Australian society in the fullest way possible,” he added.
Crackdown on guns, ‘terrorist symbols’
Australia’s federal government has flagged a suite of reforms to gun ownership and hate speech laws, as well as a review of police and intelligence services.
Albanese also announced last week a sweeping buyback scheme to “get guns off our streets”.
It is the largest gun buyback since 1996, when Australia cracked down on firearms in the wake of a mass shooting that killed 35 people at Port Arthur.
And the government of New South Wales — where the shooting took place — recalled its parliament for two days on Monday to introduce what it called the “toughest firearm reforms in the country”.
“We can’t pretend that the world is the same as it was before that terrorist incident on Sunday,” New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told reporters.
“I’d give anything to go back a week, a month, two years, to ensure that didn’t happen, but we need to make sure that we take steps so that it never happens again.”
The new rules will cap the number of guns an individual can own to four, or ten for exempted individuals like farmers.
There are more than 1.1 million firearms in the state, officials said.
The legislation would also ban the display of “terrorist symbols”, including the flag of the Islamic State, which was found in a car linked to one of the alleged shooters.
Authorities will also be able to prohibit protests for up to three months following a terrorism incident.

 

Minns said on Monday he would also look into stricter hate speech legislation next year, including restrictions on the phrase “globalise the intifada”.
The phrase is a common chant at pro-Palestinian rallies and refers to past uprisings against Israeli forces in the occupied territories.</p><small>2025-12-22 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2015141693abb39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960708/the-silent-exclusion-when-technology-speaks-every-language-but-ours' target='_blank'><strong>The silent exclusion: When technology speaks every language but ours</strong></a><br><p>Technology loves to promise miracles. For people like me, it is often marketed as a great equaliser; an assurance that with the right device, disability is not a barrier. Access is just a download away, we are told.
But growing up, I realised that this flashy narrative, wrapped in lofty guarantees, was merely a mirage — out of reach for me.
For a family like mine, buying tech was expensive. My mother worked tirelessly to purchase devices she hoped would level the field for my visually impaired brother and me. But even when she managed to get them, a more invisible barrier persisted: hardly any technology could speak our tongue.
A profound disconnect
While I could listen to English books through screen readers, reading or writing in Urdu — the language of home, of emotion, and of identity — remained a distant dream. I longed to read novels on my own, to write my own stories, to revise schoolwork without leaning on someone else’s eyes.
That dream became especially far out of reach during O-levels, when I was barred from sitting the Urdu exam simply because no accessible technology existed to support the process.
Urdu is compulsory for university admissions in Pakistan, and, like many visually impaired students, I found myself locked out of a gateway to higher education. Not because I lacked talent, but because the tools did not exist.

 

Today, decades later, much has improved, and for that I am grateful. But the truth is that progress has been slow, inconsistent, and unfairly distributed. My research with visually impaired communities across Pakistan reveals that the very barriers I encountered at that time continue to persist to date.
Many participants described a profound disconnect from technology, particularly those without English proficiency. We often assume that access to a smartphone equals access to the world. For some of us, that assumption remains painfully untrue.
Across Pakistan, Punjabi, Pashto, Sindhi, Balochi, Saraiki, and dozens of other languages are spoken every day. The country is home to at least 80 languages and nearly 27 million people with disabilities, many of whom depend on technology for education, employment, and basic communication.
When the tools they rely on cannot understand their language, the consequence is not mere inconvenience. It is exclusion: systemic, silent, and on a massive scale.
The myth of inclusive technology
So what does that look like day in and day out? The accessibility audits conducted in the Accessibility, Language, and Tech for the People (ALT) project — a major European initiative dedicated to building a robust European ecosystem for Language Technologies and AI models — provide a clear picture.
Starting with screen readers, on Windows, the commonly used E-Speak Urdu TTS engine performs so poorly that even the simplest tasks become laborious. Several participants noted that the voice was so robotic and unclear that reading long-form content became extremely difficult.
On Android, the picture is slightly better, and Google’s speech services provide clearer Urdu pronunciation. But typing remains an obstacle even then because the system does not read individual letters aloud, and therefore, users are unable to confirm what they have written. Yet another obstacle.
On iPhones, things get even more complicated. There is no built-in Urdu TTS at all.
This leaves visually impaired users with no option but to change system settings manually every time they want a message to be read in Urdu, or worse, have to rely on clumsy third-party tools. One participant put it starkly: writing even a single sentence in Urdu using the available synthesisers was “a terrible experience” and felt nothing like the smooth, accessible typing they were used to in English.
Beyond language itself, application accessibility is equally inconsistent. People often assume that because an app works perfectly for sighted users, it must work for everyone. But the audits show a very different reality.
Daraz, one of Pakistan’s most widely used shopping platforms, remains deeply problematic. Product images lack descriptions. Buttons are unlabelled. Tab navigation is inconsistent. Product details are sometimes impossible to access without help. Checkout processes fail to provide feedback, leaving users unsure whether an action has been completed. Several testers described having to rely on sighted assistance or apps like “Be My Eyes” just to finish an order.
Ride-hailing apps mirror these challenges. InDrive is relatively better, but nearly all such apps fail in one crucial area: live location tracking. For visually impaired passengers, this isn’t a bonus feature; it’s essential for safety and independent travel. Yango, for instance, makes even entering a location difficult because of inconsistent labelling. Bykea has similar navigation issues.
Food delivery apps, on the other hand, are a mixed bag. Foodpanda is usable for many tasks, but placing an order or chatting with a rider can become difficult due to unlabelled options or delayed keyboard feedback. Some testers could search for restaurants easily, only to find themselves blocked at the final step because the “place order” button wouldn’t register with their screen reader.
Banking apps, perhaps the most essential tools of modern life, show the widest range.
SadaPay is frequently praised for its smooth and intuitive accessibility. But Easypaisa and JazzCash — two financial lifelines for millions — can be nearly impossible to navigate. Users described crowded interfaces, unlabelled buttons and processes so convoluted that beginners “give up out of frustration and demotivation”.
Think about what that means: in 2025, millions of blind or visually impaired users still cannot send money, order food, track a ride, or buy groceries without assistance. We often talk about accessibility as if it’s a checklist — add alt text here, label a button there, job done.
But accessibility isn’t a feature. It’s a commitment. A philosophy. A willingness to build with the most marginalised users in mind, not as an afterthought but as a starting point. Right now, the digital world is being shaped around English-speaking, sighted, neurotypical users. Everyone else is left to catch up.
Redefining accessibility
For me, participating in the ALT project helped reclaim some of the marginalisation I grew up with. The project examines how language politics, disability and technology intersect in South Asia. Though these countries share deep histories and cultures, we found that barriers vary, and that solutions must be community-driven, co-created and grounded in the lived realities of disabled people.
Time and again, participants expressed a desire to separate themselves from colonial linguistic hierarchies. They don’t want to centre English; they want to centre their languages — to read the news in Pashto, to type in Punjabi, to browse a website in Sindhi, to write poetry, read novels and order food in Urdu without fighting their phone every step of the way.

 

And yet, big tech companies have been slow to respond. Apple still doesn’t offer Urdu TTS support. Android has made improvements, but it remains far from ideal. Community whispers about “something new coming soon” have circulated for years, only to fade away as researchers hit barriers, lose funding or abandon the project. The cycle repeats.
Pakistan deserves better. South Asia deserves better. Every language deserves digital visibility, not only the global ones. And most of all, every disabled person deserves the dignity of independent access.
Accessibility, in its current form, has too narrow a definition. It must widen linguistically, culturally and technologically. Because when technology fails people who need it most, it isn’t just a technical issue — it’s a question of justice, dignity and belonging.
The promise of technology as a saviour isn’t entirely wrong. But it will remain a myth until it serves us in the languages we live in, speak in, and dream in.</p><small>2025-12-22 06:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640806-imrans-protest-call-negates-achakzais-dialogue-wish' target='_blank'><strong>Imran's protest call negates Achakzai's dialogue wish</strong></a><br><p>

As she moved through the city, she explained, people stared at her, visibly shocked to see a woman riding a two-wheeler on her own. The attention, however, did little to dampen her spirits. She kept her focus on the road ahead.
“My family’s support gave me the confidence to ignore those reactions and focus on my way,” she told Dawn.
Motorcycles dominate Pakistan’s roads, far outnumbering cars. According to a study by the Gallup Pakistan Digital Analytics Platform (GDAP) and data from the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), more than 20.4 million motorcycles were sold between 2007 and March 2025, compared to just 2.6m cars. Pakistan’s two-wheeler market is now the world’s ninth largest, recording the strongest growth among the top 50 global markets in 2025.

Despite this dominance, it is very rare to see women riding motorcycles or scooters, particularly in cities like Peshawar, often perceived as conservative. For Pakistani women, travelling on a two-wheeler is governed by socially sanctioned rules. And even though they’re unwritten, these norms are rigid. For example, a woman may not grip the handlebars herself, and as a passenger, she is expected to sit side-saddle behind a male rider. Any other posture is widely regarded as a violation of female modesty.
Defying the norms
Women like Saba, undeterred by such conventions, are quietly reshaping Peshawar’s streets. She believes the city is becoming safer and more accepting of women’s presence on the roads.
“I believe my decision has encouraged others. We can ride a scooter safely in Peshawar, as this is not immodesty; we can ride a scooter within our limits,” she said.
Saba hopes more women will push past stereotypes and barriers with confidence and determination. “I have not had to deal with any negativity or harsh words from others.”

Official figures, however, portray how rare such visibility remains. The Pakistan Digital Census 2023 shows women make up 49 per cent of Peshawar’s 4.7m population, around 2.3m residents. Yet traffic police data for 2025 indicates only 1,931 women hold driving licences in the city.
Each woman travelling through Peshawar on a scooter, therefore, is not merely a commuter but a pioneer in a quiet shift.
Research on women’s use of scooters in Pakistan suggests that ownership and use of two-wheelers can symbolise autonomy and challenge gendered norms. Studies on urban transport show how harassment and safety concerns on public transit restrict women’s mobility, making personal transport a more viable option.
“People often label Peshawar as a typical city, but my goal is to raise awareness that Peshawar’s females are just as capable as those in other cities. That is why I decided to take the first step and start riding a scooter,” said Saba.
“I have a car and a driving licence, but a scooter is very easy to ride. I can attend meetings and run errands without any difficulty.”
Empowerment through mobility
Dr Zafar Khan, a sociology lecturer at the University of Peshawar, says the sight of women riding scooters or motorcycles signals not only a socio-cultural shift but also empowerment.
“There was a time when even women driving a car was not acceptable here, but now we can see a change, with some women even riding motorcycles or scooters,” he told Dawn.

He noted that personal transport enables women to manage daily responsibilities independently. “In this patriarchal structure, their dependency on men will decrease. Motorcycles can help with tasks such as dropping children at school, commuting to college or university, or even going to the gym,” he said.
Dr Khan added that mobility also has economic implications. “If women are working, their commute becomes easier. At the university, I see several women riding motorcycles and scooters, and when I saw a girl on a bike for the first time, my first thought was, ‘change is coming’,” he said.
The academic stressed that broader societal and government support is essential. “If society, along with the government, supports women in such initiatives, it can reduce their dependence on others and protect them from harassment on public transport. Providing a safe environment will allow women to become more socially and economically empowered.”
Role of family support
Citizens of Peshawar have also stressed the importance of enabling women riders. Tahir Naeem, a native now living in Islamabad but visiting the city every weekend, said: “Females should have safe spaces. An alternative mode of transport is a good opportunity. It gives independence, reduces reliance on others and is economical.”

He added that family support is crucial for such changes to take root.
This was evident in the experience of Huma, a University of Peshawar student. She moved from riding a bicycle in childhood to riding a motorcycle in 2020, encouraged by her father.
“If the family supports you, no one can say anything,” she told Dawn. Growing up in a joint family, her father ensured that no one interfered with her decision. His backing gave her the freedom to pursue independence.
“People appreciate me for riding a motorbike, and it is a confidence booster. I feel safe riding at night, too. I have never faced negativity, though people do get shocked when they see me riding for the first time,” she said.
“Riding my bike has made my life much easier. I am independent and can get around without relying on anyone else.”
Huma also had a message for other young women: “Riding a bike has been a game-changer for me. It is about being independent and free. Many girls stop themselves because of what people might say.”
‘Change will take time’
Peshawar-based journalist Jamaima Afridi told Dawn that, being from and working in the area, she understands the challenges women face in the city. “Whenever something is unfamiliar or uncommon in society, it is bound to be challenging,” she said.
“I think this will become normal only when such women come forward and practise the basic right to freedom of movement. Over time, people will get used to it.”
She reflected on her own experience, recalling a cycling rally she organised in her village. “It drew a lot of criticism, but it also made people realise that women should have the right to cycle,” she said.
Afridi emphasised that creating public debate around women riding bicycles or motorcycles is the first step toward building space for their mobility.
“The initial women taking this step will face difficulties: stares, criticism, claims that they are ‘ruining the culture.’ But with time, it will improve. The key is that as many women as possible practise this right, creating visibility and normalising it,” she said.
A quiet revolution
The number of women riding scooters in Peshawar may still be small, but their visibility signals something larger: a shift in how women are claiming space in a city that is, gradually, learning to make room for them.
“My Peshawar is wonderful,” Saba said with a sigh, “and it is getting better for girls.”

Spot gold rose 1.2 per cent to a record $4,391.92 an ounce, while spot silver climbed 2.7opc by 0344GMT to hit a historic high of $69.23.
Bullion has gained 67pc so far this year, shattering multiple records and breaching the $3,000 and $4,000 per ounce milestones for the first time. It is poised for its biggest annual gain since 1979.
Silver has surged 138pc year-to-date, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by robust investment inflows and persistent supply constraints.
“With December usually producing positive returns for gold and silver, seasonality is on their side,” said StoneX senior analyst Matt Simpson.
“Given that gold has already risen 4pc this month and we’re nearing the end of the year, bulls may want to tread with caution as volumes are to deplete and odds of profit-taking are also likely on the rise.”
Traditionally viewed as a safe-haven asset, gold has been supported by heightened geopolitical and trade tensions, steady central bank buying and expectations of lower interest rates next year.
A softer dollar has provided an additional tailwind by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers.
Markets are currently pricing in two US rate cuts for next year despite the Federal Reserve signalling caution. Non-yielding assets such as gold tend to benefit in lower interest rate environments.
Simpson said two Fed rate cuts were pencilled in for 2026, with a faster US jobs slowdown and a shift to a more dovish Fed likely to add further upside to gold.

The directive was issued by Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah while chairing a meeting of officials representing the KMC, zoo and relevant departments.
The meeting reviewed the existing conditions, management practices and future planning related to exotic animals housed at the zoo.
Mr Shah emphasised that the government was committed to ensuring animal welfare, ethical management and compliance with international best practices concerning captive wildlife.
He stated that uncontrolled breeding of exotic species, especially big cats, posed serious challenges in terms of animal welfare, space constraints, safety and long-term management, and needed to be addressed without delay.
During the meeting, the KMC and zoo authorities were directed to initiate immediate measures to halt the breeding of exotic animals and develop a clear, time-bound plan in consultation with qualified wildlife experts.

 

The chief secretary underscored the need for expert guidance to ensure that all actions taken were scientifically sound, humane and aligned with conservation principles.
He further instructed that a comprehensive assessment of existing exotic animals at the zoo be carried out, including their health, habitat conditions and future care requirements.
“The focus should remain on responsible wildlife management, discouraging unnecessary captivity and breeding of exotic animals, and promoting practices that prioritise animal well-being and public safety,” he noted during the meeting.
It might be recalled that three lion cubs were born at the zoo last month.

This means higher taxes, costlier utilities, and job cuts, while the country’s intellectual community seems too complacent to craft credible, growth-oriented policy options.
Responsibility for Pakistan’s chronic underperformance rests equally with the state and the elite. It is vested interests, not ignorance, that block meaningful reforms. When the path to prosperity remains undefined, political leaders, policymakers, intellectuals and civil society all share the blame.
Blaming the IMF for all of Pakistan’s problems is misguided, just as expecting the Fund to deliver perfect solutions is unrealistic. It is not the Fund’s mandate to fix a country’s weaknesses, nor has Pakistan’s long history of repeated programmes ever suggested it could. If IMF programmes solved everything, Pakistan would not be returning to the IMF every few years — currently, Pakistan is under the second year of the 24th Extended Fund Facility arrangement, a $7 billion, 37-month deal.
The Fund’s role is to stabilise economies in acute distress, and its support comes with conditions meant to restore fiscal health and creditworthiness. Like any lender, it demands stronger safeguards when dealing with a vulnerable client.
Many Pakistani analysts argue that IMF conditionalities only address the financial dimension of the country’s complex economic challenges. They view the reforms as neither politically neutral nor aligned with the sequencing required for inclusive, sustainable development that fully leverages Pakistan’s human and natural endowments. Business leaders were even more critical, contending that the IMF’s stabilisation-focused approach has contributed to the current low-investment cycle and weakened the environment for domestic growth.

Little intellectual pushback and scant policy innovation has reinforced dependence on the Fund’s prescriptions

Dr Aliya Hashmi Khan, an economist and adviser to several local and global bodies, pointed to a fundamental lack of clarity on Pakistan’s growth paradigm. “My short answer is that alignment remains weak,” she observed, further elaborating that, “Since we still lack clarity on goals, policies and sequencing, it is difficult to judge the programme’s impact.
She added that institutional fragility and persistent volatility limit the state’s ability to undertake structural reforms needed to address deep developmental gaps. At the same time, she acknowledged the economic team’s success in persuading the IMF to proceed with reforms despite clear evidence that the chosen trajectory remains uncertain.
Dr Nadeem ul Haq, former vice chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, noted that an IMF programme is merely an emergency stabilisation tool; it can steady an economy, but it cannot place a country on a sustained growth path. Yet Pakistan’s policy debate remains dominated by bankers and political appointees focused only on meeting the Fund’s minimum conditions.
Equally troubling, he argued, is an economist community that behaves more like a passive follower than an idea generator. There is little intellectual pushback, scant policy innovation, and no meaningful effort to present the government with alternative reform models. This absence of bold, homegrown ideas, he said, has narrowed Pakistan’s policy space and reinforced dependence on IMF prescriptions instead of building a long-term vision for growth and shared prosperity.
Muhammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, was brief and unequivocal. “When a country is in trouble and turns to the IMF in desperation, it must follow the Fund’s policies. There is simply no alternative.”
Tensions between the IMF and the government persist over the pace of tax, energy and state-owned enterprise reforms, now filtered through the IMF’s governance lens. Despite accepting the Fund’s governance diagnostic, Pakistan still lacks a coherent roadmap linking stabilisation to sustained growth, investment and employment.
Auto sector leader Mashood Ali Khan noted that IMF policies are not politically neutral and repeated bailouts have raised concerns about Pakistan’s economic sovereignty, industrialisation and inclusive growth. He warned that tariff rationalisation, removal of industrial-zone incentives, costly energy, high interest rates, and austerity risks are deepening de-industrialisation and deterring investment, while electric vehicle-import incentives without local capacity add new vulnerabilities.
Dr Kaisar Waheed, former president of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, remarked that IMF programmes align only partly with Pakistan’s priorities. While they address urgent stabilisation needs, they conflict with long-term goals of growth, job creation and poverty reduction. The Fund’s singular focus on stability imposes heavy social costs, while state-owned enterprise reforms and tax base expansion entail entrenched resistance.
On the contrary, Majyd Aziz, former president of the Employers’ Federation of Pakistan, defended the IMF and its stance. He argued that the criticism of the IMF often ignores that countries approach it only after their economies have already deteriorated. The Fund’s role is to stabilise and restructure through a standard framework, adjusted to each country. Pakistan’s real problem is not IMF conditions but weak implementation, elite capture, and failure to undertake structural reforms.
Dr Khaqan Hasan Najeeb argues that IMF engagement aligns with Pakistan’s short-term macro-stability needs — containing inflation, narrowing fiscal and external deficits, and restoring credibility. However, the country’s longer-term priorities, export diversification, industrial upgrading, job creation and productivity-driven growth, require far deeper structural reforms. n

This progress would be hovering around 55-60pc by June next year; the project’s completion was slated for June 2027.
The barrage’s refurbishment and upgradation works are going to have a positive impact on the irrigation and agriculture sectors, considering that the Sukkur barrage ensures dependable irrigation water supplies to large swaths of agricultural lands in Sindh on both the right and left banks of the Indus River.
The barrage has a command area of around eight million acres of farmland, starting from upper Sindh to the tail end of the Indus River system in Badin district. Furthermore, it ensures a regular water supply to two of Pakistan’s largest irrigation canals – Rohri and Nara.
The 208-mile-long Rohri canal, considered a mini-Indus River in Sindh, mostly irrigates prime land that produces high-value bananas and mangoes. The same goes for the Nara canal, which stretches over 226 miles. The barrage, however, imposes a significant economic cost on Sindh’s agriculture sector, which contributes significantly to the national economy.

Modernisation of gate operations will play a crucial role in ensuring dependable supplies for Sindh’s agriculture sector

Both these perennial left-side canals of the barrage feed areas that produce crops such as wheat, sugarcane, and cotton. Among them, Nara has recently witnessed lining work on its seven initial distributaries early this year as part of the annual development programme. Its post-line assessment is now awaited.
When damages to seven of the Sukkur barrage’s old gates were reported in June 2024, it raised alarm bells in the government and farming community. The closure of major canals in the wake of the damage had become a matter of grave concern then. Nara canal, however, still had reports of some withdrawals.
It’s been around 100 years since the barrage was built during the colonial era in this part of the subcontinent, in 1932. Replacement of all 56 barrage gates under the World Bank-funded Sindh Barrage Improvement Project (SBIP) was undoubtedly a major intervention.
“This replacement [of gates] is going to have a lasting impact on the life of the barrage,” said SBIP project chief, Pritam Das. According to him, execution of the barrage’s upgradation, including modernisation of gate operations, as well as its replacement by Chinese contractors, would play a crucial role in ensuring dependable supplies for Sindh’s agriculture sector in the days to come.

“We are confident we will achieve 55–60pc progress in the Sukkur barrage’s project by June 2026, and we will complete it by 2027 as per the timeline,” said SBIP project chief Pritam Das

Seventeen gates were replaced in FY25. Another 27 would be replaced during FY26, and finally, the remaining 12 would be changed in FY27. When the barrage was built, it had 66 gates, but due to the heavy load of silt on its right side, 10 of its gates (Gates 6 to 14 & 23) were closed for this technical reason, reducing its discharge capacity from 1.5m cusecs to 0.9m cusecs in the early 40s.
Since then, the barrage has operated with 56 gates and has passed a flood of 1.1m cusecs eight times to date. The last super flood passed the barrage in August 2010.
The barrage is key to ensuring irrigation water supplies during the Kharif and Rabi seasons, despite water shortages in the river system.
“We have examined the barrage’s floor for the first time and checked for cavities. If any cavity is found, grouting is undertaken to fill it with liquid concrete,” said Mr Das.
According to him, a hydrological assessment was also done after laying a six-inch reinforced cement concrete floor over the barrage’s actual floor. “We are confident that we will be achieving 55–60pc physical progress in the Sukkur barrage’s project works by June 2026, and we will be completing it in 2027 as per the timeline,” said Mr Das. He disclosed that both barrages would remain under the watch of contractors for another year, till 2028, as part of the defect liability period.
An amount of Rs74.6bn was spent on World Bank-funded for both the Sukkur and Guddu barrages. The cost was not revised, but the escalation amount was payable as per the approved PC-I of the project, due towards dollar appreciation.
While the barrage’s improvement is understandable, the Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) president Mehmood Nawaz still believes the deteriorating condition of the connecting infrastructure of Sindh’s three barrages — Sukkur in particular — should not be lost sight of.
“This vital infrastructure is facing ageing issues now and needs timely attention that has not been given over the years. Sindh’s economy is basically agrarian in nature, so we can’t turn a blind eye to them,” he noted. For instance, he said, the barrage’s Dadu canal, one of the major right-bank canals that supplies irrigation water to rice-growing areas of upper Sindh, doesn’t receive the required water flows at the head. It was fed through an alternate source of the Rice canal of the barrage.

 

He also observed that if economic priorities were in place and fiscal space had some cushion, then canal infrastructure should also be prioritised, given that these networks carry irrigation water to command areas from the Indus River at Guddu, Sukkur, and Kotri barrages. Serious damage to the Sukkur barrage’s gates in 2024, according to Mr Nawaz, was alarming and clearly indicated that such problems also exist in canal networks.
Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, December 22nd, 2025</p><small>2025-12-22 03:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6948a1f53aa2d.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962550/recovering-history' target='_blank'><strong>Recovering history</strong></a><br><p>OVER the past two decades, the study of Pakistan’s post-independence history has grown considerably richer. As previously hidden or uncovered information sources and archives become available, and as intellectual tools to make sense of discrete events evolve, our understanding of the past grows both sharper and more complex.
Within this growing repository of work, there are broadly two strands of scholarship. The first uses archives, cultural forms, and memory to reconstruct mainstream narratives of state-building, political and social change, and popular agency. This type of work is usually helpful in making sense of how the present came to be and in pushing back against homogenisation or linearity in the narration of the past.
The second type of work is the uncovering of historical occurrence: events, trends, and happenings that have never been recorded because of historical amnesia and indifference or purposeful suppression. While this distinction is never neat, it is this second type that is on vivid display in historian Ilyas Chattha’s recently released book, Citizens to Traitors: Bengali Internment in Pakistan 1971-1974.
An outcome of a historian tugging at the thread of a chance, childhood encounter in central Punjab, Chattha’s work documents how ethnic Bengalis in (West) Pakistan were subjected to confinement for periods of up to three years in the aftermath of Bangladesh’s independence. As the title of the book suggests, this action was driven by heightened, paranoiac suspicion around the loyalty of ethnic Bengalis, given the ethnonationalist currents of the secessionist movement and a central state reeling from significant losses.
Chattha documents that approximately 400,000 Bengalis were living in West Pakistan at the time of Bangladesh’s independence. While not all were detained, they were subjected to intense scrutiny under the Defence of Pakistan Rules, and reportedly more than 81,000 Bengalis, including military personnel, civil servants, and their families, were formally interned. This mass detention was hardly incidental, given how it formed part of a political strategy in the aftermath of the 1971 civil war. With 93,000 Pakistani POWs held in India, the state used Bengali internees as leverage in a triangular negotiation involving Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh.
Chattha’s book provides careful documentation of the differentiated nature of internment. Military officers and senior civil servants, he writes, were confined in cantonment camps, while civilians, such as factory and service-sector workers suddenly dismissed from their jobs, were placed in overcrowded, unsanitary camps. By drawing on previously unseen personal correspondence and memory testimonies, the book details abject conditions and psychological trauma experienced by detainees now recast as ‘traitors’ in a country they had once served.

Ilyas Chattha’s new book shows how formal ideals of citizenship run afoul of political exigencies and nationalist ideologies in modern states.

Escape attempts form another critical historical layer of the book. Chattha records perilous journeys by land, sea, and air, often involving bribery, extortion, or death. High-profile escapes, such as those of singer Shahnaz Rahmatullah and Pakistan’s former Foreign Office official S.M. Yusuf, reflected the level of scrutiny and allowed for the mobilisation of international pressure.
In fact, that last bit remains instrumental in how this episode was recovered from the margins of history. Families and well-wishers of those interned, residing abroad or in the newly independent state of Bangladesh, launched a global campaign to shed light on the situation, often taking out large adverts in international newspapers and magazines. That record was meticulously collected in the process of putting together this history.
The deadlock ended only with the Tripartite Agreement of August 1973, enabling repatriation. By mid-1974, nearly 120,000 Bengalis had returned to Bangladesh. Yet their ordeal continued there: many were dismissed from service, stigmatised as collaborators, and marginalised within the new nation.
It is this aspect that makes this new book not just about repression by the state, but also more broadly about how formal ideals of citizenship run afoul of political exigencies and nationalist ideologies in modern states.
The Pakistani state cast one blanket of suspicion based on ethnic affiliation that led to the internment; and upon their repatriation, the Bangladeshi state cast another based on their geographic and occupational pasts. In both instances, though more in the former than the latter, standards of exception imposed by the sovereign (and supported by segments of society) created new forms of marginalisation and exclusion.

 

While documentation for posterity’s sake is important, this new book also raises a more fundamental question: what is the point of retelling suppressed stories? There are two justifications that one can lean on in response.
Firstly, state practices are never discrete occurrences. They carry histories and they possess futures. The practice of casting suspicion on a population and using that as an excuse to practise some form of collective punishment has a long history that stretches back into the colonial regime (from which our states directly derive).
It was relived during the 1971 civil war, and is reflected even today in the existence of enforced disappearances and racialised regulations. Perhaps by documenting past trauma, society can be equipped to resist its repetition in the future.
Secondly, there are social remnants of this particular past that still linger in Pakistan. Remnants that require immediate attention and rectification. A significant portion of the Bengali population remained outside formal camps and found themselves facing extreme precarity.
These stranded Bengalis in Karachi, Islamabad, and other cities encountered social hostility, attacks from other ethnic groups, and economic dispossession. Many relied on charity kitchens and informal communication networks, especially in the absence of any infrastructure of support and care. To this day, they remain mired in difficult legal and socioeconomic conditions. One hopes that a retelling of the origins of this marginalisation will help bring attention to their plight and generate greater urgency to fix it.

The latest IMF estimates suggest Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) receipts rose from 8.9 per cent of GDP in the fiscal year 2023-24 to 10.3pc in 2024-25, but still missed the Fund’s programme target of 10.7pc.
For the current fiscal year, the IMF projects FBR revenue at 11.1pc of GDP, which would then remain flat at that level until FY30.

 

In absolute terms, FBR revenue increased from Rs9.3tr in FY24 to Rs11.74tr in FY25, with a massive shortfall. For the current year, collections are projected at Rs13.98tr, implying a shortfall of Rs328 billion under existing assumptions.
The IMF noted that tax revenue collection in FY25 fell short by Rs1.224tr relative to budget projections and by Rs524bn relative to the lender’s first review target. About Rs850bn of the shortfall relative to the budget reflected faster-than-expected inflation deceleration and lower-than-expected GDP growth in FY25.

Forecasts provincial taxes to offset stagnant federal collections

The inflation deceleration at the end of FY25 led to a revenue shortfall of Rs157bn relative to the first IMF review target. The remaining portion of about Rs380bn was broadly linked to administrative and enforcement challenges that remained unaddressed throughout FY25, chiefly because of prolonged settlement of tax court cases that delayed the recovery of significant revenue amounts.
Overall revenues, including non-tax receipts, rose sharply to 15.9pc of GDP by the end of FY25 from 12.6pc in FY24. The Fund attributed the increase mainly to stronger receipts from the petroleum levy and State Bank profits.
The IMF expects the petroleum levy to remain a key source of revenue, rising from Rs1.02tr in FY24 to more than Rs2.2tr by FY30. It projected the levy’s contribution at about 1.1pc of GDP over the medium term, rising to around 1.2pc in the current and next fiscal years before easing back.
The Fund projected direct taxes to remain unchanged at 5.5pc of GDP through FY30, while the sales tax ratio is expected to hover around its existing level of 3.5-3.6pc of GDP.
It said major contributions are projected to come from provincial taxes on the expectations of successful implementation of the agriculture income tax and sales taxes on services. The Fund expects the provincial tax-to-GDP ratio to increase from the current 0.9pc to 1.3pc of GDP in FY27, rise further to 1.6pc of GDP in FY28 and then stay flat until FY30.
In absolute numbers, the four provinces that collected Rs929bn in FY25 are expected to deliver Rs1.22tr during the current fiscal and further improve their collection to Rs1.77tr in FY27. They would build upon this base to collect Rs2.5tr in FY28, Rs2.8tr in FY29 and cross Rs3.1tr in FY30.
The Fund said projected FBR collections would depend on advancing reforms to raise revenues through tax policy simplification and base broadening, supporting fiscal sustainability and creating space for climate resilience, social protection, human capital development and public investment.
It noted that FBR revenues rose 26pc year-on-year in FY25 to 10.3pc of GDP, a historically high level, but overall tax revenue still fell short of the target by 0.3pc of GDP, largely due to delays in resolving court cases over disputed taxes (0.4pc of GDP) and lower-than-expected inflation. Lower-than-budgeted federal subsidies and grants, estimated at 0.2pc of GDP, helped offset the impact of the revenue shortfall.
The IMF said provinces had begun implementing new agricultural income tax (AIT) regimes, including measures to strengthen compliance and address underreporting.
“However, significant obstacles to realising the full potential of AIT remain, notably fully operationalising information sharing between the FBR and provincial tax authorities,” the Fund observed, adding that the provinces have also ensured that all services, except for a limited list of exemptions, are subject to GST.
It said the cross-country evidence suggests that countries that sustainably increase their tax-to-GDP ratio to 15pc have a significantly higher GDP per capita growth compared to countries whose tax ratio stalls around 10pc, as has been the case for Pakistan over a long time.
In this way, the Fund projected the consolidated fiscal deficit at 5.4pc of GDP in FY25, easing to 4pc this year, before declining to 3.2pc in FY27 and FY28, and then to 2.8pc in FY30.

According to the programme circulated by the Privatisation Commission on Sunday, bids will be submitted between 10:45am and 11:15am, while bids will be opened at 3:30pm, a process that will be shown live on television networks, as decided by the government.
The three bidders are: a consortium comprising Lucky Cement Limited, Hub Power Holdings Lim­ited, Kohat Cement Com­pany Limited, and Metro Ventures (Private) Limi­ted; a consortium comprising Arif Habib Corporation Limited, Fatima Fertiliser Company Limited, City Schools (Private) Limited, and Lake City Holdings (Private) Limited; and Air Blue (Private) Ltd.
Chairman of the Privatisation Commission and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation, Muhammad Ali, said during a YouTube interview that Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd had decided to quit the bidding process for PIA.
Mr Ali explained that on Tuesday, after submission, the sealed bids will be placed in a transparent box, following which the board of the Privatisation Commission will meet and fix the reference price.
Thereafter, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) will meet and approve the reference price, which will be announced during the opening of the bids.
He further explained that if bids are higher than the reference price, there would be an open auction. However, if the bids are less than the reference price, priority will be given to the highest bidder.
About the next step, the adviser said that the federal cabinet will approve the transaction within days, followed by the signing of the documents which the Privatisation Commission has received from the bidders. After the signing of the documents, the commission will have 90 days to fulfill some procedures, including the transfer of properties, liabilities and leased aircraft.
Transaction structure
As per the transaction structure, the bidding will be on the basis of a 75 per cent stake in PIA. Out of the 75pc bidding amount, 92.5pc will go to PIA instead of the national exchequer, while only 7.5pc will go to the national exchequer.
He said 25pc of PIA shares will remain with the government, which will be a valuable asset. However, the successful bidder will have the option to acquire the remaining 25pc after payment or leave it with the government.
According to Mr Ali, the valuation of the remaining 25pc shares of PIA will take place after the decision on the 75pc stake. The government has given bidders the option to decide whether to pay for the remaining 25pc within 12 months with a 12pc premium.
The bidders will have to take a decision on the 75pc stake on Tuesday, whereas for acquiring the remaining 25pc , they would have to take a decision within 90 days.
He said the bidders had sought to make payment for the 75pc stake over one year; however, the government did not agree to this proposal. If the performance of PIA declines within a year, the bidder would decide against the purchase, and if performance improves, the bidder would decide in favour, which would be unfair to the government, he said.
He said the winning bidder will deposit two-thirds of the bid within 90 days, while the remaining one-third will be deposited within a year.
Mr Ali said the revival of PIA would have an impact on GDP growth and the economy as a whole.
Pakistan has the lowest contribution of the aviation industry to GDP. Compared to 18pc in the UAE and 8.5pc in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan’s aviation sector contributes only 1.3pc to GDP. However, due to the potential in PIA, this percentage would increase considerably, he said.
Of PIA’s 34-aircraft fleet, only 18 aircraft are currently in operation. However, PIA has air service agreements with 97 countries, besides landing rights in over 170 countries.

 

PIA’s current net profit is Rs11 billion, with equity of Rs30bn. He said liabilities of Rs26bn will remain with PIA, and bidders will pay these over five years.
About the employees, he said that under the proposed agreement, no employee can be fired for one year. Employees’ pensions and perks are fully protected, while the pension liabilities of retired employees, including medical benefits and discounted tickets, will be borne by the holding company.
He said that in 2011, PIA had 11,500 employees, which has now reduced to 6,500, a reduction of 5,000 employees over five years.
Mr Ali said PIA is such an asset that if not properly managed, colossal sums of money will be lost; however, if run with proper management, it could generate mammoth earnings. With a country of 250 million people, PIA has customers, destinations, routes and landing slots.
What is required, he said, is investment, the addition of aircraft and efficient management, which the government cannot provide.
The type of decision-making required at PIA can only be undertaken by the private sector, and if the airline is properly managed, PIA could return to its glory days, Mr Ali remarked.

The latest approvals come days after the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank — all of which are illegal under the international law — had reached its highest level since at least 2017.
The Israeli government’s decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69, according to a statement from the office of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
“The proposal by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defence Minister Israel Katz to declare and formalise 19 new settlements in Judea and Samaria has been approved by the cabinet,” the statement said, without specifying when the decision was taken.

Decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69

Smotrich is a vocal proponent of settlement expansion and a settler himself.
“On the ground, we are blocking the establishment of a Palestinian terror state,” he said in the statement.
“We will continue to develop, build, and settle the land of our ancestral heritage, with faith in the justice of our path,” he said.
UN chief condemns move
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel’s “relentless” expansion of settlements in the occupied territory.
It “continues to fuel tensions, impede access by Palestinians to their land and threaten the viability of a fully independent, democratic, contiguous and sovereign Palestinian State”, he said earlier this month.
Since the start of the war in Gaza, calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state have proliferated, with several European countries, Canada and Australia recently moving to formally recognise such a state, drawing rebukes from Israel.
Sharp increase in settlements
A UN report said the expansion of settlements was at its highest point since 2017, when the United Nations began tracking such data.

 

“These figures represent a sharp increase compared to previous years,” Guterres said, noting an average of 12,815 housing units were added annually between 2017 and 2022.
“These developments are further entrenching the unlawful Israeli occupation and violating international law and undermining the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,” the UN chief said.
Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents.
Smotrich’s office said the 19 newly appro­ved settlements are located in what it descr­ibed as “highly strategic” areas, adding that two of them — Ganim and Kadim in the nort­h­ern West Bank — would be re-established after being dismantled two decades ago.
Five of the 19 settlements already existed but had not previously been granted legal status under Israeli law, the statement said.
While all Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory are considered illegal under international law, some wildcat outposts are also illegal in the eyes of the Israeli government.
Many of these, however, are later legalised by Israeli authorities, fuelling fears about the possible annexation of the territory.
US President Donald Trump has warned Israel about annexing the occupied West Bank.
“Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened,” Trump said in a recent interview to Time magazine.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and violence there has soared since the Gaza war erupted in October 2023.
Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 1,027 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank alone since the start of the fighting in Gaza, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian health ministry figures. At least 44 Israelis have been killed in the occupied West Bank in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations during the same period, according to Israeli data.

Under the initiative, farmers will be able to apply digitally through the Zarkheze app for financing of up to Rs1 million. After verification and agronomic assessment, applications will be forwarded to the bank chosen by the farmer for processing.
The programme provides that 75 per cent of the financing will be disbursed in kind for the purchase of agricultural inputs through banks’ pre-approved agri-vendors. Farmers will also receive advisory services through the Land Information Management System (LIMS).
Officials said the product was designed not only to provide financing but also to improve productivity by ensuring access to quality inputs and advisory services.
To encourage banks to increase lending to small farmers, the government has offered 10pc first-loss coverage and an operational cost subsidy of Rs10,000 per borrower for the net increase in banks’ outstanding borrowers.
Commenting on the initiative, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said it was part of the government’s push for financial inclusion and rural development, adding that it would support national food security goals.

 

SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad said Zarkheze “is a pivotal step in improving the small farmers’ access to finance”.
He stressed that digitising the credit process would reduce hurdles for small farmers and make formal lending more accessible and timely, while also supporting the goal of promoting digital payments in the rural economy.
PBA Chairman Zafar Masud said the banking industry would continue to work closely with the Ministry of Finance and the SBP to expand outreach and streamline processes for farmers across the country.
“By leveraging advanced technology and innovative credit assessment methods, we aim to improve access to finance for smallholder, particularly landless, farmers operating within a largely undocumented sector,” he added.
The Zarkheze application is available on the Google Play Store. Farmers may also visit their nearest bank branch for assistance with digital onboarding.

Since 2015-18, the federal government has upgraded FBISE through a Rs50 million project, “Modernisation and Standardisation of Examination System.”
The project was a brainchild of Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal.
According to documents, the project was completed in three years “with accomplishment of all set targets.” After completion of the project, the then PML-N government wanted to replicate it across the country. However, with the change of its government the plan could not be executed. 

Planning, education ministries and FBISE working on proposed project, says board chairman

According to documents, a series of meetings of the project steering committee represented by all provinces was held in 2018-19, but no tangible progress could be made due to lack of interest by the provinces.
“After completion of the PML-N tenure in 2018, the new government of PTI did not prioritise this project and provinces too did not show any seriousness and the project was surrendered in 2019,” said an official source.
He said now, once again, the Planning Ministry is headed by Ahsan Iqbal and Dr Ikram Ali Malik, who had executed the project from 2015-18, is the chairperson of FBISE. 
“So the government with the support of FBISE wants to provide same facilities and technology to all the 30 examination boards in the country,” the official said.
FBISE has completed concept papers for launching the new project and soon a presentation would be given to the planning minister. According to the working paper, the estimated cost of the project is Rs2 billion. Under the proposed project, three data centres with resources will be set up in provinces. Besides other facilities, provision of scanners and PC for scanning, customisation of software, delivery and training are part of the new project.
When contacted, the FBISE chairperson said on the direction of the federal government, the board was extending technical help to all the 30 boards. 
“Recently, we conducted a training workshop for all boards and we are also transferring technology to the boards. But for executing all the plan, new resources and manpower are required; therefore, a new project has been planned,” he said and added that in the new project all components of previous project of FBISE (2015-18) had been added in addition to new items.  
Sharing the details of new items, Dr Malik said the use of Artificial Intelligence in assessment process, introduction of verbal communication, certification on educational assessment for highly qualified persons, academic and resource audit, post-examination analyses and publication of examiner reports were part of the proposed project.
“Ministries of Planning, Education and FBISE are working closely on the proposed project and soon FBISE will give a briefing to planning minister in this regard,” he said. 
To a query about willingness of provinces, he said all provinces were excited to modernise their educational boards.
Recently, State Minister for Federal Education Wajiha Qamar while addressing participant of a workshop organised by FBISE called for forward-looking vision and introduction of technology-driven reforms in the national examination system. She said the government will always be supporting all educational boards in embracing digital transformation, which will lead to transparent, credible and student-centred examination processes.

The Republican politician, on a visit to Israel, is a staunch ally of US President Donald Trump.
Beginning in October, a fragile ceasefire has so far halted two years of war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip despite both sides trading accusations of truce violations.
A separate ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah also came into effect in November 2024 after more than a year of hostilities, though Israel continues to carry out strikes on Lebanese territory.
Israel has made dismantling the arsenals of both groups, allies of its arch-foe Iran, a key condition for any lasting peace.
“It’s imperative we come up with a plan quickly, put Hamas on a time clock, give them a period of time to achieve the goal of disarmament,” Graham said at a press conference during his visit. “And if you don’t, I would encourage President Trump to unleash Israel to go finish off Hamas.
“It’s a long, brutal war, but you cannot be successful anywhere in the region until you deliver on dealing Hamas out of the future of Gaza and disarming them,” Graham added, insisting that the second stage of the truce would fail if Hamas remains armed.
“Ninety days after the ceasefire, they are consolidating power in Gaza.“
Graham also called for military engagement against Hezbollah if it too does not surrender its weapons.
“If Hezbollah refuses to give up their heavy weapons, down the road we should engage in military operations working with Lebanon, Israel and the United States, where we fly with Israel … to take Hezbollah out,” Graham said.
Opposition to Turkiye
The Lebanese government has begun to disarm Hezbollah, starting in the country’s south, and insists it will complete the plan. Israel, however, has questioned the effectiveness of the Lebanese military, while Hezbollah itself has repeatedly refused to lay down its weapons.
Graham’s remarks came a day after mediators the US, Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye urged both sides in the war on Gaza to uphold the ceasefire.
The mediators are pressing for the implementation of the second phase of the truce, which would involve an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of an international stabilisation force and the establishment of an interim authority to govern the territory in place of Hamas.
The second phase of the Gaza truce also envisages the demilitarisation of the territory, including the disarmament of Hamas.
Graham backed Israel’s opposition to Turkiye being included in the stabilisation force, saying it would “rock Israel to its core”.
“There is no political support anywhere in Israel for having Turkiye being involved in the stabilising force,” he said.
Hamas, meanwhile, has called on the mediators and Washington to stop Israeli violations of the ceasefire in Gaza.
On Sunday, Israeli artillery shelling was reported in several parts of Gaza’s southern area of Khan Yunis, according to the civil defence agency, which operates under the authority of Hamas.
On Friday, six people, including two children, were killed in an Israeli bombing of a school serving as a shelter for displaced people, according to the agency.</p><small>2025-12-21 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2123180470e5f3b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962455/kp-cm-announces-preparations-for-countrywide-movement-as-ttap-issues-feb-8-strike-call' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM announces preparations for countrywide movement as TTAP issues Feb 8 strike call</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: As Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi announced preparations for a countrywide movement and that a call will soon be given, the main opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Sunday announced a nationwide wheel-jam and shutter-down strike on February 8, 2026.
The date coincides with the second anniversary of the 2024 general elections, in which the current PML-N government rose to power.
Claiming that the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before, the TTAP also decided to form a committee headed by Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, with Haleem Adil Sheikh, Zain Shah and others to constitute committees at the provincial and district level.
The TTAP announced that it will also organise conferences at all provincial headquarters and engage bar councils, civil society and the public for efforts for the restoration of the Constitution, rule of law and democracy in Pakistan.







Those who attended today’s conference included TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, PTI leaders Asad Qaiser and Salman Akram Raja, Balochistan National Party (BNP) chief Akhtar Mengal and others.
CM Afridi, who also attended the conference, told media persons that, as per the directions of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, the preparations for the countrywide movement have been started.
“We will meet every person and will tell them to wait for the second call. We will go to Rawalpindi, Lahore, KP and other parts of the country,” he said while replying to questions.
According to the declaration from the conference, as democracy was not possible without free and fair elections, an effort would be made to ensure free and fair elections.







Participants demanded the immediate appointment of a neutral chief election commissioner and next elections be held under a reconstituted Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
They also demanded an independent investigation into the February 8 elections and to identify and punish “responsible personalities”.
Participants were of the view that the judiciary was dismantled through the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments and alleged that conscientious judges, including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza, were forced to leave the institution, with arrangements made to sideline the remaining judges.
They further alleged that most recently, action was taken against Islamabad High Court Judge Justice Tariq Jahangiri, who was removed from his office over a fake degree. The conference claimed that these officials demanded to restore the judiciary in accordance with the original 1973 Constitution.
The conference also condemned the convictions against the PTI founder and his wife and the “inhumane treatment” of Imran’s sisters, including “their being attacked by water cannons.”
Additionally, the participants demanded the release of prisoners, including Imran, his wife Bushra Bibi and PTI leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Ejaz Chaudhry, Yasmin Rashid and Sarfraz Cheema, among others.







TTAP also condemned the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), alleging that it was passed to curtail media freedom, additionally showing concerns over the economic strangulation of Dawn Media Group.
Moreover, the participants expressed complete solidarity with journalists who “lost their jobs under the system” and denounced the narcotics case against journalist Matiullah Jan. The cases registered against lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, were also condemned.







The opposition was also of the view that statements and reports regarding the deployment of Pakistan’s armed forces in Gaza reflected “alarming non-transparency”. They demanded that the nation be taken into confidence before any decision was made.
The conference additionally cited the World Bank, claiming that over 44 per cent of Pakistan’s population lived below the poverty line, while the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) reports indicated corruption amounting to Rs 5,300 billion. They assailed the government for failing to curb unemployment, inflation, and poverty and lacked a roadmap for relief.







The TTAP also expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in Sindh and Balochistan and demanded the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other Baloch detainees.
The opposition alliance demanded the implementation of unanimous resolutions passed by the KP Assembly Jirga and the release of outstanding federal dues to the province. It also called for lifting the ban on the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement.
They said under the 18th Amendment, minerals belonged to the provinces and that entering into international mining agreements without taking provincial governments and local populations into confidence violated it.
The TTAP also demanded the immediate restoration of student unions across the country.

With the notification of rules for the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance 2025, the Punjab Assembly is expected to take up “The Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025” for approval in its sitting on Monday.
“The Punjab government is currently holding meetings to decide the scale of the three-day Basant festival, ranging from allowing kite flying activities across Lahore, or in some specified grounds or specified rooftops, including known rooftops inside the Walled City,” a source in the Punjab home department told Dawn on Sunday.
Sources also say the Punjab government has yet to formally notify the announced basant dates in Lahore.
The Punjab government instructed all deputy commissioners in the province to register kite and string manufacturers, traders or sellers and inform the government when they would be ready to hold the Basant festival in their respective districts.
“While the Basant festival was actively celebrated in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and other districts, the respective DCs (deputy commissioners) will formally inform the Punjab government whether they will hold the Basant festival on the Punjab government’s announced dates or another,” the sources privy to developments told Dawn.
Under the leadership of the then-chief minister, Shehbaz Sharif, Punjab had banned the Basant festival in 2007 following an increasing number of deaths and serious injuries caused to motorcyclists by prohibited and sharp kite strings.

 

The Punjab government is now making efforts to revive the festival, on the recommendation of PML-N chief and former premier Nawaz Sharif, following meetings with stakeholders.
Kite flying is currently banned across the province and will be allowed only on specific days and designated locations across the province after the passage of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.
Under the bill, flying kites with metallic wires, nylon cord or strings coated with glass or other sharp materials is prohibited, along with the manufacturing, transport, storage and sale of kites and hazardous strings.
Violators involved in kite-flying could face three to five years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs2 million, while those manufacturing or selling banned materials may be punished with five to seven years in jail and fines up to Rs5m.
The bill empowers deputy commissioners to allow “permissible kite-flying” on specific days and at designated locations, subject to government approval and strict conditions. However, the use of sharp or metallic strings will remain banned under all circumstances.
New rules
Under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Rules, 2025, manufacturers, traders or sellers of authorised kite flying material must apply to the DC and provide specified documents.
Kite flying associations can also register themselves with the DCs concerned through an online application by the association president or general secretary.
The DCs must verify the contents of applications and documents within 10 days of receiving them. Upon verification, the DC shall decide the application and issue a certificate of registration having a one-year validity. According to the rules, manufacturing, trading, transporting, selling or using a string coated with sharp materials is prohibited.



The notified rules also proposed an annual non-refundable registration fee structure, explaining that the government will charge Rs1,000 each to register manufacturers, traders and sellers, while they will charge Rs5,000 to register a kite flying association.
Specifications for permitted kites were also shared. A ‘patang’ shall not exceed 35 inches in width and 30 inches in length, while a ‘gudda’ cannot exceed 40 inches in width and 34 inches in length.
‘Dor’ (string) must be made of cotton with not more than nine threads and no less than 28 counts. The string must be wound in the shape of a ball, since spools are prohibited.
Last July, a 13-year-old boy was electrocuted while catching a stray kite in Kasur’s Basti Lal Shah area.
The boy rushed to catch a stray kite attached to a metal string. The metal string fell on the transmission line before he caught it.
In March last year, a motorcyclist died after a metal string, believed to be part of a stray kite, cut his throat in Faisalabad. Following the incident, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz ordered a crackdown on those involved in kite-flying.
The provincial government intensified its crackdown on kite-flying by declaring kite-making, flying, and transportation as non-bailable offences in August 2024.</p><small>2025-12-21 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640726-pakistan-iraq-express-resolve-to-fight-terrorism-extremism' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iraq express resolve to fight terrorism, extremism</strong></a><br><p>

Cold and dry weather was also forecast in Balochistan.
According to the statement, rain fell in isolated places today in Balochistan, KP, upper and central Punjab, AJK and GB. KP’s Kalam district recorded the highest amount of rainfall, at 24mm.

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 19 December 2025, nine khwarij belonging to Indian proxy fitna al khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.”
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It added that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists in the Dera Ismail Khan district of the province.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, four khwarij were sent to hell.”
Per the statement, the second IBO was conducted in the Bannu district. “In ensuing fire exchange, five more khwarij were effectively neutralised by the security forces.”
The ISPR said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain terrorists, who had remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies, and the target killing of innocent civilians.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as a relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” it said.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Last week, security forces had killed 13 terrorists in two operations in Mohmand and Bannu districts of the province.</p><small>2025-12-21 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640725-political-stability-progress-hinge-on-charter-of-politics-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>Political stability, progress 'hinge' on charter of politics, dialogue</strong></a><br><p>

“Politics is the name of a continuous process,“ he said, as he addressed a seminar in Lahore. “No country or nation can progress amid political and economic instability.”
The relationship between the government and the opposition has come under additional strain in recent weeks, especially after the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan as a “national security threat”, triggering a strong reaction.
Moreover, Imran, who is already facing a slew of legal cases, was once again sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case on Saturday, making his release uncertain.
The law minister stated that the country had witnessed cultures of tolerance as well as violence, emphasising that it was the duty of politicians to “balance out” these tendencies and pave a way through “dialogue”.
He emphasised that all politicians must play their role in preventing violence and extremism from paving the way into politics.
“We feel the need for a national dialogue, only for the sake of our beloved country.“
Emphasising restraint and respect for dissent, he called for “listening to opponents, embracing positive criticism, and forging a national political charter to ensure stability”.
Meanwhile, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) – the grand opposition alliance headed by Mahmood Khan Achakzai – is currently holding a two-day national conference in Islamabad.
The alliance had also called for a national dialogue in all parties’ conference in August, calling for a new charter of democracy between all political stakeholders.
“The parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,” they said.
National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had also shown his willingness to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties. However, there has been no formal initiation of the dialogue between the government and the opposition since last year.
PM’s advisor warns against ‘confrontation and violence’
Speaking at the same event, the Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said political stability can only be achieved through “restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue.”
He warned that “confrontation and violence” had repeatedly derailed Pakistan’s democratic course.
“No nation can progress through fighting, chaos and disorder,” adding that attacks on defence installations were “gravely wrong” and unacceptable.
He argued that political instability emerges when parties abandon dialogue for confrontation, stressing that the government has repeatedly offered talks.
“Tell us — who is refusing dialogue? If it is us, we will correct ourselves; if it is someone else, name them,” he said.
Rejecting claims that the general elections were selectively fair or unfair, Sanaullah recalled that even in 2018, the opposition alleged mandate theft, yet extended an offer to work together in parliament — an offer that was rebuffed with threats of imprisonment by Imran.
“If elections are disputed, political parties — not the establishment — must decide the way forward. Political stability is essential for national progress.”
Sanaullah also cited overtures made before the passage of this year’s budget, saying Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly invited the opposition for talks, including in the presence of the military leadership, proposing a ‘Charter of Pakistan’.
“Who is declining political dialogue?” he asked again, urging clarity to remove ambiguities blocking stability.
The former interior minister said, noting that while second-tier leadership within the PTI favours dialogue, fear of backlash from within the party’s ranks had stifled it.
Saad Rafique calls for Charters of Democracy and Economy
Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique called for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, warning against inter-provincial polarisation and repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote.
Rafique underscored that confrontation and chaos cannot strengthen the state, warning that repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote had eroded public trust.
Calling for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, he urged “engagement with all constitutional forces and dialogue with institutions to reduce political pressure and restore stability”.</p><small>2025-12-21 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2117541484f0818.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962431/current-levels-of-bilateral-trade-do-not-reflect-the-true-potential-of-pakistan-iraq-relations-president-zardari' target='_blank'><strong>Current levels of bilateral trade do not reflect the true potential of Pakistan-Iraq relations: President Zardari</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari met Iraqi President Dr Abdul Latif Jamal Rashid at Baghdad Palace on Sunday, a statement from the Presidency said.
The president, who is expected to meet senior Iraqi leadership during the trip, arrived in Iraq on Saturday night, where he was received by Iraq’s Culture Minister, Ahmed Fakkak Al-Badrani, upon his arrival in Baghdad.
According to the statement, President Zardari received a guard of honour upon his arrival at the palace, where he was scheduled to have lunch and a one-on-meeting with his Iraqi opposite number. The pair expressed satisfaction over growing diplomatic momentum from high-level exchanges.







“The president noted that current levels of bilateral trade do not reflect the true potential of Pakistan-Iraq economic, cultural and security relations,” the statement read.
“He highlighted opportunities for expanding trade, investment, agriculture and defence production sectors, besides information technology, construction, pharmaceuticals and related industries.”
President Zardari underscored the importance of business-to-business engagement, reciprocal business delegations and the establishment of direct banking channels to facilitate trade and commercial activity, the Presidency stated.
During the meeting, President Zardari also requested improved facilitation for Pakistani pilgrims visiting Iraq and was hopeful that the proposed memorandum of understanding (MoU) on Zaireen management would be finalised and implemented soon.
It aims to ensure orderly travel and address longstanding issues related to religious visits, the Presidency added.







“The president also expressed his firm resolve to work with [the] Iraqi government to stop [the] illegal entry and overstay of those Pakistanis who violate Iraqi law,” the statement added. “Both presidents [also] expressed their resolve to fight extremism, terrorism and narco trade and enhance bilateral cooperation.”
Additionally, President Zardari congratulated the Iraqi leadership and people on the successful conduct of the parliamentary elections and expressed his best wishes for the smooth formation of the new government.
“He reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm support for Iraq’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity and reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to Iraq’s stability, prosperity and democratic progress,” the statement read.
“The two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to further deepening bilateral cooperation across political, economic and social domains and agreed to maintain close coordination at regional and multilateral fora, including the United Nations and the OIC, on issues of mutual interest,” it added.
[The] Iraqi President appreciated Pakistan’s role in uniting [the] Islamic Ummah and the historical support to the people of Palestine.“







Separately, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Muhammad Mudassir Tipu posted on X that while en route from Islamabad to Baghdad, Zardari “conveyed a goodwill message to the Iranian leadership“ as his aircraft entered Iranian airspace.
“It reaffirmed solidarity with Iran, emphasising mutual respect and stronger relations between the two historic neighbours,” Tipu said.
He added: “ The president’s message coincides with the Iranian nation celebrating Yalda Night tomorrow — a civilisational tradition that brings hope, joy, and compassion amongst people and families. The spirit of Yalda Night defines our bilateral, social, and cultural affinities as well.”
Previously, the Foreign Office had said in a statement that President Zardari would undertake an official visit to Iraq from December 20-24.
According to the statement, he was invited for the visit by his Iraqi counterpart, Abdul Latif Jamal Rashid.
It said that during his meetings with the Iraqi leadership, President Zardari would review bilateral relations between the two countries and explore ways to further strengthen cooperation across key areas of mutual interest, including trade and investment, energy, reconstruction, manpower, technology, education and people-to-people exchanges.
The discussions would also cover regional and international developments, as well as cooperation at multilateral forums.
“The visit is expected to reinforce the traditionally warm and cordial ties between the two countries, identify new avenues of partnership, and enhance people-to-people linkages, particularly in the context of religious tourism and economic collaboration,“ it said.</p><small>2025-12-21 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/211426295b05440.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962442/pakistan-rout-india-to-clinch-u-19-asia-cup-title-as-sameer-minhas-and-ali-raza-star' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rout India to clinch U-19 Asia Cup title as Sameer Minhas and Ali Raza star</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan produced a dominant all-round performance to thrash arch-rivals India by a massive 191 runs in the final of the U-19 Asia Cup at the ICC Academy Ground on Sunday, claiming the prestigious title in emphatic fashion.
Opener Sameer Minhas lit up the first half of the match with a record-breaking 172 — the highest individual score in a U-19 Asia Cup final — propelling Pakistan to a formidable 347 for 8 after being asked to bat first.
In reply, India’s much-vaunted batting line-up crumbled spectacularly, folding for a paltry 156 in just 26.2 overs as pacer Ali Raza ripped through the order with figures of 4 for 42.
The victory marked a sweet redemption for Pakistan, who had suffered a heavy defeat to the same opponents in the group stage and had entered the final as underdogs against an unbeaten Indian side.
Instead, it was Pakistan who delivered a clinical display, overwhelming India in every department to lift the trophy amid jubilant celebrations.
India captain Ayush Mhatre won the toss and elected to bowl, perhaps hoping to restrict Pakistan on a surface expected to assist the seamers early on.
However, the decision backfired spectacularly as Sameer launched a brutal assault from the outset. After Hamza Zahoor fell early for 18, Sameer combined with Usman Khan (35) and Ahmed Hussain (56) in substantial partnerships — 92 for the second wicket and 137 for the third — to put Pakistan in complete command.
The right-hander brought up his century off 71 balls and raced to 172 off 113 deliveries, studded with 17 fours and nine sixes, before falling to a slower ball from Deepesh Devendran in the 43rd over.
A late flurry of wickets — five falling for 45 runs in the final overs — prevented Pakistan from reaching 400, but their total remained the highest ever posted in a U-19 Asia Cup final.
Khilan Patel was the pick of India’s bowlers with 2 for 44, while Devendran claimed 3 for 83.
Chasing 348, India started explosively, racing to 21 in the first over off Ali Raza, with Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashing a six and four in an over that also included a no-ball and extras.
Suryavanshi continued the onslaught, striking three sixes and a four in his blistering 26 off 10 balls.
But the introduction of spin and disciplined pace turned the tide irreversibly.
Captain Mhatre (2) holed out to mid-off, Aaron George (16 off 9) miscued a pull, and Suryavanshi nicked behind — all falling to Raza and Mohammad Sayyam as India slipped to 49 for 3 in the fifth over.
The collapse deepened. Vihaan Malhotra (7) was bowled attempting a rash pull off Abdul Subhan,
Vedant Trivedi (9) found short midwicket, and Abhigyan Kundu (13) upper-cut to deep third. Kanishk Chouhan (9) and Khilan Patel (19) offered brief resistance, but regular strikes kept India on the back foot.
Lower down, Deepesh Devendran provided late entertainment with a quickfire 36 off 16 balls, including six fours and two sixes, but his dismissal — skying one to point off Raza — ended any lingering hopes.
Subhan (2-29) and off-spinner Huzaifa Ahsan (2-12) chipped in effectively, while Sayyam supported with 2 for 38.
India’s innings lasted a mere 26.2 overs, underscoring Pakistan’s bowling dominance and fielding sharpness after the break.
The margin of victory was the largest in a U-19 Asia Cup final, completing a comprehensive rout.
Man of the Match Sameer was hoisted onto his team-mates’ shoulders as Pakistan celebrated wildly, while India, unbeaten until the final, were left to rue a day when nothing went right.</p><small>2025-12-21 12:04</small></div><hr>
