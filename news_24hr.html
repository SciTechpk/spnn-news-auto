A two-member bench, led by Chief Justice Sar­dar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, will hear on September 16 the petition filed by Advocate Mian Dawood.
The petition, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a writ of quo warranto (by what authority) against Justice Jahangiri, arguing that his foundational qualification for judicial office — an LLB degree from the University of Karachi — is “invalid”, thereby rendering his entire legal career and subsequent appointment illegitimate.
 
 

The petitioner has bas­ed his case on official correspondence from the Uni­versity of Karachi, which is attached as evidence.

Justice Dogar’s predecessor had reserved judgement on maintainability of plea; fresh hearings will delve into substantive allegations

The petition was initially filed earlier this year. Former IHC CJ Aamer Farooq had reserved judgement on the preliminary issue of whether the petition was maintainable.
With the case now listed for a fresh hearing before a new bench, the court is poised to potentially delve into the substantive allegations.
The key allegations include use of dual enrollment numbers, as the record shows two different enrollment numbers for Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I and Part-II examinations. The University of Karachi has previously stated that it is “impossible to allot two enrollment numbers to a student for one programme”.
The enrolment number AIL-5968/87, which appears on Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I mark sheet, was officially allocated by the university to another individual, Imtiaz Ahmad, son of Muhammad Ellahi.
Furthermore, the principal of Government Islamia Law College, Karachi, stated in a letter that a student named “Tariq Mehmood s/o Qazi Muhammad Akram”, under enrolment number AIL-7124/87, was never admitted to the college for the LLB programme during the relevant period.
In addition, the Controller of Examinations at the University of Karachi concluded in an official letter that the degree and mark sheets in question are “invalid”.
The petition argues that the appointment of a judge without the requisite legal qualification is not just an administrative error, but a violation of the fundamental rights of all citizens.
Citing judgments like the Sajjad Ali Shah case, the petitioner contended that the presence of a judge with an allegedly invalid degree “shakes public confidence” and “tarnishes the image of the judiciary as a neutral arbiter”.
It may be recalled that Justice Jahangiri is one of the five judges who challenged the transfer of Justice Dogar, along with two other judges —Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif — to the Islamabad High Court.
He was also among the cohort that, last year, wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council, alleging interference by intelligence agencies in the judicial matters.
Days before the controversy over his degree initially surfaced, Justice Jahangiri was expeditiously hearing election petitions against alleged rigging in all three constituencies of Islamabad.
Published in Dawn, September 12th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-12 03:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68c38738876da.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941370/school-closures' target='_blank'><strong>School closures</strong></a><br><p>WHEN schools are closed, especially at times when they are expected to be open, the loss in terms of educational and learning outcomes can be substantial. Out of the 365 days that make up the year, we get only 160 days or so for teaching and learning time, thanks to the weekends and a number of scheduled national and religious holidays. When schools are shut for a longer period, it makes it difficult for teachers to complete the syllabus, to revise or make time for deeper learning. They may not even have time for the repetition of lessons that may be needed when young people are learning new things.
On the other hand, take a look at the trends in the context of curricula reviews, including of the infamous Single National Curriculum. We have added a) more subjects to the curriculum, b) more material and learning objectives to all subjects, c) more requirements for what teachers need to do in class to explain things, and d) more expectations of how teachers should assess the students.
Reducing the time and the number of days spent on teaching and adding more to the curriculum of each grade cannot go together, of course. The ultimate cost is borne by the children whose education is compromised as a result. As it is, the quality of education is quite poor in most schools in the country. Learning poverty figures are already high: 77 per cent for 10-year-olds by one estimate. How do further school closures make sense then?
The most recent example of this sort of policy action was seen when the Punjab education minister announced in early August that schools would remain closed in the province until the end of the month, instead of opening, as initially announced, on Aug 15. No real reason was given for the closure, and we just heard some vague references to the weather and so on. The weather, even if inclement, cannot be the same across a province as big as Punjab. So how can it be a reason for the blanket closure of schools across the province for approximately 15 days? And did the minister know that the weather would be better from the beginning of September? As I write this, we are still facing heavy rains and floods.

We should talk about decentralising school closure beyond regular holidays to the district level.

There are two issues that should be debated here. One, shouldn’t there be a policy for school closures? Of course, we cannot predict all the events that could lead to such closures, but, given our experience over time, we have a good idea of the reasons behind school closures.
In recent times, schools have been closed due to smog, fog, cold weather, heat, rain and floods — as well as the anticipation of these climatic events. Schools have also been closed at times of protests or in anticipation of public demonstrations. At times, they have been closed when foreign or other dignitaries are visiting a city or a certain area. In addition, schools have been closed to prevent students from joining protests in an organised way. Maybe, there should be a policy that looks at a) the circumstances under which schools can be closed, b) who should have the power to make the decision, and c) what the post-facto accountability process should be for ensuring policy compliance.
Two, the issue of procedure should also be looked at in detail. Who should decide if schools should close? We are not talking of individual school closures as that power should obviously reside with those at the school level. We are talking about the power to shut down approximately 50,000 public/ government schools across Punjab (as well as thousands of public schools in the other provinces) and some 150,000 private schools across the country. Since education is a devolved subject, policy decisions have to be made at the province level, though it may be determined that the decision to close schools should be taken at the district or even sub-district level by specified educational authorities.
 
 

Within the procedural domain, there are two things to keep in mind: is it, or is it not, an emergency situation? If it is an emergency situation, we have to ensure that some official has the power to decide things, according to the policy parameters already in place, but the decision should be subject to a post-facto review to ensure not just accountability but also optimal learning and precedent-setting.
If we can foresee something coming up, the decision should not only be made according to policy — there should be a role for consultation with the relevant stakeholders, especially school officials and teachers, so that the best ways to deal with an anticipated situation can be determined. If there is a fair warning of what to expect, schools might be able to adjust their teaching in advance, and come up with options such as online learning, supplementary classes and so on. Prior warning and consultation will allow for smoother and better responses.
At the policy level, we should seriously think about decentralising school closure issues beyond yearly and regular holidays to the district level. The education minister, sitting in Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar or Quetta should not really have this power. Our provinces are just too big to allow for that. Most issues related to the weather, protests and other emergencies tend to be local and they should be met with local responses. This will take away some of the arbitrariness from the process and force provincial officials to conduct better, more thoughtful and careful policymaking to set the parameters for local actions as well.
Closing down schools may appear to be the easy option in any perceived or real emergency as the cost of this measure is not immediate and clear to most people. But, in light of the impact on the learning of millions of students in the country, the cost to children and their families — in fact, to society as a whole — is quite substantial. The action should not be arbitrary or based on convenience. It should be based on a well-thought-out policy that sets the parameters for closure, allows for due consultation if there is time, and post-facto accountability.

• UAE calls Israeli strike ‘attack on collective Gulf security framework’; Qatar calls emergency Arab-Islamic summit
• PM Shehbaz lauds Doha’s mediatory role for Gaza peace
WASHINGTON / ISLAM­ABAD: Members of the UN Security Council railed against Israel’s “illegal and unprovoked aggression” against Qatar, recalling that in the span of mere days, it has struck Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and now the main peace broker in Gaza.
Some nations even called for levying sanctions on Tel Aviv “before it was too late”.
In a statement issued ahead of the meeting, the Council also condemned the strikes, calling for “de-escalation” and expressing solidarity with Qatar, but without naming Israel.
Calling Doha “the territory of a key mediator” for peace talks between Israel and Hamas, the council also “underlined their support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar.”
Meanwhile, at a special UNSC briefing — jointly requested by Pakistan, Algeria and Somalia — Pakistan’s Permanent Repre­s­e­n­tative Asim Iftikhar Ahmad welcomed the condemnation, but called for further steps.
 
 

“The Council must go beyond; must hold Israel accountable; safeguard the role and protection of mediators engaged in peace efforts; and recommit to the centrality of international law and the UN Charter in maintaining international peace and security,” he urged.
The briefing was held under the agenda item ‘Situation in the Middle East’, and was attended by Qatar’s Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani.
“The brazen and illegal assault is not an isolated incident, rather it is part of a broader and consistent pattern of aggression and violation of international law by Israel that undermines regional peace and stability,” Ambassafor Ahmad said.
Even Dorothy Shea, the US envoy, stressed that unilateral bombing inside Qatar does not serve the interests of either Israel or the US.
However, she emphasised that this should not be used to cast doubt on Israel’s commitment to bringing its prisoners home.
Algerian Ambassador Amar Bendjama noted that “Israel behaves as if law does not exist, as if borders are illusions and the UN Charter is an ephemeral text.”
He pointed out that Qatar was the fourth country attacked by Israel in as many days, condemning “the conduct of an extremist government” and urging the Council to use all its tools — including sanctions — “before it is too late”.
Arab diplomacy
Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates on Thursday condemned Israel’s threat of further attacks on Qatar, warning that any assault on a Gulf nation amounted to an attack on the “collective Gulf security framework”.
The remarks came in response to a threat made by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu who said that Doha must expel or prosecute senior Hamas officials, “because if you don’t, we will”.
 
 

The incident prompted a fierce backlash across the Arab world and triggered urgent efforts to coordinate a regional response.
UAE president Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan embarked on a tour of Gulf capitals, a move his diplomacy adviser, Anwar Gargash, said was aimed at “reinforcing the concept of a common destiny”.
Meanwhile, at the funeral of those slain in Doha on Thursday, coffins draped in Qatari and Palestinian flags were carried into a packed mosque, underscoring the dual impact of the strike.
Hamas confirmed that five of the dead were part of its political operation, including the son of veteran negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. The Qatari soldier who died was named as Lance Corporal Badr Saad Mohammed al-Humaidi al-Dosari.
Hamas officials accused Israel of deliberately sabotaging negotiations over a possible ceasefire and hostage deal. Fawzi Barhoum, a senior spokesperson, described the airstrike as “an assassination of the entire negotiation process” and accused the US of complicity.
An emergency Arab-Islamic summit will be held in Qatar on Sunday and Monday to discuss next steps.
Shehbaz in Doha
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday rushed to Qatar to express solidarity with its people and the government after Israel struck the Hamas leadership in Doha in “a blatant violation of international laws”.
During his one-day visit, the prime minister met Qatar’s ruler Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and conveyed Pakistan’s strongest condemnation of the Sept 9 Israeli attack, which he termed “a blatant and flagrant violation of Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
He appreciated Qatar’s responsible, constructive and mediatory role in efforts to bring peace in Gaza, and stressed that such acts of Israeli aggression were clearly meant to undermine regional stability and threaten ongoing diplomatic and humanitarian efforts.
He also welcomed Qatar’s decision to host an extraordinary Arab-Islamic Summit on Sept 15, and said Pakistan had indicated its willingness to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation to co-sponsor and co-convene this summit.

• 19 militants killed in separate operations across KP
• President, PM laud successful operations
• Tribal elders vow to expel militants from South Waziristan, announce strict penalties
LOWER DIR / PESH­AWAR: At least seven Frontier Corps (FC) personnel were martyred and 13 others injured during a search and strike operation against militants in the Sar Banda area of Maidan in Lower Dir on Thursday.
According to official sources, one FC soldier was also reported missing after a fierce gun battle with militants in the mountainous terrain within the jurisdiction of Lal Qila police station. The militants had taken positions and opened fire on a security convoy.
The wounded were shifted to Lal Qila Hospital, and later referred to District Headquarters Hospital Timergara.
Police officials said a heavy contingent of pol­ice, Elite Force and Dir Scouts remained in the area as the operation continued.
Security forces also claimed to have inflicted “significant losses” on the militants, though no details were immediately provided.
Lal Qila was once a stronghold of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Nifaz-i-Shariat-i-Muhammadi (TNSM), led by Maulana Sufi Muhammad.
His son-in-law, Mullah Fazlullah, became the head of the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan (TTP) and fled to Afghanistan during the 2009 military offensive in Malakand. He was later killed in an air strike in Afghanistan.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for the successful operations. In their statements, both leaders lauded the bravery and professionalism of the troops in eliminating 19 militants, APP reported.
“Pakistan is determined to eliminate Indian-sponsored terrorism,” President Zardari said, reaffirming the nation’s resolve to completely eradicate terrorism and praying for the safety and success of the security forces. PM Shehbaz also commended the security forces for successful operations in Mohmand, North Waziristan and Bannu, reiterating that the war against terrorism would continue until its complete elimination from the country.
Police post
Separately, militants launched a late-night assault on the Lajbook police post. Police sources said personnel deployed there repelled the attack after several hours of firing, forcing the militants to retreat. No casualties were reported.
In another development, the Lower Dir district administration imposed Section 144 on Thursday, banning the flying of drones, quadcopters and balloons across the district. Deputy Comm­issioner Mohammad Arif Khan directed assistant commissioners and police officials to ensure strict enforcement, warning that violators would face legal action.
19 militants killed
At least 19 militants were killed in three separate encounters with security forces across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
“On 9-10 Sept, nineteen Khawarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna al Khawarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in KP” the ISPR said in a statement.
According to the statement, 14 militants were killed after troops engaged their hideout in an intense exchange of fire in the Guluno area of Mohmand district.
Another operation in Datta Khel, North Waziristan, left four more militants dead, while a separate encounter in Bannu resulted in the killing of one militant.
Weapons and ammunition were recovered from the slain fighters, who, the ISPR said, had been involved in numerous attacks in the region. Troops were carrying out sanitisation operations to clear the area of remaining militants.
The ISPR reiterated that security forces were committed to wiping out “the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism” from the country.
Meanwhile, tribal elders of the Toji Khel tribe in South Waziristan resolved in a meeting on Sept 9 not to allow militants to operate from their soil. They warned militants to leave the area or face exile.
The elders also announced strict penalties, including demolition of houses and a fine of Rs2 million, against anyone found facilitating militants with food, shelter or other assistance.

SUKKUR: A fisherman navigates one of the meanders of the Indus, near the Lansdowne Bridge. While Panjnad is recording flows over 0.6m cusecs, Guddu and Sukkur are steady at around 0.4m.—Umair Ali

• Panjnad crosses 668,000 cusecs; mass evacuations underway in Alipur
• Guddu, Sukkur barrages record over 400,000 cusecs, remain in ‘medium flood’

LAHORE: Punjab is facing a relentless flood emergency as the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers continue to swell, inundating thousands of villages and displacing millions across the province.
The situation intensified after Indian authorities issued alerts regarding rising water levels at Ganda Singh Wala and Ferozepur two days ago, prompting renewed evacuations along the Sutlej River.
Despite some areas witnessing a slight recession in water levels, the overall flood threat remains severe, with rescue and relief operations stretched across multiple districts.
At Panjnad Headworks on the Chenab River, water discharge surged to an exceptionally high level, crossing 668,000 cusecs. Between Wednesday morning and early Thursday, the flow increased by 100,000 cusecs, triggering mass evacuations in Alipur tehsil.
 
 

In a late night development, a protective dyke near the city of Shujabad collapsed for a second time, inundating communities along the river bank.
The downstream pressure has also impacted Sindh’s Guddu and Sukkur barrages, which continue to record medium flood levels with flows exceeding 400,000 cusecs.
In Rahim Yar Khan, authorities reported 660,000 cusecs passing through Chachran Sharif, though no immediate threat to localities was identified.
According to the Flood Fore­casting Division (FFD) data, Pan­jnad witnessed outflows of over 668,000 cusecs, with a steady trend, while Guddu and Sukkur barrages had a flow of over 400,000 cusecs.
On the other hand, flood levels in Punjab rivers receded further, with Ganda Singh Wala on the Sutlej River near the Indian border in a “medium” flood.
PDMA River Flows report relea­sed at 6:30pm revealed that on the Chenab River, Marala Headworks was steady at 68,986 cusecs, Khanki Headworks was rising at 82,411 cusecs, and Qadirabad Headworks was steady at 84,440 cusecs.
At Chiniot Bridge, the flow was rising at 57,463 cusecs, while the Rivaz Bridge gauge level was steady at 518 feet.
At Trimmu Headworks, the flow was steady at 140,007 cusecs. The Head Muhammad Wala gauge was falling at 412.38 feet, the Sher Shah Bridge level was steady at 393.20 feet and Panjnad Headworks was flowing extremely heavy at 658,845 cusecs.
On the Ravi River, conditions were steady at all locations: Jassar was reporting 19,500 cusecs, Ravi Syphon 32,120 cusecs, Shahdara 31,682 cusecs, Balloki Headworks 59,580 cusecs, and Sidhnai Headworks 75,549 cusecs.
On the Sutlej River, flows were predominantly steady: Ganda Singh Wala was at 98,165 cusecs, and Sulemanki Headworks was at 121,459 cusecs. An exception was Islam Headworks, where the flow was falling at 113,956 cusecs, while the Mailsi Syphon was steady at 120,150 cusecs.
For the Indus River upstream of Guddu, the Chachran Bridge gauge was steady at 298.25 feet, and the Guddu Barrage flow was steady at 506,433 cusecs.
Tragedies, displacement
In Bahawalnagar, two people drowned after a Rescue 1122 boat carrying 23 evacuees capsized. In Jalalpur Pirwala, another rescue bo­­­­at carrying 25 people overturned, leaving five, including children, missing. In Muzaf­fargarh, three teenagers fell into floodwaters near Basti Jarah; one died and two were rescued.
Authorities reported thousands fleeing their homes in Seetpur, Khairpur and Bait Nabi Shah in Muzaffargarh, as well as in Jalalpur Pirwala, where 706,000 people across 148 mou­­zas have been affected. In Khanewal, 159,029 people were evacuated from riverbeds, while 128,658 acres of crops were submerged.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabil Javaid said more than 4,500 villages and 4.287 million people have been affected by floods across the province, with 2.262m relocated.
He said 396 relief camps, 490 medical camps and 412 veterinary camps have been set up, while 1.696m animals have been shifted to safer areas. A total of 79 people have lost their lives in the floods, he added.
Rescue, relief efforts
Punjab Emergency Service Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer said over 13,600 people were rescued in the past three days in Multan alone, with more than 25,000 relocated. Across the province, more than 362,000 people have been evacuated using 139 rescue boats.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said four helicopters and 2,000 tents have been deployed to Jalalpur Pirwala, where reli­­ef distribution continues with army support.
Rahim Yar Khan Deputy Commissioner Khurrum Parvaiz told Dawn that water levels were rising downstream of Panjnad, prompting evacuation operations in the riverbed areas of Khanpur and Liaquatpur. He said around 12,000 people had been evacuated, six relief camps established and 1,800 tents distributed among flood-affected families.
The deputy commissioner added that all dy­­k­­es in the district were intact, with 660,000 cu­­secs passing through Chachran Sharif, and as­sured there was no threat to nearby localities.
 
 

Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had ord­ered the removal of the Assistant Commis­sioner of Jalalpur Pirwala over negligence after a rescue boat capsized. She added that water levels at Muhammad Wala and Sher Shah bridges had fallen below critical levels, ruling out immediate breaching of dykes.
Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman visited Panjnad Headworks, where he was briefed on inflows and discharges. Officials confirmed that evacuation of low-lying areas was ongoing, with all embankments under constant monitoring.
Meanwhile, officials said Mangla Dam is 90 per cent full, Tarbela 100pc, India’s Bhakra 90pc, Pong 99pc and Thein 97pc, increasing downstream pressure.
Balochistan rains
NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik said on Thursday that Pakistan was facing the final monsoon spell of this season, adding that during the past two days, the floodwater heading south was “losing steam”, Dawn.com reported.
“The water in our rivers came in two layers,” he explained. “The first is hitting Guddu Barrage, the other is at Panjnad. Based on this information, we expect that it will stabilise in the next two to three days.”
Several areas of Balochistan have been lashed by torrential monsoon rains over the past two days, triggering flash floods and prompting the PDMA to issue an alert on Thursday. District administrations have been directed to take urgent measures to protect residents from possible devastation.
Officials said seasonal rivers and streams were already carrying heavy rainwater, with the risk of severe flooding if showers continued in the catchment areas.
At Hub Dam, water levels rose rapidly to 338 feet, just one foot short of its full capacity of 339 feet. A senior Irrigation Department official said the spillways could be opened at any time, and people living along the Hub Riv­er had been warned to move to safer locations.
Meanwhile, the Balochistan government has completed arrangements along the left bank of the Indus River in anticipation of floodwaters expected to arrive from Punjab’s Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers within the next few days.
Rescue teams, boats and heavy machinery have been deployed in the border areas of Nasirabad division, including Nasirabad, Usta Muhammad, Sohbatpur and Jaffarabad.
“For the past week, rescue staff and equipment have been positioned along the Sindh-Balochistan border,” an official said.
Balochistan Irrigation Minister Sadiq Um­­rani told the provincial assembly that preparations were in place to shift people from vulnerable areas to safety. He added that an understanding had been reached with the Sindh government that no embankments would be deliberately breached if water reached dangerous levels. “If over 1.1 million cusecs flow through the Indus, the chief ministers of both provinces will decide further action,” he said.
Balochistan PDMA Director General Jahanzeb Khan said 16 flood control centres had been set up across four districts of Nasirabad division, operating round the clock. Rescue and relief arrangements, including provision of essential goods, had been finalised to assist displaced families.

The images of inundated fields in thousands of villages, displaced families, destroyed homes and dead livestock underscore the seriousness of the catastrophe. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has set up a special committee to assess the extent of damage to agriculture, determine how farmers can be compensated and recommend steps to mitigate the deluge’s impact on the economy.
The devastation will test both the state’s resolve and ability to rehabilitate displaced communities, protect food security and rebuild rural livelihoods in the face of recurring climate shocks. Immediate relief must come first: announcement of financial compensation for smallholders for their losses and soft loans to buy inputs for the next crop cycle; provision of food and fodder supplies; and veterinary and healthcare services in the flood-affected areas to prevent the outbreak of disease.
 
 

Equally critical will be the protection of consumers from a possible surge in inflation, which may require timely food imports and stringent action against hoarders.
That said, the massive nationwide human and economic losses and destruction of infrastructure caused by floods past and present show that even prompt and generous relief and rehabilitation efforts remain insufficient.
The government, therefore, should combine relief and rehabilitation with long-term sustained investments in climate adaptation and mitigation so that the economy and farmers are not left at the mercy of extreme weather events, be they floods, droughts or heatwaves.
While declaring a climate and agriculture emergency, the PM has rightly stressed the need for a comprehensive strategy to tackle climate challenges.
In this respect, a broader framework for action — the 31-point Declaration on Rights of Nature & Climate Justice — has already evolved under the Dawn Media Group’s Breathe Pakistan initiative.
Drawing from climate rights guaranteed under Article 9A of the Constitution, the call is for all stakeholders to build a “climate democracy”. The initiative provides a plan on how to build climate resilience around the restoration of the ecological balance to protect the vulnerable, and secure justice and sustainability for future generations.
 
 

Indeed, the national challenge is enormous and demands wide-ranging constitutional, legal and social reforms, besides close cooperation between the centre and provinces.
It also requires other stakeholders — businesses, high-net-worth individuals and civil society — to step up and help the government build climate resilience. After all, climate change is no longer a challenge for governments alone; nor does it impact just the rural economy. It also imposes significant costs on businesses in multiple ways as Pakistan’s vulnerability to destructive climate-induced events increases by the day.

“It flows unconditionally from the solemnisation of a valid marriage and constitutes a binding legal duty,” observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in his decision on an appeal by Ambreen Akram. She had challenged the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) verdict of April 28, 2015, which turned down her plea for maintenance because the marriage was not consummated.
“In essence, the only legitimate ground for suspending this obligation (maintenance) arises where the husband discharges a high burden of proof to establish that his wife has wholly and without justification withdrawn from marital relationship, not merely as physical access but encompassing the full spectrum of emotional, residential and relational life,” Justice Shah explained in his 15-page judgement.

Justice Shah says claim to maintenance takes effect with solemnisation of marriage; criticises LHC observations as ‘deeply patriarchal’

“Absent such proof, the obligation to provide maintenance persists,” Justice Shah emphasised.
Two fundamental questions
The judgement observed that the case raises two fundamental questions at the intersection of Islamic law, constitutional rights and social realities: When does a Muslim woman become entitled to maintenance within a marriage?
And, under what circumstances, may a man be excused from his marital obligation to pay maintenance to his wife?
 
 

At stake is not merely the contemporary interpretation of Islamic law but the very meaning of marriage (Nikah) and marital relationship, the scope of financial independence of a woman within marriage and the Constitution’s promise to uphold the dignity, privacy and equality of an individual, the protection of the family and participation of women in all spheres of life, the judgement explained.
The case pertains to Ambreen Akram’s marriage to  Asadullah Khan in Nov 2012. Despite a valid Nikahnama, Asad­ullah delayed Rukhsati for over a year.
So Ambreen Akram filed for maintenance in Oct 2013.
Claim upheld
A family court in Faisalabad upheld her claim, awarding an amount of Rs3000 per month as maintenance with effect from the date of marriage. The amount was later raised by Faisalabad’s District Court to Rs5000.
Asadullah Khan divorced his wife on May 2, 2014. But the LHC reversed the decision, citing lack of consummation.
The Supreme Court observed in its judgement that Asadullah Khan had failed to provide a marital abode, made no arrangements for rukhsati and did not fulfil his basic obligations under the marital contract.
There is no factual or legal basis to invoke an exception to the husband’s obligation of maintenance, Justice Shah observed.
 
 

“No credible evidence has led to suggest that the petitioner wilfully withdrew from the marital relationship or refused cohabitation without valid cause,” the apex court judge said.
The wife’s inability to cohabit due to husband’s own failure to facilitate Rukhsati does not defeat her claim to maintenance, the judgement explained.
Hence Ambreen Akram cannot be penalised for non-consummation as it resulted from her husband’s own inaction, Justice Shah said.
“To suggest otherwise would allow men to weaponise the absence of consummation, often caused by their own neglect, as a means to escape financial responsibility, thereby trapping women in marriages devoid of rights and dignity,” the judgement cautioned.
The Supreme Court held that the petitioner’s right to maintenance took effect with the solemnisation of marriage and continued as long as the bond lasted.
Considering that the divorce took place during the pendency of the litigation, the maintenance period will continue till the period of Iddat, the judgement added.
“The denial of maintenance in the light of husband’s default and in the absence of any fault on part of the wife, was contrary to law and accordingly set aside,” Justice Shah observed.
In his judgement, Justice Shah went on to say that a reading of Islamic jurisprudence, statutory enactments, constitutional protections and judicial precedents affirm that a woman’s right to maintenance was neither contingent upon consummation or rukhsati, nor subject to discretion of her husband.
This understanding not only gives effect to the egalitarian spirit of Islamic law but also reinforces constitutional commitment to dignity (Article 14), equality (Article 25), and protection of the family unit (Article 35).
“In a patriarchal society where economic dependence often fuels systemic injustice, the right to maintenance must be safeguarded as an essential constitutional, legal and ethical entitlement.
“Any attempt to curtail it must therefore be subjected to strictest constitutional and jurisprudential scrutiny, the judgement emphasised.
The Supreme Court set aside the LHC judgement by holding that Ambreen Akram’s entitlement to maintenance of Rs5000 per month began on the date the marriage was solemnised. It will include maintenance for the period of Iddat.
Concern over LHC verdict  In his concluding remarks, Justice Man­soor Ali Shah noted with concern the language used in the LHC judgement.
The High Court verdict stated: “Maintenance allowance is the right of wife after consummation of marriage and after crossing the barrier, it becomes the responsibility of the husband to maintain his wife.”
Justice Shah criticised the observations as “deeply patriarchal”.
These expressions cast women as passive recipients in marriage rather than equal partners, undermining their legal and constitutional status, the judge said.

A CTD Balochistan spokesman said on Thursday that the joint operation was launched on intelligence-based information about the presence of the terrorist group in Akalzai Yaro area in Pishin.
 
 

The terrorists opened fire on the CTD personnel when they cordoned off the area. However, the security personnel immediately retaliated, and a heavy exchange of fire continued for over an hour. During the gun battle, four members of Fitna al Khawarij — the term used by the state for the TTP — were killed, the spokesman said, adding that a large quantity of arms and ammunition was recovered from their hideout.
The seized weapons included two SMGs with magazines and cartridges, two 9mm pistols with cartridges, three hand grenades, a large quantity of explosive material, prima cord, and detonators.

Gunmen slay four in Kharan; as many abducted

The spokesman further said that the slain suspects had been directly involved in several terrorist incidents, including multiple casualty improvised explosive device (MCIED) attack on an FC truck in Chaman in Jan, IED attack on a Levies dafadar on College Road in Chaman in March, target killing of police official Mohammad Hashim in Oct 2022, and killing of another police official, Shaheed Zainullah in Nov 2022.
Further investigation is underway, the CTD Balochistan spokesman added.
Kharan attack
Meanwhile, unknown armed men gunned down four members of a family and abducted four others from a remote area of Kharan district on Thursday.
Police said the incident took place in the Laja area of Kharan, where a large number of armed men arrived late Wednesday night. After identifying a house, they barged in and opened fire on its residents, killing four people — three of them brothers — on the spot.
“The armed men fired multiple rounds at the victims, causing their instant death,” a senior police officer said, adding that the bodies were badly mutilated due to the excessive number of bullets.
Police officials also confirmed that the attackers took away four relatives of the deceased while leaving the area. Sources said the victims belonged to local tribes of Laja.
“It appears to be a case of target killing,” police officials in Kharan said, adding that an investigation was underway. No group has so far claimed responsibility for the killings.

A series of posts shared on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account on Thursday, which were supposedly based on his conversation with his sisters in Adiala Jail, recalled that the former ruling ANP had become unpopular in the province due to its support for such military action.
Although Mr Khan does not have access to his X account while in prison, it is not clear who operates it in his stead.
“Killing one’s own always leads to an increase in terrorism,” the post on the ex-PM’s official account said.
The message instructed all members of provincial and national assemblies and the Senate who are from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa “to come together and resist these  operations and drone strikes against our own people, and to work for  peace so that issues can be resolved through dialogue”.
Continuing his mantra of favouring negotiations over kinetic action, he also regretted the forcible expulsion of Afghans from the country. “These measures must stop immediately, otherwise the situation will deteriorate further.”
 






Mr Khan also expressed indignation over the attacks on his wife and sisters, saying that they had no role in politics.
“Aleema Khan only conveys my message, while the campaign against her reflects the regime’s fear. Bushra Begum has never interfered in political decisions and is suffering solitary confinement only because she is my wife.”
 






The PTI founder also criticised the “sham trials” that, in his words, are being used to snatch parliamentary seats. He pointed out that senior leader Ejaz Chaudhry’s seat was “unlawfully” awarded to Rana Sanaullah.
On the occasion of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s death anniversary, Mr Khan also paid tribute to Pakistan’s founding father, reaffirming his party’s resolve to continue its struggle for democratic rights.

The 10-member expedition comprised Bibi Afzon and Zeeba Batool from GB, Bismah Hasan and Iqra Jillani from Punjab, Madeeha Syed from Sindh, Mona Khan from Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Marya Bangash from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Shahreen Khan and Amina Shabbir from Islamabad and Laraib Batool from Balochistan.
According to a statement issued today by Alpine Club of Pakistan Vice President Karrar Haidri, history was “written in the high mountains of Pakistan”.
He said the first-ever all-woman expedition, organised and sponsored by the Alpine Club, successfully summited Bari La Peak on Wednesday.
“With equal representation from all four provinces, GB and AJK, these courageous women came together not just to climb, but to break barriers and prove that Pakistan’s daughters can rise to any peak,” Haidri said.
He added that before embarking on their journey, the expedition received training in basic climbing techniques at the Sadpara Mountaineering Training School under the guidance of renowned climbers Sajid Sadpara and Ashraf Sadpara.
Sajid, Arshaf, Fida Ali and Shareef Sadpara were mountain guides of the expedition.
“Their success is not merely a climb but a statement of resilience, determination and the immense potential of Pakistani women in adventure sports,” Haidri said.
Madeeha Syed, an award-winning documentary filmmaker who previously summited Mt Kilimanjaro (5,895m), told Dawn.com, “Most people just go to the lower summit. But the group, thanks to Sajid, made it to the true summit.
“Ayaz Shigri was leading the expedition and reached the lower summit (5,350m), but Sajid Sadpara set ropes to the summit for the rest of the team to make it to the true summit of Bari La (5,400m).”
However, Madeeha’s climb was cut short, as she experienced sickness and turned back at the 5,000-metre mark.
The expedition team members reached Skardu on Thursday.
For six members, this was the first time they summited a peak.
Meanwhile, Bibi Afzon, known as Zoni from Hunza, was in the K2 women’s expedition last year. Zeeba from Shigar is a rock-climbing instructor, and Bisma is a professional mountain and tour guide.
Mona is an Islamabad-based journalist.
“Life as a journalist has its own path, but being part of an expedition was a completely different experience,” she told Dawn.com. “For me, it was nothing short of a dream when I was selected by the Alpine Club to represent Kashmir in this mission.
“Prior to this, I had never climbed a peak above 5,000m, but up to 4,800 m,” she added. “I was excited but also nervous. Standing on the summit, I could hardly believe that I had crossed this challenging, rocky, and icy mountain.”
The Alpine Club added in their statement that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated the team on their achievement and invited them to the PM House in recognition of their courage and determination.
“In the years to come, the mighty mountains of Pakistan will echo with the footsteps of women who dare to dream,” Haidri stated.</p><small>2025-09-11 19:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11234148d0c0a82.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941283/litton-guides-bangladesh-to-win-over-hong-kong-in-asia-cup-t20' target='_blank'><strong>Litton guides Bangladesh to win over Hong Kong in Asia Cup T20</strong></a><br><p>Skipper Litton Das top-scored with 59 as Bangladesh beat a spirited Hong Kong by seven wickets in their first match of the Asia Cup on Thursday.
Hong Kong posted 143-7 after Nizakat Khan made 42 in the T20 meeting in Abu Dhabi, where the minnows were invited to bat first.
Bangladesh lost two early wickets in their chase to raise Hong Kong’s hopes of an upset, but Litton put on a stand of 95 with Towhid Hridoy, who made an unbeaten 35, to reach 144-3 in 17.4 overs.
Litton reached his 50 in 33 balls but fell to medium-pace bowler Ateeq Iqbal before Towhid hit the winning run.
It was Hong Kong’s second straight defeat in Group B, which includes Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. Afghanistan beat Hong Kong by 94 runs in the tournament opener.
Hong Kong lost two early wickets before Nizakat paired up with Zeeshan Ali, who made 30, in a third-wicket stand of 41. Nizakat then got into another partnership of 46 with skipper Yasim Murtaza, who hit 28 off 19 balls, as the two counter-attacked.

Murtuza was run out and leg-spinner Rishad Hossain struck twice in the next over, including taking Nizakat’s key wicket, as the Hong Kong batting line-up stuttered towards the end.
Pace bowler Tanzim Hasan Sakib stood out with figures of 2-21 from his four overs. Taskin Ahmed and Rishad also took two wickets each. In reply, Bangladesh slipped to 47-2 before Litton and Towhid rebuilt the innings and then bossed the opposition bowling.
Pakistan will open their campaign on Friday against Oman in Dubai.

Tuesday’s unprecedented Israeli strikes on a Gulf state sent shockwaves through a region long shielded from conflicts and halted already floundering Gaza talks.
“This crime was … an assassination of the entire negotiation process and a deliberate targeting of the role of our mediating brothers in Qatar and Egypt,” Hamas official Fawzi Barhoum said in a televised statement.
In Doha, tight security surrounded the mosque where prayers were held as the Gulf state’s ruler joined mourners.
One coffin bearing a Qatari flag and five others bearing Palestinian flags were brought into the mosque, live footage from Qatar television showed.
 


Facing the coffins, Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, prayed alongside dozens of mourners, some wearing traditional white robes, others wearing military uniforms.
The interior ministry said the dead would be buried in the Mesaimeer Cemetery after the funeral at Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Wahhab Mosque.
Authorities beefed up security, with checkpoints on access roads to the mosque.
Barhoum accused Washington of being “a full accomplice” in the Israeli attack.
The White House said Trump did not agree with Israel’s decision to take military action.
He said he was not notified in advance and when he heard, he asked his envoy Steve Witkoff to warn Qatar immediately — but the attack had already started.
Reassessing everything
Israel said it targeted Hamas leaders, but the group said its top officials survived.
 
 

Hamas said five of its members were killed — top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya’s son Hamam, his office director Jihad Labad and bodyguards Ahmad Mamlouk, Abdallah Abdelwahd and Mumen Hassoun.
Qatari Lance Corporal Badr Saad Mohammed al-Humaidi al-Dosari was also killed.
Barhoum said Hayya’s wife, his slain son’s wife and his grandchildren were wounded in the attack on the compound where he lived.
In an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he could not confirm Hayya’s fate.
The Hamas chief negotiator was not seen at the funeral in the footage viewed by AFP.
Pictures shared on Hamas’s Telegram channel showed Osama Hamdan — a senior figure in the movement — attending the burial of the movement’s dead, along with political bureau member Izzat al-Rishq.
A post by the group said several Hamas members were present at the funeral.
 
 

Sheikh Mohammed said the Israeli attack had killed any hope for Israeli hostages in Gaza, adding that Qatar was reevaluating “everything” surrounding its role as mediator in ceasefire talks.
Doha has been a venue for several rounds of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel.
The emirate allowed Hamas to set up a political office in Doha in 2012 with the blessing of the US, which has sought to maintain a communication channel with the group.
Sheikh Mohammed said he hoped for a collective regional response to the attack and that an Arab-Islamic summit would be held in Doha to decide on a course of action.
The attack has drawn sharp condemnation and a show of solidarity from Gulf neighbours.
The United Arab Emirates said, “Any aggression against a Gulf Cooperation Council member state constitutes an attack on the collective Gulf security framework.”
The United Nations Security Council condemned the strikes but did not mention Israel in the statement that was agreed by all 15 members, including Israel’s ally, the US.
“Council members underscored the importance of de-escalation and expressed their solidarity with Qatar. They underlined their support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar,” read the statement, drafted by Britain and France.
“Council members underscored that releasing the hostages, including those killed by Hamas, and ending the war and suffering in Gaza must remain our top priority,” it said.
Former Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was buried in Qatar after his assassination in Iran in July 2024 in an attack attributed to Israel.</p><small>2025-09-11 18:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/112252001a19ec3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941280/washington-new-delhi-not-that-far-apart-on-tariffs-says-trumps-india-nominee' target='_blank'><strong>Washington, New Delhi ‘not that far apart’ on tariffs, says Trump’s India nominee</strong></a><br><p>Republican President Donald Trump’s nominee to be the United States ambassador to India said on Thursday that Washington and New Delhi were “not that far apart” on tariffs.
“We’re not that far apart on a deal on these tariffs,” Sergio Gor, a close Trump aide who is currently director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, said at his Senate confirmation hearing.
“I do think it will get resolved in the next few weeks,” Gor said.
US-India ties have been strained by Trump’s trade war, with talks on lower tariff rates collapsing after India, the world’s fifth-largest economy, resisted opening its vast agricultural and dairy sectors. Bilateral trade between the two countries is worth more than $190 billion each year.
Trump first imposed additional tariffs of 25 per cent on imports from India, then said they would double to 50pc from August 27 as punishment for New Delhi’s increased purchases of Russian oil, as Washington works to end the war in Ukraine.
Trump said on Tuesday his administration is continuing negotiations to address trade barriers with India and that he would talk to Modi, in a sign of a reset after weeks of diplomatic friction.
Asked whether he would commit to pushing to ensure that a summit meeting of the Quad, which groups India with Australia, Japan and the US, would take place as scheduled later this year, Gor said: “Without committing to exact dates … the president is fully committed to continue to meet with the Quad and strengthening it.”
India has been expected to host a November Quad summit, with a more explicit focus on security regarding China than previously, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters this month that Trump has yet to schedule a trip there.</p><small>2025-09-11 17:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1118463958908b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941223/ihc-cj-warns-imaan-mazari-of-contempt-of-court-proceedings-over-alleged-dictator-remark' target='_blank'><strong>IHC CJ warns Imaan Mazari of contempt of court proceedings over alleged ‘dictator’ remark</strong></a><br><p>Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar on Thursday warned renowned rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir of a contempt of court case for allegedly calling him a “dictator”.
A heated exchange between the two took place during the hearing of a plea filed on behalf of rights activist Dr Mahrang Baloch, who has been in custody since March. The petitioner had sought the removal of Mahrang’s name from the Exit Control List (ECL), which restricts a person’s travel abroad.
Mazari was representing her in the court, when, at one point, the IHC chief justice remarked, “If I issue any order in this case, then Miss Mazari would go downstairs and hold a programme, [saying] that a dictator is sitting [here].”
 
 

At this, Mazari maintained she had said “no such thing that could be considered outside the boundaries of the law”.
“You should also remain within the boundaries of respect,” Justice Dogar then told Mazari.
At that, Mazari clarified that “whatever I have said was in a personal capacity”, adding that “it should not affect the client’s case.”
“If you have any prejudice against me, don’t let the client’s case get affected. I have come here with a brief, not in a personal capacity,” the lawyer added.
At this point, Justice Dogar remarked, “You commented that I am not a judge but sitting here as a ‘dictator’. Should we not initiate contempt of court proceedings against you?”
It is not clear which instance of Mazari calling him a dictator the judge was referring to.
Responding to the judge, Mazari said, “I have not said anything beyond the jurisdiction of the law and Constitution. If you want to initiate contempt of court proceedings, then please do so. The Constitution has given me the right to freedom of expression, which is what I have used.”
Addressing Mazari’s husband, the IHC chief justice then said: “Hadi sahib, make her understand; if I get hold of her someday …”
Mazari then quipped, “If we are at a stage where courts will threaten lawyers, then go ahead with contempt of court [proceedings].”
After the hearing today, Mazari posted on X that “it is important for CJ IHC to understand that I am not activist Imaan Mazari in his court, I am a lawyer holding a brief for my client and conduct myself according to professional etiquette (and a court should do the same).”
She reiterated that Mahrang Baloch’s case “should not suffer because of any grievances a judge may have with her lawyer over the right to freedom of expression in a personal capacity”.
 






Mazari is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities. In June, she won the World Expression Forum’s Young Inspiration Award 2025 on for her efforts and work advocating for the rule of law and justice in the country.
On Monday, an additional district and sessions court in Islamabad granted interim bail to Mazari and her husband in a case registered against them on the charges of alleged anti-state activities on social media. In the same case today, the court accepted the pre-arrest bail plea of the couple.
According to the first information report (FIR) of the case, registered by the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency, Mazari and Chatha were accused of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The FIR alleged that they held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It stated that Mazari and Chatha had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including Balochistan Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
Mazari was also among the voices calling for a probe into allegations made by six IHC judges against interference in judicial affairs by the country’s intelligence apparatus in March.
The same month, an Islamabad court had issued arrest warrants for Mazari and Pashtun Tahaffuz Move­ment leaders Ali Wazir and Manzoor Pash­teen due to their repeated failure to appear in a case concerning an alleged anti-state march.</p><small>2025-09-11 17:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11163550677ec3b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941161/in-meeting-with-qatari-emir-pm-shehbaz-urges-muslim-unity-to-confront-israeli-provocations' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with Qatari emir, PM Shehbaz urges Muslim unity to confront Israeli provocations</strong></a><br><p>In a meeting with the Qatari emir on Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged unity in the Muslim world to confront Israeli provocations following Tel Aviv’s recent airstrikes targeting residential areas in Doha.
PM Shehbaz reached Doha today on a one-day visit, where he met Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to express solidarity and regional unity after the attacks, state media reported.
“The prime minister emphasised that Israel’s ongoing aggression in the Middle East must be stopped and the Muslim world needs unity in its ranks to confront Israeli provocations,” according to a statement by state broadcaster PTV on X.
 






The statement said the prime minister strongly condemned the Israeli attack as a “blatant violation” of Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. He stated that the leadership and people of Pakistan were deeply concerned about the attack, which was contrary to international laws.
“Reaffirming the historical and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar, the prime minister said that both countries stand with each other. “In this spirit of brotherhood, Pakistan has stood shoulder to shoulder with his highness the emir of Qatar, the royal family and the brotherly people of Qatar during this difficult time.”
He assured the Qatari leadership of Pakistan’s complete solidarity and support against this unjustified provocation, statement said, adding that he also expressed deep sympathy over the loss of precious lives in Israel’s brutal and heinous attack and prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.
PM Shehbaz also appreciated Qatar’s “responsible and constructive mediation role” in efforts to establish peace in Gaza, stressing that Israeli actions, such as the Doha strikes, “clearly aim to undermine regional stability and jeopardise ongoing diplomatic and humanitarian efforts”.
Qatar and Egypt have been instrumental in US-backed att­e­mpts to hammer out a ceas­efire in Gaza, and have been wor­king tirelessly to help sec­ure a deal that would see prisoners being freed on both sides.
According to Hamas sources, the group’s representatives were targeted in Doha by Israel on Tuesday while they were discussing United States President Donald Trump’s proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza. Qatar had condemned the attack as “cowardly” and called it a flagrant violation of international law.
In today’s meeting with the Qatari emir, PM Shehbaz recalled that after the Israeli attack in Doha, Pakistan called for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council at Qatar’s request to discuss recent developments in the Middle East.
He also welcomed Qatar’s decision to host an Arab-Islamic Summit on September 15, saying that Pakistan had expressed its willingness to co-sponsor and co-organise the summit with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
“The prime minister also thanked his highness the emir for Qatar’s strong support for Pakistan during India’s unjustified aggression against Pakistan earlier this year. The emir of Qatar thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for visiting Doha to express solidarity.
“Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination in promoting regional peace, upholding international law and supporting the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people. During the visit, both leaders reaffirmed the deep brotherly relations between Pakistan and Qatar and their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region,” the statement concluded.
The prime minister later departed after wrapping up his visit. He was received earlier today and then seen off by Deputy PM and Minister of State for Defence Affairs Sheikh Saoud bin Abdulrahman bin Hassan Al Thani.
 






The prime minister was accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Tariq Fatemi and others during the visit.
The Foreign Office earlier said that the visit underscored Pakistan’s “unwavering support for the security and sovereignty of Qatar and its commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East”.

Kirk, an influential ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah University, sparking a manhunt for a lone sniper who the governor said had carried out a political assassination.
Authorities said they still had no suspect in custody as of Wednesday night, some eight hours after the midday shooting at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah, during an event attended by 3,000 people.
Cellphone video clips of the killing posted online showed Kirk addressing a large outdoor crowd on the campus, about 64 kilometres south of Salt Lake City, around 12:20pm MT (18:20 GMT or 23:20 PKT), when a gunshot rang out.
Kirk, a staunch defender of gun rights, was answering an audience question about mass shootings when the bullet struck his neck; screaming audience members fled in panic.
The lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper’s nest on campus, remained “at large”, said Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, at a news conference four hours later.

Meanwhile, Robert Bohls, the FBI special agent in charge, told reporters: “The shooter jumped off the roof and fled into an adjoining neighbourhood.”
Investigators found a “high-powered, bolt-action” rifle in a nearby wooded area and were examining that along with palm prints and footprints for clues.
The shooter appears to be of college age and “blended in well” on the campus, Mason added. The shooter has not been publicly identified, and while investigators said they had “good video footage”, they would not make that public for now.
State police issued a statement on Wednesday night saying that two men had been detained and one was interrogated by law enforcement, but both were subsequently released.
“There are no current ties to the shooting with either of these individuals,” the statement said. “There is an ongoing investigation and manhunt for the shooter.”
Trump said today he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honour, making the remarks during a ceremony at The Pentagon commemorating the 9/11 attacks.
Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance cancelled his trip to New York to commemorate the attacks by Al Qaeda on September 11, 2001, and instead will travel to Utah to visit Kirk’s family, a person familiar with the situation said.
“So much of the success we’ve had in this administration traces directly to Charlie’s ability to organise and convene,” Vance wrote in a lengthy tribute posted on social media. “He didn’t just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.”
 






In a video message taped in the Oval Office and posted to Trump’s Truth Social online platform, the president vowed that his administration would track down the suspect.
“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organisations that fund it and support it,” Trump said.
Jeff Long, chief of the university police department, said he had six officers working the event and coordinated with the head of Kirk’s private security team, which was also on site. Trump ordered US flags flown at half-staff until Sunday in Kirk’s honour.
The killing was the latest in a series of attacks on US political figures, including two assassination attempts on Trump last year, that have underscored a sharp rise in political violence.
“This is a dark day for our state, it’s a tragic day for our nation,” Utah’s Republican Governor Spencer Cox said at the press conference. “I want to be very clear that this is a political assassination.”
 
 

With the suspect still at large, there was no clear evidence of a motive for the act of violence.
Trump, who routinely describes political rivals, judges and others who stand in his way as “radical left lunatics” and warns that they pose an existential threat to the nation, decried violent political rhetoric.
“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals,” Trump said in the video. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.”
On Capitol Hill in Washington, an attempt to observe a moment of silence for Kirk on the floor of the US House of Representatives degenerated into shouting and finger-pointing.
Kirk’s appearance on Wednesday was the first in a planned 15-event “American Comeback Tour” at universities around the country. He often used such events, which typically drew large crowds of students, to invite attendees to debate him live.

Engraved ammunition
The Wall Street Journal reported today that investigators found ammunition engraved with expressions of transgender and antifascist ideology inside the rifle that authorities believe was used to shoot Kirk, according to an internal law-enforcement bulletin and a person familiar with the investigation.
The older-model .30 calibre hunting rifle was discovered in the woods near the scene of the shooting, wrapped in a towel with a spent cartridge still in the chamber, the sources said. There were also three unspent rounds in the magazine, all with wording on them.
Asked about shootings, then shot
Seconds before he was shot, the married father of two young children was being questioned by an audience member about gun violence, according to multiple videos of the event posted online.
“Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America in the last 10 years?” Kirk was asked.
He responded, “Counting or not counting gang violence?” He was shot moments later.
Kirk and the group he co-founded, Turning Point USA, the largest conservative youth organisation in the country, played a key role in driving young voter support for Trump in November.
After winning his second presidential term, Trump credited Kirk for mobilising younger voters and voters of colour in support of his campaign.
“You had Turning Point’s grassroots armies,” Trump said at a rally in Phoenix in December. “It’s not my victory, it’s your victory.”
Kirk had 5.3 million followers on X and hosted a popular podcast and radio programme, ‘The Charlie Kirk Show’. He had also recently appeared as a guest co-host on Fox News’ ‘Fox & Friends’. He was part of an ecosystem of pro-Trump conservative influencers, including Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer, Candace Owens and others, who helped to amplify the president’s agenda.
Kirk frequently attacked mainstream media and engaged in culture-war issues around race, gender and immigration, often in a provocative style.
At the White House, staff members, many of them young and admirers of Kirk, were ashen-faced as news of the shooting spread.

Political violence on the rise
Republican and Democratic politicians alike expressed dismay over the shooting.
Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement, “Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values. We pray for his family during this tragedy.”
The US is undergoing its most sustained period of political violence since the 1970s. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts since supporters of Trump attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
In July 2024, Trump was grazed by a gunman’s bullet during a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. A second assassination attempt two months later was foiled by federal agents, with opening arguments in that suspect’s trial set to begin on Thursday.
In April, an arsonist broke into Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence and set it on fire while the family was inside.
Earlier this year, a gunman posing as a police officer in Minnesota murdered Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot Democratic Senator John Hoffman and his wife. And in Boulder, Colorado, a man used a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack a solidarity event for Israeli hostages, killing one woman and injuring at least six more.
In 2022, a man broke into Democratic then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer, leaving him with skull fractures and other injuries.
In 2020, a group of right-wing militia members plotted unsuccessfully to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.

Known for his behind-the-scenes manoeuvring during a career lasting over three decades, Mandelson was forced from Britain’s most desirable diplomatic post after some of his letters and emails to Epstein were revealed this week.
Starmer, struggling in opinion polls after numerous setbacks, had strongly backed his ambassador on Wednesday as a state visit by US President Donald Trump, with whom Mandelson had developed strong ties, looms next week.
Trump has also faced questions about his links with Epstein, with the White House denying that an alleged birthday letter from him to the late financier is authentic.
Mandelson called Epstein ‘my best pal’
Mandelson, who was key to the Labour Party’s success when Tony Blair was prime minister, had come under scrutiny after US lawmakers released documents including a letter calling Epstein “my best pal”.
Emails were published in the media showing that Mandelson had advised Epstein to fight for early release in 2008 when he was about to be sentenced to 18 months in jail for soliciting a minor.
“The emails show that the depth and extent of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment,” Britain’s foreign ministry said.
The reporting of Mandelson’s suggestion that Epstein’s first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged was “new information”, it said, adding that Starmer had asked for his removal.

On Wednesday, Mandelson had said he deeply regretted ever meeting Epstein, and that he had carried on the association “for far longer than I should have done” — a statement that seemed to satisfy the prime minister.
Starmer had heaped praise on Mandelson, the first political appointee to the position in almost half a century, for his efforts in securing a trade deal with the United States. However, after being forced out of the cabinet twice under Blair, Mandelson was no stranger to controversy.
Last week, the departure of Starmer’s deputy, Angela Rayner, over her tax affairs forced Starmer into a wide cabinet reshuffle and overshadowed what had been intended as a relaunch for his Labour government.
As economic growth fails to ignite and potential tax rises loom, Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK has overtaken Labour in opinion polls, and Starmer’s party is growing restless.</p><small>2025-09-11 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623211-islamabad-court-nullifies-ban-on-11-youtube-channels' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court nullifies ban on 11 YouTube channels</strong></a><br><p>

The arch-rivals will clash in a geopolitically-charged men’s Asia Cup contest in Dubai on Sunday. It will be the first cricket match between the sides since four days of military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
While reigning T20 world champions India are the firm favourites to retain their title, Pakistan are on a high, having convincingly beaten Afghanistan in the final of a tri-series, also involving hosts United Arab Emirates (UAE), on Sunday. Pakistan play against Oman tomorrow.
Questioned during a pre-match press conference in Dubai about the team’s batting performance and judgement, Hesson said he was “not quite sure” where the concerns were arising from, saying the team had played against the “best wrist spin attack” in the world and won by over 70 runs against Afghanistan in the tri-series final.
“It’s very much a developing batting lineup. There’s many players who can win you the game on their day but they don’t have as many good days as you’d like at the moment … the thing for us is that we are more interested in the sum of the parts as a batting group.”
Hesson said that as a batting unit, “we have got the job done”.
The coach said what mattered for a team over a fifty or 190 runs was “what’s required to win the game and can we get above that — that’s the only thing that matters — it’s not about average strike rate”.
 


Hesson said it was exciting to be part of the “highly charged” event, adding that ultimately it was about keeping everyone focused on the task at hand. “That will be no different in the weekend,” he said.
He said India were “hugely confident and rightfully so” in terms of their performance, adding that Pakistan were “very much focused on improving as a team day by day and not getting too far ahead of ourselves”.
The coach further said: “We are well aware of the, I wouldn’t say the enormity of the task [of beating India], I would say the challenge of the task ahead and we are certainly looking forward to it.”
He said the squad for tomorrow’s match had not yet been finalised, adding that the Dubai pitch was very different from Sharjah regarding the abrasiveness of the grass. “I think within our squad we have got the balance to deal with it, we have got plenty of multi-skilled players which give us a bit of flexibility,” the coach added.
Hesson said he did not expect the pitch to provide spin as the one in Sharjah did. “The beauty of our side is we have got five spinners,” he said, saying Mohammad Nawaz was the “best spin bowler” in the world and also pointed to the performances of Abrar Ahmed, Sufyan Moqim, Salman Ali Agha and Saim Ayub.
“We have got a lot of spin bowling options if we think the conditions suit that. If we don’t, we’ve got five seamers as well,” he added.
The eight-nation T20 tournament began on Tuesday with Afghanistan beating Hong Kong by 94 runs. India crushed the hosts, the UAE, by nine wickets on Wednesday.
Since winning the World Cup last year, India has won 18 of their 21 T20Is.
India, Pakistan, Oman and UAE are in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Bangladesh form Group B.
The top two teams from each Group will qualify for the Super Four stage.
The top two teams will then play the September 28 final in Dubai.

In July, it emerged that an Islamabad court had ordered YouTube in June to block 27 channels for disseminating “fake, misleading, and defamatory” content against the government and armed forces. The sanctioned accounts were being run by journalists, political commentators and social media influencers in Pakistan and overseas. The ban order sparked criticism from various legal and digital rights groups.
Among the 27 channels were those of the PTI, journalists Matiuallah Jan, Wajahat Khan, Ahmad Noorani and Asad Ali Toor; former anchors Imran Riaz, Orya Maqbool, Sabir Shakir, and Moeed Pirzada.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Muhammad Afzal Majoka had later suspended the order for at least seven petitioners. A total of 11 of those impacted had appealed against the lower court’s order.
ADSJ Majoka conducted a hearing over the matter today and expressed anger at the prosecutor of the National Cyber Crimes Investigation Agency.
“You have started getting your work carried out through us. I will never let this happen. Tell me under which authority channels can be shut down? You are trying to defame the judges,” he remarked.
The judge said he would dismiss the petitions of those whose lawyers did not appear in court for non-compliance.
He subsequently reserved his verdict and later overturned the lower court’s order to the extent of 11 petitioners.</p><small>2025-09-11 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623173-floods-force-extension-in-hajj-registration-deadline' target='_blank'><strong>Floods force extension in Hajj registration deadline</strong></a><br><p>

So far, seven senators have quit the Senate standing committees, including Dost Muhammad, Zeeshan Khanzada, Mirza Muhammad Afridi, Muhammad Azam Khan Swati, Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, Falak Naz and Aon Abbas Buppi.
The development comes two weeks after the PTI claimed some 30 of its lawmakers resigned from the membership of parliamentary committees, although the National Assembly Secretariat only confirmed the receipt of 20 resignations.
The resignation letters of all seven senators, seen by Dawn.com, stated that the decision was made “voluntarily” upon the orders of Imran.
They resigned from all their respective standing committees, decrying Imran’s incarceration as well as the “disintegration of democratic norms” in the wake of the recent disqualification of PTI lawmakers.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
“I can no longer in good conscience serve on Senate committees when the state is the foremost violator of the very rights and protections these committees are meant to safeguard,” Swati wrote in his letter.
Citing the recent disqualification of PTI lawmakers, he stated that the authorities were “systematically dismantling” the foundations of democracy, the judiciary, and basic rights of citizens.
He pointed out that the “breakdown began with a deeply flawed judgment authored by Justice Qazi Faez Isa,” stripping PTI of its symbol — the bat, followed by the “abuse of Form-47” during the 2024 general elections.
“This resignation is an act of protest not just on behalf of my party, but to faithfully follow the decision of my party leader Imran Khan, the Law of this great country and the Constitution of Pakistan, which today stands orphaned, dishonoured, and ignored.”
Swati urged parliamentarians, jurists, and citizens to speak up “before the space for dissent is completely extinguished.”
Meanwhile, both Senator Khanzada and Dost Muhammad stated in their letters: “The deliberate denial of Justice has compelled both him and myself to take this step as an expression of protest.”
Buppi, Afridi, Mohmand, and Falak Naz, in their letters, said that they were also resigning following the directions of Imran Khan.
Mohmand, in his statement, criticised the state, saying that “the lawful avenue through which we can register [our] complaint has been blocked,” citing the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
The senators resigned from the following committees:

Swati — cabinet secretariat, economic affairs, law and justice, national health services, regulation and coordination, and rules of procedure and privileges.
Dost Muhammad — government assurances, human rights, national food security & research, poverty alleviation and social safety, and railways.
Khanzada — Overseas Pakistanis & human resource department, foreign affairs, finance, commerce, and privatisation.
Afridi — commerce, federal education and professional training, inter-provincial coordination, industrial and production, and power.
Buppi — Industries & production, poverty alleviation & social safety, religious affairs and interfaith harmony, defence production, and information and broadcasting.
Mohmand — parliamentary affairs, human rights, national health services and regulation, water resources, information technology and telecommunication.
Falak Naz — federal education & professional training, economic affairs, climate change, and problems of less developed areas.

Last month, PTI lawmakers resigned from membership and chairmanship of all standing committees in the National Assembly as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in July and August disqualified a large number of PTI members and leaders in relation to their involvement in the May 9, 2023, riots against Imran’s arrest, sparking protests in the NA.</p><small>2025-09-11 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/111643336c9b9ca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941228/quetta-atc-extends-byc-chief-mahrang-balochs-physical-remand-by-15-more-days-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>Quetta ATC extends BYC chief Mahrang Baloch’s physical remand by 15 more days: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta on Thursday extended the physical remand of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group on the police’s request, according to her lawyer.
Advocate Israr Baloch told Dawn.com: “The arrested leaders of the BYC were presented before Judge Muhammad Ali Mubeen of Quetta ATC -1, who extended their physical remand in police custody for 15 more days on the police’s request,” adding that apart from Mahrang, Bebow Baloch, Sibghatullah Shahji, Gulzadi and Beberg Baloch were presented in the court as well.
The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Its chief Mahrang, along with other BYC members, was arrested on March 22 on allegations of “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”. The arrests were made a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
Mahrang was taken into custody under Section 3 of the Mainte­nance of Public Order (MPO) — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order —  for a period of 30 days (first term). Thereafter, her detention was extended for an additional 30 days (second term) through a decision of the Balochistan Home Department in April.
After the BYC leaders had completed three months in custody in June, the provincial government issued a fourth extension order, extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.
Following their detention under the MPO, cases were also registered against Mahrang and other BYC leaders under different sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Pakistan Penal Code.
While in custody, Mahrang and other BYC leaders’ remand has been extended multiple times.
Last month, an ATC in Karachi issued a non-bailable warrant for  Mahrang in a case pertaining to sedition.</p><small>2025-09-11 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11102022e453ee4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941167/security-forces-kill-19-terrorists-in-3-separate-operations-across-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 19 terrorists in 3 separate operations across KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed 19 terrorists in three separate operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 9-10 September, nineteen Khwarij belonging to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.”
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said that an intelligence-based operation was conducted in KP’s Mohmand district upon the reported presence of terrorists there.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s* location, and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”
It added that another intelligence-based operation was conducted in the general Datta Khel area of the North Waziristan district, where, during the ensuing fire exchange, four more terrorists were neutralised by the security forces.
In another encounter that took place in Bannu district, one more terrorist was killed, the statement added.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian-sponsored killed Khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country.”
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the successful counter-terrorism operations.
According to Radio Pakistan, President Zardari, in a statement, said the courage and professionalism of Pakistan’s brave soldiers continued to protect the nation from the scourge of terrorism.
“He emphasised that such operations demonstrate Pakistan’s unshakeable resolve to confront and defeat Indian-sponsored terrorism,” the report said.
Per the report, PM Shehbaz said, “The war against terrorism will continue until this scourge is completely eradicated from the country.”
“Officers and personnel of the Pakistan Army are tirelessly engaged day and night to foil the nefarious designs of the Khawarij and the Fitna of Hindustan,” he was quoted as saying.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan.  In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.
Last week, six soldiers were martyred, while five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in the Bannu district.
In August, security forces neutralised 50 terrorists during a four-day operation in Balochistan.</p><small>2025-09-11 11:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1116364686ae62d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941229/governor-kundi-condemns-punjab-govts-arbitrary-ban-on-wheat-supply-to-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Governor Kundi condemns Punjab govt’s ‘arbitrary ban’ on wheat supply to KP</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Thursday condemned the Punjab government’s reported ban on wheat supply to his province.
Kundi had last week expressed his regret over reports that wheat supply from Punjab had been suspended. However, Punjab officials tasked with maintaining supplies of commodities and regulating their prices denied there was any ban on the grain’s inter-provincial movement.
“The arbitrary ban imposed on August 31, 2025, by the Government of Punjab on the supply of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a blatant violation of Article 151 of the Constitution and a serious breach of national unity,” Kundi said on X.
The Constitution’s Article 151 states that “trade, commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free”, but empowers the parliament to “impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one province and another or within any part of Pakistan as may be required in the public interest”.
 






The KP governor further noted: “As a result, the price of a 20kg bag of flour has soared to approximately Rs 1,200 in Punjab and up to Rs 2,800 in KP — an unbearable burden on families already struggling with inflation.
“On behalf of the people of KP, I strongly condemn this discriminatory act and urge Chief Minister Punjab [Maryam Nawaz] to not only condemn but also immediately withdraw this verbal ban,” he added.
Stressing that food security cannot be “compromised by provincial barriers”, Kundi also called on the PTI’s KP government to “urgently provide wheat quotas to flour mills to stabilise prices and protect the rights of our people”.
Yesterday, the KP Assembly unanimously passed a resolution, denouncing the Punjab government’s “restrictions” on wheat supply amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in flour prices across the province.
The sharp rise in prices is evident in branded flour, with some millers raising the cost of a five-kilogramme bag of fine flour to Rs700, up from Rs500 on August 1 and Rs600 on September 1, despite the arrival of the new wheat crop earlier this year.
 
 

The issue came to light earlier this month, when the KP chapter of All Pakistan Flour Mills Association said the Punjab government had imposed a ban on the interprovincial movement of wheat and called it “unconstitutional”.
Some market analysts believe the ongoing wheat crisis is unrelated to the recent floods in Punjab and other regions, as the new wheat crop was harvested in March/April. However, hoarders, stockists and investors are reportedly holding substantial wheat stocks, waiting for further price hikes driven by supply and demand dynamics.
On Tuesday, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced a three-day grace period for all wheat hoarders to voluntarily declare their inventory or face action.
The government has also recently unveiled a new roadmap for the ‘National Wheat Policy and Wheat Management Strategy’ for 2025-26 and onwards that will serve as a long-term plan to ensure food security, safeguard farmers’ livelihoods, protect consumers and build resilience against market disruptions and climate-induced emergencies.</p><small>2025-09-11 10:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623147-political-fissures-hinder-pakistans-anti-terrorism-strategy-report' target='_blank'><strong>Political fissures hinder Pakistan's anti-terrorism strategy: report</strong></a><br><p>

“While three recent events — the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and the two most recent ICC Women’s T20 World Cups — have featured all-female match official panels, this is the first time in the history of the Women’s World Cup the feat will be achieved,” the ICC said a statement.
The 13th edition of the Women’s World Cup is set to be held in India and Sri Lanka from September 30.
The tournament would be overseen by a group of 14 umpires, including Claire Polosak, Jacqueline Williams, Sue Redfern, Lauren Agenbag and Kim Cotton.
The ICC statement mentioned that Polosak, Williams and Redfern “will be appearing at their third Women’s World Cup” this year while  Agenbag and Cotton “will be at their second World Cup”.

The all-female panel of match officials for the World Cup also includes four match referees, namely Trudy Anderson, Shandré Fritz, GS Lakshmi, and Michell Pereira, who “will all bring varying levels of experience in the role” to the tournament.
The statement by the global governing body for cricket further stated that chairperson Jay Shah “believes the all-female panel is a historic moment for women’s cricket and thinks it will help lead to many more success stories around the world in the future”.
It quoted him as saying: “This marks a defining moment in the journey of women’s cricket, one that we hope will pave the way for many more trailblazing stories across all facets of the sport.
“The inclusion of an all-women panel of match officials is not only a major milestone but also a powerful reflection of the ICC’s unwavering commitment to advancing gender equity across cricket.”
He further said, “This development goes beyond symbolic value. It is about visibility, opportunity, and the creation of meaningful role models who can inspire future generations. By highlighting excellence in officiating on the global stage, we aim to spark aspiration and reinforce that leadership and impact in cricket know no gender.
“We are honoured to recognise a new chapter in the growth of the women’s game. We believe the influence of this initiative will resonate far beyond this tournament, motivating more women worldwide to pursue officiating careers and helping redefine what’s possible within the game.”
Earlier this month, the ICC also announced a staggering increase in the prize money for the Women’s World Cup.
“The overall prize money at the eight-team marquee tournament totals $13.88 million — a monumental rise of 297 per cent from $3.5m at the last edition held in New Zealand in 2022,” ICC said in its announcement.</p><small>2025-09-11 10:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623132-pakistan-assumes-chair-of-sco-counter-terrorism-committee' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan assumes chair of SCO counter-terrorism committee</strong></a><br><p>

Shenkiari Station House Officer Muhammad Saqib told Dawn.com that a jeep heading towards the Jabori area fell into a ravine due to landslide debris following heavy rains on the road.
“The local people rushed to the scene after the accident and retrieved the victims from the ravine. Two of them were [found] dead,” he said, adding that four others were injured in the incident, including three children and a driver.
He also said that the dead bodies and the injured were taken to the Shenkiari Rural Health Centre, while two of the injured were later taken to the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital for further treatment.
Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain, and poor infrastructure.
Earlier this month, two people were killed and 24 others sustained critical injuries when a wagon carrying participants of a wedding procession skidded off the road and plunged into a deep ravine in Balakot.
At least two local tourists were killed in an accident after their car plunged into a ravine in the Kaghan area in June.
In April, five people were killed and eight others were injured when a passenger jeep plunged into a ravine in Mansehra’s Jabori area of Siren Valley.</p><small>2025-09-11 07:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/11112440417c531.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941180/new-york-marks-911-attacks-against-divided-backdrop' target='_blank'><strong>New York marks 9/11 attacks against divided backdrop</strong></a><br><p>New York prepared to mark the devastating attacks of Sept 11, 2001 on Thursday, 24 years after the deadly plane hijackings that claimed almost 3,000 lives and forever changed the United States.
Vice President JD Vance was expected to attend memorial events at Ground Zero in Manhattan, where the World Trade Centre’s twin towers were destroyed in coordinated attacks that also saw a jetliner crash into the nerve centre of American military power, the Pentagon in Washington.
Another jet, Flight 93, crashed into the Pennsylvania countryside when passengers overran the hijacker and took control of the aircraft.
This year’s gathering takes place against a backdrop of sharp political division both in the city and nationally.
New York is in the grip of an unprecedented mayoral election campaign in which socialist Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing off against former governor Andrew Cuomo and sitting mayor Eric Adams.
 
 

New Yorkers go to the polls on November 4.
It was unclear which of the mayoral candidates would attend the ceremony, which is always attended by the sitting mayor as well as community leaders.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Mamdani, a Muslim and naturalised US citizen, calling him a “communist lunatic”, while one Republican lawmaker has called for the race’s frontrunner to be deported.
Mamdani holds a 22-point lead in the race, according to the latest polling from The New York Times and Siena.
“It was this horrific day that was also for many New Yorkers the moment at which they were marked an ‘other,’” Mamdani told The Times, describing the surge in Islamophobic attacks that followed 9/11.
It was unclear if Trump would attend New York’s commemorative events as he has in years past.
The United States has faced a rash of political violence in recent months, with the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk following the targeted killing of a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker and her husband and the firebombing of a Democratic governor’s residence.
 
 

New York will mark a citywide moment of silence at 8:46am (5:46pm PKT), the time that hijacked Flight 11 struck the North Tower of the World Trade Centre.
Places of worship across the city will sound their bells to mark the impact as families of the victims read the names of those killed at ground zero.
The official death toll was 2,977, including the passengers and crew of the four hijacked planes, victims in the twin towers, firefighters, and personnel at the Pentagon. The death toll excludes the 19 Al-Qaeda hijackers.</p><small>2025-09-11 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/111117393fc3db6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941179/soured-rivalry-india-vs-pakistan-as-brothers-chopra-and-nadeem-clash-for-world-gold' target='_blank'><strong>Soured rivalry: India vs Pakistan as ‘brothers’ Chopra and Nadeem clash for world gold</strong></a><br><p>India’s Neeraj Chopra and Arshad Nadeem of Pakistan will battle for javelin gold in Tokyo next week, the latest chapter in a brotherly rivalry which has soured since a deadly military conflict between their countries.
The Tokyo Olympic champion, Chopra, and his successor in Paris, Nadeem, will line up at the athletics world championships for their first encounter since the nuclear-armed neighbours engaged in a four-day conflict in May, their worst since 1999.
Chopra, who took Olympic silver behind his great rival a year ago, had often spoken about his friendly relations with Nadeem despite the tensions between their countries.
After Nadeem won gold and Chopra stood alongside him on the podium in Paris, Nadeem’s mother Raziah Parveen said: “Winning and losing is part of sport, but they are like brothers.” Chopra’s mother Saroj said she took some solace in Nadeem beating her son because the Pakistani “is also our boy”.
But publicly at least that changed after the conflict.
The 27-year-old Chopra, who will defend his world title in Tokyo, said that they were “never really close friends”.
Nadeem, 28, also played down any friendship with Chopra.
“When he won, I congratulated him, and when I won the gold, he returned the same courtesy,” Nadeem told AFP by telephone en route to Tokyo.
“[Just as] in wrestling, one wrestler wins and the other loses — it’s part of the game.”
Invitation withdrawn
Nadeem, who is returning to competition after calf surgery in July, hails from a farming village.
He became an overnight sensation when he gave Pakistan their first Olympic gold in 40 years with a Games-record throw of 92.97m.
Nadeem has competed only once since Paris, winning the Asian Athletics Championships in South Korea in May when Chopra did not participate.
The last time the pair clashed was at the Paris Olympics.
In April, the Indian star invited Nadeem to India for his ‘Neeraj Chopra Classic’ javelin event but the Pakistani declined, saying it clashed with his training schedule.
Chopra then withdrew the invitation after an attack in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir on April 22 killed 26 people.
India accused Pakistan of backing the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied.
In the conflict that followed more than 70 people were killed.
“I want to clarify that I don’t have a particularly strong relationship with Nadeem, we were never really close friends,” Chopra said afterwards.
“But because of the current situation, things will not be as they were. That said, if someone speaks to me with respect, I always respond in kind.”
Fine form
Chopra became a national hero in India after his Tokyo gold, earning million-dollar endorsement deals with his boyish charm, changing hairstyles and infectious smile.
He won the world title in Budapest in 2023 and has been in fine form since joining Czech javelin great Jan Zelezny’s coaching group ahead of the 2025 season. He went past 90m for the first time when he threw 90.23m at the Doha Diamond League meeting in May, but finished second to German Julian Weber.
At the Zurich Diamond League last month, Weber once again stood on top of the podium, with a throw of 91.51m. Chopra was second with 85.01m. Along with Weber, also in Tokyo will be two-time world champion Anderson Peters of Grenada.
The world championships start on Saturday, with the men’s javelin final on September 18.</p><small>2025-09-11 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623121-pm-shehbaz-departs-for-solidarity-visit-to-qatar-after-israeli-attack' target='_blank'><strong>PM calls for end to Israel's 'brazen aggression', seeks united Ummah in meeting with Qatari emir</strong></a><br><p>
