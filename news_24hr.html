Yesterday, the Foreign Office sought clarification from India via a letter over a sudden variation in the Chenab River’s flow, which badly affected wheat and other crops being fed through the Marala-Ravi link and other canals in various parts of Punjab.
The office of the Pakistan Commissioner on Indus Waters said that the Jhelum River was experiencing reduced inflow from upstream in India to downstream at Mangla Dam.
“It is really serious and alarming because around 15 million of the total 25 million acres of agricultural land, which is irrigated through various canals, is receiving either less water or no water these days,” a senior official of the irrigation department explained, expressing concern.

According to an internal report, on December 14, the inflows and outflows of the Jhelum River at Mangla stood at 5,000 and 33,000 cusecs, respectively.
However, inflows decreased to 3,300 cusecs on December 15 and remained at that level until December 19, while outflows remained at 33,000 cusecs.
Water flow at the same time last year was recorded at inflows of 4,400 cusecs and outflows of 25,000 cusecs.
“The data at the Kerot Hydropower Project, which comes just before Mangla Dam in Pakistan, is nearly identical. This indicates the abrupt holding and release of water by Indian authorities in their territory,” a senior official of the Private Power Infrastructure Board, which regulates the Kerot project, said.
“It is a serious matter,” he warned.
According to another senior official of the irrigation department, Indian authorities are controlling and disrupting the rivers’ flows by holding and releasing water from their run-of-the-river hydroelectric plants.
“The River Jhelum, through Mangla Dam, the Rasool Barrage, and various link canals, is irrigating a huge chunk of land in Punjab,” he said.
“The Chenab at Marala and various link canals also irrigate a considerable area of land,” the official explained, adding that the disruption of flows by Indian authorities is severely affecting crops.
“India had also caused problems for us during the recent floods by abruptly releasing water without informing us,” the official added.
Water flow in Chenab stabilises
However, the Ministry of Water Resources said today that water levels in the Chenab River have stabilised, after they plummeted due to variation in river flow.
The ministry, in a statement, said that the Punjab government‘s irrigation department was monitoring river flow in the Chenab from Marala headworks, with data showing that the river’s discharge stabilised after “a significant period of volatility”.
“Hydrological records from the first half of December 2025 confirm that an extraordinary reduction in flows was observed, persisting from December 10 to December 16,” the statement read.
It added that from December 8-13, satellite imagery showed a reduction in surface area in India’s Balighar reservoir, before it began increasing again.
“This reduction, followed by [an] increase in the surface area of Baglihar reservoir, leads to believe that India has emptied Baglihar reservoir followed by its refilling,“ the statement read, adding that under the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), India cannot empty dead storage reservoirs at run-of-the-river hydroelectric plants.
“Pakistan’s commissioner for Indus waters has taken up the matter with the Indian commissioner for Indus waters and asked for the details [and] data relating to extraordinary reduction in flows of Chenab River, under the framework of the [IWT],” the statement read.
The ministry noted that a positive shift in water levels occurred on December 17, rising to 6,399 cusecs by 7am.
“Punjab Irrigation Department data indicates that as of December 19, 2025, the river flows are presently within the last ten-year range of maximum to minimum flows,” the statement read.
“Punjab Irrigation Department data indicates that as of December 19, 2025, the river flows are presently within the last ten-year range of maximum to minimum flows.”
The ministry added that water levels in rivers will be continuously monitored to make sure that water management strategies adapt to any future fluctuations.
In April, India had held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.
The supplemental award was issued in a 2023 case that Pakistan brought to the PCA over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.</p><small>2025-12-19 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640410-pakistan-issues-demarche-to-taliban-regime-after-afghan-soil-used-to-martyr-soldiers' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan issues demarche to Taliban regime after Afghan soil used to martyr soldiers</strong></a><br><p>

Taiwan’s Premier Cho Jung-tai said the attacks at Taipei Main Station and Zhongshan Station were “a deliberate act”, although the motive was not immediately clear.
Cho said in a statement that the suspect wore a mask and threw “five or six gasoline bombs or smoke grenades” at Taipei Main Station.
According to the Taipei City Fire Department, a total of four people were confirmed dead, including the suspect, a 27-year-old man. Five other people were injured, it added.
The city’s mayor said the suspect had apparently jumped off a building and that he was wanted for evading military service.
One of the victims was killed while trying to stop the attack at the Main Station, Mayor Chiang Wan-an told reporters.
“Unfortunately, he was attacked and passed away … we are all deeply saddened,” he said.

A witness of the attack at the Main Station told local network EBC News that he had seen a “man rush up and try and subdue” the attacker, who was “wearing a gas mask and a bulletproof vest”.
“At first I thought it was a drill, then I saw a person holding a knife and throwing smoke grenades,” said the witness, who did not give his name.
The mayor said that “we understand that the suspect committed suicide by jumping from a building to evade arrest, and has been confirmed dead.”
High alert
A second witness told EBC News that “someone ran out wearing a gas mask and started throwing canisters that released gas.
“I quickly ran away. He kept throwing them behind me. I didn’t count how many (canisters) but there was a constant banging and clanging sound,” added the witness, who also did not give his name.
“I didn’t hear any explosions, but a lot of gas kept spraying out.” Cho, the island’s premier, earlier said three people suffered cardiac arrest as a result of the attacks, and several people had “injuries from stab wounds and blunt force trauma to various parts of their bodies”.
Authorities said they were ramping up security across the island in response to the attacks.

“All important locations… including railway stations, highways, subway stations and airports are maintaining a high level of alert and vigilance,” Cho told reporters.
Images released by Taiwan’s Central News Agency show a canister on the ground at the Main Station, with officers examining potential evidence at the scene.
A video posted on social media shows a thick cloud of white smoke covering an underground section of a metro station, with some people standing at a distance.
President Lai Ching-te said Taiwanese authorities will “quickly clarify the details of the case. There will be no leniency and we will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of our citizens.”
Violent crime is rare in Taiwan, though an attack in 2014 horrified the normally peaceful island when a man went on a stabbing spree on Taipei’s metro, killing four people. He was executed for the killings in 2016.</p><small>2025-12-19 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640394-pakistan-raises-water-flow-concerns-with-india-over-unusual-chenab-river-fluctuations' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan raises water flow concerns with India over 'unusual Chenab River fluctuations'</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X, the interim administration wrote that a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight carrying Sharif Osman Hadi’s remains landed at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka at 5:48pm local time (4:48pm PKT) after departing from Singapore, where he was undergoing medical treatment.







Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, the youth leader who died, was a spokesperson for the Inquilab Mancha (Platform for Revolution) and participated in the protests that overthrew Hasina. He was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last Friday while launching his election campaign.
Hadi, an outspoken critic of India, was initially treated at a local hospital before being flown to Singapore for advanced medical care, where he died after spending six days on life support.
Meanwhile, the United States Embassy in Dhaka stated in a post on X that Hadi’s funeral prayers will be held after afternoon prayers around 2pm in front of the National Parliament building on Manik Mia Avenue.
“Extremely heavy traffic is expected in the area and throughout Dhaka. US citizens should practice vigilance and remember that gatherings intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence,” the post warned.
“ You should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings. ”







Chief adviser of the interim administration Muhammad Yunus also confirmed in a post on X that the funeral would be held at 2pm at the southern plaza of the Bangladeshi parliament building.
Although calm had returned to much of the country on Friday morning, protesters carrying national flags and placards continued demonstrating at Shahbagh in central Dhaka, chanting slogans and vowing not to return until justice was served.

 

Residents in the Muslim-majority South Asian nation of 173 million said they were worried there could be fresh violence later on Friday.
The National Citizen Party, formed by students who led protests that forced then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina to flee the country last year, also warned of possible violence later in the day.
Nearly 1,500 people gathered peacefully at the national mosque in Dhaka after Friday prayers for a rally called by Khelafat Majlis, a religiopolitical party.

According to Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star, around 100 protesters gathered in Chowhatta and demanded that those responsible for Hadi‘s killing be brought to justice and also called for the resignation of Dhaka’s home affairs adviser if their demands were not met.
“Addressing the gathering, protesters alleged that the killing had been carried out ‘at the behest of India’ and blamed the Awami League and its affiliated bodies, particularly the banned Chhatra League,” the newspaper reported.

In Dhaka, videos circulating on social media showed mobs vandalising the offices of the country’s largest daily newspaper, Prothom Alo, as well as The Daily Star, on Thursday night.
The fire service said the blaze at The Daily Star was under control. Troops were deployed to the scene, and firefighters rescued journalists trapped inside the building.
The demonstrations were marked by emotionally charged slogans invoking Hadi’s name, with protesters vowing to continue their movement and demanding swift justice.
Several areas remained tense, with additional police and paramilitary forces deployed to prevent further violence.
Chief adviser of the interim government, Muhammad Yunus, issued a statement from his office condemning the arson and urging citizens to resist mob violence.
“This is a critical moment in our nation’s history when we are making a historic democratic transition,” he was quoted as saying. “We cannot and must not allow it to be derailed by those few who thrive on chaos and reject peace.”
Yunus added that the upcoming elections were “inseparable” from Hadi’s dreams and that honouring his sacrifice would require restraint, responsibility and a commitment against hatred.







“To the journalists of The Daily Star, Prothom Alo and New Age: we stand with you. We are deeply sorry for the terror and violence you have endured,” the statement read.
“The nation has witnessed your courage and tolerance in the face of terror. Attacks on journalists are attacks on truth itself. We promise you full justice.”
The statement also condemned the lynching of a Hindu man in Mymensingh, vowing that there would be “no space for such violence in new Bangladesh”.
UN rights chief urges probe into killing
The United Nations human rights chief voiced alarm at Hadi’s killing and called for a swift and impartial investigation.
“I urge the authorities to conduct a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation into the attack that led to Hadi’s death, and to ensure due process and accountability for those responsible,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
He urged calm as protesters rallied across Bangladesh.
“Retaliation and revenge will only deepen divisions and undermine the rights of all,” he warned.
With parliamentary elections scheduled for February, Turk stressed that it was vital to ensure an environment where all individuals could participate safely and peacefully in public life and freely express different views.
“I urge the authorities to uphold the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and security of journalists at this critical time, and prevent further escalation of unrest,” the rights chief added.
Government blames ‘fringe elements’
Bangladesh has been governed by the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Yunus since August 2024, after Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising.
The government has been grappling with fresh protests over delayed reforms, and warnings of unrest by Hasina’s party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the vote. The elections are scheduled for February 12.
It urged the people of Bangladesh to resist all forms of mob violence, which it said were committed by a “few fringe elements”.
Earlier, in a televised address to the nation, Yunus declared Saturday a day of state mourning in honour of Hadi.
Violence was also reported in a number of cities across Bangladesh, including the port city of Chittagong, where protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission.
The unrest follows fresh anti-India protests this week, with ties between the neighbours deteriorating since Hasina fled to Delhi.
On Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators marched toward the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, chanting anti-India slogans, while also demanding Hasina’s return.</p><small>2025-12-19 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19205752130705e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962043/kp-governments-non-cooperation-with-institutions-may-lead-to-governors-rule-kundi' target='_blank'><strong>KP government’s non-cooperation with institutions may lead to governor’s rule: Kundi</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Friday warned the PTI that the KP government’s non-cooperation with federal institutions might lead to the imposition of governor’s rule in the province.
The talks of governor’s rule in KP emerged after Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said that the imposition of governor’s rule in KP was being “seriously considered”, linking the need for this potential move to the “security and governance issues” in the province.
“The PTI cannot end the sentence of its party founder Imran Khan by attempting to forcibly shut down Islamabad or Peshawar, as protests and sit-ins cannot secure his release,” Kundi said, referring to the opposition party’s multiple attempts to march to the federal capital and its protests in Peshawar to put pressure on authorities for the release of the former prime minister.
Speaking to the media, the KP governor said Imran, who is currently serving his sentence in Adiala prison in Rawalpindi, was enjoying “VVIP facilities” in the prison and that “road blockades would not change his legal fate”.
“I don’t wish Imran Khan to be treated in the same manner as PTI leaders desired for their opponents,” he said.
Kundi said if the KP government cooperated with federal institutions, there would be no need for the governor’s rule. However, non-cooperation, particularly on the repatriation of Afghan refugees, could lead to such a step.
Citing the PTI-led federal government’s decision to hold talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in 2021, Kundi said the PTI had advocated engagement with terrorists. “But today, the state would never negotiate with those who take up arms against it,” he added.“No country allows foreigners to live without visas. The same rule applies in Pakistan,” he said.
Pakistan had provided solid evidence that Afghan soil was being used against Pakistan, but Kabul was not taking the matter seriously, he said. “No foreigner would be allowed to stay in Pakistan without a visa,” he added, noting that Afghan refugees could return legally. “All Afghans are not terrorists, but a few elements are creating problems,” the governor said.
He said that, though PTI had refused to shake hands, the talks with them were still welcome, but political dialogue was not possible without the PML-N. He alleged that PTI was now attempting to bring in an “imported opposition.”
Criticising KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, the governor said the chief minister and his cabinet appeared to be operating from outside Adiala prison rather than governing the province. “The real issue in KP is governance. There has been no visible development over the past two years, or even during the last 13 years,” he said, calling the province a “hub of corruption”.
He ruled out the era of “selective accountability,” saying recent judgments proved that accountability was applied to institutions and extended to the judiciary.
The governor also condemned the May 9 violence, saying no patriot could commit such acts.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar earlier said “governor’s rule is not the face of any martial law” and added that if the conditions merit it, then it was within the Constitution to implement it.</p><small>2025-12-19 16:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19211118ffc67c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962042/heated-argument-over-road-project-between-aleem-khan-palwasha-khan-mars-senate-standing-committee-session' target='_blank'><strong>Heated argument over road project between Aleem Khan, Palwasha Khan mars Senate standing committee session</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A heated exchange was witnessed between Minister for Communications Aleem Khan and Senator Palwasha Khan on Friday during a meeting of the Senate Committee on Communications over a question related to the construction of a road project.
The confrontation began when the PPP senator raised a question about a road she alleged was benefiting a private housing society in Lahore.
Pulwasha maintained that it was her right to “seek clarification on a project funded with public money and question whether the road had been built to benefit a specific private entity”.
A bitter exchange then took place between the minister and the senator. “I cannot stand the allegations set against me; I consider this offensive,” the minister said.
Senator Palwasha responded that the minister became furious over being “just questioned.”

         View this post on Instagram            

“I just asked a question whether you sought any benefit from it or not; it was not an allegation,” the senator clarified.
Aleem then reportedly said he would respond in kind if such “personal attacks” were made, adding that he did not wish to descend to what he described as a “lower level of discourse”.
Senator Palwasha, noting that the minister reacted angrily to legitimate parliamentary scrutiny, claimed he became “enraged” when asked to respond.
“You are angry at being questioned because you are guilty,” the senator stated.
“We will treat you the way we are treated,” Aleem responded. “If you speak about our person, we will also speak about yours,” he added.
As tempers flared, the committee chairman repeatedly attempted to defuse the situation and restore order.
“Mr chairman, is this any way to behave?” Palwasha questioned.
The senator then formally demanded a ruling on the minister’s conduct from the chairman of the committee, reiterating that her question was limited to transparency and accountability in the use of public funds.
“Give a ruling on the conduct of the federal minister,” she demanded.
The senator also urged the committee chairman to intervene and issue a ruling on what she termed the minister’s inappropriate behaviour.
“A ruling should be given on this behaviour,” Palwasha reiterated.
Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House following the argument, she said that if “a road funded by the public is being built, then why can we not question whether someone is trying to seek benefits for his private business?”
Expressing disappointment at the minister‘s behaviour, she said it was the “collective demeanour of Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet”
She also maintained that she will bring this matter to her party’s senior leadership.
Senator Bilal Ahmed Khan Mandokhail, a committee member, said that while ministers are routinely questioned in committees, the exchange was “inappropriate”.
He added that after the chairman’s intervention, the minister offered an apology, which Senator Palwasha declined to accept.</p><small>2025-12-19 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640385-cm-murad-says-red-warrants-to-be-issued-for-foreign-extortion-gangs' target='_blank'><strong>CM Murad says red notices to be issued for foreign extortion gangs</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement issued by the FO, President Zardari is visiting the Middle Eastern country at the invitation of his Iraqi counterpart, Abdul Latif Jamal Rashid.
The visit underscores the “longstanding, brotherly relations between Pakistan and Iraq, rooted in shared bonds of faith, culture, and mutual respect”, the FO said.







It added that during his meetings with the Iraqi leadership, President Zardari will review bilateral relations between the two countries and explore ways to further strengthen cooperation across key areas of mutual interest, including trade and investment, energy, reconstruction, manpower, technology, education and people-to-people exchanges.
The discussions will also cover regional and international developments, as well as cooperation at multilateral forums, according to the FO statement.
“The visit is expected to reinforce the traditionally warm and cordial ties between the two countries, identify new avenues of partnership, and enhance people-to-people linkages, particularly in the context of religious tourism and economic collaboration.
“The official visit reflects Pakistan’s continued engagement with Iraq and its commitment to fostering a result-oriented, forward-looking, and strategic partnership that contributes to Iraq’s stability and development, as well as to regional peace and prosperity,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-19 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19180522e96d845.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962038/trump-epstein-shared-close-relationship-marked-by-pursuit-of-women-nyt' target='_blank'><strong>Trump, Epstein shared ‘close’ relationship, marked by ‘pursuit of women’: NYT</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump and late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein shared a close relationship, with the latter calling Trump his “best friend”, according to a New York Times investigation published on Thursday.
Epstein, a convicted sex offender, died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking of underage girls. He held close associations with several influential people, including business tycoons and celebrities.
In November, Democrats released emails that suggested Trump was aware of the financier’s sexual abuse and definitely “knew about the girls.”
According to the NYT, while Trump was not found implicated in Epstein’s abuse and trafficking of minors, it appeared that the two men’s relationship was “far closer” than what the US president maintains.
“Beginning in the late 1980s, the two men forged a bond intense enough to leave others who knew them with the impression that they were each other‘s closest friend,” NYT reported, with Epstein reported to have claimed that he was Trump’s “closest friend for 10 years”.

NYT found that the two shared a distinct relationship, with the common interest of “pursuing women”.
“With other men, Epstein might discuss tax shelters, international affairs or neuroscience. With Trump, he talked about sex,” the report said, citing accounts of former employees.
The investigation detailed that throughout the 1990s, Epstein was Trump’s “most reliable wingman”.
It said that the two often “visited each other’s offices and spoke often by phone,” citing interviews with former employees of Epstein.
According to NYT, Epstein’s partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, introduced six women to Trump, one of whom was a minor; however, none of the women accused the US president of inappropriate behaviour.
According to an email released by Congress, the NYT found that Epstein once “boasted” that he “gave” Trump a 20-year-old woman.
In another instance, an Epstein employee from that era told the NYT that Trump would “occasionally send over modelling cards for Epstein to peruse, like a menu”.
The report also detailed that Epstein’s former assistant kept “daily handwritten notes” with instructions to either call Trump or return his call, indicating his regular presence in Epstein’s life.
The NYT found that in November 1993, at a beauty pageant press luncheon attended by Trump, a contestant, Beatrice Keul, alleged that Trump “groped” her and forced himself on her during a private meeting.
Before the meeting, she recalled that she was approached by Epstein, who told her, “I’m Jeffrey. I’m Don’s best friend.”
Epstein was not affiliated with the pageant, Keul said.
“He said, ‘Don likes you very much,’ and that they were organising parties at Mar-a-Lago and he would love me to join,” NYT quoted Keul as saying.

She alleged that Epstein pushed her and went on about “wealth he kept in Swiss banks, then about famous friends with whom he could arrange meetings,“ adding that this “hunting method” was routine.
In another instance, a woman who had attended several parties at Epstein’s mansion recalled that Trump was a “household name, someone Epstein often bragged about to the women around him, yet also seemed to compete with”.
“It was like a pissing contest — who had the most women,” the NYT quoted her as saying.
However, the two men’s relationship “soured” after allegations appeared against Epstein around the mid-2000s, the report said, beginning with a Page Six item in The New York Post.

The report mentioned Virginia Giuffre, who was at the centre of Epstein’s removal from the Mar-a-Lago club. Giuffre, then 18, was a masseuse at Trump’s exclusive club.
After she went public with her allegations, Epstein wrote to Maxwell that Trump had not received more attention in the case, considering that “he spent hours at my house” with Giuffre.
However, Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, maintained that “Trump had never had sex with her, and that she couldn’t remember seeing him in Epstein’s homes,” the NYT said.
NYT found that Epstein “resented Trump’s efforts to distance himself,” according to his emails.
On November 13, Congressional Democrats released 19 new images from the estate of the late Epstein, which included photos of now-President Trump.
In one black-and-white photo, Trump was seen smiling with several women — whose faces are redacted — on each side of him. A second image shows Trump standing beside Epstein, and a third, less-clear image shows him seated alongside another woman, whose face is also redacted, with his red tie loosened. It was not clear when or where the photos were taken.
“Everybody knew this man,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the photos.
“He was all over Palm Beach. He has photos with everybody. I mean, almost — there are hundreds and hundreds of people that have photos with him. So that’s no big deal.”
Previously, Trump has denied any involvement in or knowledge of the sex-trafficking activities of his former friend.
On November 20, in a stunning move, Trump signed into law legislation requiring the release of government records on Epstein.</p><small>2025-12-19 13:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191851463ef2620.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962041/abdul-subhan-stars-against-bangladesh-as-pakistan-set-up-u-19-asia-cup-title-clash-against-india' target='_blank'><strong>Abdul Subhan stars against Bangladesh as Pakistan set up U-19 Asia Cup title clash against India</strong></a><br><p>Pacer Abdul Subhan spearheaded a dominant all-round display as Pakistan Under-19s cruised into the final of the ACC Men’s U-19 Asia Cup with an emphatic eight-wicket victory over defending champions Bangladesh at The Sevens Stadium in Dubai on Friday.
The rain-hit second semi-final was reduced to 27 overs a side, and Pakistan skipper Farhan Yousaf’s decision to field first proved decisive as Bangladesh were bundled out for 121 in 26.3 overs.
Subhan led the charge with a probing spell of 4-20, accounting for key batsmen Azizul Hakim and Kalam Siddiki to leave Bangladesh reeling.
Huzaifa Ahsan offered excellent support with figures of 2-10, while Ali Raza and Mohammad Sayyam chipped in with a wicket apiece.
Samiun Basir was the lone resistance for Bangladesh with a 33-run knock before being run out at the close of the innings.
Pakistan’s chase was briefly checked when wicket-keeper-batter Hamza Zahoor fell for a duck, but opener Sameer Minhas ensured there were no further alarms.
The right-hander anchored the innings with a composed unbeaten 69 off 57 balls, striking six fours and two sixes. H
e added 85 runs for the second wicket with Usman Khan, who scored a brisk 27 before falling lbw to Samiun.
Ahmed Hussain stayed with Minhas till the end as Pakistan reached 122 for two in just 16.3 overs, sealing victory with 63 balls to spare.
Subhan was named player of the match for his incisive bowling performance.
Pakistan will now meet India in Sunday’s final at the ICC Academy Ground, setting up a high-profile clash between the traditional rivals.

The sources identified the terrorists as those belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij, a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
One of the “suicide bombers” among the terrorists rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a wall of the Boya fort on Friday morning, causing a blast, the sources said.
The powerful blast was heard as far as Miranshah city, located nearly 25 kilometres away, local sources reported.
Around four to five terrorists attempted to enter the fort after the blast, but the attempt was foiled due to timely action by security personnel, security sources said, adding that three terrorists were killed on the spot as a result of the action.
Only the outer wall of the battalion headquarters was partially damaged in the attack, they said.
According to the information shared by the security sources around noon, troops had encircled a fifth terrorist involved in the attack, and an operation was under way at the time.
It was later reported by the sources that the operation was completed by the early evening hours. The update, however, did not specify whether the fifth terrorist was killed.
The military’s media affairs wing, Inter-Services Public Relations, has yet to issue an official statement about the incident.
Meanwhile, police and hospital sources reported that 11 civilians were injured as a result of the blast, and they were rushed to the district headquarters hospital in Miranshah for treatment.
Initially, police had reported that assailants managed to enter the premises and opened fire. In the ensuing exchange of fire, four militants were killed while four security personnel sustained injuries, police earlier said.
Soon after the explosion, security forces cordoned off the area. A heavy contingent of police and security personnel reached the site after the blast, while special teams of the bomb disposal squad were dispatched to examine the scene. Rescue 1122 and medical teams were also sent to the site.
Following the attack, security across the district was placed on high alert, and traffic on a key highway was temporarily suspended as a precautionary measure.
The incident comes two months after four terrorists were killed after security forces foiled a suicide attack on a military camp in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali.
State media reported at the time that one terrorist rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the wall of the security forces’ camp after which three more tried to enter it.
Friday’s incident comes as a spate of terrorist attacks continues in Pakistan. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year.</p><small>2025-12-19 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1918180713e3650.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962039/flights-cancelled-roads-flooded-as-rare-storm-soaks-uae' target='_blank'><strong>Flights cancelled, roads flooded as rare storm soaks UAE</strong></a><br><p>Airport authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) cancelled or delayed dozens of flights and roads were flooded in major cities as the heaviest rainstorm in months lashed the desert nation on Friday.
Dubai’s Emirates airline axed 13 flights on Friday and there were also delays and cancellations at neighbouring Sharjah’s airport after the overnight downpour, which woke residents with lightning flashes and loud cracks of thunder.
Sharjah’s main street was completely flooded early on Friday, with residents seen wading through it in bare feet. One man rode his bicycle through the water, which reached the top of its wheels.







The scenes evoked memories of April 2024, when record rains caused widespread flooding and forced the cancellation of more than 2,000 flights at Dubai’s major international air hub.
On Thursday, Dubai police had urged residents to stay in unless “absolutely necessary” as the rainstorm approached.
Early on Friday, water-pumping trucks were seen around Dubai clearing blocked roads and large puddles in the streets.
The Dubai Airports website showed dozens of flights had been delayed on Friday and some cancelled.
“Some flights … are cancelled or delayed due to adverse weather,” a Dubai Airports spokesperson said.
The National Centre of Meteorology had warned of rainfall across the country from Thursday to Friday, including in Dubai and the capital Abu Dhabi.
Other Gulf states also experienced heavy rain, including Qatar where the Arab Cup football’s third-place play-off between Saudi Arabia and UAE was cancelled on Thursday.

Last year’s downpours in the UAE, the heaviest since records began 76 years ago, killed at least four people and brought Dubai to a standstill for days.
A study published by the World Weather Attribution group found that global warming caused by fossil fuel emissions “most likely” exacerbated the intense rain that lashed the UAE and Oman last year.</p><small>2025-12-19 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19160022fc3ce0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962033/chaman-traders-urge-govt-to-reopen-afghan-border-crossings' target='_blank'><strong>Chaman traders urge govt to reopen Afghan border crossings</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Traders from Chaman have arrived in the federal capital to press the government to reopen the border crossing with Afghanistan for cross-border trade, a member of the delegation said on Friday.
All border crossings with Afghanistan have remained closed since October 11, and trade has been at a standstill following ground fighting and retaliatory Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600-kilometre frontier that killed dozens on both sides—the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.
There are no signs of the border reopening, with Taliban rulers refusing to allow United Nations humanitarian aid to use Pakistan’s land route. Many people in Afghanistan depend on UN aid.
The traders have held a series of meetings with government officials, including Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, and sought their help in reopening the border, the second key crossing with Afghanistan, the former president of the Chaman Chamber of Commerce and Industry told Dawn.
A delegation led by the President of the Chaman Chamber of Commerce and Industry Abdul Nafi Jan Chakzai also met Senate Deputy Chairman Saidal Khan Nasir, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Commerce Rana Ihsaan Afzal, and Pakistan’s Special Representative for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq.
Community representatives from the region and the Chaman Chamber of Commerce and Industry were also part of the delegation.
The meeting with the minister focused on the challenges arising from the frequent and prolonged closure of the Pak-Afghan border crossing at Chaman.
“Stakeholders highlighted severe socio-economic impacts of the closures, including financial losses for traders, disruptions in the export of perishable goods, rising unemployment, and hardships faced by the local population that relies heavily on the cross-border trade,“ said a statement by the Ministry of Commerce.
The minister clarified that while the Ministry of Commerce would actively advocate for improved border trade facilitation, the decision regarding the opening or closure of the border was taken by the government, based on broader national considerations, and it is not the sole mandate of the ministry.
Khan assured that the issues raised during the meeting would be taken up with the relevant authorities and at appropriate bilateral forums to explore sustainable, predictable, and transparent border management solutions that balance security requirements with the need to promote lawful trade and economic activity.
Earlier, the traders met with the coordinator to the PM on commerce on December 17, in which they addressed challenges arising from frequent and prolonged border closure, according to a statement issued by the ministry.
Afzal also took the same stance, escalating the matter to relevant national and bilateral forums, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to addressing the challenges and ensuring that local communities continue to thrive.
Meanwhile, business leaders in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa said the border’s closure for more than two months had affected trade volumes, employment, revenues and regional connectivity.
The closure has paralysed a vital trade corridor worth billions of dollars annually, said another trader.
Daily exports during peak seasons (e.g., agriculture and construction) reached $50-60 million, including cement, sugar, kinnows (citrus fruits), potatoes, medicines, and surgical items.
Value-added industrial products, raw materials, and miscellaneous goods worth billions of rupees are stranded at the border crossings, with local exporters claiming losses of over $4 million daily.</p><small>2025-12-19 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191648472f29c95.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962036/over-1000-patients-have-died-awaiting-evacuation-from-gaza-since-july-2024-who' target='_blank'><strong>Over 1,000 patients have died awaiting evacuation from Gaza since July 2024: WHO</strong></a><br><p>More than 1,000 patients have died while waiting for urgent medical evacuation from war-ravaged Gaza in the last year and a half, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X that the UN agency and its partners had “evacuated over 10,600 patients from Gaza with severe health conditions, including over 5,600 children” since the start of the war more than two years ago.
But he warned that “many more patients remain in Gaza awaiting evacuation to receive appropriate healthcare”.







Citing numbers from the health ministry in Gaza, Tedros said that 1,092 patients were known to have died while awaiting medical evacuation just between July 2024 and November 28, 2025.
“This figure is likely underreported,” he warned, calling on “more countries to open doors to patients from Gaza, and for medical evacuation to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to be restored”.
“Lives depend on it.”
The WHO has previously estimated that more than 16,500 patients still need treatment outside of Gaza, while a top official with the charity Doctors Without Borders told AFP earlier this month the actual number was likely “three to four times that number”.
Up to December 1, over 30 countries had taken patients from Gaza, but only a handful, including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, had accepted large numbers.
A US-sponsored ceasefire has halted fighting in Gaza, which began after Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
But the deal, in effect since October 10, remains fragile as Israel and Hamas accuse each other almost daily of violations.</p><small>2025-12-19 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19162751abfb5c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962034/pakistan-targets-january-for-inaugural-panda-bond-tranche-says-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan targets January for inaugural panda bond tranche, says finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is targeting January to issue its first panda bond tranche, part of a planned programme of up to $1 billion, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday, as Islamabad seeks to diversify funding sources and tap China’s onshore debt market.
The inaugural issuance is expected to raise the equivalent of about $250 million, with further tranches to follow under a phased programme once regulatory approvals are completed, the ministry said after Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired a review meeting on the plan.
Approvals from multilateral partners have already been secured, and final clearances from Chinese regulators are expected by early January, the statement said.
The panda bond programme, denominated in yuan and sold on China’s domestic market, is part of Pakistan’s broader debt management strategy as it works to stabilise its economy under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme.







Pricing for the inaugural bond will be determined closer to the launch once all regulatory requirements are completed, the ministry said.
The finance ministry said engagement with Chinese institutional investors had been constructive, reflecting improving confidence in Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook following recent policy reforms.
Preparatory work has already begun for subsequent tranches within the planned $1bn panda bond programme.
Moody’s raised its long-term foreign-currency issuer rating to Caa1 with a stable outlook in August 2025, citing an improving external position supported by reforms and IMF support. S&P Global Ratings upgraded Pakistan to B- with a stable outlook in July 2025.
Pakistan has relied heavily on bilateral and multilateral financing, including short-term funding from Middle Eastern banks, but is now looking to broaden its investor base through markets such as China’s onshore bond market.</p><small>2025-12-19 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640330-may-9-case-yasmin-rashid-sarfraz-cheema-among-others-handed-10-year-imprisonment' target='_blank'><strong>ATC hands 10-year imprisonment to Yasmin Rashid, other PTI leaders in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

This observation by UN special rapporteurs was made in a report dated October 16, which was made public on December 15. The report outlined India‘s military response to the Pahalgam attack, as well as New Delhi’s decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in “abeyance” following the incident.
The five UN experts who compiled the report also observed that New Delhi’s actions that “may be taken to disrupt the flow of water to Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty” appeared to risk violating the rights to work and livelihood, an adequate standard of living — including the rights to water and food — a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and development.
The attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22 resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
A day after the attack, India decided to immediately hold the IWT in “abeyance”. For its part, Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin.
Roughly two weeks after the Pahalgam incident, India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, an act which led to the worst between the old foes in decades. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire.
UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism Ben Saul, UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Right to a Clean, Healthy and Sustainable Environment Astrid Puentes Riano, UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions Morris Tidball-Binz and UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, as well as an independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order George Katrougalos discussed these events in detail in their October report.
‘Unlawful use of force’
The UN experts noted that while India maintained it had exercised its “right to respond and preempt, as well as deter … cross-border attacks” by lauching strikes in Pakistan, New Delhi “did not notify the UN Security Council that its operation was in the exercise to of the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, under the procedures required by that article“.
They emphasised that Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law “prohibits India from the threat or use of armed force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Pakistan, whether such force is targeting state or non-state actors”.
“We note further that under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and customary international law, India may only exercise the right of self-defence in foreign territory where it is necessary and proportionate in response to an armed attack committed by a foreign state, whether directly by state forces or where a state ‘sends’ non-state forces to attack,” they added.
The experts further highlighted that Article 51 required “the victim state“ to report the armed attack to the Security Council.
“There is no separate right to unilaterally use military force in foreign territory in order to counter terrorism.”
The experts also said, “We are concerned that India has not disclosed credible evidence that the militants who committed the Pahalgam attack were sent to attack India by the Government of Pakistan.”
Reiterating that India had not notified the Security Council of any claim of self-defence in carrying out strikes in Pakistan, they experts observed: “It appears that India has violated the prohibition on the use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and may itself have committed an armed attack on Pakistan, entitling Pakistan to exercise self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter, risking escalation that could pose grave danger to life in both states.”
“The unlawful use of force would consequently constitute a violation of the right to life under Article 6 of the ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights),“ the experts said.
They further noted that “the illegal use of force on foreign territory would also constitute a violation of the foreign state’s sovereignty and the duty of non-intervention in a foreign state”.
‘Abeyance’ of IWT
Discussing the “abeyance” of IWT by India in a unilateral action, the UN experts highlighted its significance for Pakistan.
They noted that rivers irrigate 18 million hectares of farmland in the country (about 80 percent of Pakistan’s arable land), particularly in the food bowl provinces of Punjab and Sindh, contributing 24 per cent of Pakistan’s gross domestic product.
“The rivers are thus vital in providing food security and livelihoods within Pakistan’s population of 240 million people. Limited water storage in Pakistan means that it relies on the unimpeded flow of river water.
“Any disruption of the flow of water under the Indus Waters Treaty (such as by filling large pondage pools and reservoirs, opening dam gates to flood downstream, or the mass release of sediment) could have serious impacts onistan, human rights in Pak including the right to work and livelihood, the right to an adequate standard of living (including the right to water and the right to food), the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and the right to development,” they said.
The experts further stated that Pakistan was “already a water-stressed country and is one of the ten countries most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including water scarcity”.
They said they were “deeply concerned” that any disruption of the flow of water to Pakistan a a consequence of India holding the IWT in “abeyance” could “severely affect the human rights of millions of people […] who rely on the river for agriculture, industry, drinking water and sanitation and healthy ecosystems”.
They emphasised that the “obligation to respect rights requires states to refrain from directly or indirectly interfering in the enjoyment of the right, including where state conduct has foreseeable transboundary effects”
In this connection, they also cited the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which says: “States parties have to respect the enjoyment of the right [to water] in other countries. International cooperation requires states parties to refrain from actions that interfere, directly or indirectly, with the enjoyment of the right to water in other countries.
“Any activities undertaken within the state party’s jurisdiction should not deprive another country of the ability to realise the right to water for persons in its jurisdiction”. States must not prevent the cross-border supply of water and water should never be used as an instrument of political and economic pressure”.
The experts further said that the duty to respect the right to water required refraining from any activity that denied or limited equal access to adequate water, and maintaining access to existing water supplies.
“We note further that there is a strong presumption against retrogressive measures and that if any such measures are taken, the state must prove that they were introduced after the most careful consideration of all alternatives and that they are duly justified by reference to the totality of ICESCR (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) rights in the context of the full use of the state party’s maximum available resources,” they added.
Moreover, the UN experts highlighted that the International Court of Justice had “consistently affirmed states’ obligation to prevent significant transboundary environmental harm, most recently in its 2025 advisory opinion on climate change”.
“The court emphasised that this duty forms part of customary international law and constitutes an erga omnes obligation (obligation towards all), owed to the international community as a whole.
“In this regard, the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is indispensable for the enjoyment of all human rights and is foundational for states to fulfil their broader human rights obligations,” they stressed.
The UN experts also expressed the concern that the suspension or termination of the IWT could violate the “right of self-determination of peoples and the right to development in Pakistan in relation to their common water resources”.
They further said that there did not appear to be “any valid international legal grounds for holding the IWT in abeyance so as to justify the “potential interferences in human rights in Pakistan of disrupting the flow of water assured under the treaty”.
“We are concerned that the unilateral suspension of the treaty would not appear to constitute a valid countermeasure precluding the wrongfulness of the act under the law of treaties,” the experts said.
They said that India had not disclosed “credible evidence” that Pakistan had committed an internationally wrongful act by carrying out, or diligently failing to prevent, the Pahalgam attack, and that such threats continue, thereby justifying countermeasures to prevent the continuing violation.
“Even if Pakistan were responsible, we are concerned that the suspension of the treaty would not be proportionate to the injury suffered, given the severe adverse impacts on the human rights of Pakistanis from the disruption of the flow of water. We further emphasise that countermeasures must not in any case affect obligations for the protection of fundamental rights, which are engaged by the effects of suspending the treaty,” the experts said.
They also noted that the procedural preconditions of countermeasures, namely giving notice and offering to negotiate, did not appear to be fulfilled.
On concerns over cross-border terrorism, water-sharing
The UN experts further expressed concern that disputes over cross-border terrorism and water-sharing may persist as long as the “underlying dispute” about the status of occupied Kashmir was not “peacefully settled in accordance with international law.
In this regard, the UN experts posed six questions to the Indian government.
They called on the Indian government to provide comments on the aforementioned allegations and to indicate whether it would provide “reparation and apology for violations of the right to life resulting from the unlawful use of force in Pakistan”.
They also asked for an explanation for whether India would fulfil its obligations under the IWT “in good faith” and refrain from taking measures that interfere with Pakistan’s legal rights under the treaty and consequently the human rights of those in Pakistan dependent on the flow of water.
They also sought clarification on the measures India was taking or planned to take to prevent “harming human rights” as a result of disrupting the IWT.
They further asked whether India would peacefully settle any disputes with Pakistan over the IWT and only seek to modify it in accordance with its provisions on modification.
The UN experts also sought an explanation on the steps which will be taken to pursue a peaceful settlement of the occupied Kashmir issue, in accordance with international law and the right of self-determination.
“While awaiting a reply, we urge that all necessary interim measures be taken to halt the alleged violations and prevent their re-occurrence and in the event that the investigations support or suggest the allegations to be correct, to ensure the accountability of any person(s) responsible for the alleged violations,” they said.
President welcomes report
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari welcomed the UN report, according to a press release by the president’s media wing. The statement quoted the president as saying that the report “raises serious concerns over India’s military actions against Pakistan in May this year and its wider conduct affecting global and peace and stability”.
The president said the report reinforced Pakistan’s long-standing position that the unilateral use of force across international borders constituted a violation of the UN Charter and a grave breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty.
President Zardari also said that the findings relating to civilian deaths, damage to populated areas and religious sites of Pakistan in May, and the heightened risk of escalation caused by India were “deeply disturbing”.
He appreciated the report’s observations on India’s unilateral declaration of “holding in abeyance” its obligations under the IWT, its aggressive posture and statements and the serious civilian losses resulting from Indian aggression, it added.
According to the statement, he said that the IWT remained a “binding international agreement and a cornerstone of regional stability”, stressing that bypassing agreed dispute-resolution mechanisms and actions affecting water flows “violated Pakistan’s rights and risked creating serious human rights consequences”.
President Zardari also said the report also reflected growing international concerns over India’s conduct as a “rogue state that increasingly acts as a global bully, relying on coercion, intimidation and the normalisation of force and violence rather than law and dialogue,” the statement said.
He noted that serious reports of transnational violence and targeted killings attributed to India, raised in multiple countries, point to a “dangerous pattern that extends beyond the region and undermines global norms”.
The president expressed concern that the report “clearly manifests the irresponsible state behaviour of India”.
“India has long stonewalled its minorities and ignored its commitments to international forums such as the UN, but this pattern of rogue behaviour cannot continue indefinitely,” he said, and underscored that such behaviour cannot be allowed to persist, according to the press release.
The president also noted the report’s clear conclusion that international law did not recognise any separate right to unilateral military action under the pretext of counter-terrorism.
He said the affirmation of Pakistan’s inherent right to self-defence under international law highlighted the “seriousness of the violations identified,” the statement added.
Zardari welcomed the UN experts’ scrutiny of India’s regional conduct, “including concerns relating to support for terror outfits and the use of an illegitimate Afghan government to advance hostile objectives”, and called for transparency and accountability in this regard.
The president also welcomed the call by UN special rapporteurs for credible evidence, compensation for civilian losses, adherence to treaty obligations and a commitment to peaceful dialogue, including on occupied Kashmir, the statement added.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peace, restraint and respect for international law, and said that Pakistan would “continue to pursue diplomatic and legal avenues to safeguard its sovereignty, protect the rights of its people and promote stability in the region”.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also mentioned the findings of the report with regard to the IWT when addressing the diplomatic corps in Islamabad on Friday.</p><small>2025-12-19 10:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19143522d862f33.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962030/lahore-atc-acquits-shah-mehmood-qureshi-jails-4-pti-leaders-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC acquits Shah Mehmood Qureshi, jails 4 PTI leaders in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Friday acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while sentencing four other leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid and Ejaz Chaudhry, to 10 years of imprisonment each in a case related to the May 9 riots.
These PTI leaders have already been jailed after being indicted by different courts in Punjab in cases pertaining to violence on May 9, 2023. On that day, supporters and workers of the party, reacting to founder Imran Khan’s arrest, vandalised and torched military installations and government properties.
Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the verdict inside Kot Lakhpat Jail, concluding the trial in first information report number 852/2023, which pertains to an attack on the entrance gate of Government Officers’ Residence-I Club Chowk. The Racecourse police had registered the case and submitted a challan against 25 suspects, including PTI leaders and workers.
This marks the fifth case in which PTI leaders Dr Yasmin, Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur, and Chaudhry were convicted, while former foreign minister Qureshi was acquitted.
Earlier verdicts were delivered in cases related to an attack on the Shadman police station, violence at Sherpao Bridge, the burning of police vehicles near Rahat Bakery, and the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House during the May 9 protests.</p><small>2025-12-19 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191251041b5c2c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962016/dar-sounds-alarm-over-indias-weaponisation-of-water-following-variations-in-chenab-flow' target='_blank'><strong>Dar sounds alarm over India’s ‘weaponisation of water’ following variations in Chenab flow</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday sounded the alarm over India’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab River, which have caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.
He made the remarks while addressing an urgent media briefing for the diplomatic corps in Islamabad, a day after the Foreign Office said it had sought a clarification from India via a letter over the sudden variation in the Chenab River’s flow.







At the beginning of his briefing, Dar said he wished to draw attention to a situation that threatened peace and stability in South Asia.
“We witnessed in April this year India’s unilateral abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) … But what we are witnessing now is material breaches by India that strike at the heart of the IWT with escalating consequences for regional stability and sanctity of international law,” he said.
“We have observed unusual, abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab River twice this year,” he said, adding that these were observed from April 30 to May 21 and from Dec 7 to Dec 15.
“These variations in water flow are of extreme concern to Pakistan as they point to the unilateral release of water by India into the Chenab River. India has released this water without any prior notification or any data or information sharing with Pakistan as required under the treaty,” he said.
“India’s manipulation of water has prompted our Indus water commissioner to write a letter to his Indian counterpart seeking clarification on the matter as provided in the IWT,” he said.
He further said that India’s most recent action “clearly exemplifies the weaponisation of water to which Pakistan has been consistently drawing attention of the international community”.
“India’s manipulation of water at a critical time of our agricultural cycle directly threatens the life and livelihood as well as the food and economic security of our citizens,” he said.
Dar said that Pakistan expected India to respond to the queries raised by the country’s Indus water commissioner, refrain from any unilateral manipulation of river flows, and fulfil all its obligations in letter and spirit under the IWT provisions.
“Recent violations of the treaty by India are just one example. India has consistently attempted to undermine the treaty in a systemic manner,” he said.
The deputy prime minister said that India‘s construction of hydropower projects such as Kishanganga and Ratle involved design features that violated the treaty’s technical specifications.
“India continues to build illegal dams in sheer disregard of the treaty obligations to impose fait accompli. With the building of dams, Indian capacity to store and manipulate water is also increasing which endangers Pakistan’s security, economy, and the livelihood of 240 million people,” he said.
Dar said India had halted sharing information, hydrological data, and joint oversight required by the treaty, which had exposed Pakistan to floods and droughts.
“Such illegal and irresponsible Indian conduct has all the potential to trigger a humanitarian crisis in Pakistan,“ he asserted, adding that ongoing water manipulation by India was in violation of international and humanitarian law.
“If India is allowed to violate the treaty and obligations under the treaty with impunity, we are setting a very dangerous precedent,“ he said. Dar further said that India was also subverting the treaty’s dispute resolution mechanism by refusing to participate in the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) and neutral expert proceedings.
“India is pursuing a deliberate strategy to sabotage a well-established arbitration process under the treaty provisions. Pakistan would like to reiterate that the IWT is a binding legal instrument that has made an invaluable contribution to the peace and stability of South Asia,” he said.
He said that violating the treaty threatened the inviolability of international treaties and also posed serious threats to regional peace and security. He noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had recently reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute resolution mechanisms.
“These rulings leave no ambiguity that the IWT is alive and its provisions remain binding on the parties,” he said, calling on the international community to reject “Indian impunity“.
He also talked about a recent report by UN rapporteurs made public on Friday , saying that they had also expressed concern regarding India’s actions in connection with the IWT. Dar noted that the report was made public on December 15.
“As per the report, on June 21, India’s home minister declared that India would never restore the treaty and would instead divert to India’s Rajasthan via a new canal,” he said.
He went on to say that the same report said that on April 21, Pakistan’s national security committee declared that any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water to Pakistan under the treaty will be considered as an act of war”.
On the matter of holding the IWT in abeyance, Dar said that the report observed that the action risked affecting the “human rights of millions of people in Pakistan”.
Dar once again called on the international community to take notice of India’s “continued disregard” of a bilateral treaty and counsel India to act “responsibly”.
The minister also took note of “belligerent statements” from Indian leadership, which he said demonstrated India’s “intentions, designs to weaponise water aimed at inflicting harm to Pakistan and its people”.
“We have repeatedly brought the situation to the attention of the UN Security Council (UNSC),” he said. He said that he had also written to the UN secretary general and the president of the UN General Assembly to play their “due role” in the matter.
Dar once again reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes with India; however, he warned that Pakistan “will not compromise on the existential water rights of its people”.
As the minister concluded his address, he urged the international community, particularly UNSC members, “to take immediate steps to address this situation”.
He expressed optimism that the international community, in its capacity, will call on India to “restore the IWT in full, stop the weaponisation of water, uphold international law and treaty obligations and refrain from undermining the peace and stability of South Asia”.
“Water is life, and it can not be weaponised,” Dar concluded.
According to daily reports of the Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the situation related to inflows and outflows at Marala headworks on the Chenab River was found to be alarming from Dec 9 to Dec 18.
The inflows and outflows at Marala were monitored on the said dates with 10,100 and 3,800 cusecs on Dec 9, respectively, 6,900 and 1,500 cusecs on Dec 10.
India had held the IWT in abeyance in April following the attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence.
Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
In June, the PCA — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — had issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance.</p><small>2025-12-19 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19144334098df15.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962032/in-meeting-with-australian-envoy-pm-shehbaz-condemns-cowardly-terror-attack-at-bondi-beach' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with Australian envoy, PM Shehbaz condemns ‘cowardly terror attack’ at Bondi Beach</strong></a><br><p>In a meeting with Australian High Commissioner Tim Kane on Friday in Islamabad, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his condolences over the tragic shooting at Bondi Beach in Sydney last week and condemned the attack.
Fifteen people were killed, and dozens were wounded last Sunday in Bondi after two gunmen opened fire at people celebrating Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of lights.
The PML-N posted on social media that the newly appointed high commissioner of Australia called on Shehbaz at the PM’s House today.
It added that he conveyed deepest condolences over the tragic loss of innocent lives in the terrorist shooting incident at Bondi Beach, saying that Pakistan unequivocally condemned the cowardly act of terrorism.







While reaffirming Pakistan’s solidarity with Australia in its hour of grief, it said, PM Shehbaz emphasised that terrorism had no religion and it must be condemned in all forms and manifestations. He added that collective action was required to eradicate this menace.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi and the foreign secretary were also present during the meeting.
The prime minister also felicitated the high commissioner on his appointment and expressed confidence that his tenure would further strengthen the long-standing and friendly relations between Pakistan and Australia, the statement said.
The premier welcomed the positive trajectory of Pakistan-Australia relations and underscored the need for expanding bilateral trade and investment. He highlighted the agriculture and livestock sector as a promising area for enhanced cooperation, the statement said.
PM Shehbaz welcomed Australian interest in the mining and minerals sector, citing Reko Diq as a “shining example of the enormous potential of this sector in Pakistan”. He also lauded the valuable contribution of the “vibrant” Pakistani diaspora in Australia, saying that it served as a vital bridge between the two nations, according to the statement.
He noted that both Pakistan and Australia enjoyed strong people-to-people linkages and cultural ties, underpinned by their shared passion for cricket, the statement added.
“During the meeting, PM Shehbaz conveyed his warm regards and greetings for the Australian leadership, and said that he looked forward to working with them to build stronger ties between the two countries,” said the statement.
Ambassador Kane thanked the prime minister for the warm welcome and expressed Australia’s desire to work towards further enhancing bilateral relations “across all areas of mutual interest”.</p><small>2025-12-19 10:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19135916f3e13b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962028/in-pictures-buildings-set-on-fire-as-violent-protests-break-out-in-dhaka-following-death-of-wounded-youth-leader' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Buildings set on fire as violent protests break out in Dhaka following death of wounded youth leader</strong></a><br><p>Firefighters pulled journalists from their burning newsroom on Friday after the building was set ablaze during violent demonstrations in Bangladesh’s capital.
Thousands of protesters were brought to the streets by the assassination of a youth leader running for parliament in upcoming national elections.
A key figure in last year’s uprising, Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, was shot by masked gunmen while leaving a mosque in Dhaka last week.
After he died in hospital on Thursday, his supporters gathered in Dhaka demanding the killers be brought to justice.
Several buildings, including those housing leading newspapers Prothom Alo and the Daily Star, were set on fire and vandalised, according to authorities.

According to Pakistan‘s Permanent Mission to the UN, the resolution — titled ‘Universal realisation of the right of the peoples to self-determination’ — was adopted during the UNGA’s 80th session.
“The consensual adoption of the resolution manifests broad international support for the inalienable right of the peoples facing colonialism, alien domination and foreign occupation,“ it said in a post on X.
“For the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and Palestine, the resolution reinforces international attention to their just and legitimate cause and their aspirations for freedom and dignity in accordance with UN Security Council (UNSC) resolutions,” it added.







Diplomats said the adoption of the text by consensus — without a vote — underscored continued global recognition that the denial of self-determination remains a root cause of conflict in several regions, despite repeated UN commitments to bring colonialism to an end.
This year, the United States insisted on voting on almost every resolution presented in the UNGA, even on issues that had previously enjoyed consensus, both in committees and in the Assembly.
However, the Pakistan-sponsored resolution on self-determination was among the very few that the Americans did not insist on putting to a vote, allowing it to pass by consensus. Diplomats said this was likely due to Pakistan’s outreach. Otherwise, Washington had made it clear that it would not allow consensus on every issue, as it could create unnecessary pressure within the UN.
Earlier in the day, Pakistan told the UNGA that persistent failure to uphold the right to self-determination continued to undermine international peace efforts, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia.
Addressing the Assembly on the occasion of International Day against Colonialism in All Its Forms and Manifestations, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon said self-determination was “not merely a historical aspiration, but an enduring obligation” of the international community.
“Recent developments in the Middle East demonstrate that lasting peace cannot be achieved through the continued denial and suppression of the legitimate right to self-determination of the Palestinian people,“ he said.
On occupied Kashmir, the Pakistani envoy reminded the UNGA that the issue was not a bilateral dispute but an internationally recognised one.
“The UNSC, through several resolutions, has recognised the legitimate right of self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.
“A just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remains central to the establishment of durable peace in South Asia,” Ambassador Jadoon added, warning that continued inaction risked further instability in an already volatile region.
Marking the 65th anniversary of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) — Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples — he said the implementation of the declaration and the decolonisation agenda was not confined to Non-Self-Governing Territories alone.
According to the UN, Non-Self-Governing Territories are defined as territories whose people have not yet attained a full measure of self-government.
“Rather, it also encompasses people living under alien occupation and foreign domination.
“The overarching objective, therefore, remains to ensure that all such peoples are enabled to exercise their inalienable right to self-determination,” he said.
He further said that the milestone also served as a reminder of unfinished work.
“While the decolonisation process stands among the UN’s notable achievements, this anniversary compels us to acknowledge that the promise of resolution 1514 (XV) remains unfulfilled,” he said, adding that this failure continued to pose “a serious challenge to the maintenance of international peace and security”.
Aligning Pakistan with a statement delivered by Uganda on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), he said the declaration made clear that colonial domination and exploitation were violations of fundamental human rights and were contrary to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter.
“The right to self-determination is an inalienable and universal right,” he reiterated, stressing that its application could neither be selective nor politically conditional.
Emphasising the UN’s role as a symbol of hope and justice for oppressed peoples, Ambassador Jadoon called for the consistent and non-selective implementation of UN resolutions and urged member states to uphold international law without exception.
Pakistan also called for renewed international resolve to fully and unconditionally eradicate colonialism in all its forms and manifestations.</p><small>2025-12-19 08:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191213149eac012.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962019/saudi-arabia-qatar-have-a-white-winter-as-snowfall-hits-northern-areas' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi Arabia, Qatar have a white winter as snowfall hits northern areas</strong></a><br><p>Snow unexpectedly blanketed several regions across Saudi Arabia and Qatar on Wednesday and Thursday, with cold weather and heavy rain hitting several cities and other parts of the Kingdom, Arab News and Khaleej Times reported on Thursday.
According to Khaleej Times, a period of low-pressure systems in the Middle East has brought heavy rainfall over the last week. Conditions were forecast to intensify on Thursday, with thunderstorms expected to hit the region.
The storm was then forecast to move eastwards towards the UAE and Qatar by night, it added, citing BBC Weather.
Khaleej Times reported that large areas of Qatar had also been covered by snowfall already, sharing a video of the landscape.

In Saudi Arabia, snow and light rainfall were experienced in Trojena, a mountain destination for hiking and skiing located on Jebel Al-Lawz in the province of Tabuk that reaches up to 2,600 metres, according to Arab News.
Additionally, light to moderate rain was experienced in Bir Bin Hermas, Al-Ayinah, Ammar, Al-Ula Governorate and Shaqra and its suburbs. Several other regions, including Riyadh, also experienced moderate to heavy rainfall, the outlet added.
Riyadh experienced thick cloud cover and rainfall from early yesterday. According to Arab News, all schools in the Saudi capital switched to remote learning amid the continuing inclement weather.
“The Qassim Region, including the city of Buraidah, experienced moderate to heavy rainfall, while Tabuk Region experienced light to moderate rainfall on Thursday,” it said, citing the Saudi Press Agency (SPA).
“Parts of Hail region also witnessed snowfall on Wednesday evening in areas surrounding the city of Hail, while light to moderate rainfall was reported across the region and several of its governorates.”
The outlet added that according to the SPA, the National Centre for Meteorology (NCM) anticipated more snow in the northern parts of the Riyadh region and the governorates of Al-Majmaah and Al-Ghat, north of Riyadh, which witnessed snowfall on Thursday morning that led to accumulations over highland and open areas.

 

The official spokesperson for the NCM, Hussein Al-Qahtani, explained that the weather conditions affecting the north of the region were caused by a cold mass of air advancing into the area, accompanied by rain-bearing clouds. This contributed to temperatures dropping below zero degrees Celsius in some locations.
“Al-Qahtani noted that the centre had issued early warnings regarding the weather conditions, adding that specialised teams continued to monitor developments,” Arab News said, adding that the spokesperson expected temperatures to remain low over the coming hours with a chance of frost in several northern and central areas.
He urged citizens and residents to exercise caution, particularly while driving on exposed roads, due to the potential formation of ice.
“He also stressed the importance of following official weather updates issued by the centre through its official channels, while adhering to preventive guidelines and avoiding open areas during peak cold periods to ensure public safety,” the agency said.
Reactions to unprecedented snowfall
Many people gathered to witness the snowfall in Al-Majmaah and Al-Ghat.
Thamr Alotaibi, a Riyadh resident, told Arab News, “This is unprecedented, so we are excited to see it. Me and my friends are going to experience this winter wonder which is going to be an amazing experience.”
Meanwhile, due to gusty and dust-stirring winds, the General Directorate of Civil Defence called for caution and adherence to guidelines in light of the inclement weather conditions.
“It has advised residents to avoid going to valleys during this spell of weather,” the outlet said.
Riyadh resident Abdul Hammed told Arab News: “We had an outing planned for a family get-together at a banquet on the city’s outskirts but the prevailing weather has forced us to change the plan, and we have decided to remain indoors instead.”
Experts say snowfall not unusual
Against this backdrop, a leading Saudi astronomer said such snowfall events are not unusual during the winter months, Gulf News reported.
Mohammed bin Reddah Al Thaqafi, an astronomer and expert at the Taif Astronomical Sundial and a member of the Arab Union for Space and Astronomy Sciences, said that snowfall in northern Saudi Arabia occurs periodically each winter, even though it does not follow a fixed astronomical cycle.
Its recurrence depends largely on shifting climatic and atmospheric conditions, he explained, according to the agency.
He added that snowfall was typically recorded between December and February and was most common in regions such as Tabuk, Al-Jouf and Arar, which are more exposed to Mediterranean weather systems than other parts of the kingdom.
“He identified areas including Jabal Al Lawz, Alaqan and Al Dhahr in Tabuk; Sakaka and Dumat Al Jandal in Al Jouf; Arar in the Northern Borders; Jabal Aja and Jabal Salma in Hail; and the highlands of Abha in Asir as the locations most likely to experience snowfall,” Gulf News said.
While some seasons pass without snow, the expert noted that these areas remain among the most reliable destinations for winter conditions, the agency added.
Al Thaqafi urged motorists and outdoor visitors to exercise caution in the snow, warning of slippery roads and reduced visibility, and stressed the importance of adhering to traffic regulations to avoid accidents, it said.</p><small>2025-12-19 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640305-un-experts-assail-india-for-use-of-force-violation-of-pakistans-sovereignty-in-may-war' target='_blank'><strong>UN experts assail India for use of force, violation of Pakistan's sovereignty in May war</strong></a><br><p>

The hosts were 271-4 at stumps on day three of the third Test with Head on 142 and first-innings century-maker Alex Carey not out 52, taking the five-match series out of England’s reach.
England must win after crashing inside two days at the first Test in Perth and inside four in Brisbane, both by eight wickets.
But it appears to be an impossible task with the highest run chase at the ground 316 by Australia against England in 1902.







Head’s crucial ton, his 11th, came off a composed 146 balls although he almost didn’t get there, dropped on 99 by Harry Brook as impatience got the better of him.
He has now scored a century in four consecutive Tests on his home ground, following 140 against India last year and 119 and 175 against the West Indies.
Australia suffered an early setback in a tense 20 minutes before lunch after England were all out for 286 on the back of Ben Stokes’ gritty 83 in response to Australia’s first innings 371.
Bryson Carse trapped Jake Weatherald lbw for one and he walked without reviewing after the umpire lifted his finger, although replays showed the ball was pitching outside leg stump.
It gave England a glimmer of hope, but after the break Head slammed the door shut, cutting and chopping boundaries to all corners of the ground.
Marnus Labuschagne went for 13 when he edged Josh Tongue to Harry Brook at slip, with reviews showing it carried.
Usman Khawaja, who hit a defiant 82 in the first innings after his last-minute call-up for the ill Steve Smith, was a perfect foil for the more aggressive Head.
But on 40 he was undone by the spin of Will Jacks, caught behind, and Cameron Green followed soon after for seven, edging Tongue to Brook.
After getting through the nervous 90s, Head finally brought up his century with a four off Joe Root, taking off his helmet and kissing the turf before pumping his fists.
While not in the same vein as his match-winning 69-ball century in Perth, it was a critical knock, supported by Carey and aided by Stokes not bowling after his exploits with the bat.
Gutsy Stokes
After a woeful batting display on Thursday, Stokes and Jofra Archer kept England’s dreams alive with a stirring 106-run ninth-wicket stand.
They resumed at 213-8 in muggy conditions with Stokes not out 45 and Archer on 30.
Stokes, who suffered leg cramps and dehydration during his gutsy rearguard action in sweltering 40 Celsius heat on Thursday, brought up his slowest ever 50 in Tests, off 159 balls.

He kept plugging away but finally fell when Mitchell Starc took the new ball and bowled him, with Stokes one of the few players who showed the fight he had demanded before the game.
Archer was another, ably helping his captain.
The fast bowler was the last man out when caught by Labuschagne off Scott Boland for 51 — his highest Test score and a maiden half-century Boland ended with 3-45 while Pat Cummins took 3-69 in his first Test since July.
England’s woes began when openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett, along with the under-performing Ollie Pope, departed in a 15-ball blitz on Thursday at the hands of Cummins and Nathan Lyon.
Harry Brook showed some resistance with 45, but the Australian attack was relentless.</p><small>2025-12-19 07:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191202128530d2a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962018/us-homeland-security-chief-pauses-green-card-lottery-programme-says-it-was-used-by-brown-university-shooting-suspect' target='_blank'><strong>US Homeland Security chief pauses green card lottery programme, says it was used by Brown University shooting suspect</strong></a><br><p>US Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem ordered the suspension of the diversity visa lottery progamme on Thursday after saying it was used by the suspect in a mass shooting at Brown University.
“The Brown University shooter, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, entered the United States through the diversity lottery immigrant visa programme (DV1) in 2017 and was granted a green card,” Noem wrote on social media.
“At president Trump’s direction, I am immediately directing US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to pause the DV1 programme to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous programme,“ she said.







According to the Associated Press, the diversity visa programme makes up to 50,000 green cards available each year by lottery to people from countries that are little represented in the US, many of them in Africa.
The lottery was created by Congress, and the move is almost certain to invite legal challenges, AP reported.
Officials said earlier that the suspect was dead as investigators said he also killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor two days after the rampage at Brown.
He had been a PhD student in physics who was familiar with the building where the shooting took place, officials said.
Providence police Chief Oscar Perez and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, speaking at a Thursday night press conference, said that Valente took his own life and investigators believe he acted alone.</p><small>2025-12-19 07:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640283-indias-manipulation-of-water-threatens-food-economic-security-of-pakistan-dar-tells-foreign-envoys' target='_blank'><strong>India's manipulation of water threatens food, economic security of Pakistan, Dar tells foreign envoys</strong></a><br><p>

“They underestimated our military power and thought we will not react. They never expected a befitting response,” he said while speaking at a seminar here.
The seminar was organised by an overseas Pakistanis group led by Barrister Shehzada Hayat, in collaboration with the Pakistan Ex-Servicemen Society (PESS), headed by Senator retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum to pay homage to Pakistan’s martyrs, express solidarity with the armed forces, and commemorate the 149th birth anniversary of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
The former air chief said the telling response by Pakistan shattered the myth of “shining India”. He chided India for blaming Chinese help to Pakistan for its failure saying “If we have Chinese JF-17 aircraft, you also have Rafale jets.

Overseas Pakistanis’ contribution to national economy praised

He made it clear that Chinese pilots did not come to fight with India during the four-day tension between the two South Asian nuclear powers.
Highlighting the importance of air power, he referred to founding father of Pakistan Quaid-i-Azam’s remarks that a nation without a strong air force is at the mercy of any aggressor.
Air Marshal Aman said wars were not just about aircraft and tanks and stressed the key role of support assets. He stressed that air power and technology-driven capabilities have become central to modern national security.
Emphasising institutional development, education, and indigenous capability, he underlined the importance of linking research, operations and innovation.
He cautioned that Pakistan must prioritise its national interest and avoid involvement in others’ wars. He also stressed the need for embracing smaller provinces and honouring those who rendered sacrifices for the country.
Federal Minister for Investment and Chairman of Board of Investment,Qaiser Sheikh, said the event reflected Pakistan’s core values of sacrifice, unity and resilience.
He paid tribute to martyrs and lauded the armed forces for safeguarding the country’s sovereignty and stability.
The minister emphasised the role of overseas Pakistanis as economic contributors and goodwill ambassadors, reaffirming the government’s commitment to improving investor confidence and promoting Pakistan as an attractive investment destination.
Speaking on the occasion, Senator retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum highlighted the contributions of overseas Pakistanis to the country’s economy, calling them Pakistan’s ambassadors and an economic lifeline.

IS-K is a branch of the Islamic State terrorist organisation active in Central and South Asia, according to the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies think tank.
The UN’s 16th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team noted that IS-K’s ability to operate in the region had been degraded as a result of high-profile arrests by Pakistan, such as that of Azzam from the border region this May.
The state-run Associated Press of Pakistan said that Azzam was arrested by intelligence agencies during an operation near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
The APP report claimed that following his arrest, IS-K propaganda arms, such as the Al-Azaim Foundation, had suffered a major blow.
“Overall, the capability of [IS-K] has been degraded as a result of counter-terrorism operations,” the UN report read. “Key [IS-K] commanders and ideologues have been neutralised, and the numbers of [IS-K] fighters have likely been reduced. Several plotted attacks have been disrupted.”
It further noted that IS-K’s capability to operate freely on both sides of the border has been disrupted, but acknowledged that Kabul’s claims of no terrorist groups operating in or from their soil are “not credible”.
“The Taliban contend that no terrorist groups operate in or from Afghanistan,” the report read. “Member state reporting, however, indicates that a range of terrorist groups still operate in the country, with varying degrees of autonomy and oversight from Taliban authorities.”
It added: “In North Afghanistan and areas close to the Pakistani borders, [IS-K] is reported to have indoctrinated children in madressahs, establishing a suicide training course for minors around 14 years of age.”
In a December 8 letter, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Asim Iftikhar Ahmed, requested that the report be brought to the attention of the UN Security Council (UNSC).
Who is Azzam?
The UNSC says that Azzam held the position of IS-K spokesperson since the group first established itself in Afghanistan in 2015. Islamabad-based platform The Khorasan Diary stated that he is the group’s second-in-command, while the European Council says he operated their media branch, Al-Azaim Media.
Shan A Zain wrote for Jamestown Foundation’s Militant Leadership Monitor journal that Azzam was born in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province and, before becoming IS-K’s chief propagandist, worked for at least three local radio stations and wrote books and poetry.
His major work, Travelers of the Maze, tells the purported stories of IS fighters living in the Spin Ghar mountains, according to Zain. Excerpts were shared over Telegram by would-be recruits.
“Sultan Aziz Azzam has been credited with recruiting IS members to carry out high-profile attacks in Afghanistan,” Zain wrote. “He has written several books and articles narrating stories about [fighters] in order to inspire people to join IS ranks.”
“As [IS-K’s] spokesperson, Azam has played an instrumental role in spreading ISIL’s violent … ideology, glorifying and justifying terrorist acts,” the UNSC’s website reads.
“Building on his former experience as an Afghan journalist, his activity as [IS-K’s] spokesperson has increased [IS-K’s] visibility and influence among its followers.”
Azzam claimed responsibility on behalf of IK-K for an August 26, 2021, suicide attack near Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul and circulated messages from the group following the assassination of three female journalists on March 2, 2021 and a prison attack in Jalalabad on August 3, 2020.
Previous action against IS-K in Pakistan
In June this year, then-United States Central Command (Centcom) commander Army General Michael Kurilla praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism, citing the nation’s struggle against IS-K among other actors.
“Through a relationship we have with them and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals,” Kurilla said.
“They have extradited back Jaffar, who was one of the key individuals behind the Abbey Gate bombing,” he added, referring to IS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah, an Afghan national who was arrested by Pakistan earlier this year.
In November, a key IS-K commander was killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak in a late-evening police operation, sources told Dawn.
Sources said that acting on an intelligence tip-off, police raided a hideout in Ambari village in Karak district. An exchange of fire ensued, resulting in the death of Nisar Hakim, a key IS-K commander.</p><small>2025-12-19 02:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/190812211b7a962.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961907/pti-sit-ins-prompt-heightened-security-outside-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>PTI sit-ins prompt heightened security outside Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>• 1,200 policemen, anti-riot personnel deployed; number of pickets increased• Party leaders return without visiting Imran after being barred by prison authorities
RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: As the PTI staged two sit-ins outside the jail in as many weeks, the Punjab government has deployed more than 1,200 police officials, installed additional pickets, and deployed anti-riot police in the vicinity of Adiala jail, in an apparent bid to pre-empt such protests.
Separately, the jail authorities also barred the PTI leaders, including KP’s former finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra, who had arrived in Rawalpindi to meet their incarcerated party chief, Imran Khan.
According to the Islamabad High Court, Mr Khan can have two weekly meetings with his family and party leaders, but the authorities have routinely restricted such visits, much to the PTI’s chagrin. Last Tuesday, the PTI leaders staged a protest, which was dispersed by police with water cannons after midnight.
In a seemingly pre-emptive measure that would dissuade protesters from congregating outside the prison, protective measures around the jail have now been strengthened.
Besides more than 1200 police personnel, including the Elite Force and women police, four police squads have been put on standby for emergencies. The police will be equipped with rubber bullets, tear gas shells, and other anti-riot tools.
Similarly, one police picket was established at the jail’s gate and the second was established at Gate 5, while two pickets were set up at the Gorakhpur Road and near the Shaighan Factory. The area was also inspected by the Special Branch personnel and the bomb disposal squad for security measures.
In addition, traffic police wardens, remained on patrol in the area to keep the flow of traffic smooth during the proceedings of cases inside the jail. On Thursday, about 25 PTI supporters, including MPAs, visited the jail but returned empty-handed.
PTI leaders return without meeting
The PTI leaders, after spending a couple of hours outside the prison, returned after the jail administration did not allow them to meet Mr Khan. Talking to Dawn, Mr Jhagra said that the PTI leaders reached Adiala after 2pm and started waiting for permission to meet Imran Khan. He said the police told them they had no orders to allow them to enter the jail. “We waited there till 4:30pm and then decided to leave,” he said.
PTI leaders, including Aftab Alam, Adnan Qadri, Pir Musavir Khan, Muhammad Israr, Liaqat Ali Khan, and Taimur Khan Jhagra, had come to meet Imran Khan but they were denied permission. This time, the PTI did not give the name of KP CM Sohail Afridi for the meeting.
Speaking to media outside the prison, he warned the ‘powers that be’ to beware of the day when things would go out of the hands of the party and people would take things into their own hands and take to the streets. Mr Jhagra said that government functionaries were claiming, while giving interviews to foreign media, including Sky News, that 870 meetings with Mr Khan had been allowed.
“However, the fact is that since October 2024, as many as 60 weeks have passed but not a single meeting between Imran Khan and his political friends has been allowed. Party leaders arrive here every week, but they are not allowed to meet Imran. On the other hand, during the last 60 weeks, Imran’s relatives have been allowed to meet him just once or twice,” he said.







To a question, Mr Jhagra said the major issue was that only Imran Khan’s narrative had credibility while the hybrid system has no credibility.
To another query, he said it was unfortunate that an ATA case was registered against peaceful protesters.
“We have been trying to convince the global community that we are fighting a war against terrorism, but cases of terrorism are being registered against PTI workers. How can we convince the world that we are against terrorism,” he wondered.
When asked why Sohail Afridi had not come, Mr Jhagra said that the KP CM has a double responsibility. “He is running the province, along with making efforts to secure the release of Imran Khan. He holds a cabinet meeting every week,” he said.
To a question about why the PTI was not giving a call for street agitation, he said that it was also the responsibility of the party to protect the lives of workers and not expose them to bullets.

ISLAMABAD: No decision has been taken yet on contributing troops to the planned International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for Gaza, the Foreign Office said on Thursday, seeking to quell renewed speculation about Washington’s pressure on Islamabad for joining the mission.
“About Pakistan’s participation in the ISF, we have not taken a decision to participate in ISF as yet,” Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said at the weekly media briefing.
ISF forms a key component of US President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza conflict, a 20-point framework announced in September that facilitated a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in October.
On Nov 17, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution, with Russia and China abstaining, endorsing the plan and authorising the establishment of the ISF as a temporary multinational force to support security, demilitarisation, and reconstruction in Gaza. Pakistan had supported the resolution.
The FO spokesperson’s clarification on Pakistan’s possible contribution to ISF came amid growing conjecture that the Trump administration is stepping up pressure on Pakistan to commit troops to the force.
Those reports were fuelled by a Reuters report, which claimed that Field Marshal Asim Munir — in his capacity as both army chief and chief of defence forces — was expected to travel to Washington in the coming weeks for talks with President Trump, with the Gaza stabilisation force likely to feature prominently on the agenda.
Asked about the report, Mr Andrabi was initially noncommittal on whether such a visit was in the works. When pressed, he pushed back against the suggestion that the trip had been finalised.
“On the visit of the chief of army staff/chief of defence forces, as reported by Reuters, I can contradict the Reuters story in its essence that it seemed to suggest that the visit has been planned and there is a finality about it. So, I am contradicting that,” he said.
“We would wait for an official announcement from the government of Pakistan in the event of such a visit. Our political and military leadership visits different capitals, and when an official visit is organised, an official announcement is made prior to it, which in this case, has not been made.”
Meanwhile, the White House also said that no meeting had been scheduled. “This is not on the President’s calendar at this time,” a White House official said on background, responding to an Arab News query about a possible Trump-Munir meeting.
On the ISF itself, Mr Andrabi said discussions were continuing internationally but emphasised that Pakistan had not received any formal request to deploy troops.
“The discussion on ISF is ongoing in certain capitals. I am not aware of any specific requests made to Pakistan to send troops. As stated, we have not taken any decision on this subject as yet,” he said.
The spokesman’s remarks appeared to contrast with earlier comments by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who had said Pakistan was ready “in principle” to contribute to the force, subject to clarity on its mandate and terms of reference.
“We are definitely ready to contribute to the force; the prime minister has in principle already announced after consultation with the field marshal that we will contribute, but this decision cannot be taken until it is decided what its (ISF) mandate and TOR (terms of reference) will be,” Mr Dar said a few weeks ago.
Mr Dar had also drawn a red line over any role involving disarmament of Hamas. “We are not ready for that (disarmament of Hamas). This is not our job, but of the Palestinian law enforcement agencies. Our job is peacekeeping, not peace enforcement,” he said, adding that Indonesia had expressed similar reservations.
Dar noted that Indonesia had offered 20,000 troops and that PM Shehbaz Sharif had signalled that Pakistan would positively consider participation in principle.
It may be noted that the US Central Command hosted a conference in Qatar on Tuesday with dozens of partner countries to discuss ISF’s command structure and other unresolved operational issues. Pakistan was among nearly 45 countries attending the meeting.
The US State Department has formally approached more than 70 countries seeking troops or funding for the proposed force. Some 19 countries have reportedly so far indicated willingness to assist through troops, logistics, or equipment, with international deployment in Gaza potentially beginning as early as next month.

ISLAMABAD: Develop­ment spending under the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) remained subdued in the first five months of the current fiscal year, with utilisation amounting to just 9.2 per cent of the Rs1 trillion annual allocation amid fiscal rationing to meet the IMF’s contingency measures for growing revenue shortfall.
“Development spending remained modest, with Rs92 billion utilised against Rs196bn sanctioned, led mainly by infrastructure,” the Ministry of Planning and Development said in its Monthly Development Outlook (December 2025). It added that foreign-funded projects showed relatively better utilisation, with Rs12.8bn spent out of Rs25.1bn sanctioned.
At Rs92bn, the July-November utilisation was 20pc lower than the Rs115bn spent in the same period last year. The ministry attributed the slowdown to “significant reduction in expenditure by provinces, special areas and the Ministry of Railways”.
The government has given a written commitment to the IMF for contingency measures as part of the recent $1.2bn disbursement, as a five-month revenue shortfall touched Rs430bn.
According to the undertaking, if Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collections continue to lag in the second quarter of FY26, and other tax receipts fail to bridge the gap, the government will — in consultation with IMF staff — increase the federal excise duty (FED) on fertilisers and pesticides by five percentage points, introduce FED on high-value sugary items, and move items from the Eighth Schedule of the sales tax regime to the general GST framework.
“If by the end of the second quarter of FY26, there is a revenue shortfall due to the implementation of the National Tariff Policy, we will postpone an equivalent amount of expenditure until the last quarter of FY26,” it added.
The report said ministries and divisions were sanctioned Rs196bn for the five-month period, against which Rs92bn was reported as expenditure.
The low release and utilisation of development funds come despite a 1.6pc budget surplus in the first quarter of the fiscal year, driven by elevated State Bank profits and petroleum levy collections, and as the government has sought to close hundreds of projects to focus resources on strategically important schemes at advanced stages of development for their early completion.

 

A sector-wise expenditure breakdown showed that the infrastructure sector had been allocated Rs626.767bn (63pc) in FY26, of which Rs55.238bn had been utilised till Nov 30. Within infrastructure, the transport and communication sector received the highest allocation of Rs333.484bn, which posted an expenditure of Rs30.433bn.
The energy sector and physical planning and housing sector recorded an expenditure of Rs3.52bn and Rs7bn against allocations of Rs122.653bn and Rs72.725bn, respectively. This meant the energy sector consumed less than 3pc in five months, while physical planning and housing utilised 9.6pc.
The water sector, with an allocation of Rs98bn, reported an expenditure of Rs14.281bn (14.6pc) in five months.
The utilisation was relatively better in the social sector. It was allocated Rs169.309bn (17pc) in the budget, wherein Rs60.75bn was allocated for the education sector, including higher education, which spent an amount of Rs12.292bn.
The health and nutrition sector utilised Rs211 million against an allocation of Rs16.8bn, accounting for only 1.25pc in five months. Furthermore, Rs21.7bn was allocated for “Others”, of which only Rs2.122bn (9.8pc) could be utilised in five months.
The budget entailed an allocation of Rs11.167bn to promote transparency and good governance and to provide an enabling environment for investors, but only Rs1.015bn could be utilised in five months.
The science and information technology sector recorded an expenditure of Rs3.619bn as of mid-December against an allocation of Rs37.586bn, accounting for 9.6pc.
The food and agriculture sector spent Rs605m against its allocation of Rs5.1bn, while the industrial sector utilised Rs227m against Rs2.856bn and stood at 11.8pc and 7.9pc, respectively.
The report said the PSDP portfolio comprised 86 foreign-funded projects with a total foreign cost component of Rs4.2tr, of which 15 projects are fully foreign-funded, while the remaining 61 projects are implemented with counterpart local funding.
It said a PSDP review was conducted from Nov 10-12 to assess financial and physical progress on the ongoing development portfolio. The executing agencies revealed that Rs90bn had been utilised during the first quarter, and 313 projects were expected to be completed this fiscal year.
It said the government had decided to prioritise fast-moving schemes, strengthen project execution and ensure timely allocations to maximise development impact. The report said Pakistan’s economic and development outlook was optimistic, supported by stronger fiscal management, moderating inflation and resilient remittance inflows.
“The development trajectory is steadily improving as high-priority initiatives in health, education, infrastructure, energy and governance are enhancing economic efficiency and social impact,” it said.
Under the mechanism announced by the Ministry of Finance for the current fiscal year, the government should release 15pc of budgeted allocation in the first quarter, followed by 20pc in the second quarter, 25pc in the third and the remaining 40pc in the last.
