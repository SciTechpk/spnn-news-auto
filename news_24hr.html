According to an FIA statement, the action was taken on the instructions of the director of the agency’s Islamabad Zone during a surprise inspection of the immigration staff under the supervision of Deputy Director (Immigration) Salman Liaquat.
The statement read that an assistant sub-inspector and a constable were taken into custody while on duty “after they were found using mobile phones”, which the immigration staff are prohibited from carrying during duty.
Their phones were searched on suspicion, and “important evidence related to illegal immigration” was recovered.
The FIA reported that according to initial investigation, the two men were in “contact with passengers and agents” and “charging Rs50,000 per person to send citizens to the Philippines and Uzbekistan”.
Records of transactions amounting to “millions of rupees were recovered from the suspects’ mobile phones”, and the pair was “using microfinance accounts to receive payments”, the statement read.
A case has been registered with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle in Islamabad, and a three-day physical remand of the suspects has been obtained, it added.
Last month, the FIA took notice over videotaping of passengers, mostly female migrants, on Pak-Afghan border crossing Torkham.
A video went viral on the social media, prompting the agency to take notice of the FIA official recording passengers and being negligent during duty at the border.
A statement read that the DG FIA had sought a detailed report of the incident from the Director FIA Peshawar Zone and the official had been suspended immediately.</p><small>2025-09-28 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28174127c5582d2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945198/un-arms-embargo-other-sanctions-reimposed-on-iran-over-nuclear-programme' target='_blank'><strong>UN arms embargo, other sanctions reimposed on Iran over nuclear programme</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations has reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran over its nuclear programme following a process triggered by European powers that Tehran has warned will be met with a harsh response.
Britain, France and Germany initiated the return of sanctions on Iran at the UN Security Council over accusations it had violated a 2015 deal that aimed to stop it from developing a nuclear bomb. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons.
The end of the decade-long nuclear deal originally agreed by Iran, Britain, Germany, France, the United States, Russia and China is likely to exacerbate tensions in the Middle East, just months after Israel and the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
UN sanctions imposed by the Security Council in resolutions adopted between 2006 and 2010 were reinstated at 8pm EDT on Saturday. Attempts to delay the return of all sanctions on Iran failed on the sidelines of the annual gathering of world leaders at the UN this week.
“We urge Iran and all states to abide fully by these resolutions,” the foreign ministers of France, Britain and Germany said in a joint statement after the deadline passed.
European Union (EU) foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas confirmed in a statement on Sunday that the bloc would “now proceed to implement the re-imposition of all previously lifted UN and EU nuclear-related sanctions without delay”.
Israel hailed the reimposition of sanctions on its arch foe as a “major development”, citing what it called Tehran’s ongoing violations over the nuclear programme.
“The goal is clear: prevent a nuclear-armed Iran. The world must use every tool to achieve this goal,” the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a post on X.
 






Iran calls in ambassadors
Tehran has warned of a harsh response to the reimposition of sanctions. Iran said on Saturday it was recalling its ambassadors to Britain, France and Germany for consultations. But Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Friday Iran had no intention of leaving the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Russia has disputed the return of UN sanctions on Iran.
“It is unlawful, and it cannot be implemented,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters at the UN earlier on Saturday, adding that he had written to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warning that it would be “a major mistake” for him to acknowledge a return of UN sanctions on Iran.
The European powers had offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months to allow space for talks on a long-term deal if Iran restored access for UN nuclear inspectors, addressed concerns about its stock of enriched uranium, and engaged in talks with the United States.
“Our countries will continue to pursue diplomatic routes and negotiations. The reimposition of UN sanctions is not the end of diplomacy,” the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany said, urging Iran to “return to compliance”.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement President Donald Trump has been clear that diplomacy is still an option for Iran and a deal remains the best outcome for the Iranian people and the world.
“For that to happen, Iran must accept direct talks, held in good faith, without stalling or obfuscation,” Rubio said, adding that until there was a new deal it was important for countries to implement sanctions “immediately in order to pressure Iran’s leaders”.
Rial falls to record low
Iran’s economy is already struggling with crippling US sanctions reimposed since 2018 after Trump ditched the pact during his first term.
Iran’s rial currency continued to weaken over fears of new sanctions. The rial fell to 1,123,000 per US dollar, a new record low, on Saturday, from about 1,085,000 on Friday, according to foreign exchange websites, including Bon-bast.com.
With the return of UN sanctions, Iran will again be subjected to an arms embargo and a ban on all uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities, as well as any activity related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
Other sanctions to be reimposed include a travel ban on dozens of Iranian citizens, asset freezes on dozens of people and entities and a ban on the supply of anything that could be used in the nation’s nuclear programme.
All countries are authorised to seize and dispose of any items banned under UN sanctions and Iran will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in any commercial activity in another country involving uranium mining, production or use of nuclear materials and technology.</p><small>2025-09-28 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/281255026307e09.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945182/pakistan-calls-india-regional-bully-at-unga-says-attempts-to-distort-islamabads-name-utterly-shameful' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls India ‘regional bully’ at UNGA, says attempts to distort Islamabad’s name ‘utterly shameful’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called India a “regional bully” at the United Nations General Assembly after an Indian diplomat referred to the country as “terroristan,” the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported on Sunday.
Ties between Pakistan and India have long been fraught, with four wars fought since independence. Earlier this year, a brief but intense military escalation erupted after India launched air strikes in Pakistan over the Pehalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which killed more than two dozen people. Pakistan denied involvement, and the crisis eased following US intervention.  Since then, relations have become exceedingly sour between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The spat unfolded during the fifth day (Sept. 27) of the 80th UNGA session in New York, where exchanges turned heated in the absence of the usual prime ministerial face-off.  The sharpest blows came in the Right of Reply, with Indian representative Rentala Srinivas branding Pakistan a terrorist state, declaring: “No arguments or untruths can ever whitewash the crimes of Terroristan.”
Responding, Muhammad Rashid, Second Secretary at the Pakistan Mission, condemned the remarks as “utterly shameful,” saying India had stooped so low as to distort the name of a fellow UN member state.
Also refuting the terrorism claims made earlier by Indian External Affairs Minister Jaishankar and calling the distortion attempt “undignified”, Rashid went on to say that India itself “is not just a serial perpetrator of terrorism, but a regional bully that is holding South Asia hostage to its hegemonic designs and radical ideology.”

He called on the international community to pay attention to India’s “reckless behaviour.”
“By engaging in this kind of rhetoric, India diminishes its own credibility, showing the world that it has no substantive argument to offer—only, I am sorry to say, cheap slurs which are not worthy of serious discourse.”
Questioning the tone of the language, Rashid further said: “Such language reflects neither maturity nor responsibility. Instead, it exposes that India is frustrated and reveals its pettiness on the world stage.“
He claimed India “itself has been implicated in supporting and sponsoring terrorism beyond its borders.”
Calling it unfortunate, the Pakistani diplomat added that Indian “intelligence operatives have been accused of financing and directing groups engaged in sabotage and targeted killings across the world.”
“Undermining regional stability and violating international law is a habit for India.“
Rashid also noted that actions such as these “expose duplicity of India’s counterterrorism claims, and raise concern regarding India fuelling terrorism rather than combating it”.
He stressed that the claims made by Jaishankar were “completely devoid of facts” and an attempt to “malign” Pakistan’s name.
Earlier, the Indian minister had said that “India has confronted this challenge since independence, having a neighbour that is an epicentre of global terrorism,” without naming Pakistan.
Outlining Pakistan’s losses in the fight against terrorism, Rashid highlighted that Pakistan is “one of the strongest pillars in leading global efforts for combating terrorism.”
On the other hand, India, the diplomat pointed out, “is in the league of those who illegally occupy territories, oppress populations and violate fundamental human rights, as is the case in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
“State terrorism — in the form of: extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, detentions, staged encounters and collective punishment under the cover of counter terrorism.”
While reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to peace in South Asia, Rashid noted that “these goals cannot be achieved through threats and intimidation.”
On that note, he invited India to “embrace” peace, stating, “True progress requires sincerity, mutual respect, dialogue and diplomacy — principles Pakistan has upheld, and which India must finally choose to embrace, if it truly seeks peace.”
On Friday, in his address to the UNGA, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif highlighted the need for “proactive” rather than “provocative” leadership for South Asia, citing India’s recent aggression against Pakistan.</p><small>2025-09-28 12:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28170437c3b8fae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945195/vietnam-evacuates-thousands-shuts-airports-as-typhoon-bualoi-nears' target='_blank'><strong>Vietnam evacuates thousands, shuts airports as Typhoon Bualoi nears</strong></a><br><p>Vietnam closed airports and evacuated thousands of people in areas under storm threat on Sunday, as intensifying Typhoon Bualoi barrelled towards the country, days after causing at least 10 deaths and widespread flooding in the Philippines.
The typhoon was generating winds of up to 133 km/h (83 mph) as of 1000 GMT  (3pm PKT) and is forecast to make landfall in central Vietnam around 0100 on Monday, slowing as it nears the coast, state-run Thanh Nien newspaper reported.
“This is a rapidly moving storm - nearly twice the average speed - with strong intensity and a broad area of impact,” the national weather forecast agency said.
“It is capable of triggering multiple natural disasters simultaneously, including powerful winds, heavy rainfall, flooding, flash floods, landslides, and coastal inundation.” Northern and central provinces may see up to 600 mm of rain through October 1, with rivers rising by 9 meters and risks of flooding and landslides, it said.
Authorities in the central province of Ha Tinh have started to evacuate more than 15,000 people, the government said, adding thousands of troops were standing ready.
Residents in Vinh, capital of Nghe An province, where the typhoon is expected to make landfall, were rushing to secure homes, tie down boats, and stack sandbags or water-filled sacks on rooftops.
“We already suffered from losses from recent Typhoon Kajiki this year and haven’t recovered yet,” said Bui Thi Tuyet, a 41-year-old resident. “Over the last 20 years living here, I have not felt this terrified because of storms.”
Vietnam suspended operations at four coastal airports from Sunday, including Da Nang International Airport, and adjusted the departure time of several flights, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
Schools in the typhoon-affected area will be closed on Monday, with closures potentially extended if necessary, according to news site VnExpress.
Heavy rain has already caused flooding in Hue and Quang Tri, the government said.
With a long coastline facing the South China Sea, Vietnam is prone to typhoons that are often deadly. Last year, Typhoon Yagi killed around 300 people and caused $3.3 billion of property damage.</p><small>2025-09-28 12:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/281646185b44806.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945191/shama-junejo-claims-pm-shehbaz-included-her-in-pakistans-un-delegation-as-adviser' target='_blank'><strong>Shama Junejo claims PM Shehbaz included her in Pakistan’s UN delegation as adviser</strong></a><br><p>The controversy surrounding the supposed inclusion of columnist and social media activist Shama Junejo in Pakistan’s delegation to the United Nations this week took a new turn on Sunday when she claimed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had included her among the delegates as an adviser.
The controversy had surfaced when photos from Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s address at a UN Security Council session on artificial intelligence (AI) spread like wildfire on social media platform X, with users pointing to Junejo sitting in the background. Several of them also shared screenshots from her Twitter (now X) timeline from several years ago, expressing support for Israel — a position sharply at odds with Pakistan’s longstanding pro-Palestinian stance.
After social media furore, Asif said on X that only the Foreign Office could explain Junejo’s presence at the session. Later, the FO clarified that she had not been part of Pakistan’s accredited delegation.
Following that, Asif also spoke about the matter on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’. Asked whether he was “taken aback” by the FO’s statement, Asif emphatically said: “I was taken aback, rather I was a bit disturbed that such people could be with the delegation whom no one owns later.” He also denied Junejo having written PM Shehbaz’s speech for the 80th UN General Assembly session, further stating that as far as he knew, she did not have any official position, be it of an adviser or a special assistant.
However, Junejo claimed in a post on X today that she had been working for the prime minister for the past many months.
“My policy briefs, advice and points during the Pakistan-India escalation are all part of the record and preserved,” she said, further claiming that the premier had assigned her the task of “writing the UN speech”.
The London-based social media activist went on to claim that the PM himself had included her in the UN delegation as an adviser and that she was also issued a security pass.
“I worked with his team day and night. I travelled with him, stayed with his team in the same hotel and was also a part of his important meetings on the sidelines (of the UNGA session), such as the one with Bill Gates,” she said, adding that in another conference on climate on the UNGA sidelines, she was sitting with Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar behind the prime minister.
According to Junejo, after the session on climate, the protocol team escorted her to the session on AI, where she sat behind Asif alongside a man she identified as Bilal. In her post, she also shared a picture of herself with Asif and Pakistan Crypto Council Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib, as well as that of her UN card.
Junejo maintained that at the AI conference, Bilal continued to write a new speech and “we had tea together afterwards”.
“We sat together for 40 minutes waiting for the car, and returned to the hotel together in the same car. Khawaja Asif sahib sat with me on the backseat of the car,” she maintained.
Junejo claimed that she was also at the UN “with the others” when PM Shehbaz was delivering his speech. “There, Khawaja Asif was sitting in front of me, and we all applauded together for the prime minister.”
 






According to her, the PM’s “historic speech was not only written by her, but it was teamwork”. Junejo had claimed about being a part of the minister’s speech-writing team since April earlier as well.
In her post today, she claimed that her return flight was also booked beforehand, and the mission protocol team had dropped her at the airport.
She questioned, “Why is Khawaja Asif sahib issuing such statements now and under what agenda is he tarnishing a historic visit of his government?”
“The prime minister should ask him about this, as his authority has been challenged, not mine.”
In a similar post on X in English, she said Asif’s statements and the FO’s post “
have embarrassed Pakistan globally“.
She added, “If anyone attempts to malign my character or professional integrity, I reserve the right to pursue legal action in the UK.”
Minister passes the buck, FO distances itself
When the controversy had initially surfaced, Asif, facing a barrage of criticism, publicly distanced himself from Junejo’s appearance with the delegation and pointed the finger at the FO.
In a post on X, the defence minister had clarified that he had given the speech instead of PM Shehbaz at the UNSC session as the latter had other engagements.
 






“This woman or whoever sat behind me was and is at the discretion of the Foreign Office,” Asif said. “Who is this woman? Why is she with the delegation, and why was she seated behind me? Only the FO can answer these questions. It is not appropriate for me to respond on their behalf.”
Subsequently, the FO issued a clarification, stating: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has noted queries regarding the seating of a certain individual behind the defence minister at a recent meeting of the UNSC.
“To clarify, the individual in question was not listed in the official letter of credence for the Pakistan delegation to the 80th UNGA session, signed by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister.
 






“As such, her seating behind the defence minister did not have the approval of the deputy prime minister/ foreign minister.”
Official sources confirmed to Dawn that while the FO did not issue the required letter of credence, Junejo joined PM Shehbaz’s entourage from Britain, where she had been staying at the same hotel.
On arrival in New York, Pakistan’s mission to the UN was directed by “a senior political leader” to issue a note verbale for facilitating her accreditation so that she could attend meetings, including the UNSC debate, the Dawn report said.
It added that the leader’s argument was that though she wasn’t part of the official delegation notified by FO for the session, she was part of the entourage. Therefore, the mission was asked to get her accredited.
A source categorically told Dawn that the FO did not even have prior knowledge about Junejo’s inclusion in the entourage.
Junejo clarifies stance on Israel
Meanwhile, Junejo has also posted about her stance on Israel.
In a post on X today, she said that an impression of her being pro-Israel was created on the basis of a 2018 post on X. “Whereas, I have been writing against the massacre in Gaza and Netanyahu almost daily since 2023. But nobody sees that.”
She said her statements about Pakistan recognising Israel were given during Abraham Accords — a set of agreements that normalised ties between Israel and multiple Arab states — and that she had always condemned Israel’s atrocities since its invasion of Gaza. “I will keep doing so,” she added, referring to a video of Pakistani delegates walking out during the recent UNGA session.
 






At the UNGA, delegates from several countries had walked out, boycotting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s speech.
Earlier, Junejo had shared screenshots on X of previous posts where she had called out Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
The Dawn report from yesterday mentions that in her social media posts from London, Junejo had also said she was in possession of the ‘secret files’ raising questions about the security of such documents.
Junejo, in a post on X, also appeared to be clarifying this matter. She said: “There was a fire incident at the Churchill Hotel which left me panicked. I am disabled and was not assisted during evacuation. I carried hard copies of speech drafts and meeting notes — my personal intellectual property. These were sensitive but not state documents. I held no access to or custody of any official files beyond my remit.”

Manhas was the only nominee to be chief of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and was appointed after the board’s annual general meeting in Mumbai.
Rajeev Shukla was elected as vice-president, while Devajit Saikia will stay on as secretary, the BCCI said in a statement.
Manhas, 45, never played for India but turned to the game’s administration after his first-class playing career ended.
He replaces India’s former World Cup-winner Roger Binny, who quit in August after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 70.
Cricket’s massive popularity in India has helped the BCCI become by far the wealthiest of all of the sport’s boards, netting massive money from sponsorship and TV deals.
Manhas’ rise has apparently been backed by India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
He was chosen at a key meeting in New Delhi last week that was also attended by senior BJP members, the Indian media reported.
The meeting was held at the residence of India’s Home Minister Amit Shah, who is the father of International Cricket Council chief Jay Shah.
Manhas most recently worked as director of the cricket association in Indian-occupied Kashmir.
A middle-order batsman who scored 9,714 runs at an average of 45.82 in 157 domestic matches, Manhas remained on the fringes of national selection.
Cricket pundits have said he was unlucky to play in the same era as Indian greats Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, and VVS Laxman.
He was also overshadowed by the presence of Virender Sehwag and Gautam Gambhir in his Delhi team, but led the side with those two star players often on national duty.
Manhas has played more than 50 matches in the Indian Premier League.</p><small>2025-09-28 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/28145449081c6e4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945183/taliban-govt-welcomes-russia-china-iran-and-pakistans-stance-against-foreign-military-bases-in-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>Taliban govt welcomes Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan’s stance against foreign military bases in Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>Afghanistan’s Taliban government has welcomed the recent stance by Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan against the establishment of foreign military bases in and around Afghanistan.
This position was affirmed in a joint statement released after foreign ministers from the four countries met on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York. They emphasised respect for Afghanistan’s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity and said re-establishment of foreign military bases is “not conducive to regional peace and security.”
According to Hamdullah Fitrat, deputy spokesperson for the Taliban government, his country not only welcomed the stance of the four countries but said that “Afghanistan will not allow its territory to be used against other countries, nor permit armed groups to operate from its soil.”
While the joint statement did not refer to any specific country seeking bases in Afghanistan, it follows one by US President Donald Trump where he said Washington was trying to get Bagram air base in Afghanistan back.
Bagram Air Base served as the linchpin for US operations in the rugged country, where the long war against the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies was fought with air strikes and resupply missions from the airfield. In July 2021, all US and Nato troops left Afghanistan’s biggest air base, signalling the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the country after two decades of war.
After his initial statement about Bagram in the United Kingdom, Trump had threatened Afghanistan with unspecified consequences if it refused to give control of the Bagram air base to the US.
For their part, the Taliban government in Afghanistan rejected his demand.
‘Want positive ties with all’
In their joint statement, Russia, China, Iran and Pakistan also urged the Taliban rulers to take “effective, concrete and verifiable actions in fulfilling the international obligations and commitments made by Afghanistan to fight terrorism, and dismantle, and eliminate all terrorist groups, and to prevent recruitment, fundraising and their access to weapons, as well as their collaboration with foreign terrorist fighters”.
The four countries further urged the Afghan authorities to dismantle any terrorist training camps or any other terrorist infrastructure on their soil.
Moreover, their joint statement said: “The four sides expressed deep concern over the security situation related to terrorism in Afghanistan, noting that terrorist groups such as ISIL, Al Qaeda, the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Jaish ul Adl, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and other similar groups in the region including Majeed Brigade, as well as others, based in Afghanistan, continue to pose a serious threat to regional and global security.
“They emphasised that strengthening peace and stability in Afghanistan and countering the threats of terrorism, radicalism, and drug crime emanating from its territory are in line with their common interests in the region.”
To this end, Fitrat termed the idea of “Afghanistan posing any threat to other countries baseless”.
“Afghanistan is taking serious steps against corruption, drugs and all kinds of undesirable issues and considers this process its responsibility,” he said, stressing that the “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan wants to establish positive relations with all countries on the basis of mutual respect”.
Fitrat said “prioritising relations with regional and international countries in the context of security, stability and development in Afghanistan” was a “realistic” approach.
The Afghan government deputy spokesperson asserted that Kabul’s policy was “based on mutual trust, positive contacts and promotion of friendly relations and any false concerns or baseless allegations regarding Afghanistan are strongly rejected”.
JI delegation meets Afghan FM
Separately, a delegation of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) from Pakistan, led by JI Deputy Ameer Professor Muhammad Ibrahim, met with Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi during a visit to Afghanistan, according to a statement issued by the party.
The delegation included JI Deputy Ameer in Balochistan Dr Atta-ur-Rehman, JI Ameer in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa North Inayatullah Khan, JI Ameer in KP Central Abdul Wasi, and Dr Muhammad Iqbal Khalil, the statement said.
Muttaqi also posted about the meeting on X. According to a translator of his post, Pakistan-Afghanistan relations were discussed during the conversation.

Tang took bribes, including cash and property worth over 268 million yuan ($37.6 million) in various positions held from 2007 to 2024, Xinhua said.
The Changchun Intermediate People’s Court suspended his death sentence for two years, noting he had confessed to his crimes, it added.
China’s Communist Party expelled Tang in November 2024, six months after he was placed under investigation by the anti-graft watchdog and removed from his post.
Tang’s investigation was unusually swift and followed similar investigations into Defence Minister Li Shangfu and his predecessor Wei Fenghe.
President Xi Jinping started a campaign of purges of China’s domestic security apparatus in 2020, seeking to ensure police, prosecutors, and judges are “absolutely loyal, absolutely pure and absolutely reliable”.
Tang was governor of the western province of Gansu from 2017 to 2020 before being named minister of agriculture and rural affairs, according to official biographies.
In January, Xi said corruption is the biggest threat to China’s Communist Party and remains on the rise.</p><small>2025-09-28 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625932-daesh-commander-behind-2022-peshawar-bombing-killed-in-afghanistan-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Daesh commander behind 2022 Peshawar bombing 'killed in Afghanistan'</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan on Thursday won by 11 runs after stumbling to 135-8 in the virtual semi-final against Bangladesh.
With that win, the Green Shirts booked their final date with archrivals India for the first time in the 17th iteration of the Asia Cup today.
Ahead of the high-profile clash, Pakistan Cricket Board chief and Asian Cricket Council chairman Mohsin Naqvi has stirred up a hornet’s nest with an ambiguous post on X about a “balancing act”.
 






“How much time do you need to explain the reasons behind the balancing act?” he wrote on X, leaving fans pondering if it was intended for the Indian team, given its timing.
The previous two matches have been marred by much controversy as the two countries are playing against each other amid high tensions following the four-day military standoff in May.
The controversy began with calls from across the border to “boycott” the match. Later, at the match, pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands with their rivals at the toss and after the match, prompting many to decry the “lack of sportsmanship” exhibited by the Indian side.
Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav was said to have “politicised” the win by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, saying the victory was “a perfect gift” for his nation.
In response to this, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav.
The PCB also complained to the ICC that match referee Andy Pycroft had told skipper Salman Ali Agha not to approach Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav for a handshake at the toss.
Further, during the September 21 match, when the rivals met for the second time, Pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the match.
 
 

Because of fraught political ties, nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan only meet at neutral venues during multi-team tournaments.
Tensions soared ahead of the Asia Cup after the two countries engaged in their worst conflict since 1999. The hostilities in May left more than 70 people dead in missile, drone and artillery exchanges, before a ceasefire.
The conflict was triggered by an April attack on civilians in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir that New Delhi accused Pakistan of backing, a charge Islamabad denies.
India lifted the Asia Cup in its last, 50-over edition and are the favourites to retain the crown.

The HPV vaccine, first launched in Pakistan in 2022, has now been rolled out nationwide as part of the routine immunisation programme to protect adolescent girls against cervical cancer. However, vaccine hesitancy in Pakistan remains a major public health challenge, driven by a mix of misinformation, safety concerns, and mistrust of authorities.
In the latest incident yesterday, the HPV vaccination team was performing its duty in a non-formal education school in the village of Ratuwal, within the limits of Kathian Sheikhan police station, when a 55-year-old resident of the village entered the school and attempted to attack a female health supervisor.
According to Kathian Sheikhan’s Station House Officer Sabir Iqbal Sindhu, the suspect “tried to attack the supervisor with a stick and by lifting a chair, threatened serious consequences and used foul language”.
“The sudden attack caused a stampede in the school, and the vaccination process had to be stopped immediately,” he added.
Statement of the affected supervisor
Speaking to Dawn on the telephone, Health Supervisor Shamim Anjum said that she and her team were forced to leave the school to save their lives.
She said that after the incident, she submitted a written application to the Kathian Sheikhan police station, following which a case was registered.
However, she added, “The assurance of security given by the provincial health minister on the first incident of September 25 has not been fulfilled yet, and no practical action has been taken by the police.”
The SHO said that a case has been registered on the complaint of the affected woman. The first information report (FIR), a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was registered under sections 186 (obstructing a public servant in discharge of public functions) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the police, action has been initiated against the suspect, who will be arrested soon.
An HPV vaccination team was also attacked in Mandi Bahauddin’s Chak No. 38 on Thursday, in which a woman was beaten up by locals.
The provincial health minister of Punjab, Khawaja Imran Nazeer, had taken notice of the incident and issued instructions to provide security to female health workers. Health workers, however, say there has been no implementation given Saturday’s attack.
When contacted by a Dawn representative about the matter, Mandi Bahauddin’s Chief Executive Officer of Health, declined to comment, hanging up the phone.
The repeated incidents of violence are affecting the performance of the campaign, as health workers say that unless they are provided with police security, it will not be possible for them to perform their duties.
The HPV vaccination campaign is being implemented in three phases: Phase 1 covered Punjab, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the Islamabad Capital Territory; Phase 2 will expand to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026; and Phase 3 will reach Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027.
Phase 1 of the campaign ran from 15–27 September. The goal is to vaccinate 90 per cent of girls aged 9–14 in Phase 1 regions by the end of 2025, and to sustain high coverage through routine immunisation in the coming years.</p><small>2025-09-28 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/281250159db36e6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945181/massive-crowd-chaos-preceded-deadly-india-rally-stampede' target='_blank'><strong>Massive crowd, chaos preceded deadly India rally stampede</strong></a><br><p>A stampede that killed dozens at a south Indian political rally happened after a crowd of thousands waited hours in baking heat without sufficient safeguards, officials and witnesses said on Sunday.
Some 27,000 people thronged a public road in Tamil Nadu state in hopes of seeing popular actor-turned-politician Vijay on Saturday, but panic broke out and 39 were killed, authorities said.
Witnesses cited hours of delays, insufficient police presence, and people falling from a tree branch onto the audience as contributing to the tragedy.
Tamil Nadu police have registered a criminal case against leaders of Vijay’s political party.
Senior police official V Selvaraj told Reuters that the filing of the case was the first step toward potential charges, “against TVK party senior leaders Bussy Anand, Nirmal Kumar and VP Mathiyalagan, and the investigation is under way”.
“TVK originally sought permission for a gathering of 10,000 people, but the actual crowd was more than double,” he said.
Deadly crowd incidents happen repeatedly during mass gatherings in India, often blamed on lax safety measures.
Vijay, known by one name, was addressing the rally when the crowds surged suddenly, forcing him to halt his speech in Karur district.
Videos on social media showed him tossing water bottles to supporters shortly before the panic broke out.
“My heart is shattered at this tragedy,” the 51-year-old star said in a statement.
State Chief Minister M.K. Stalin told reporters on Sunday that 39 people had died, raising an earlier toll of 36.
Nine children were among the dead, he added, announcing a judicial enquiry into the disaster.
State police chief G. Venkataraman said crowds had been waiting for hours under the hot sun without sufficient food and water after the public was informed that Vijay would arrive at the venue by noon.
“The crowds started coming in from 11am. He came at 7:40pm. The people lacked sufficient food and water under the hot sun,” he told reporters.
He added that 10,000 people were expected, but some 27,000 turned up.
Vijay launched his own party in 2024 and has drawn huge crowds at campaign events ahead of state elections due next year.
“I was pushed down by the crowd all of a sudden. There was absolutely no space to move,” B. Kanishka, a survivor, told the Hindu newspaper. “I subsequently fainted.”
Others said poor organisation and an hour-long wait left people restless before the situation spiralled dangerously out of control.
Karthick, a survivor, told the publication that the situation could have been prevented “if people were not forced to wait for hours together”.
“Poor planning and execution of the programme and lack of police personnel at the spot were also the reasons,” he said.
The Indian Express newspaper said panic spread after supporters who had climbed onto a tree branch fell onto the crowd below.
In January, 30 people were killed in a crush at a major religious fair, and last year 121 died during a Hindu prayer meeting in Uttar Pradesh.
In July last year, 121 people were killed in northern Uttar Pradesh state during a Hindu religious gathering.

It had taken time but the necessary trust had been gained — a tottering Pakistan were pinning hopes on Shaheen Shah Afridi to dig them out of a hole and, for a change, with the bat.
Bangladesh had reduced Salman Ali Agha’s men to 58-5 in their 2025 Asia Cup Super Four clash and Pakistan were searching for some inspiration when the transformed Shaheen hoicked Tanzim Hasan Saqib to the top tier of the Dubai International Cricket Stadium for the first six of the match.
Taskin Ahmed, Bangladesh’s most successful bowler of the night, was then clubbed for another in the next over to pave way for Pakistan to post a respectable 135-8; the defence of which he would later spearhead with the ball.
There is a viral video from the 2024 T20 World Cup in which Shaheen jokingly complains to the ICC crew for putting ‘bowler’ next to his name instead of ‘all-rounder’. Only days later, his unbeaten 16-ball 23 not out helped Pakistan to a respectable score against a much weaker and lower-ranked USA — a game they went on to lose and resulted in an upheaval in the T20 side — after a listless showing from batters had left Pakistan in jeopardy, much similar to this night in Dubai.
The two massive sixes had been anticipated from the moment Shaheen had walked into the middle ahead of all-rounders Mohammad Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf. This was only the fourth time in his T20I career that Shaheen had walked out to bat above number eight.
Such has been this tournament for him, after all. His runs have taken Pakistan to decent totals from embarrassing positions and they have come at scorching strike rates, turning his lower-order contributions into impactful knocks.

There was an uproar only days ago, in their opening Super Fours fixture, when Pakistan kept Shaheen in the dugout as India asphyxiated their middle order after a flying start to restrict them to 171. Shaheen had come into that game after being the second-highest scorer for Pakistan in the last two matches. His best T20I score of 33 not out off 16 balls had taken Pakistan to 127 against India in their first meeting of the tournament and his 29 not out off 14 had propelled them to 146 against UAE. He hit four sixes against India that were the most a batter had managed that night.
There have been instances in the Pakistan Super League when Shaheen has promoted himself up the order for the very job that needed to be done in the latter half of Pakistan’s innings during their Super Fours meeting with India. The most famous instance being the 2023 PSL final when he rushed out of the dressing room to cross the rope ahead of David Weise after the fall of wicket in the 15th over and smashed 44 not out in only 15 balls.
“My job is to deliver [for the team] whether it is in the batting, bowling or fielding,” Shaheen said during this Asia Cup. “I try to give my 100 per cent whenever I play regardless of whether I am sick or I am carrying an injury. I don’t show it because my job is to lift the morale and energy of the team.”

In Shaheen, Pakistan had found an attacking bowler who bowled at express pace and moved the new ball around. His high release point helped him extract bounce from the slow surfaces, but his most threatening weapon has always been his pitched up in-swingers.
He found success across formats and transformed into Pakistan’s all-format leader of the attack, before that ill-fated dive in Galle derailed his career.
Unable to run and bowl, it was during the days of his rehabilitation that Shaheen began to work on his batting. Later, in a PCB in-house video that captured his batting session, Shaheen recalled how he had always liked to bat, but only got the opportunity to work on it during the rehab.
And his efforts have started to pay dividends.
Shaheen has hit 23 sixes and 15 fours in T20Is and 22 and 14 of those have come since his return from the injury. He averages 16.41 and has been scoring at a strike rate of 134.13 since, a marked improvement from 9.50 and 95 from his pre-injury days.
That he had the greatest six-hitter Pakistan has ever produced at his house helped. A video of Shahid Afridi, his father-in-law, teaching him bat swing and feeding him under arm full tosses at the Moin Khan Academy in Karachi in early 2023 went viral. In the PSL that year, Shaheen made 133 runs at a strike rate of 168.35. The next PSL, his 107 runs were scored at 164.61. Across the 2023 and 2024 seasons, Shaheen hit 21 sixes and 13 fours.
Now, he’s unwaveringly translated that to the international stage.

In this Asia Cup, only five players from Pakistan have scored more than 80 runs and Shaheen’s strike rate of 188 is the best among them. In fact, his strike rate, among batters with at least 80 runs, is only bettered by Afghanistan’s Azmatullah Omarzai (217.07) and India’s Abhishek Sharma (204.63) in this tournament.
He has the joint-fourth most sixes in the tournament behind Sharma (19), Bangladesh’s Saif Hasan (12), and Sri Lanka’s Pathum Nissanka (11). Sahibzada Farhan, who Pakistan brought into the side after a chart-topping PSL for his six-hitting abilities, has hit the same number of sixes as Shaheen.
What augurs well for Pakistan is that he seems to be peaking in both aspects of the game just at the right time as they head into the Asia Cup final against India as it was his lethal opening bursts that set Pakistan’s wins in the last two matches against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
He took a wicket each in the first over — which has now become his trademark — and dismantled their top orders inside the powerplay. Following his consecutive three-wicket hauls, he now has the joint-second most wickets in this tournament with nine scalps with each wicket costing 16 runs.

The last two years have not been a smooth sailing for Shaheen. He has been in and out of the side and has remained embroiled in off field controversies. He was sacked as the captain of the T20I side after only one series at the start of 2024 and was later quoted in a PCB media release without his consent that caused friction between him and the management.
 
 

He was dropped from the Test side after the first Bangladesh Test and again after the first Test against England. He was not included in the squad for the Tests in South Africa, despite the pitches there ripe for fast bowling, and was later dropped from the T20I side for the home and away series against Bangladesh in summer this year despite leading Lahore Qalandars to their third title. He is the only captain to have multiple PSL trophies.
There had been concerns about Shaheen’s waning bowling speed and effectiveness. And, in all fairness, he is yet to be as good as he was before the knee injury. But, the signs, of late, have been encouraging.
Shaheen has had wickets in every match of this tournament, except against India. He got smashed at 11.50 and 10.43 runs per over on the last two Sundays.
India’s batting dominance in this tournament has come at the back of the staggering top-order performances and the battle between the Indian openers and Shaheen sets for a spicy subplot.
T20 is a fickle format and it takes only one bowling spell or a batting cameo to take the game away from the opposition. Shaheen knows a thing or two about it. He had orchestrated Pakistan’s famous 10-wicket win over India in the 2021 T20 World Cup inside the first 2.1 overs and has proven himself as a reliable lower-order contributor with the bat over the last two weeks.
A bit of both this Sunday and he will not have to ask anyone to write ‘all-rounder’ next to his name.</p><small>2025-09-28 07:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68d7fa9f6581e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944998/india-and-pakistan-the-politics-of-brinkmanship' target='_blank'><strong>INDIA AND PAKISTAN: THE POLITICS OF BRINKMANSHIP</strong></a><br><p>“I have the means to make myself deadly, but that by itself… is absolutely nothing in the way of protection.

PRELUDE
The four-day “non-contact” war between India and Pakistan — May 7-10 — has already produced sizeable literature within and outside the region. Predictably, writings in India and Pakistan have sought to select their own facts to suit the notion of victory, while extra-regional commentary has oscillated between initial scepticism about Pakistan’s performance and begrudging acceptance of it after facts could no longer be ignored. That said, the Indians think that India won the war, while Pakistanis think they did.
How can two sides win a war?
Simple: when (a) they walk away from a conflict drawing different lessons; (b) neither can deliver a knockout punch; (c) when messaging to domestic constituencies is important; and (d) when you ignore the larger canvas and focus on bean-counting for reasons a, b and c.
While the tactical is important because that’s where the actual fighting takes place, the operational (the middle tier) and the politico-strategic (the top tier) are the levels where victory or defeat normally resides, because these two levels define the Zweck [the political objective] for which a war is fought.
If it’s not obvious, let me clarify. The factors listed above complicate notions of victory and defeat. If State X after aggressing against State Y returns from the conflict (war) without achieving its political objective, has it achieved victory? Logic 101 would dictate that it hasn’t, especially if the objective was/is to coerce State Y into accepting State X’s Zweck. This, as should be clear, is independent of any attenuation at the tactical level during the course of the fighting. And this is as true of short, sharp wars as it is of protracted, attritional ones.
It is also important to appreciate that any conflict (or war) between Pakistan and India takes place and will take place under the overhang of nuclear weapons. By the essence of the theory of deterrence, therefore, war should either not happen between this nuclear dyad or, if hostilities do break out, they must remain confined. This is one of the central themes I want to address later in this article. For now, I will just flag the point with a simple observation: if the essence of deterrence theory is correct, then a number of assumptions on which India’s current Zweck is perched can be challenged.
The purpose here is to move away from the piecemeal treatment of facts at the tactical level and the politics of spectacle and, instead, unpack India’s assumptions that guide its policy decision to undertake kinetic actions against Pakistan.
MAPPING THE TERRAIN
To this end it’s important to map out India’s policy. What drives India’s policy? Does it want to establish hegemony in the region by unsettling the balance of power between Pakistan and itself? Does it want to deter or, as some Indian analysts suggest, compel Pakistan? Does it have the capabilities necessary to achieve this politico-strategic objective, tactical gains or losses notwithstanding? Is this policy independent of India’s domestic politics or is it entrapped in the anti-Pakistan rhetoric that has become the political staple of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under Narendra Modi, helping him to win elections?
These questions are vital because answers to them would determine whether this region is poised for more instability or, by some miracle, can change course and get out of the ‘Thucydides Trap.’
INDIA’S ZWECK, OR IS IT?
The central tenet of India’s policy since 2016 is clear: it will hurt Pakistan in every way. The details are known so I won’t list them. Inflicting pain will involve kinetic and non-kinetic options: diplomatic, covert (sub-conventional) and overt (conventional hostilities).
Clear also from Mr Modi’s speech to the Indian people in the aftermath of the war is the fact that India’s ‘Operation Sindoor’ hasn’t ended — it has been paused. In other words, India is in a state of suspended war with Pakistan. Two, India will consider an attack in Occupied Kashmir as sponsored by Pakistan and does not need to prove it through any evidence. This entails automaticity. Three, India will not differentiate between the so-called “terrorists” and their “sponsors”. Essentially, that Pakistan is the sponsor regardless of any evidence. Finally, that any attack will be an act of war, to which India will respond by attacking Pakistan.
These four points are instructive in that India is (a) trying to create space for kinetic actions in the future and (b) shaping the narrative to couch its aggression in the language of self-defence — an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir (IOK) will be an act of aggression, to which India will respond. This is straight out of the Zionist entity’s playbook.
The question, however, is: can India work this policy of coercion?

From India’s perspective, its strategy is not about disproving nuclear deterrence between India and Pakistan. The presence of nuclear weapons is a fact. Instead, the strategy aims at exploiting any gaps and testing Pakistan’s thresholds. In other words, nuclear parity at the strategic level creates a perverse stability that allows for more instability at the lower, sub-conventional level (eg sub-conventional subversion, border skirmishes and limited conventional strikes).

DOES COERCION WORK?
Coercion can come in two forms: deterrence (through denial or punishment) and compellence. Deterrence says to the adversary, don’t change your behaviour, stay in your lane or my retaliation will inflict unacceptable pain. The adversary nods and stays in its lane. Deterrence is established by coercing the adversary into not changing his behaviour. As American political theorist Thomas Schelling put it, “the deterrent threat only changes the consequence if the act in question — the one to be deterred — is then taken [by the adversary].”
In the case of compellence, a state says to the adversary, listen, I am sick of what you do, so you change your present behaviour or I will extract a cost you won’t be able to pay. The adversary determines that the threat is credible and changes its behaviour. Compellence has worked. In other words, it is definite and time bound. Unlike deterrence, it can’t wait. To quote Schelling again, “We move, and you get out of the way. By when? There has to be a deadline, otherwise tomorrow never comes. And the action… must be brought to successful closure. The payoff comes at the end, as does the disaster if the project fails.”
Easy-peasy? Au contraire. Literature shows that coercion often doesn’t work, even in asymmetric power relationships. In the case of India and Pakistan, both are not only nuclear-armed, with near-symmetrical nuclear forces, but also matched conventionally. So how would coercion work?
The simple answer is, it won’t and it hasn’t. Robert J. Art and Kelly Greenhill’s 2018 paper for Political Science Quarterly, ‘The Power and Limits of Compellence: A Research Note’, and Abby Fanlo and Lauren Sukin’s 2023 paper for Security Studies, ‘The Disadvantage of Nuclear Superiority’, are two outstanding examples of how and why coercion is so difficult to achieve and how even weaker (inferior nuclear) states can show greater resolve.
As Fanlo and Sukin argue, “Our theory suggests neither state (in the case of nuclear weapons states) should be able to very credibly threaten nuclear escalation. As a result, nuclear superiority should largely be irrelevant.” Art and Greenhill imply that Thucydides’ ‘Melian Dialogue’ is often misunderstood. “Thucydides recognised not only the limits of compellent power alone to dictate outcomes but also the dangerous tendency of the powerful to fall victim to an exaggerated faith in, and over-reliance on, the ‘power of power’ to bend others to one’s will.”

This being what it is, what in Darwin’s name is India’s play?
WE KNOW THERE ARE NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT WE ARE RISK-PRONE
From India’s perspective, its strategy is not about disproving nuclear deterrence between India and Pakistan. The presence of nuclear weapons is a fact. Instead, the strategy aims at exploiting any gaps and testing Pakistan’s thresholds.
In other words, nuclear parity at the strategic level creates a perverse stability that allows for more instability at the lower, sub-conventional level (eg sub-conventional subversion, border skirmishes and limited conventional strikes).
As I have mentioned in a previous assessment in these pages, the ‘instability-stability paradox’ is highly destabilising in the Subcontinent’s context because, unlike the Cold War contest between the United States and the Soviet Union, there’s no periphery in geographic contiguity — unless covert actions at the sub-conventional level can become a metaphoric periphery. India is involved in that activity but it also wants overt action to establish its status externally and, more importantly, for the BJP’s domestic constituencies.
To that end it argues that it can exploit the space below the strategic level. The calculus or the argument, if you will, is that, while Pakistan’s nuclear weapons deter an all-out conventional war that could potentially threaten Pakistan’s existence, they do not necessarily deter limited, punitive conventional strikes aimed at specific “terrorist” targets, especially if such strikes are non-contact and the target set(s) do not involve degrading Pakistan’s military capabilities.
The May war has changed some of these assumptions. India is moving from working within a band to widening the band. Second, Pakistan’s successful counter-air operation forced India to change its strategy: the target sets changed and India engaged Pakistan’s ground air defence systems and also targeted Pakistan Air Force (PAF) bases.
This is what the literature describes as the danger of firebreaks. Escalation begins to happen in steps, with firebreaks between them (eg from signalling of intent to diplomatic moves, to threats to sub-conventional actions to limited conventional war to widening of the conflict at the conventional level, to all the way up the ladder to nuclear exchange. The brinkmanship by India, which is expressed through normalisation of conventional strikes and widening the band for them shows that (a) it is constantly probing and pushing against these firebreaks and (b) the process runs the risk of making them weaker and more diffuse.
The danger is that, in reality, escalation is not a linear process — ie adversaries may not go up rung by rung. They could skip two or three rungs and decide to operate at a much higher rung. In fact, this is one of the critiques of military theorist Herman Kahn’s ‘escalation ladder’ metaphor.
This has consequences for deterrence. But what is deterrence? Is it a scientific concept or is it dynamic and psycho-perceptual?
DETERRENCE: SCIENTIFIC OR PSYCHO-PERCEPTUAL?
Going by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper’s ‘Falsifiable Principle’ — that for a theory to be scientific it must be possible to conceive of an observation or experiment that could prove it false — deterrence is not a scientific theory.
The core claim of deterrence is that the possession of nuclear weapons by State A prevents State B from taking a hostile action. Put another way, deterrence is not supposed to fail or, as political scientists Reid Pauly and Rose McDermott argue in ‘The Psychology of Nuclear Brinkmanship’ in International Security, “When two sides engage in rational decision-making, the chance of strategic nuclear exchange should be zero.”
We will return to this theme subsequently but, at this point, the question is: how does one test this? The core claim makes the theory unfalsifiable.
So, why do policymakers and strategists find the concept compelling? The argument is that deterrence operates on a different epistemological plane than science, that it is a complex and dynamic game of signalling, perception and risk-taking. It is psycho-perceptual.
Deterrence is not a law of nature. It’s a theory about human decision-making. It relies on assumptions about rationality, risk-assessment, and the value an adversary places on its own survival. But a number of situations can move the needle from risk-assessment to extreme uncertainty. And uncertainty is just that, uncertainty, and doesn’t allow for assessment.
This also mean that deterrence is a continuous process of signalling, maintaining credibility, and managing perceptions. The lines above from Conrad’s The Secret Agent are instructive. The issue is not whether the professor will push the button but that people must believe he would. That’s what made him deadly.
Proponents also point to specific historical crises (the Cuban Missile Crisis being the prime example), where the presence of nuclear weapons is widely believed to have forced extreme caution on both sides, thereby confirming the theory.

SHOULD WE REST ASSURED?
And yet, no one really knows at what point deterrence could fail. This is the central terror of the concept.
The decision to use nuclear weapons would likely not be a cool, calculated application of a theory. It would be made under conditions of extreme stress, panic, possible misinformation (eg faulty radar readings), and the catastrophic failure of conventional defences. The theory seeks to provide a framework for preventing that decision point from ever being reached through what American national security analyst Joe Cirincione has recently described as “nuclear policy-babble.”
In a September 11 article, ‘Why Are Democrats Pushing for More Nuclear Weapons?’, Cirincione writes: “As fans of Star Trek know, whenever the writers needed a technological fix to the plot dilemma they had created, they would write into the script ‘Scotty says some techno-babble.’ To anyone who has engaged in debates on nuclear weapons policy this phenomenon is all too familiar.” Trust me, he is spot-on! I have previously called it nuclear jabberwocky!
So, what is that decision point and would it always be rational and advertent? In the Cuban Missile Crisis episode, things could have gotten out of control at multiple points during those 13 days. US President John F. Kennedy could have decided to respond to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev’s hard letter instead of his soft letter. He could have followed US Air Force chief of staff Curtis LeMay’s proposal to bomb Cuba and take out the Soviet missiles. The Soviet submarine that the US destroyers were forcing to surface by dropping depth charges could have fired the nuclear torpedo, starting an inadvertent escalation.
In terms of perceptions, ‘red lines’ present their own problem. For instance, it doesn’t matter what Pakistan’s actual red lines are; what matters is what India believes they are and India might just misread them. The situation becomes even more destabilising if India begins to test to map out Pakistan’s thresholds, which it obviously is doing.
A good example of this is what I would call the stress test for Pakistan’s doctrine of ‘Full Spectrum Deterrence’ (FSD). As I have previously noted in this space, FSD was Pakistan’s response to India’s ‘Cold Start Doctrine’, later rechristened ‘Pro-Active Ops’ (PAO). India’s PAO envisaged independent battle groups for short, sharp strikes within Pakistan. Pakistan plugged that gap by developing a range of nuclear weapons of different yields (low to high) and different delivery systems (ballistic missiles, cruise missiles) to be used at every potential level of escalation — from the battlefield (tactical nuclear weapons, like the Nasr missile) to strategic strikes against cities.
While Pakistan perceived Nasr to be a deterrent rather than a war-fighting option, India (and others) perceived it to be a system that would actually be employed through dispersal and decentralised control in the field. The PAO never got off the ground and the Feb 2019/May 2025 strikes did not involve physical land ingress into Pakistan. But it has given India the false perception of having called Pakistan’s nuclear bluff.
This is very different from Pakistan’s perception — ie Pakistan will use proportional conventional means to demonstrate resolve and capability, without crossing the nuclear threshold. For Pakistan, this means maintaining the credibility of its deterrent by not being forced to use it, while still punishing the provocation. [NB: I have eschewed going into my own criticism of FSD as a policy here.]
India’s approach through repeated attacks is to force Pakistan to answer a critical question: if not this, then what would trigger a nuclear response? This is a real problem because, in theory, if Pakistan does not respond to a limited strike or ingress with nuclear weapons (which it hasn’t), India could determine that Pakistan’s threshold is much higher than claimed, and the band for conventional strikes is much wider.
India’s actions show why Pakistan felt it needed FSD — to deny India a safe space for conventional war. Yet, those same actions test its credibility, forcing Pakistan into a difficult position, where it must respond effectively without triggering the very war its weapons are meant to deter.
The paradox is that the way the game of brinkmanship is being played both validates and challenges FSD. In essence, because of India’s insistence that there’s a band and it will act to probe the size of that band, the India-Pakistan contest has become a live lab for the most dangerous aspects of nuclear deterrence theory, where the concepts of thresholds, credibility, and the stability-instability paradox are not academic abstractions anymore.
SIGNALLING AND PERCEPTIONS
If, as noted above, deterrence is a complex and dynamic game of signalling, perception and risk-taking, then for it to work, the adversaries must share some common understanding — ie signalling by one should be understood by the other. This should also impact perceptions. Empirical evidence, however, does not support this assumption in many cases. Let me list three, gleaned from different works in military literature.
In 1961, as part of its “forward policy”, India began moving troops into border areas where neither China nor India had maintained military presence.  In Ladakh, Chinese troops (PLA) surrounded some Indian forward pickets and cut them off from their supply routes. After a few days, they withdrew. For its part, China was signalling resolve but also giving India an out: move back without loss of face.
India, for its part, perceived the PLA’s withdrawal as weakness, and determined that Peking (Beijing) was not prepared to press its tactical advantage. It doubled down on its forward policy and, by June 1962, Indian authorities reported that the country had gained 2,000 square miles of territory via this forward policy.
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, India’s then prime minister, and his coterie of close cabinet ministers had convinced themselves that Peking would not start a war and be branded an aggressor by the non-aligned bloc. Later events showed that India had seriously misjudged China’s resolve.
As the political scientist Richard Ned Lebow has written: “The Chinese, who were unaware of the nature and extent of India’s illusions, behaved in a way damaging to deterrence by reinforcing in Indian minds the very expectations about themselves they sought to forestall.”
Take Japan’s sneak attack on Pearl Harbour in 1941. Japan did not want to pull the US into a war against itself. If anything, it had correctly assessed that the US joining the war in the Pacific would stack the odds against Japanese forces. But Tokyo also needed to do something about the US oil and materials embargo, which was hurting its war effort.
The attack on Pearl Harbour was an effort to destroy the US Pacific fleet, to force the US out of the Western Pacific theatre. The assumption was terribly flawed, as subsequent events showed. If anything, the Japanese attack brought the US into the theatre actively.
The 1965 decision by the US to send a light marine division ashore in Vietnam instead of a heavy army division was to signal to Hanoi that Washington’s objectives were limited. The US was also aware of escalation a la the Korean War if it mounted a ground invasion of North Vietnam. Even during the bombing of North Vietnam, the US used bombing pauses to signal to Hanoi that it did not want escalation but that it would also ensure its protection operation in support of South Vietnam. For North Vietnam, however, the central issue was the US deployment itself and bombing, not what kind of troops were being deployed or whether there were bombing pauses.
As Lebow noted, “Carefully calibrated signals most often fail to make the desired impression because they are based on distinctions that seem obvious to the sender but to which the receiver is oblivious.”
To this I would add that signalling often fails because X’s priorities are not Y’s priorities and the difference also creates the differential. Put another way, information is imperfect and finding a common bargaining framework is often very difficult at the exact moments when it is most desirable.
EPILOGUE
Outside of think tank gobbledygook and political rhetoric for domestic reasons, India’s presumed Zweck means nothing, since it can neither deter nor compel Pakistan. However, the battles India wants to fight to an unachievable end have the potential to destabilise the region. Testing red lines to find space for violence is innately unstable because escalation is “a step of any size that crosses a saliency.”
In his 1991 book Inadvertent Escalation: Conventional War and Nuclear Risks, US political scientist Barry Posen has listed a number of “causal patterns” which could entangle conventional and nuclear forces and destroy command, control and communication centres that are used by both conventional and nuclear forces, thus inadvertently degrading a state’s capacity to employ its nuclear-weapons capability and getting it to escalate to that level in a use-it-or-lose-it scenario.
There’s also the temptation to strike nuclear forces/platforms with non-nuclear strategic weapons, forcing the other side to jump multiple rungs on the escalation ladder.
This is not an exhaustive list nor an exhaustive treatment of a policy pursued by India that has ‘DANGER’ written all over it. In fact, the very inability of India to coerce Pakistan could lead it to go for options that could result in inadvertent escalation.
Pakistan, for its part, has to be prepared. Given the psycho-perceptual make-up of the current Indian dispensation, anything else would be considered timidity and may end up bringing upon that which we want to forestall. That’s unfortunate but it’s also a fact.

The country’s first HPV vaccine campaign aimed to administer jabs to 11 million girls — but by the time it ended on Saturday, only around half the intended doses were administered.
 
 

A long-standing conspiracy theory that Western-produced vaccines are used to curb the Muslim population has been circulating online in Pakistan.
Misinformation has also spread that the vaccine disrupts the hormones of young girls and encourages sexual activity.
“Some people have refused, closed their gates on us, and even hid information about their daughter’s age,” vaccinator Ambreen Zehra told AFP while going door to door in a lower-middle-income neighbourhood in Karachi.
 
 

Only around half the intended vaccines had been administered, according to a federal health department official who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity.
“Many girls we aimed to reach are still unvaccinated, but we are committed to ensuring the vaccine remains available even after the campaign concludes so that more women and girls get vaccinated,” they said on Friday.
One teacher told AFP on condition of anonymity that not a single vaccine had been administered in her school on the outskirts of Rawalpindi because parents would not give consent, something she said other rural schools had also experienced.
A health official who asked not to be named said some private schools had resorted to closing for several days to snub vaccine workers.
“On the first day we reached 29 per cent of our target, it was not good, but it was fine,” said Syeda Rashida Batool, Islamabad’s top health official, who started the campaign by inoculating her daughter.
“The evening of that first day, videos started circulating online, and after tha,t it dipped. It all changed.”
 
 

A video of schoolgirls doubled over in pain after teargas wafted into their classroom during a protest several years ago was re-shared online, purporting to show the after-effects of the vaccine.
The popular leader of a right-wing religious party, Rashid Mehmood Soomro, said last week the vaccine, which is voluntary, was being forced on girls by the government.
“In reality, our daughters are being made infertile,” he told a rally in Karachi.
‘This will control the population’
In 95pc of cases, cervical cancer is caused by persistent infection with Human Papillomavirus (HPV) — a virus that spreads through sexual activity, including non-penetrative sex, that affects almost everyone in their lifetime.
The HPV vaccine, approved by the World Health Organisation, is a safe and science-based protection against cervical cancer and has a long history of saving lives in more than 150 countries.
Cervical cancer is particularly deadly in low and middle-income countries such as Pakistan, where UNICEF says around two-thirds of the 5,000 women diagnosed annually will die, although the figure is likely under-reported.
This is because of a significant lack of awareness around the disease, cultural taboos around sexual health and poor screening and treatment services.
It is underlined by the damaging belief that only women with many sexual partners can contract sexually transmitted infections.
In Europe, where the HPV vaccine has been highly effective, there were around 30,000 diagnoses across all 27 EU nations in 2020, of which around one-third of women died, according to the European Commission.
“My husband won’t allow it,” said Maryam Bibi, a 30-year-old mother in Karachi who told AFP her three daughters would not be vaccinated.
“It is being said that this vaccine will make children infertile. This will control the population.”
Humna Saleem, a 42-year-old housewife in Lahore, said she thought the vaccine was “unnecessary”.
“All cancers are terrible. Why don’t we tell our boys to be loyal to their wives instead of telling our girls to get more vaccines?” she told AFP.
Pakistan — one of only two countries, along with Afghanistan, where polio is endemic — remains stubbornly resistant to vaccines as a result of misinformation and conspiracy theories.
After marking one year without polio cases for the first time in 2023, the crippling disease has resurged with 27 cases reported in 2025 so far.
In response to overwhelming misinformation about the HPV vaccine, Pakistan’s minister of health, Syed Mustafa Kamal, took the bold move to have his teenage daughter vaccinated in front of television cameras.
“In my 30-year political career, I have never made my family public,” he told reporters.
“But the way my daughter is dear to me, the nation’s daughters are also dear to me, so I brought her in front of the media.”</p><small>2025-09-28 05:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/280759205720865.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945127/17-terrorists-eliminated-in-karak-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>17 terrorists eliminated in Karak: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>• TTP terrorists targeted in intelligence-based operation
• Four civilians killed in Bajaur blast, caused by old explosive device

LAKKI MARWAT/ BAJAUR: Seventeen militants were killed in an intelligence-based oper­ation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district on Friday night, while four civilians fell victim to an explosion in the Bajaur district on Saturday.
Three security personnel were also injured in the operation conducted in the Darshakhel area of Karak.
The operation was conducted “on the reported presence of khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location and, resultantly, 17 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” it added.
Karak District Police Officer Shahbaz Elahi said that the police and security forces launched the operation in the remote rural area within the limits of Shah Slaim police station on information about the presence of militants there.
“We had credible reports that terrorists affiliated with the Mullah Nazir group of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban were present in the area with an intention to execute their nefarious plans,” he said.
He added that an intense exchange of fire took place when security personnel reached the area and started laying a siege around the mountainous hideouts of militants.
“The fierce gun battle lasted for several hours, resulting in the killing of 17 Fitna al Khwarij terrorists and their six accomplices were injured,” Mr Elahi said.
“The anti-state and anti-peace elements will not find any place to hide and the police and security forces will carry out joint operations to eliminate them,” the district police chief added.
Another police official said that heavy contingents of police and security forces remained present in the area on Saturday and continued search in the mountains on the border between Lakki Marwat and Mianwali districts for the injured and fleeing militants.
He said that announcements were made in the Darshakhel and adjacent villages and hamlets, advising people to stay indoors as the operation was underway.
“People were also advised not to allow anyone to enter their houses seeking shelter and cooperate with police and security forces,” he added.
Bajaur explosion
In Bajaur’s Lowi Mam­und tehsil, four people were killed and two critically injured when an un­­e­­xploded device went off in a field in the Laghari area on Saturday afternoon, officials and locals said.
They told Dawn that the tragedy occurred in the Laghari area around 3pm when a group of local youths were passing through the field.
Israr Khan, public relations officer of the district police in Khar, confirmed that the blast was caused by an old explosive device.
Riaz Ahmed Khan, a spokesman for Rescue 1122 Khar station, told Dawn that among the four fatalities, one person died at the scene, while others were pronounced dead upon arrival at Khar’s district hospital. He said that the victims were identified as Sajad Khan, 18; Nawshad Khan, 13; Faw­ad Khan, 18; and Jawad Khan, 15.
The official mentioned that 17-year-old Waqas Khan and 15-year-old Attaullah were among the wounded. They were initially taken to the district headquarters hospital in Khar but were later airlifted to a hospital in Peshawar via a specially arranged Frontier Corps North helicopter for adv­anced medical treatment.
Local political leaders from the ANP, JI, and PTI visited Khar Hospital to donate blood and express solidarity with the families.
PTI MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman said he would press authorities for the early return of displaced residents to their homes.
Talal Chaudhry
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Saturday that Pakistan’s response to militancy would be firm, suggesting those “who understand the language of bullets will be explained with bullets” if negotiations with Afghanistan fail to stop cross-border attacks.
 
 

Speaking at a press conference, he described Pakistan’s diplomacy as at a 75-year high and defended ongoing security operations.
Mr Chaudhry said terrorism remained the cou­ntry’s biggest challenge and insisted the government was committed to making Pakistan safe for investment.
“Today red carpets are being laid for the prime minister abroad,” he said, contrasting current diplomatic outreach with past isolation. He added that federal and provincial governments must cooperate closely on security.
The minister accused militants of entering Pakistan from across the border and charged that “80 per cent of terrorist attackers are Afghans”.
Mr Chaudhry said the government would streng­then measures to prevent cross-border infiltration, curb sectarian violence and stabilise restive areas.
He called on all political parties to unite for nat­io­nal development and noted that foreign observers acknow­ledged impro­vements in Pakistan’s security situation.
On media conduct, he warned journalists again­­st supporting “those who hide behind the guise of journalists” and critici­s­­ed what he described as “false vloggers” who, he said, traded national security for money. He said the government was taking action against such individuals and hinted that laws could be further toughened.

Sources said that the procedure was successfully performed by experts of the livestock and fisheries department — a second such procedure in recent months.
The experts included Dr Shalla Hayat, Dr Muhammad Ali Ayaz, Dr Javed Khoso, Dr Zulfiqar Haider Otto and Dr Muhammad Ali Gopang. The disease investigation was carried out by Dr Abdul Manan Khokhar, who is also the government focal person.
The 18-month-old camel — now affectionately named Chandni — is currently being kept under 24-hour observation at the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) shelter home, located in the Murad Memon goth.
A separate unit has been created at the facility to meet her intensive health needs. Officials say Chandni is recovering.

Female camel’s right hind leg surgically removed ‘to prevent infection’

Sources said her post-operation blood tests showed presence of a potentially life-threatening blood parasitic infection that had caused a significant drop in her haemoglobin level. This situation, they said, forced the medical board — constituted by the provincial government for her care — to consider treatment options that would minimise blood loss.
“The team had to amputate her right hind leg as there was no sensation in her limb. Second, it was a strategy to help prevent the spread of the infection that’s still being treated,” an official told Dawn.
He added that her multiple jaw injuries were attended to through “bone pinning techniques” — a surgical method in which a metal pin is inserted into the centre of the broken bone to hold the pieces in place when they heal.
According to her post-operation report, a copy of which is available with Dawn, “Both procedures were performed under local and dissociative anaesthesia. Both surgeries were bloodless and painless. The animal female camel Chandni is now out of danger and in complete senses,” it says.
The medical team reaffirms that the animal will be able to swallow food within two days and eat solid food within three to five weeks. Now the focus is on her health stability and vital control, it adds.
Sources said Chandni’s complete recovery was expected in two months, after which the team would reassess her condition and plan to fit a prosthetic limb.
Meanwhile, the chief minister has directed the officials concerned to ensure good care of Chandni until she fully recovers.
“Till she heals, experts in making artificial limbs should be consulted,” a statement released by CM House says.
It might be recalled that Chandni, earlier named Sumi, was “punished” for drinking water from a pond in a landlord’s field in Sukkur. The camel was later brought to the CDRS shelter in Karachi for treatment.
The poor camel had been battling multiple life-threatening injuries, including a crushed leg and multiple jaw fractures.
The police have claimed to have arrested two of the three suspects allegedly involved in the torture reported in the Januji area in taluka Salehpat, Sukkur.
According to the complainant, when his camels were returning after drinking water from a pond, one of the suspects hit one of the camels with an axe, breaking its leg. Then he dragged the camel with his tractor. The complainant said he kept pleading with the suspects to spare the camel, but they did not listen to him. According to the FIR, the suspects reacted angrily, saying that the camel had “destroyed their crops”.
 
 

Earlier, Cammie, another female camel, suffered a similar brutality in Sanghar as punishment for foraging in a landlord’s field.
She was able to stand on her feet with the help of a prosthetic leg following a major surgery in July this year.

The decision has plunged already vulnerable communities into a deeper crisis. In water-logged villages including Azmatpur, Lati Marhi and Bait Nabi Shah, stagnant floodwater continues to fill homes, but with official relief channels severed, families have nowhere to turn.
 
 

The administration has also shut down relief centres established in local schools, compelling displaced individuals to return to their destroyed or inundated houses.
The scale of the disaster is immense. Of the 14 union councils in Tehsil Alipur, 11 were swallowed by floodwaters. Officials estimate that nearly 400,000 of the tehsil’s 700,000 people have been affected and forced to abandon their homes.

District official links provision of further relief to completion of damage assessment survey

For residents like Abid Khan, this means living under the open sky.
“All of the houses in our basti have collapsed,” Mr Abid said. “We have to live under the sky. We did not get any tents, and my children and other family members have to spend the day under the scorching sun.”
 
 

Khan, from the Azmatpur area, added that his family has no ration and no fodder for their surviving cattle, which are their primary source of livelihood.
Muzaffar Gopang from the village of Kundrala said his family has been without a roof for 15 days.
“Our house collapsed and water is still inundating our low-lying area. We cannot even go back,” he said. Mr Gopang stated their cattle are stranded on riverbanks without fodder and that families feel completely cut off. “The authorities did not visit our areas.”
Describing the scene of utter destruction, he reported floodwaters reaching 10 to 12 feet. “All the houses of Basti Chandia have washed away. We are helpless and waiting for any relief. Ministers and officials visited other areas, but we did not receive any help.”
Others reported receiving no aid at all. Ghulam Fareed Chandia from Bait Mullanwali said his community has not received a single packet of ration in over two weeks.
“No one from the ministers or the district and tehsil administration has visited us,” he said. “All the houses of Basti Chandia have washed away. We are helpless and waiting for any relief.”
Muzaffargarh Deputy Commissioner Usman Tahir Jappa confirmed the conclusion of the rescue and relief phase.
“The rescue and relief operation was completed, and we are now starting a survey to address the issues of the people,” Mr Jappa told Dawn. He added that relief would be provided after the damage assessment survey is completed.

The court proceeded with the hearing irrespective of objections from Mr Khan’s legal team, who requested a halt to the video link trial, insisting on his in-person appearance.
ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah resumed proceedings in the General Headquarters (GHQ) protest case as lawyers for Mr Khan submitted an application seeking his personal appearance. They urged the court to stop the trial being conducted via video link, where Mr Khan appears from Adiala Jail.
Raja Ikram Ameen Minhas, head of the prosecution, argued that a similar application had already been dismissed and the defence counsel did not challenge that order before the Lahore High Court. He alleged the defence filed the previously decided application to disrupt the court proceeding.

Judge overrules plea for ex-premier to appear in person; says he can’t stop the trial without an appellate forum’s restraining order

The judge observed that he could not stop the trial unless an appellate forum restrained him from doing so.
The court then recorded statements from three prosecution witnesses: Tehzeebul Hassan, Asmat Kamal and Akbar. The testimony of 44 of the 50 prosecution witnesses has now been recorded. The court summoned three more witnesses for a hearing on Sept 30.
The legal arguments on Saturday reflect an ongoing dispute over the trial’s format.
On Sept 19, Judge Shah had ruled that the trial would be held on court premises instead of at Adiala Jail but said Mr Khan’s attendance would be marked through a video link, an order passed after a Punjab government notification cited security concerns.
Mr Khan, who has been incarcerated since Aug 2023, faces multiple cases. He was indicted in December last year in the GHQ protest case and was formally arrested by Rawalpindi police in connection with it in January 2024.
His initial arrest from the Islam­abad High Court on May 9, 2023, triggered violent protests across the country, during which state buildings and military installations were vandalised.
During Tuesday’s hearing, defence lawyers again sought a deferment to challenge the video link order, but the prosecution, however, argued that the defence neither obtained any restraining order from the high court nor challenged the order before an appellate forum.
The judge then proceeded with the testimony of prosecution witnesses as the defence counsel left the courtroom and later told reporters about connectivity issues in the video link arrangement.
The prosecution has said it expects to conclude its evidence against Khan and other leaders of his Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party next week, after which cross-examination of the witnesses is expected to begin.

The formal bilateral interaction between the two leaders was held at the Oval Office and was closed to the press. According to a statement issued from Pakistan, the leaders discussed regional security and cooperation on counter-terrorism, among other matters.

Calls Trump talks ‘very encouraging’

During an interaction with the media in New Jersey, aired on Saturday, the prime minister said the US was ready to share “techniques” with Pakistan in the areas of artificial intelligence, information technology and agriculture. He added that the US was also open to investment opportunities in the country.
At the airport, the PM along with the foreign minister and others was seen off by UN and US ambassadors.

Israeli army fire killed at least 42 people in Gaza City as it attempts to capture and occupy the territory’s largest urban centre.
In less than two years, Israel’s war on Gaza has killed at least 65,549 people and wounded 167,518, besides displacing millions from their areas.
Footage from a hospital courtyard in central Gaza on Saturday showed several bodies in white shrouds, victims of a strike on Nuseirat refugee camp. Women wept over the dead, while men stood in prayer beside the bodies.
Piles of concrete blocks and gaping holes marked the site of the strike that hit a building in the camp.
Groups of men and children picked through the debris, salvaging what they could of their belongings.
Iyad Shokr, who survived the strike on Nuseirat, said the attack came just before dawn. “The debris collapsed on our floor. By the will of God some survived while others were martyred,” he said.
Seven members of the Bakr family were killed overnight in the strike on Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, where Israeli forces have stepped up a ground and air assault.
 
 

The dead included children and women, according to the Gaza civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas authority, which said several others were also wounded in the Israeli strike.
“What is happening are massacres, massacres that are condemned internationally,” said Umm Khaleel, who survived when the family home was hit.
Gaza’s main Al-Shifa hospital confirmed receiving six bodies of victims killed in the strike.
“We cannot sleep because of the bombing and shelling on Al-Shati… the children were sleeping when suddenly a missile landed on us,” said Salwa Subhi Bakr.
“What does the world want from us?”.
Bakr, displaced by the nearly two-year-long war, said families had nowhere safe to flee. “They tell us go there, then come back here. Where do we get the money for trucks?” she said. “People are in the streets, in the south scattered everywhere. Where should we go? Find us a solution.”
 
 

While Trump is due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after on Sept 29 after telling reporters on Friday it “looks like we have a deal on Gaza”, a Hamas official said on Saturday the Palestinian group had not received Trump’s Gaza ceasefire plan.

ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved technical assistance to operationalise the ‘Glaciers to Farms (G2F)’ regional programme, covering Pakistan and several Central and West Asian countries, as the region faces intensified climate disaster risks.
According to an ADB report, the support will back the Climate Action Roadmap through glacier monitoring, river basin planning and regional knowledge sharing. It will also help countries establish institutional and operational mechanisms, and prepare diagnostics, studies and capacity requirements needed to implement the programme.
The early ADB support ensures that the G2F programme seamlessly transitions into the implementation phase, minimising delays, strengthening readiness of proposed projects and enhancing the overall effectiveness and sustainability of the interventions in key sectors, including agriculture, health, social protection, and water, the report said.
Anchored by the ADB and aligned with Green Climate Fund (GCF) priorities, G2F mobilises up to $3.5 billion in public and private finance, including $325 million in GCF concessional support, to build resilience from glacier to farmland.

$3.5bn regional initiative targets glacier retreat, food security

The programme establishes a full-cycle adaptation framework by linking upstream glacier monitoring with downstream interventions in agriculture, water management and disaster risk reduction, underpinned by integrated science-policy-finance mechanisms.
The G2F feasibility assessment has confirmed that climate finance systems across Central West Asia are underdeveloped and misaligned with national priorities. Critical gaps — including the absence of green taxonomies; environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards; and risk-sharing mechanisms — continue to undermine the ability of both governments and private actors to scale adaptation investments.
G2F is structured as a phased, ecosystem-based programme that leverages regional platforms such as the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Programme (CAREC), while avoiding duplication and fostering country-led adaptation at scale.
It is a regionally integrated, multi-sectoral climate adaptation programme aimed at safeguarding the lives, livelihoods and ecosystems of over 370m people in Central and West Asia.
The region is experiencing rapid and severe climate impacts — glaciers are retreating at rates of up to one per cent per year, water flows are becoming increasingly erratic, and both food insecurity and climate-related health risks are intensifying. “These cascading threats are especially acute in major transboundary basins such as the Indus, Amu Darya, and Syr Darya, where communities are heavily reliant on cryosphere-fed water systems,” the ADB report said.
Central West Asia is among the fastest-warming regions globally, with average temperatures rising by 0.2 to 0.4 degrees Celsius per decade. If these trends continue, more than 50pc of glacier volume in the Pamir and Tien Shan ranges could be lost by 2100, posing an existential threat to water, food and energy security across the region.
Glacier retreat is already destabilising seasonal water availability, intensifying natural hazards — such as glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), avalanches and flash floods — and placing enormous pressure on already fragile agricultural systems. In addition to glacial retreat, snowpack is melting earlier in the year due to rising temperatures, shifting peak water availability to months when agricultural demand is still low.
 
 

This temporal mismatch between water supply and irrigation diminishes agricultural productivity and increases reliance on groundwater and reservoir storage — resources already under strain, the report said.
Any alteration in water timing, quality or quantity disproportionately affects vulnerable communities, particularly in water-stressed and low-capacity regions. Rural households, women-headed farms, and agri-micro-small-and-medium-enterprises (MSMEs) — already facing limited access to finance, infrastructure, and support services — are often the first to feel the effects of water stress and production losses.

Documents filed in a US federal court reveal new charges against the alleged assassin, Nikhil Gupta, incl­uding money laund­ering, credit card fraud, drug and arms trafficking, and atte­mpted murder of a person in Nepal or Pakistan.
According to fresh court documents, US gover­nment lawyers claim that the alleged murder-for-hire plot was not limited to New York but also included plans to kill another person in Nepal or Pakistan.
US prosecutors allege that former Indian RAW officer Vikash Yadav promised to supply firearms and even arrange clearance for an aircraft to transport weapons from India. This was allegedly intended so that Gupta could sell the weapons to a man he believed was a trafficker, who would, in turn, help him hire a hitman to target a Sikh separatist in the United States.
In WhatsApp messages dated June 22, 2023, Yadav allegedly promised to provide “assault rifles and pistols” and to “arrange for the clearance of an airplane to transport the weapons from India.”
On June 26, Gupta reportedly followed up, asking Yadav to check on the “toys,” a coded reference to firearms. Prosecutors say Yadav res­p­o­nded that he could obtain the weapons once the killing was complete.
US prosecutors argue that these exchanges show Yadav’s alleged support was conditional on Pannun’s assassination, linking the arms offer directly to the murder-for-hire plot.
Beginning in May 2023, when Yadav instructed Gupta to “save my name as Aman,” he told Gupta over WhatsApp that there were multiple targets, including one in New York (the primary victim) and another in California, and, by reference to addresses, at least one target in Nepal or Pakistan, according to a prosecutor’s letter to the judge.
Regarding the Nepal discussions, the government stated that Yadav provided Gupta with the target’s location to pass on to hitmen, whom Gupta described as “soldiers.” On May 8, Gupta wrote to Yadav that the men had “already arrived [in Nepal] and were looking for” the target. Yadav pressed Gupta to increase their payment and stressed that the task was “urgent.” In one message, Yadav instructed: “If they have really captured the target, they should kill him. Otherwise, we won’t get another chance.”
Prosecutors argued that communications between Yadav and Gupta about the Nepal task were substantially similar to their communications regarding the New York target and described the Nepal plot as “strikingly similar” to the Pannun plan.
Nikhil Gupta’s extradition, arrest
Gupta, also known as Nick, 53, was arrested in the Czech Republic on June 30, 2023, and extradited to the United States under the bilateral treaty between the US and Czech Republic. He arrived in the US on June 14 and was presented on murder-for-hire charges.
Attorney General Merrick B. Garland said the extradition “makes clear that the Justice Dep­artment will not tolerate attempts to silence or harm American citizens.” Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco described the plot as “a brazen attempt to silence a political activist for exercising a quintessential American right: his freedom of speech.”
FBI Director Christopher Wray emphasised that the bureau “will not tolerate attempts by foreign nationals, or anyone else, to repress constitutionally-protected freedoms in the United States.”
DEA Administrator Anne Milgram said the extradition was “the result of the hard work and commitment of the DEA New York Division’s Drug Enforcement Task Force” and praised international law enforcement cooperation, inc­luding the Czech Republic’s Nat­ional Drug Headquarters.
Assassination plot
According to court documents, Gupta conspired with an Indian government employee, identified as CC-1, to target a US-based Sikh separatist leader who advocates for Khalistan, a sovereign Sikh state. CC-1, a former RAW officer with training in battlecraft and weapons, allegedly directed the plot from India.
Gupta, a resident of India with prior involvement in narcotics and arms trafficking, attempted to contract a hitman to kill the US citizen. The supposed hitman was, in fact, a DEA undercover officer. CC-1 allegedly agreed to pay $100,000 for the murder, and an initial payment of $15,000 was delivered in Manhattan in June 2023.
The plot included surveillance of the target, with Gupta sending photos and updates to CC-1. Gupta instructed the undercover operative to avoid carrying out the assassination during upcoming US-India diplomatic engagements.
Nijjar’s murder link
On June 18, 2023, masked gunmen murdered Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was associated with the target and also led the Sikh separatist movement, outside a Sikh temple in British Columbia, Canada. Gupta informed the undercover operative that Nijjar “was also the target” and emphasised multiple potential targets. CC-1 later instructed Gupta to prioritize the main target.
Gupta faces charges of murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, each carrying a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. The case is being prosecuted by the southern district of New York, with the FBI and DEA actively investigating.
The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs coordinated with Czech authorities to secure Gupta’s arrest and extradition. Trial attorneys from the National Security Division and the US Attorney’s Office are handling the case.

• Maryam says Punjab is working while other provinces are busy criticising it
• 2,200 survey teams with 10,000 personnel from army, other depts deployed in the province
• Azma Bokhari threatens to sue Nadeem Afzal Chan over loan claim
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: As the Punjab government on Saturday launched a survey to assess the losses caused by recent floods, the PPP urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to accept its demand for providing immediate relief to the flood-affected people through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
The PML-N and the PPP — coalition partners at the Centre and in Punjab — have been at odds over how to help the flood victims, with the former’s government in Punjab insisting on using its own resources, while the latter is adamant about channelling the aid through the BISP.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, PPP Secretary General Humayun Khan, Senator Palwasha Khan and the party’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa leader Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha criticised the Punjab government, saying that the BISP already had the required data and was the most effective mechanism to assist flood-hit families.
Humayun Khan said the people were enduring severe hardships due to the floods, recalling that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had visited flood-affected areas in Punjab, and reiterated the demand for immediate relief through the BISP.
Palwasha Khan expressed regret over what she termed “unfortunate remarks” from some PML-N ministers against the PPP despite being coalition partners. “It is regrettable that the Punjab government has used such language for its coalition partner. The Punjab government says it will not bow down to anyone. Then why go to the IMF? The impression is being created that Punjab belongs to one party. Punjab is not the domain of any one party; similarly, no province is the exclusive domain of any party. All provinces of Pakistan belong to all Pakistanis,” she said.
She proposed that the electricity bills of flood-affected families be waived until they fully recover. She said the scale of the damage caused by the floods was immense and could not yet be fully estimated.
She recalled that BISP funds had previously been disbursed during the holy month of Ramazan and asked: “Why does the name of BISP cause so much pain?”
Without elaborating, she said that when the Punjab chief minister faced challenges, “the most vocal voices of support came from Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and the PPP”.
 
 

Ali Shah Bacha criticised not only the PML-N but also the PTI’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for what he called its failure to help flood victims despite being in power in the province for the past 12 years. He said the floods in KP were different in nature from those in Punjab and Sindh, as they were caused by cloudbursts that wiped out entire villages and caused hundreds of deaths.
“The prime minister and the chief minister came for just one day, distributed cheques and left,” Mr Bacha said, terming the role of both the federal and provincial governments in rescue and relief efforts “disappointing”.
“The Punjab chief minister says they do not need the PPP’s advice. But when the PML-N government is in trouble, it remembers the PPP and its leadership. When the PML-N wants votes on a bill, it turns to Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari,” he added.
“If Maryam Nawaz is the daughter of Nawaz Sharif, then don’t forget that Bilawal Bhutto is the son of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto and the grandson of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,” he remarked.
Flood losses survey
The Punjab government launched a survey to assess the losses suffered by people in the province due to recent floods, but refrained from giving any timeline for completing the exercise or for the start of compensation payments to the more than four million affected residents.
“Some 2,200 survey teams comprising 10,000 members of Pakistan Army, revenue, agriculture and livestock departments and district administration will carry out the survey. Full compensation to the affected families — Rs1 million for a completely destroyed house, Rs500,000 for a partially damaged house, Rs500,000 for loss of livestock, and Rs20,000 per acre (up to 12 acres) for farmers — will be provided based on the survey report,” Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said at the launch of the Punjab Flood Survey Campaign.
“We will make sure that every single flood victim is compensated and resettled. These survey teams are my eyes, ears and hands,” she said, administering an oath to the survey teams, whom she described as the “sons and daughters of Punjab”.
Indirectly responding to criticism from the PTI and PPP over what they termed her ‘flood photo/video shoot,’ the chief minister said: “If someone is working, the camera should show it because the public deserves to know what its CM is doing. We don’t seek the camera as the real work is happening, it speaks for itself.”
She said Punjab was working while other provinces were busy criticising it. The chief minister said she was often asked how she coped with criticism. “I say Punjab is progressing and that is why criticism exists. We close our ears to negativity and keep our eyes fixed on the goal,” she remarked, adding that people from other provinces wished to live in Punjab.
She thanked Pir Pagara for appreciating Punjab’s flood management.
The CM criticised the PPP for suggesting the use of the BISP database to help flood-affected people. “Distributing Rs10,000 to each flood-affected person through BISP data will do no good,” she said.
The PPP leadership, including MNA Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, had urged the Punjab government to use BISP data instead of undertaking a lengthy survey to provide immediate relief to flood victims.
Tensions over loan remarks
As the dispute between the two coalition partners over the BISP issue continued, senior PPP leader Nadeem Afzal Chan said on X: “Punjab has emerged as the biggest borrower among all provinces, securing a staggering Rs405 billion loan from the State Bank in just the first 38 days (July 1 to August 8, 2025) of the current fiscal year (2025-26).”
Responding to the claim, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari threatened to sue Mr Chan under defamation laws and the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
“Chan Sahib, you were a decent man, but for the past few days it seems you are either under mental stress or deliberately running fake propaganda against Punjab,” she said, emphasising that the facts about the loan issue had already been shared with the media on Aug 26. “Now repeating this false narrative falls under Peca.” Ms Bokhari added that under the Punjab Defamation Bill, Mr Chan would have to prove the “fabricated news” in court.

But Rousseau mostly spoke about a ‘civil religion’, and not a traditional, revealed faith. Civil religion functions like a belief system by ‘sacralising’ ideas that are secular. 
Rousseau was writing during a period when pre-modern Christianity was receding. It had begun to be viewed by most European thinkers as exploitative, myopic and a hindrance to the advancement of ‘new knowledge’ derived from empiricism and rationalism. 
This critique was not only coming from staunch secularists alone, but also from Christian reformists. Yet, even the most secular thinkers agreed that faith was important to keep societies from spiralling into spiritual anxiety and chaos. Rousseau’s idea of civil religion, therefore, became increasingly influential across the 19th and 20th centuries. Concepts like the nation and the state began being given a sacred status and rituals. 
These rituals borrowed symbolic elements from traditional religions but reframed and reinterpreted them. For example, sacralisation in this regard often constitutes national holidays, flag-raising ceremonies, pledges of allegiance, remembrance days and memorial services for historical events or figures etc. These are ritualised in a way to evoke emotions as rituals of traditional faiths do. 

Secular ideas, when imbued with sacred meaning, turn politics into a ‘moral mission’ and reshape democracy’s character in the process

Civic religion eventually gave birth to the ‘sacralisation of politics.’ Politics is inherently amoral. It is largely invested in the interest of the self or the nation, and is often unconstrained by moral judgement when pursuing these interests. But the gradual sacralisation of the body politic sacralised the amorality of politics as well. 
According to the researcher Bilge Yabanc, many political parties have transformed politics into a religious-like mission by infusing secular entities — such as the nation, the state and the leader — with sacred meaning. Some of the first major consequences of this process were rather drastic. They produced political forces that wanted to be the only ones in the picture. 
Early examples in this regard include the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the National Fascist Party in Italy, the Nazi Party in Germany, the Movimiento Nacional in Spain and, later, Mao Zedong’s Communist Party of China. 
According to the British historian Paul Jackson, these created new symbols and rituals to evoke belief in a higher cause (related to the state). This was to be navigated by a ‘visionary’ leader shaped by a ‘cult of personality.’ In 1952, the German-American political scientist Waldemar Gurian wrote that the totalitarian movements which rose after World War I “were fundamentally religious movements, based on a new conception of faith.” Political scientists began to refer to this conception as “political religion” (not to be confused with religious politics). 
Jackson wrote that a utopian vision is at the core of a political religion. It is treated as a messianic mission, binding leaders and followers together in a shared project. It develops new rituals that make a charismatic individual the personification of the mission. He/she also personifies a wider mythology that allows societies to engage in activities that express their collective belief in the sacred cause espoused by the new ‘faith’. But sacralisation of politics doesn’t always produce totalitarian outcomes. It is very much present in democracies as well. 



 
In developed as well as developing democracies, too, the nation-state continues to be treated as a sacred entity, and serving it is viewed as a sacred purpose. Ever since the 2000s, populist leaders have been the main outcomes of the sacralisation of politics. According to Yabanc, they present themselves as saviours, and their pronouncements are given a quasi-religious significance, demanding uncritical devotion from followers. 
This is quite apparent in Narendra Modi’s India, Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s Turkey, Donald Trump’s America and Benjamin Netanyahu’s Israel, as it was in Jair Bolsonaro’s Brazil and Imran Khan’s Pakistan. Their political agendas were framed as being of utmost moral importance. To Yabanc, politics has increasingly become an expression of a ‘spiritual’ mission.
Twentieth century totalitarian ideas — Stalinism, Nazism, Fascism and Maoism — were extreme outcomes of the sacralisation of politics. Less monolithic versions of the same were already present in almost every country. Initially, sacralisation sought to replace traditional beliefs with more modern and pluralistic identity markers. It tried to formulate beliefs and rituals to fill the gaps left behind by the receding traditional beliefs. Interestingly, during this process, the idea of democracy too was sacralised.
After the Second World War, when ‘political religions’ such as  German Nazism and Italian Fascism collapsed, democracy was presented by the West as a more sober and rational idea. But the fact is, it was already in the process of being sacralised. As far back as 1934, the American philosopher John Dewey was trying to find “a moral and spiritual motivation for democracy.”
During the Cold War (1945-91), the tendency to treat democracy with great reverence intensified. It was elevated to having superior moral authority, especially in opposition to Soviet communism. As long as there was a ‘totalitarian’ Soviet Union, the sacralised idea of democracy continued to gain traction as an ideal system that guaranteed the construction of free and ethically and morally sound societies.
This sacralised perception of democracy reached its peak after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. But, according to the British-American sociologist Michael Mann, in the absence of a communist ‘other’, democracy turned on itself, especially when its sacralised sides became entry points for populists to storm the corridors of mainstream power. 
They began shaping a “moral majoritarianism” that undermines institutions, creates polarisation, justifies authoritarian behaviour, and cultivates a following that is encouraged to undermine critical thinking for a greater cause — causes such as the establishment of a white Anglo-Saxon Christian state in the US, or a ‘kingdom of God’ in Brazil, a ‘Riyasat-i-Madina’ in Pakistan and an entirely white Europe etc.  
In the early 2000s, many political scholars began to speak about a “post-secular world” and the “return of religion.” But the fact is, secularism began to erode when secularists themselves began to sacralise secular entities. As the American political scientist Anna Grzymala-Busse correctly posits, it was the sacralisation of politics that “buttressed popular religiosity and attitudes and empowered religious organisations in influencing policy across a wide range of domains.” 
The so-called return of religion was the outcome of the sacralisation of multiple secular ideas. This ploy eventually ate up what it was trying to make more widely accepted: secularism.

The show of force by the government came as the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC) escalated its campaign, vowing to shut down the region to protest what it calls the decades-long denial of fundamental rights. 
In Muzaffarabad, Shaukat Nawaz Mir, a core member of the action committee, toured several neighbourhoods with colleagues and dozens of followers. 
“Let it be clear once again: we are not running a campaign against any ideology or institution, but for the bona fide rights of our people that have been denied for over seven decades under one or the other pretext,” he told a cheering crowd in Plate.  

Traders vow to keep shops open

“The lockdown will send a loud and clear message that enough is enough. Either grant the rights or face the wrath of the people.” 
He said the lockdown was plan A, while the alliance had also prepared plans B and C. “And plan D,” he warned, “is the harshest.” 
While the government has not publicly outlined its strategy for the Sept 29 event, officials said strict security measures have been established.  
On Saturday, large convoys of vehicles carrying armed police and paramilitary personnel conducted flag marches in almost all district headquarters. Heavy contingents were also deployed at city entry and exit points, with strict surveillance at sensitive sites. 
Separately, traders’ associations announced they would forgo their  weekly holiday and keep shops open on Sunday to allow citizens to  purchase essential food and household items ahead of the planned  lockdown. 
At the Muzaffarabad  meeting, Divisional Commissioner Chaudhry Guftar Hussain noted that  federal and AJK ministers had already held “open-hearted” dialogue with  the JKJAAC but stressed that peace must be ensured collectively.  “Disorder and lawlessness benefit no one,” he remarked. 
District  Magistrate Mudasser Farooq, speaking at the same meeting, warned that no  one would be allowed to disrupt public life or free movement. 
“Maintaining  peace is a shared responsibility of the administration, police, and  citizens,” he said. “We have no quarrel with anyone, but our mission of  public service will continue at all costs.” He added that safeguarding state property, including vehicles and machinery, was the “foremost duty of all employees.”

Addressing a PTI rally in Peshawar, he said, “We will not allow any operation and do not support it … Federal government, listen. The KP government does not support operation or displacement.”
Gandapur called on the “federal institutions” to talk to Afghanistan and resolve the issue of terrorism in the country.
 






“We don’t want war and we will raise our voice against it,” he added.
Gandapur has been shifting positions on the matter.
In July, he said in a heavily-edited video message that the armed for­ces were in the province at the request of the KP government and should be treated as “guests” and with respect.
This came in complete contrast to another video statement issued by him following a PTI parliamentary meeting a day ago, in which he said that innocent civilians were martyred in a military offensive launched against militants in Bajaur district. He added that such operations had a negative impact and eroded trust between people and the forces.
Meanwhile, the PTI remained opposed to military action.
More recently on Tuesday, he said that mortar shelling, drone strikes and using fighter jets against terrorists was the constitutional right of the military and that the provincial government could not stop it.
Gandapur calls for justice
At the rally today, the KP CM also urged the judiciary to serve justice in line with the Constitution. “Deliver justice to Imran Khan, his wife and the people,” Gandapur said.
The CM further stated that PTI’s struggle for ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ would continue until it achieved success.
Addressing army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, he said, “It is obligatory on you to play your role and sort out Imran’s issue” just as the PTI founder had played his role during the May conflict with India asked the people to stand with the armed forces.
Earlier the rally, PTI leader Faisal Javed announced that “video messages” from Imran would be played at the rally.
 






“In a while, Imran Khan will speak to you on this screen, Peshawar,” he said.
Later, a video of an address by Imran was played, but it seemed to be from a previous public gathering.
 






Party leader Azam Swati also addressed the gathering and vowed to stand tall and “continue to bear cruelty and barbarity” until Imran’s release from jail. He expressed the hope that Imran would soon come out of jail and lead the country towards development, prosperity and peace.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan lauded the party’s followers for standing together during the brief war with India in May.
“This is the eighth rally since the elections and Pakistan has changed greatly since February 8,” he said. “In May, despite (Imran) Khan sahib being wrongfully imprisoned and not allowed to see his family, you stood with the rest of Pakistan and defeated our thuggish enemies.”
Gohar added that the PTI lost its mandate in these elections, but said that Imran was confident the courts would restore it. However, he continued that “the 26th Constitutional Amendment killed that hope”.
“Our rally is not a power show. The world is saying that 90 per cent of people are in favour of Khan sahib — 200 million people rise at his call,” the PTI chairman said. “They want to demand one thing: this rally is for us to raise our voices and show our concerns. Injustice in one place means injustice will be everywhere.”
Quoting Imran, Gohar demanded free courts, a strong parliament and democracy.
“It is your duty to hear our voice,” he emphasised, addressing the government. “Do not silence the voice of 90pc of our people; end injustice, end military operations; end these wrongful convictions. We want justice. We have approached the courts for it and will continue to fight for it.”
He closed out his speech with a message from the PTI founder: “I will not compromise or make deals, I will not bend and I will remain in this country. But as long as I am here, I will stand up and live my life and will not let my country bend the knee.”
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram delivered a fiery speech branding the federal government “thieves and killers” and slamming the Punjab government’s flood relief efforts.
“Today, [Imran] Khan has called you all here … it is his rally. This is a rally for a man who has been stripped of his rights and locked in prison for standing for the right thing and sacrificing for future generations,” Akram said, addressing the crowd.
“He endures every problem, mistreatment and 22-hour isolation, but remains standing in the face of it all.”
The party spokesperson said that if there were true freedom, PTI figures including Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Ahmed Bachar, Aliya Hamza, Ayesha Bhutta, Khadija Shah, Zartaj Gul, Dr Yasmin Rashid and Sanam Javed would not have been “jailed for 10 years”.
“Why did this happen? Because there is no true freedom. This is a government of slaves, thieves and mandate stealers,” Akram declared. “If there were true freedom, what happened to the flood victims at the hands of this shameless government would not have happened.
“Look at what the KP government — Imran Khan’s government — has done: we disbursed billions to flood victims and rehabilitation has started. In Punjab, [Punjab Chief Minister] Maryam Nawaz has not even completed the initial survey. She is a liar, chasing photo-ops.”
Akram impressed on the crowd that “these people are not your leaders”.
“They are thieves and killers; they murdered your vote. Will you endorse these murderers? Will you condemn them?”
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja took to the stage, emphasising that his party will not end its struggle until the “system of oppression” is brought down.
“I was sitting with Imran Khan in Adiala Jail. I asked him what message he has for you all. He said: ‘Tell my nation that I will never bend before hardship. I am in jail because I value every drop of blood my nation sheds’,” Raja said.
“Today, KP is drenched in blood: ours, the innocents and that of our martyrs. Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan are all drenched in blood. Oppression is everywhere.”
Raja paid tribute to martyrs, stating that “their mothers’ tears are our tears”.
“The martyrs of Tirah ask when this system of oppression will end,” he declared, referring to those affected by a recent airstrike in KP’s Tirah area. “I bring a message from Imran Khan: our struggle, our movement, will only end when the oppression does.”
Raja then demanded the release of the PTI founder, as well as other party leaders and activists, who he said were “imprisoned without rights” and given “false punishments by military tribunals”.
 






PTI stalwart Asad Qaiser said that the people of KP demand only one thing and that is peace.
“We will not allow military operations in our province under any circumstances,” he emphasised. “We are tired of wars; we will not be a part of one.”
Qaiser also demanded that the federal government settle matters with Afghanistan through diplomatic channels and jirgas.
“We in KP and Afghanistan share deep relations, so we want trade and relations so that there is peace and jobs in our province,” he stated. “I am hopeful that Ali Amin Gandapur will convince this ‘Form 47’ federal government to do so.”
The PTI leader and ex-national assembly speaker noted that there needs to be peace in this region.
“We appreciate the Saudi pact, but if this country is going to progress, then it needs to establish trade relations with regional nations.”
 






Rally arrangements
According to information shared by the PTI on social media, party workers and supporters have reached Peshawar from across the country to participate in the rally.
While television channels did not air it, the PTI employed social media to broadcast the event online.
Earlier, a statement issued by the office Peshawar Chief Capital Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmed detailed the security and traffic plan ahead of the rally.
The statement read that 1,451 police personnel would be deployed as part of security arrangements and sniper shooters would be stationed on the roofs of the buildings round the rally’s venue.
Meanwhile, 508 traffic personnel would be deployed at different spots under the traffic plan, the statement said.
Several PTI leaders visited the rally’s venue and examined arrangements before the event. They included Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan and PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar.
Ahead of the gathering, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said on Friday that the party’s rally in Peshawar would raise a strong voice across the country against lawlessness, constitutional violations and restrictions on freedom of speech.

Under fire after two comprehensive losses at the hands of India in the ongoing Asia Cup, the Green Shirts proved they were good enough to make it to the tournament’s final when they edged Bangladesh by 11 runs in their last Super Four outing on Thursday and all that matters now for the side are the title honours.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Dubai, Salman said: “Every individual has their own way. If a player wants to be aggressive, then why not? If you take aggression away from a fast bowler, then there’s nothing left.”
 
 

He was responding to an Indian journalist’s question about his responsibility as captain to keep his players’ actions in check.
“Every player knows how to deal with their emotions. I give the players a free hand unless they are disrespecting someone or causing disrespect to our country,” the Pakistani skipper added.
Speaking on the refusal of customary post-match handshakes by the Indian men’s team, Salman said: “I’ve been playing since 2007, I’ve never seen teams not shake hands … I don’t think there has been an instance of players not shaking hands.”
He added that on previous occasions, even under worse circumstances between the two countries, handshakes still took place.
The Pakistan captain added that he hoped that his team had “saved their best for the final”.
Asked about media reports from across the border that the Indian captain had refused to attend the captains’ photoshoot ahead of the final, Salman said: “That’s their choice, we have our own protocols to follow.
“If he (Yadav) wants to attend, he can attend — but if he doesn’t want to, then that’s up to him.”
On Friday, India captain Suryakumar Yadav was found guilty by the ICC of breaching the code of conduct for his comments that alluded to the brief military conflict between India and Pakistan this year, after their group stage match in the Asia Cup on September 14, ESPNcricinfo reported.
“It is understood Suryakumar’s not-guilty plea was rejected by ICC match referee Richie Richardson and that he was fined 30pc of his match fee. India have appealed against the verdict,” the publication reported.
The move came after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) lodged an official complaint with the ICC against Yadav for dedicating its September 14 win over Pakistan to “the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack”.
At least 24 people had been killed in the April attack, which led to a brief military escalation between India and Pakistan, as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence.
“The PCB had demanded the ICC impose a Level 4 sanction — reserved for the most serious breaches of the ICC Code of Conduct — on Suryakumar. It cited past examples of players who were either prevented from what was deemed political messaging or fined for deploying it,” the ESPNcricinfo report added.
Pakistan’s pacer Haris Rauf and opener Sahibzada Farhan were also reprimanded by the ICC for gestures made during the Asia Cup Super Four stage match against India, ESPNCricinfo added.
According to the publication, the pacer was fined 30 per cent of his match fee by match referee Richie Richardson. At the same time, “It is understood that Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan was not fined and let off with a warning by Richardson“.
Pakistan won by 11 runs after stumbling to 135-8 in the virtual semi-final against Bangladesh in their men’s Asia Cup Super Four fixture at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.
With that win, the Green Shirts booked their final date with archrivals India for the first time in the 17th iteration of the Asia Cup on Sunday.</p><small>2025-09-27 16:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/2717454227c4b28.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944978/lpg-tanker-with-24-pakistanis-aboard-attacked-by-israeli-drone-at-yemen-port-mohsin-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>LPG tanker with 24 Pakistanis aboard attacked by Israeli drone at Yemen port: Mohsin Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday that a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tanker with 27 crew members, including 24 Pakistanis, was attacked by an Israeli drone while it was docked at a port in Yemen earlier this month.
After the Foreign Office (FO) said earlier today that Pakistanis aboard the LPG tanker were safe and sound and making their way out of Yemeni waters, Naqvi posted on X that the vessel was attacked on September 17 while it was docked at the Ras Issa port, which was under the control of Houthi rebels.
 






Israel has launched repeated attacks on Houthi targets during the Gaza conflict, as the Iran-backed rebels fire missiles and drones at Israel and Red Sea shipping, claiming solidarity with the Palestinian cause.
According to Naqvi, apart from Pakistanis, the LPG tanker’s crew included two Sri Lankans and a Nepali. He said the vessel’s captain was also a Pakistani.
Naqvi added that an LPG tank had exploded following the attack, but the crew managed to extinguish the fire.
“The vessel was subsequently stopped by Houthi boats and the crew were held hostage aboard the ship,” he said, adding that the tanker and its crew “have now been released by the Houthis and are out of Yemeni waters”.
Naqvi said he was “profoundly grateful to Secretary Interior Khurram Agha and other MOI (Ministry of Interior) officers, Ambassador Naveed Bokhari and his team in Oman, our colleagues in Saudi Arabia, and especially the officials of our security agencies who worked day and night under extraordinary conditions to secure the safe release of our citizens when hope was fading”.
Earlier, the FO said 24 Pakistani nationals aboard the vessel were safe and sound and making their way out of Yemeni waters.
The FO also said that the tanker had caught fire off the coast of Yemen on September 17, adding that upon receiving the news about the incident, the relevant Pakistan embassies had established contacts with the authorities in Yemen to ensure the well-being of the crew.
“Efforts were made to set the tanker underway again,” it added.
The FO further stated that diplomatic missions also maintained contact with the family members of the Pakistani crew and kept them updated about the latest situation.
“Today, the LPG tanker has departed [from the] port and is making [its] way out of Yemeni waters. The entire crew, including Pakistani nationals, on board is safe and sound,” it said.</p><small>2025-09-27 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/625810-lpg-tanker-carrying-24-pakistanis-released-by-houthis-mohsin-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>24 Pakistani hostages, LPG tanker released by Houthis: Mohsin Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>
