The April 22 attack killed 26 men, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
“Pakistan has successfully shot down an Indian quadcopter along the Line of Control, thwarting a violation of its airspace,” state-run Radio Pakistan and PTV News reported, citing security sources.
 


Specifying the location, security sources said the “enemy attempted to conduct surveillance using a quadcopter” in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district in AJK.
“The Pakistan Army, through timely action, foiled this nefarious attempt by the enemy,” the report added.
The security sources termed the incident a “clear testimony to the vigilance, professional skill and defensive preparedness of the Pakistan Army”.
“The Pakistan Army is always ready to give an immediate and effective response to any aggression from the enemy,” the report read, adding that the entire nation stood “united with the armed forces to give a befitting response to the enemy on every front”.
The development comes as Indian and Pakistani soldiers reportedly traded fire along the LoC for a fifth straight night, after four years of relative calm.
The Indian army said its soldiers and Pakistani forces fired at each other overnight. There was no immediate confirmation from Pakistan.
India said that overnight from Monday to Tuesday, the gunfire took place in areas opposite the Kupwara and Baramulla districts in held Kashmir, as well as in the Akhnoor sector.
There were no reports of casualties.
In the latest of this heated debate, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif yesterday said Pakistan was ready for any incursion by India.
 
 

“We have reinforced our forces because it is something which is imminent now. So in that situation, some strategic decisions have to be taken, so those decisions have been taken,” Asif told Reuters.
He said the military had briefed the government on the possibility of an Indian attack, but did not go into further details on his reasons for thinking an incursion was imminent.
In an interview with Samaa TV, Asif warned there was a “war looming on the horizon”, and later told Geo News that the “next two to three days were crucial”.
Since the Pahalgam attack, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other.
India on April 23 unilaterally suspended the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — a water-sharing agreement that was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.
The next day, Pakistan retaliated by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights. The National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad also called on India to “refrain from its reflexive blame game”.
India has said today (Tuesday) is the deadline for Pakistani citizens to leave.
Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. Analysts say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.
UAE joins chorus favouring Pak-India dialogue
Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates has joined other countries in stressing the importance of “promoting dialogue” to defuse tensions between arch-rivals India and Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
UAE Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in a phone call with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar today, discussed the recent regional situation and matters of mutual concern, the Foreign Office (FO) said on X.
Dar apprised the UAE official of the decisions made by Pakistan’s National Security Committee last week in response to “India’s unfounded allegations, inflammatory rhetoric and unilateral actions”.

The UAE deputy PM “emphasised the importance of upholding regional stability, promoting dialogue, exercising restraint and peaceful resolution of disputes”, according to the FO.
“Reaffirming the strong fraternal ties between Pakistan and the UAE, both leaders committed to maintaining close coordination and consultations in light of [the] evolving regional situation.”
Both deputy premiers also expressed their countries’ resolve to “enhance bilateral cooperation and advance shared objectives of peace, stability, and sustainable development”, the FO stated.
Other friendly countries and global powers have also sought de-escalation of tensions between Pakistan and India — including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Turkiye, and Qatar.
 
 

Yesterday, China said it hoped the two sides would “exercise restraint, meet each other halfway, properly handle relevant differences through dialogue and consultation, and jointly maintain regional peace and stability”.
Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also called for a swift de-escalation of the brewing crisis, Anadolu Agency reported on Monday.
“We want the escalating tensions between Pakistan and India to be de-escalated as soon as possible, before they evolve into a more serious situation,” Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting in Ankara.
“Türkiye emphasises at every opportunity that we do not want new conflicts in our region and beyond,” he stressed.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint” so that issues can be “resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.
Iran has already offered to mediate, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”. US President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed tensions, saying the dispute will get “figured out, one way or another”.

“We are working to bring the [online] taxi system in Karachi under one umbrella in an integrated and modern manner,” the statement quoted Memon as having said while chairing a meeting of the transport department.
Memon added that these services will be organised under one umbrella so that safe, standard and legal facilities can be provided to passengers.
The minister’s spokesperson Husain Mansoor, speaking to Dawn.com, said, “All online taxi services like Careem, Yango would be brought under one system.”
The statement added that Special Assistant to the Sindh Chief Minister on Investment and Public-Private Partnership Qasim Naveed Qamar, Transport Secretary Asad Zamin, and Sindh Mass Transit Authority Managing Director Kamal Dayo also attended the meeting.
The senior minister added that providing quality, safe and environment-friendly travel facilities to the citizens of Karachi is a top priority.
Memon also spoke about taking steps to introduce an electric vehicle (EV) taxi service in Karachi.
“The launch of an EV taxi service will not only improve the city’s taxi system but will also significantly reduce environmental pollution.”
The meeting also considered various models of providing EV taxi vehicles to the public on easy instalments, according to the press release.
Speaking about an earlier announcement by the Sindh government about providing pink scooters to women free of cost, Memon said that rapid progress was being made in this regard to provide women with ease of transport facilities.
“Double-decker buses for the transport sector [in Karachi] will arrive by June this year. A large batch of new buses is expected in late June or early July,” he added.
The senior minister added that in the budget for the upcoming financial year, efforts will be made to allocate maximum funds for the purchase of new buses for commuters.
Earlier in February, the Sindh cabinet had approved the procurement of 50 more electric buses for Karachi, including 15 double-deckers, and 1,000 pink electric motorcycles for women.</p><small>2025-04-29 08:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2911483708b5d1b.jpg?r=123714' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907327/pakistan-tells-un-it-has-credible-evidence-of-regional-adversaries-sponsoring-jaffar-express-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan tells UN it has credible evidence of ‘regional adversaries’ sponsoring Jaffar Express attack</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Mission to the United Nations on Tuesday said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the Jaffer Express attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”, according to a press release.
The Jaffar Express train was hijacked on March 11 when Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages.
Security forces launched a two-day operation, concluding on March 12. Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that all 33 terrorists were neutralised, but no hostages were harmed in the final rescue phase.
During the launch of the “Victims of Terrorism Association Network”, Jawad Ajmal, a counsellor at the Pakistan Mission, emphasised that the international community has a responsibility to support survivors of brutal terrorist attacks and the families of victims whose lives were permanently altered by such tragedies.
He underscored the need for collective action to prevent future attacks, calling for holding terrorists and their handlers accountable and adopting a “uniform, victim-centric approach”.
“If we are to chart a way forward for victims, we must look beyond narrow political interests and geopolitical agendas. We must examine why, despite global strategies, terrorism threats continue to proliferate and give rise to an ever-increasing number of victims,” he stated.
“Pakistan unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including right-wing extremism, Islamophobia, racially and ethnically motivated terrorism, and, above all, state-sponsored terrorism.”
Ajmal stressed that the world must address the root causes of terrorism and the conditions conducive to its spread. He also emphasised the importance of distinguishing terrorism from legitimate struggles for self-determination.
The counsellor highlighted the “need to address state-sponsored terrorism and underscored the necessity of reaching a consensual definition of terrorism that reflects emerging trends”.
“He added that challenges arising from the use of new tools — such as social media and the dark web — to deepen divisions and incite violence must also be combated,” the press release read.
He further called for efforts to counter disinformation campaigns designed to spread hate speech, xenophobia, and Islamophobia.
Ajmal highlighted that the international community owes a moral and legal obligation to victims of terrorism to take effective, impartial steps to suppress terrorism wherever it exists and in whatever form.
“The more terrorism there is, the more victims there will be,” he noted.
Speaking on the recent Pahalgam attack, Ajmal expressed concern at the loss of tourist lives in the incident. He said that we extend our heartfelt condolences to the near ones of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery.
He noted that Pakistan joined fellow UN Security Council members in condemning the attack.
The counsellor further said that Pakistan has been one of the worst victims of terrorism for over two decades. With the loss of more than 80,000 lives and thousands more injured, Pakistan remains inspired by the resilience and strength of its nation.
“We pay tribute to the families of the martyrs from our law enforcement agencies and armed forces, who have made countless sacrifices to defend our motherland,” he added.
Last month, the Foreign Office said that the perpetrators of the attack on the Jaffar Express remained in touch with their handlers in Afghanistan throughout the incident.
During the briefing, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan was asked whether Pakistan had shifted its stance when it said that Afghanistan, and not India, was behind the terrorist attacks on Pakistan. He clarified that there was “no shift” in policy. “The facts have not changed. India is involved in sponsoring terrorism against Pakistan. What I was referring to was, in this particular incident, we have evidence of calls being traced to Afghanistan. This is what I said,” he said.
A day later, the DG ISPR called India the “main sponsor” of terrorism in Balochistan.
Lt Gen Chaudhry, who maintained that India was the main sponsor of terrorism in Balochistan, said the terrorists had used Afghan and foreign weapons in the recent incident and previous attacks. “We must understand that in this terrorist incident in Balochistan, and others before, the main sponsor is your eastern neighbour [India].”</p><small>2025-04-29 07:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602329-heatwave-grips-sindh-rain-expected-in-early-may' target='_blank'><strong>Heatwave grips Sindh, rain expected in early May</strong></a><br><p>

Electricity had been restored to more than 90 per cent of mainland Spain early on Tuesday, the REE power operator said. Lights came on again in Madrid and in Portugal’s capital.
Barely a corner of the peninsula, which has a joint population of almost 60 million people, escaped the blackout. But no firm cause for the shutdown has yet emerged, though wild rumours spread on messaging networks about cyber attacks.
Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said the source of the outage was “probably in Spain”. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said “all the potential causes” were being analysed and warned the public “not to speculate” because of the risk of “misinformation”.
Sanchez said about 15,000 megawatts of electricity, more than half of the power being consumed at the time, “suddenly disappeared” in about five seconds.
He was unable to say when power would be completely restored in Spain and warned that some workers would have to stay home on Tuesday. Montenegro said Portugal’s power would be back “within hours”.
Power was restored overnight to around 6.2m households in Portugal out of 6.5m, according to the national electricity grid operator.
The outage rippled briefly into southwest France while Morocco saw disruption to some internet providers and airport check-in systems.
People were “stunned”, according to Carlos Candori, a 19-year-old construction worker who had to exit the paralysed Madrid metro system. “This has never happened in Spain”.
“There’s no (phone) coverage, I can’t call my family, my parents, nothing: I can’t even go to work,” he told AFP.
Cash queues
In Madrid and cities across Spain and Portugal, panicked customers rushed to withdraw cash from banks, and streets filled with crowds floundering for a phone signal. Long lines formed for taxis and buses.
With stop lights knocked out, police struggled to keep densely congested traffic moving and authorities urged motorists to stay home.
In Madrid alone 286 rescue operations were carried out to free people trapped in lifts, regional authorities said.
Trains were halted across the country and on Tuesday morning, three trains were still stranded in Spain with passengers onboard, according to Transport Minister Oscar Puente.
Several high-speed rail lines are expected to resume normal service, including between Madrid-Barcelona and Madrid-Valencia, but disruptions remain between Barcelona-Alicante and between Madrid-Galicia (northwest), Puente wrote on X.
Railway stations in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia, Seville and four other major cities were kept open all night so that stranded passengers could sleep there.
Spain’s nuclear power plants automatically went offline as a safety precaution, with diesel generators maintaining them in a “safe condition”, the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council said.
Serious disruption
Sanchez said the blackout, which hit just after midday, caused “serious disruption” for millions and “economic losses in businesses, in companies, in industries”.
The European Commission said it was in contact with Spain and Portugal over the crisis. European Council President Antonio Costa said on X: “There are no indications of any cyberattack”.
 






The huge power cut disrupted flights to and from Madrid, Barcelona and Lisbon, European air traffic organisation Eurocontrol said.
France affected
Transport chaos also gripped Spain’s second city, Barcelona, where locals and tourists alike flooded the streets in an attempt to find out what had happened.
Student Laia Montserrat left school when the lights went out.
“As the internet wasn’t coming back, they told us to go home… [but] there weren’t trains either,” she told AFP. “Now we don’t know what to do.”
The internet activity monitoring site Netblocks told AFP the blackout caused a “loss of much of the country’s digital infrastructure”. It said web connections plunged to just 17pc of normal usage.
Spain’s El Pais newspaper reported that hospitals used back-up generators to keep critical wards going, but some units were left without power.
Massive blackouts have affected other countries around the world in recent years.
Huge outages struck Tunisia in September 2023, Sri Lanka in August 2020, and Argentina and Uruguay in June 2019. In July 2012, India experienced a vast blackout.
In Europe, in November 2006, 10m people were left without power for an hour in France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. That was caused by a failure in Germany’s grid.</p><small>2025-04-29 06:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/290931569ed1149.jpg?r=100527' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907317/imf-board-to-meet-on-may-9-to-discuss-pakistans-programmes' target='_blank'><strong>IMF board to meet on May 9 to discuss Pakistan’s programmes</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new $1.3 billion arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme, the global lender said.
According to the Fund’s website, this will be the first “review under the Extended Arrangement Under the Extended Fund Facility”, along with request for an arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
Previously, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb during his visit to Washington had said he also expected the IMF Executive Board to approve in early May.
Approval from the board would trigger the disbursement of a $1bn tranche under the programme, which Pakistan secured in 2024. The IMF programme has played a critical role in stabilising Pakistan’s fragile economy, providing much-needed external financing and boosting market confidence.
Pakis­tan and the IMF had reached a three-year, $7bn aid package deal in July 2024, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
The ongoing 37-month EFF programme consists of six reviews over the life of the bailout, and the release of the next tranche of approximately $1bn will be contingent on the success of the performance review.
In March, Pakistan and the IMF had concluded the first biannual review of the $7bn loan programme on a positive note, without imposing additional revenue measures.
In an end-of-mission statement, mission chief Nathan Porter said: “Programme implementation has been strong, and the discussions have made considerable progress in several areas, including the planned fiscal consolidation to durably reduce public debt, maintenance of sufficiently tight monetary policy to maintain low inflation, acceleration of cost-reducing reforms to improve energy sector viability.”
A separate technical mission from the IMF also visited the country on Pakistan’s request for over $1bn in additional financing for climate resilience.</p><small>2025-04-29 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602320-lawyers-end-sindh-sit-ins-after-cci-rejects-controversial-canals-project' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers end Sindh sit-ins after CCI rejects controversial canals project</strong></a><br><p>

The clash left some protesters as well as the policemen injured.
The protesters, including the young doctors, had announced on Sunday to take out the rally under the banner of the Grand Health Alliance (GHA) and stage a sit-in outside the Chief Minister House.
The young doctors alleged that the police used force, tortured the protesters, including women, and arrested some of them. The police high-ups claimed that the protesters used syringes and knives they had brought from the hospitals, and injured some law enforcers. They said the employees were asked to avoid using the road leading to the high security zone, which led to the physical clash.

YDA stops entry of policemen to all public hospitals

The eyewitnesses said a part of The Mall from Charing Cross to the Alhamra Hall remained the battleground as both sides clashed, throwing the traffic out of gear even on the smaller adjoining arteries. The motorists and the traders faced a great deal of inconvenience in the day-long tense situation. However, a group of the charged protesters managed to reach the Club Chowk where they staged a sit in.
There were reports that the Young Doctors Association Punjab led the Monday’s rally and intensified agitation when the health department terminated and transferred many young medics for instigating the employees of the state-run hospitals for the strike in the outpatient departments (OPDs). YDA Punjab chairman Dr Salman Haseeb and president Dr Shoaib Niazi were also among them who faced terminations and transfers made by the health department.
Following Monday’s tense situation, the YDA Punjab banned the entry of the police personnel to all the government hospitals across the province. It also announced to postpone all kinds of surgeries of the patients and warned to go on strike in the indoor wards of the public hospitals of Punjab.
There were reports that the GHA postponed the agitation at the Club Chowk and reached back to the Charing Cross after Monday evening.
The YDA Punjab president has given a 48 hours deadline to the government to start negotiations with the employees protesting against outsourcing of the state-run hospitals. If the negotiations do not start, the employees would close down all the indoor wards of the public sector hospitals across the province.
Talking to the media persons late on Monday, Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique alleged that the employees of the government hospitals took the law into their hands, used knives and sharp surgical equipment to attack the police.
He said that the young doctors turned violent rather than being peaceful and used the women employees of the hospitals as shields to reach the high-security zone area, which was declared sensitive by the law enforcement agencies following the movement of the international cricketers playing the PSL in Lahore.
After the threats of the YDA, the health minister announced that the professors would run the OPDs from today (Tuesday) as the government would not tolerate interruption of healthcare services to the poor patients.

• Desperate people scramble for food as ‘hunger breaks everything’ in the strip
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli strikes on Monday killed at least 40 people across the Palestinian territory, which has been under an Israeli aid blockade for more than 50 days.
Israel resumed its military campaign in the Gaza Strip on March 18. A ceasefire agreement that had largely halted the fighting for two months before that collapsed over disagreements between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas, which has been calling for a long term ceasfire.
Brazil on Monday called for a “complete withdrawal” of Israeli forces from Gaza and termed Israel’s blocking of aid to the territory “unacceptable.” “The resumption of Israeli bombardments and the continued obstruction of humanitarian aid are unacceptable,” Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira told a meeting of BRICS foreign ministers in Rio de Janeiro.
Civil defence official Moham­med al-Mughayyir said that 40 people had been killed since dawn on Monday. They included eight people who were killed in an Israeli strike on the Abu Mahadi family home in Jabalia, in the north of the territory.
“They were sleeping in their homes, feeling safe, when missiles hit… this scene makes the body shiver,” said Abdul Majeed Abu Mahadi, 67, who added that his brother was killed in the attack.
“If a person looked at this scene, they would have seen children, women and elderly men cut into pieces, it makes the heart ache, but what can we do?” The civil defence agency reported that another 10 people were killed in an Israeli strike on the Al-Ghamari family home in the Al-Sudaniya area northwest of Gaza City.
A strike on the Al-Agha family home killed eight others in an area of Khan Yunis in the south, it added. Fourteen others were killed in four separate strikes across the territory, the civil defence said, including one that hit a tent sheltering displaced people in the Al-Shafii camp, west of Khan Yunis.
The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Monday that at least 2,222 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes, bringing the overall death toll since the conflict broke out to 52,314.
‘Empty-handed’
At the break of dawn, 10-year-old Youssef al-Najjar races barefoot, clutching a battered pot, to a community kitchen in Gaza City, only to find hundreds of others already queueing. “People push and shove out of fear of missing their turn. There are little children who fall,” said Youssef.
Thousands of Gazans, including many children, rush to community kitchens every day in the hope of securing food for their families.
The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has worsened significantly since Israel blocked all aid from entering the territory on March 2.

• Beijing, Washington, Ankara and Doha urge measures to calm tensions as neighbours trade fire across Line of Control
ISLAMABAD: As friends in foreign capitals continue to advocate for a de-escalation of tensions in South Asia, Pakistan’s defence min­ister said the country was ready for any incursion by India.
The two neighbours have been trading fire across the Line of Control (LoC) for four days now, with each blaming the other for provocation.
“We have reinforced our forces because it is something which is imminent now. So in that situation some strategic decisions have to be taken, so those decisions have been taken,” Khawaja Asif told Reuters on Monday.
He said the military had briefed the government on the possibility of an Indian attack, but did not go into further details on his reasons for thinking an incursion was imminent.
His remarks follow New Delhi’s increasingly aggressive posturing following an attack in a tourist resort in India-held Kashmir, which claimed over two dozen lives.
Immediately after the Pah­algam attack, India clai­med two of the suspects were from Pakistan, albeit without proof. Islamabad has flatly denied any role and called for a neutral investigation.
In the interview, Mr Asif said Pakistan was on high alert and that it would only use its arsenal of nuclear weapons if “there is a direct threat to our existence”.
Later, in an interview with Samaa TV, he said, “We should be mentally prepared, there is a war looming on the horizon.”
The channel also quoted him as saying that there was a “vivid possibility” that “we can have war in the next day or two or three or four (sic)”.
 
 

However, he later had to clarify these remarks, telling Geo News: “They (the channel) asked me what the cha­nces of war are, so I said that the next two to three days were crucial.”
“If something has to happen, then it will occur in the next two to four days … otherwise the immediate danger will pass.”
Mr Asif also clarified that his statement should not be misconstrued as a categorical prediction that war would begin within the next two to three days, reiterating that he had only said the “upcoming days would be crucial.”
He reiterated that he had said there was a danger of war breaking out in the next few days but it could also be averted, as other countries in the region were working to avert any contentious situation and de-escalate the matter.
He said that Islamabad had approached friendly countries, including Gulf states and China, and also briefed Britain, the United States and others on the situation.
“Some of our friends in the Arabian Gulf have talked to both sides,” Asif said, without naming the countries.
Over the past week, leaders and officials from China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the UK have been in touch with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar. All of them have urged a de-escalation of tensions.
De-escalation
Meanwhile on Monday, Beijing, Washington, Ankara and Doha also expressed the hope that India and Pakistan will exercise restraint and welcomed all measures that will help cool down the situation.
“China hopes that the two sides will exercise restraint, meet each other halfway, properly handle relevant differences through dialogue and consultation and jointly maintain regional peace and stability,” foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
“China welcomes all measures that will help cool down the situation,” AFP quoted Jiakun as telling a regular press briefing.
Beijing’s call for restraint added to the United States’ statement from Sunday, urging India and Pakistan to work towards what it called a “responsible solution”, as Washington said it was in touch with both countries.
“This is an evolving situation and we are monitoring developments closely. We have been in touch with the governments of India and Pakistan at multiple levels,” a US State Department spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.
“The United States encourages all parties to work together towards a responsible resolution,” the spokesperson added.
In public, the US government has expressed support for India after the attack but has not criticised Pakistan, while President Trump said last week he was confident that both countries would “get it figured out”.
Speaking after a cabinet meeting on Monday, Turkiye President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country also wants a de-escalation between Pakistan and India, Reuters reported.
Separately, speaking to Mr Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, Qatar’s prime minister emphasised the importance of resolving  conflicts through dialogue and diplomacy.
Dar spoke with Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman  Al-Thani as part of Pakistan’s diplomatic outreach to inform allies  about what Islamabad describes as India’s “unsubstantiated allegations,  inflammatory rhetoric, and unilateral measures,” according to a  statement from the Foreign Office.
During the conversation, Al-Thani underscored the imperative of maintaining regional peace and  stability, highlighting the value of diplomatic engagement in addressing  disputes between countries.
Both leaders reaffirmed the strong  bilateral ties between Pakistan and Qatar and agreed to maintain close  coordination and consultations on the evolving regional situation.

The admission comes just days after Moscow confirmed the North’s participation, while Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday heralded the  “feat” of Pyongyang’s troops. South Korean and Western intelligence agencies have long reported that Pyongyang sent more than 10,000 soldiers to help in Kursk last year.
North Korean forces  “participated in the operations for liberating the Kursk areas”, Pyongyang’s Central Military Commission said in the KCNA report. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s decision to deploy the troops, it said, was in accordance with a mutual defence treaty. “They who fought for justice are all heroes and representatives of the honour of the motherland,” Kim said, according to KCNA.
Kim added that a monument to the  “battle feats” would soon be built in the capital, and referred to  “the tombstones of the fallen soldiers”, publicly confirming that North Korean troops had been killed in combat. The country must  “take important national measures to specially honour and care for the families of war veterans”, said Kim.
Russia’s president praised Moscow’s  “Korean friends” for their backing in Kursk. “We appreciate it a lot and are deeply grateful to comrade Kim Jong Un personally… and the North Korean people,” the Kremlin cited Putin as saying. Russian Chief of Staff Valery Gerasimov on Saturday said North Korean soldiers  “provided significant assistance in defeating the group of Ukrainian armed forces”.
South Korea’s Ministry of Defence on Monday said Pyongyang  “has admitted to its own criminal acts” which violate UN Security Council resolutions.
China, North Korea’s key economic benefactor which has repeatedly condemned Western backing for Ukraine, declined to comment specifically on the admission from Pyongyang.

The killing of Aboubakar Cisse on Friday in a village in provincial France caused shock, prompting President Emmanuel Macron to say there was no place for religious hate in French society and Prime Minister Francois Bayrou to denounce an  “Islamophobic” crime.
The suspect, a French national born in Lyon in 2004 and named only as Olivier A.,  “surrendered himself to a police station in Pistoia” near Florence in central Italy on Sunday, Abdelkrim Grini, the prosecutor of the southern city of Ales, said. He had been on the run for three days in the wake of the murder.
“This is very satisfying for me as a prosecutor, said Grini, who is in charge of the case. “Faced with the effectiveness of the measures put in place, the suspect had no option but to hand himself in — and that is the best thing he could have done.”

• New Delhi objects to BBC’s coverage of Pahalgam attack
• Pakistan’s National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team warns media, content creators against sharing sensitive info
KARACHI: The Indian government on Monday banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels belonging to media organisations, freelance journalists, content creators and sportspersons.
The channels were blocked by the Government of India on the recommendations of the Ministry of Home Affairs, The Hindu reported, while quoting a government official.
The channels blocked in India are: Dawn News, Samaa TV, ARY News, Geo News, Bol News, SUNO News HD, Raftar, GNN, Irshad Bhatti, The Pakistan Reference, Samaa Sports, Uzair Cricket, Umar Cheema Exclusive, Asma Shirazi, Muneeb Farooq and Raazi Nama.
The account of former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar’s channel was also banned.
Comedian and content creator  Shehzad Ghias said his podcast channel ‘The Pakistan Experience’ was also banned by the Indian government.
According to Aditi Agarwal, an Indian journalist covering technology, it was unclear under which law the accounts were blocked.
No authority or official in Pakistan has commen­ted on the matter so far.
Any person accessing these channels on YouTube from India sees a message reading they have been blocked due to an “order from the government related to national security or public order”.
Separately, India’s Ministry of External Affairs has objected to BBC’s coverage of the Pahalgam attack, according to The Hindu.
The ministry wrote a letter to Jackie Martin, BBC’s India head, for writing “militants” instead of “terrorists” in one of its reports about the Pahalgam attack.
However, a BBC spokesperson told The Hindu that the broadcaster reported the attack “accurately, impartially and responsibly”.
NCERT advisory
In the wake of escalating geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan, the National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-CERT) has warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.
The advisory issued on Monday said there has been an “uptick in the circulation of videos, images, and commentary revealing troop movements, military deployments, and sensitive national security activities” on social media and public forums.
“ Such disclosures — whether inadvertent or intentional — may severely compromise national security, jeopardise operational effectiveness, and facilitate hostile actions by adversaries,“ said NCERT, responsible for the security of critical digital infrastructure.
The advisory added that disseminating sensitive material may result in a security breach by disclosing the locations and movements of troops.
 
 

It said the unauthorised sharing of mapping coordinates or terrain analysis may also allow hostile forces to “gather open-source intelligence” and assist them in “refining targeting, planning ambushes, or circumventing defences”.
The NCERT also warned that deepfake videos or false narratives “may spark unnecessary alarm or civil unrest”.
The agency recommended that media, freelance journalists and content creators not film or publish information that exposes troop movements, military installations, or logistical activities.
It advised social media users not to engage with or amplify unverified posts regarding military developments and report suspected disinformation and deepfakes.
A day ago, NCERT issued a separate advisory for “heightened vigilance and immediate cybersecurity precautions”.
It warned of a serious risk of state-sponsored cyberattacks targeting government agencies, critical infrastructure, defence, media, finance and individuals within Pakistan.

•  Irfan Siddiqui calls Pahalgam attack ‘false-flag operation’
• Senators warn New Delhi against changes to Indus treaty
ISLAMABAD: The main opposition, PTI, has demanded the release of its incarcerated leader Imran Khan so he can participate in national deliberations on escalating tensions with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The party also called for an immediate multi-party conference (MPC), with Mr Khan in attendance.
The demands were made in the  Senate on Monday, as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle slammed India for suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and fanning war hysteria following the April 22 attack.
Senator Ali Zafar, PTI’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, said political differences should be set aside for an issue of national importance.
He noted that a multi-party conference was the only “correct thing to do in the present circumstances”.
If Mr Khan is allowed to attend such a meeting, Mr Zafar said it would send a signal across the world that Pakistan is united and make the country’s case stronger.
He also criticised Indian PM Narendra Modi’s government and its “Nazi mentality” for fal­sely accusing Pakistan — which is itself a victim of terrorism.
“I want to tell the world that this is a blatant and baseless lie motivated by malice.”
He added New Delhi has a “habit of levelling such allegations” and also called the Indian government an “expert in carrying out false flag operations”.
PTI Senator Shibli Faraz said Mr Khan should be allowed to appear on TV to give a call to people for a public gathering at Minar-i-Pakistan and a march toward the Wagah border with India.
Mr Faraz, the opposition leader in Senate, expressed confidence that “over ten million people” will gather on Mr Khan’s call.
“Only a true representative of the people can give a strong message to India,” he said, warning the enemy “takes advantage of political instability”.
He demanded the release of all “political prisoners” and doing away with the practice of filing false cases against political opponents.
’False-flag operation ’
PML-N Senator Irfanul Haq Siddiqui said the Pahalgam incident was a “false flag operation carried out by the Indian authorities to defame Pakistan”.
 
 

He said India routinely accused Pakistan without any investigation or evidence. “India accused Pakistan within minutes of the Pahalgam incident, but the international community refused to accept their false narrative.”
Senator Siddiqui also raised critical questions about the security situation in India-held Kashmir.
He questioned how a major terrorist attack took place despite the “presence of army checkpoints at every corner and the deployment of one Indian soldier for every seven Kashmiris”.
Mr Siddiqui warned India against carrying out any attack in Pakistan, saying the people were “fully prepared and united to defend the motherland” despite internal political differences.
 


The PML-N senator also referred to growing internal dissent within India, noting that voices from within the country were now questioning PM Modi’s handling of the situation.
The BAP parliamentary leader in the Senate said the Pahalgam attack, which took place in an area with high military presence “clearly exposed that it was a false flag operation”.
He said India was involved in target killings in different countries and was responsible for various terrorist attacks inside Pakistan and there was “irrefutable evidence” of Indian funding to outlawed groups BLA and TTP.
Suspension of IWT
Talking about India’s move to suspend the IWT, Mr Siddiqui said New Delhi cannot unilaterally terminate the agreement.
“The Indus Waters Treaty involves the World Bank as an arbitrator along with several other international institutions. India cannot simply walk away from its obligations,” he stressed.
Senator Zafar of PTI also agreed with Mr Siddiqui saying that India has no right to unilaterally suspend, amend or cancel the treaty.
Mr Zafar, who is also a constitutional expert, said any such action by the Modi government will be “illegal and against the principles of international law”.
He said the announcement by India to suspend the treaty had no legal effect and Pakistan has rejected it.
Calling water a “basic human right”, he warned India that any disruption to the water flows of Pakistan would be “an act of war”.
“We will fight for each drop of water till the last drop of our blood.”

The Indian authorities have demolished nine homes belonging to the families of suspected assailants as part of a crackdown after the April 22 killings of tourists.
“We should not do anything to alienate the people after their spontaneous reaction (against the attack),” Omar Abdullah said at a session of the legislative assembly in Srinagar.
“Guns can only control militancy, not finish it. It will only end when the people are with us. It seems people are now reaching that stage.”
Some Kashmir residents have spoken out against the move by the authorities to destroy homes, like that of Rifat Sheikh.
On Monday, she stood next to her razed kitchen, assessing the damage caused by explosives used by police to demolish the house.
Police say her brother Asif is with the Lashkar-i-Taiba, which New Delhi blamed for the attack.
 
 

Rifat Sheikh said her family had not seen or spoken with Asif after he left home one morning in 2022 on the pretext of going to a market. “Why are they punishing us by destroying our house this way for what they say he has done?” she asked. “We don’t know where he is or what he is doing. This is provocation, but I pray that people remain calm.”
Two police officials say they were acting against homes that “retained connections with militants”.
Nazir Ahmad Wani’s house in Khasipora village was one of the nine homes destroyed so far. Police say his son, Amir Nazir, is a member of the Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit.
Broken pieces of glass lay in the backyard of Wani’s home where he grew maize crops. The roof of the house came down due to impact of the explosives, his relatives said. Amir had left the home in April last year and didn’t return, they added.
“I was kept at the police station all night. They didn’t tell me anything at the time. I only learned of the damage the next morning when I came to the house,” said Wani.

Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja expressed confidence that despite threats from India, the event would be a success.
“The participants include delegations from China, Russia, the United States, Indonesia, Malaysia, and even from South America,” she said. Over 75 foreign investors and CEOs of more than 50 global companies are expected to attend the landmark event, the minister added.
Shaza Fatima also revealed that websites of some ministries had come under cyberattacks from India, but all attempts were thwarted. “The cybersecurity systems in Pakistan are among the best in the world, comparable to even those in Britain and the United States,” she said.
 







Over 100 Pakistani IT firms to showcase products

Highlighting the country’s expanding digital economy, the minister said that over 100 Pakistani IT companies and a large number of startups would present their products and innovative ideas to international investors.
The conference, being organised under the aegis of the Digital Cooperation Organisation (DCO), marks the first-ever DFDI meeting held in Pakistan.
The minister said that agreements with several investors had already been signed, and the prime minister was expected to announce potential investment figures during the event.
Deemah Al Yahya, the secretary general of DCO, will attend the conference as a special guest. Pakistan is also scheduled to assume the presidency of the organisation for the next year.
 
 

“We are working with Saudi Arabia to expand the DCO and aim to bring advanced economies like China into its fold,” Shaza Fatima added.
In reply to a question, she said the government was implementing reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to address investors’ complaints about bureaucratic hurdles.
“We are committed to creating a more business-friendly digital ecosystem, and reforms are being carried out in FBR, as well as in other government departments, to reduce red tape and improve the business environment,” she said.
Speaking about the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), the minister said the council represents a whole-of-government approach and acts as a platform through which the concerns of the IT ministry are easily forwarded to the FBR and other departments.
“We are moving toward establishing a one-stop shop for business services,” she said, adding that the World Bank’s project was being implemented to streamline business processes through digitalisation.
“Our ultimate goal through the National Digital Transformation is to create ease of doing business and attract significant investment into Pakistan’s tech sector,” Shaza Fatima concluded.

• Justice Dogar-led bench sets aside contempt notices, asks how judge can pass order in case he’s not hearing
ISLAMABAD: Ten­sions within the Islam­abad High Court (IHC) escalated sharply on Monday, as two separate but interlinked proceedings exposed a deepening ‘institutional rift’ over judicial authority, procedural conduct and internal accountability.
Earlier in the day, Justice Babar Sattar issued a strongly worded order criticising the registrar office for not listing a case related to the removal of the former director general of Malir Development Authority from the no-fly list.
The judge issued the contempt notices to the heads of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Immi­gration and Passport.
 
 

A division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Sardar Moha­mmad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Asif has already suspended the contempt notices after the penalised government officials filed an intra-court appeal.
The bench also merged the case with another identical matter. Subsequently, the case was not fixed before Justice Sattar on April 28 as was scheduled.
Justice Sattar lambasted the deputy registrar (judicial) for what he described as “prima facie defiance” of court orders.
He noted irregularities in the handling of the intra-court appeal, warning the hearing by the division bench might not have been properly assisted regarding the jurisdiction.
Justice Sattar has summoned court officials to explain why the case was not listed before him and also the removal of his prior orders from the high court’s public database.
The next hearing has been fixed for May 7.
Notices suspended
On the same day, the IHC division bench, comprising Justice Dogar and Justice Asif took a different view of the matter.
Hearing the same appeal, the bench suspended the contempt of court notices issued by Justice Sattar.
It also set aside Justice Sattar’s eight-page order, with acting Chief Justice Dogar questioning the legit­imacy of the proceedings.
“How can he pass an order when he does not have the case?” he asked sharply, suggesting the controversy could spark widespread public attention.
 
 

Later, the bench adjourned the hearing on the intra-court appeal.
The developments have once again highlighted deep fissures within the IHC, as Justice Sattar and acting CJ Dogar are also involved in a legal battle over the seniority of judges in IHC.
Justice Dogar was one of the three judges transferred from other provincial high courts to the IHC in February.

The public broadcaster CBC and other outlets projected the Liberals would form Canada’s next government, but it was not yet clear if they would hold a majority in parliament.
Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre fell short of becoming prime minister, but his party was on track to form a strong opposition in parliament
Trump’s trade war and threats to annex Canada — which he renewed in an election day social media post — outraged Canadians and made dealing with the US a top campaign issue.
 
 

Carney, who had never held elected office and only replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister last month, anchored his campaign on an anti-Trump message.
He previously served as central bank governor in both Britain and Canada and persuaded voters his global financial experience has prepared him to guide Canada through a trade war.
Carney, who also had a lucrative career as investment banker before joining Canada’s public service, promised to expand overseas trading relations to curb Canada’s reliance on the United States.
Carney’s descriptions of the Trump threat have been stark.
“Donald Trump wants to break us so America can own us,” he said during the campaign.
“They want our resources, they want our water, they want our land, they want our country. They can’t have it.”
When the CBC projection was announced, cheers of joy erupted at the Ottawa venue where Liberal supporters were watching the results.
“I’m happy in the sense that we’ve got somebody that can speak to Mr. Trump on his level,” said Dorothy Goubault, 72. “Mr. Trump is a business person. Mr. Carney is a business person, and I think they can both relate.”
Before Trudeau resigned, Trump had mocked him, calling the prime minister “governor” as he urged Canada to become the 51st US state.
Goubault said she expects that mockery to stop.
“It’s not the governor anymore, it’s the prime minister of Canada, and it’s not the 51st state anymore. It’s ‘We are Canada!’”
 


Liberal lawmaker and a member of Carney’s cabinet, Steven Guilbeault, tied the outcome to Trump.
“The numerous attacks by President Trump on the Canadian economy, but not just the economy, on our sovereignty and our very identity, I think have really mobilised Canadians, and I think they saw in Prime Minister Carney someone who has experience on the world stage,” he told the CBC.
Trudeau’s departure
The departure of former prime minister Justin Trudeau was also crucial to the Liberal win, which capped one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history.
On January 6, the day Trudeau announced he would resign, the Conservatives led the Liberals by more than 20 points in most polls, as voter anger over soaring coasts mounted after Trudeau’s decade in power.
But Carney replacing Trudeau, combined with nationwide unease about Trump, transformed the race.
Carney, 60, distanced himself from Trudeau throughout the campaign.
 
 

He said the former prime minister did not focus enough on growing Canada’s economy and scrapped a controversial Trudeau tax on carbon emissions that left many voters seething.
For Poilievre, a 45-year-old who has been in parliament for two decades, the outcome marks a stinging defeat.
He was criticised for the at-times muted anger he directed towards Trump, but said he wanted to keep the focus on domestic concerns that drove Trudeau’s unpopularity.
He tried to persuade voters that Carney would simply offer a continuation of the failed Liberal governance, an argument that fell short.
At the Conservative watch party in Ottawa, Jason Piche told AFP he was surprised by the result.
“I was hoping to have a big celebration tonight,” Piche said.
Nearly 29 million of Canada’s 41 million people were eligible to vote in the massive G7 country that spans six time zones. A record 7.3 million people cast advanced ballots.
Results were still pending on the shape of Canada’s 343 members of parliament, with 172 seats needed for a majority. The Liberals won a majority in 2015 but have governed with a minority since 2019.</p><small>2025-04-29 04:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/290847413f05de0.jpg?r=084752' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907280/govt-seeks-more-time-for-stance-on-right-to-appeal-for-may-9-convicts' target='_blank'><strong>Govt seeks more time for stance on right to appeal for May 9 convicts</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan on Monday requested more time from the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench hearing cases concerning the military trials of civilians to present government’s stance on granting appeal rights to those convicted for their alleged involvement in the May 9, 2023 arson attacks.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, a seven-judge constitutional bench had fixed Monday’s hearing for the AGP to apprise the court about government’s plan to provide right to appeal to the May 9 convicts, after Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman at the previous hearing had informed the bench that the AGP was busy in deliberations with stakeholders, which may take another couple of days.
The bench had taken up a set of 38 intra-court appeals (ICAs) moved by the federal government, provincial governments, Shuhada Forum Balochistan and others against the October 2023 judgement.

Attorney general cites canals controversy, regional tensions as reasons for delay

The next hearing date is May 5.
The AGP explained that the issue of giving the right to appeal to those convicted by the military courts was a policy matter and that he could place any submission before the constitutional bench only after taking proper instructions from the federal government.
Civil system failed?
During the hearing, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail observed that the court had to examine the matter only relevant to the case, though parliament could even take a policy decision that the civil system had failed and send all cases to military courts.
The AGP explained before the constitutional bench that he would advance arguments on three points since senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed who was representing defence ministry had almost covered other points related to the case. Mr Awan explained that he would first provide some details about the May 9 incidents, then dilate upon the assurances he had given to SC at the previous hearing, and lastly his arguments would be about the right to appeal to the May 9 convicts.
Explaining that extending the right to appeal to those who faced military trials was a policy matter, he apprised the court that he could only place the submissions before the court after taking proper instructions on it.
The AGP said the controversial canals issue cropped up and then everyone’s attention was on the prevalent faceoff between India and Pakistan in the wake of Pahalgam terrorist attack. He said he was scheduled to depart for the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Monday but the visit had been cancelled.
 
 

When Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar inquired how much time the AGP would take, he replied that he might take at least 45 minutes.
Earlier in 2023, the AGP had sought time to seek federal government’s instructions regarding provisions of right of appeal to the then accused civilians against the judgement issued in their trials before the independent court.
In addition, the AGP had also assured the bench then that no offence entailing death penalty or a lengthy sentence would be made against any detained civilians.
Also, he had said the accused would have the right to appoint private counsel of their own choice for their defence, family members and legal team of the accused civilians will be allowed to attend the trial proceedings, evidence will be recorded at the trial of the accused under the law and procedure applicable to the criminal courts of ordinary jurisdiction besides the judgment delivered in the trial of the accused will be supported by reasons.

The petitions have been filed a day before the Supreme Court is scheduled to resume hearing on the dispute over seniority of IHC judges.
Filed through senior counsel Muhammad Waqar Rana, the petitions contended that the transfers of Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar of the Lahore High Court, Justice Khadim Hussain Somroo of the Sindh High Court and Justice Muhammad Asif of the Balochistan High Court violated Article 200 of the Constitution.  The article requires that such transfers be made in the public interest and only after proper consultation with the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) and the respective high court chief justices.
On Tuesday, a five-judge constitutional bench headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar will resume proceedings on a broader dispute over the inter-se seniority of five sitting IHC judges.

Petitions say transfers lacked transparency

Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz have jointly petitioned the Supreme Court to argue that the three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194 of the Constitution, read in conjunction with Schedule III.
 
 

In rejoinders filed against the federal government, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and the registrars of the Supreme Court and high courts, the petitioners argued that adequate consultation with the CJP and other judges did not take place. They noted that the chief justice of Sindh had explicitly rejected the geographical reasoning cited in the transfer summary, yet the transfers proceeded.
Moreover, the petitioners contended that the prime minister and president approved the transfers on the same day the summary was initiated, suggesting a rushed process without due deliberation.
“Such decisions required cabinet approval, not just the prime minister’s advice,” the petition stated.
The petitioners also noted that the transfers were predetermined, as the judges were asked for their consent before consultations were properly held. For instance, Justice Somroo gave his consent before his chief justice was consulted.
In the case of Justice Muhammad Asif, the petitioners argued that transferring an additional judge who had just been appointed to the Balochistan High Court was contentious. They asserted this move undermined the appointment process and deprived other eligible candidates from Balochistan of the opportunity to serve in the IHC.
Referring to the CJP’s concurrence about federal representation as reasons for the transfers, the petitioners maintained this ground conflicted with constitutional provisions and prior judicial precedents. They claimed the CJP did not consult senior judges or convene a full court meeting, reducing the required consultation to a “mere formality.”
 
 

The petitioners warned that the transfers set a dangerous precedent, enabling the executive to manipulate judicial appointments and eroding judicial independence.
The petitioners also urged the Supreme Court to intervene and declare the transfers unconstitutional in order to restore the integrity of the judicial process, ensuring that future actions are transparent, consultative, and driven solely by public interest.

“The treaty is critical to regional stability and its sanctity must be preserved,” Mr Dar said while speaking at a high-level meeting convened to strategize Pakistan’s response to India’s suspension of the decades-old accord.
The meeting was attended by Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazir Tarrar, Attorney General Mansoor Awan, senior officials, technical experts, and former foreign secretaries.
On Monday, Mr Dar condemned India’s move as a “unilateral and illegal” action that contravenes international law, established norms of inter-state relations, and the treaty’s provisions. He warned that India’s attempts to “weaponise water” posed a serious threat to the region’s peace and stability.
“The waters of the Indus River System remain a lifeline for Pakistan’s 240 million people,” he said, underscoring the strategic and humanitarian importance of preserving the treaty.
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding its rightful share of water under the treaty and pledged to continue advocating for its full implementation to protect the country’s water security and the well-being of its people.

The truck was one of the vehicles that supplied Iranian petrol brought over by Zambad vehicles to local shops. The injured also included police personnel and several children.
Officials said the truck was parked in the main bus and truck stand, when the driver discovered a leak in its fuel tank. After trying unsuccessfully to stop the leakage, the driver moved the truck away from a densely populated area towards an open space.
The fuel tank was being welded when a fire broke out, leading to a big explosion that damaged a fire tender and injured several people gathered at the scene.
“As a result of the huge fire, the driver was burnt to death on the spot, while over 60 people present at the site received burns,” Noshki Deputy Commissi­oner Amjad Somroo said while talking to the media after the incident.
The injured were moved to the district hospital for treatment.
“We have received over 45 people, including police personnel and children in the hospital who had suffered burns,” Dr Zafar Ali Mengal, the medical superintendent of the hospital, said while speaking to Dawn.
He said the condition of at least 20 people was critical as they had sustained more than 40 per cent burns.
The critically injured were moved to the Civil Hospital Quetta, while some of the injured were shifted to private hospitals in Noshki as the district hospital did not have a burns ward.
“We have received 23 injured who received serious burn injuries,” Dr Abdul Hadi Kakar said, adding that 20 of them were shifted to the Bolan Medical College hospital for treatment.

Cardinals are meeting from around the world for the vote, which begins on May 7.
The prelate — once one of the most powerful figures in the Vatican — had reportedly been pushing to take part, despite not being on the official list of electors. But on Monday Cardinal Pietro Parolin, who as secretary of state was Pope Francis’s number two, presented Becciu with two documents signed by the Argentine pontiff which said he could not, the media reports said.
The letters dated from 2023 and last month, according to the Domani newspaper. Becciu, 76, a former adviser to Pope Francis who was once considered a papal contender himself, was removed from office and stripped of his cardinal  “rights and privileges” by the pope in September 2020. He was sentenced in 2023 to five years and six months in jail for financial crimes and has appealed the conviction.
The cardinal had been one of 10 defendants in a trial focused on a disastrous Vatican investment in a luxury building in London. The surprise 2020 decision to strip Becciu of the rights associated with being a cardinal — a very rare punishment — came as Francis enacted a series of reforms aimed at cleaning up the Vatican’s notoriously murky finances.

Trump’s spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said the administration would name and shame cities accused of blocking efforts to protect “American communities from criminal aliens.” 
The announcement came with Trump celebrating major progress in honouring his election campaign promises to stem illegal border crossings from Mexico. The figures soared to all-time highs under Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, and the Republican won the White House in part on promises to combat what he repeatedly claimed was an invasion of criminal migrants.
But Trump’s popularity has since plunged in the polls, with more than 40 per cent of Americans saying they “disapprove strongly” of him, according to a Washington Post-ABC survey.
On Monday he suggested pollsters and news organisations should be sued for fraud over the “fake news.” Trump will this week be hailing his achievements in his first 100-days, claiming successes on the economy, foreign policy and government efficiency as well as on migration.
Leavitt noted a 95pc drop in encounters of undocumented migrants at the Mexico border — from 140,000 to 7,000 — in the 12 months from March 2024, when Biden was still in office.
“America’s borders are now secure because of President Trump,” she said. “He has restored the rule of law, enforced our immigration laws and defended America’s sovereignty.” Trump’s election campaign rhetoric about taking on the alleged hordes of rapists and murderers resonated with voters concerned about illegal immigration.

Over 100 migrants arrested in Colorado nightclub raid

Amid Trump’s immigration crackdown, US authorities said on Sunday they arrested more than 100 undocumented migrants in a raid on a nightclub in Colorado.
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) “apprehended over 100 illegal aliens at an underground night club frequented by Tda and MS-13 terrorists,” Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X. Trump has designated South American gangs Tren de Aragua and MS-13 as terrorist groups, sent troops to the Mexican border and called for mass expulsions of undocumented migrants as part of his iron fist approach to immigration.
The Republican leader has in the process butted heads with federal judges, rights groups and Democrats who say he has trampled or ignored constitutional rights in rushing to deport migrants, sometimes without the right to a hearing.
Footage posted on X by the DEA showed armed officers breaking a window and shouting at clubgoers to raise their hands as they run out of the building onto what appears to be a strip mall parking lot. The DEA said that “more than 100 illegal aliens” were taken into custody at the “underground nightclub” in Colorado Springs. “Drugs and weapons have also been seized,” the agency posted on X.
DEA Special Agent Jonathan Pullen told local TV stations that the raid uncovered various US military members at the club, “either as patrons or working as armed security.” 
Trump on Sunday praised the operation on his Truth Social platform for targeting “some of the worst people illegally in our Country — Drug Dealers, Murderers, and other Violent Criminals, of all shapes and sizes.” 
He hit out at judges who have blocked migrant deportations, saying they would make the United States a “Crime ridden MESS.” 
Rights groups said last week that authorities had deported three American children — one of whom has a rare form of cancer — alongside their undocumented immigrant mothers.
As part of the drive to deliver on his pledges, Republicans are targeting “sanctuary cities,” which typically prohibit local officials from telling federal agents about undocumented immigrants if they are at risk of deportation.
The Democratic mayors of four major cities — Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York — were hauled over the coals in Congress in March over what Republicans called “pro-criminal” immigration policies.
All four cities have struggled to cope with a huge influx of migrants crossing from Mexico.

The comments came as US President Donald Trump pushed Russia to accept a ceasefire, telling reporters on Sunday that he believed Volodymyr Zelensky might concede Crimea as part of a settlement — a suggestion the Ukrainian leader has repeatedly rejected. But as a possible deal looms, experts raised concerns over the legality of any agreement, which would mark a monumental shift in the post-World War II international order.
“The message it sends is that it can pay off, for great powers at least, to violate that prohibition of the use of force,” said Lauri Malksoo, an international law professor at the University of Tartu in Estonia.
‘Catastrophic consequences’
After 1945, nations set rules to uphold international law — and made it clear that borders could not be changed by force. As a result,  “there has been no case of a country expanding its size by militarily seizing the territory of another for 80 years,” said Phillips O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews.
The Kremlin has repeatedly outlined its demands for a Ukraine settlement, comprising Crimea, which Moscow seized in a lightning operation in 2014, as well four regions it annexed after its full-scale invasion three years ago but does not fully control.
Kyiv has denounced the annexations as an illegal land grab and says it will never recognise them, while experts have warned that accepting Moscow’s demands sets a dangerous precedent that could lead to future Russian aggression.
Forcing Ukraine to recognise Russian sovereignty over Crimea would be  “a return to the right of conquest”, said Elie Tenenbaum at the French Institute for International Relations (IFRI). And the repercussions could extend far beyond the conflict in Ukraine, said Michel Erpelding at the Max Planck Institute in Germany. Such a precedent could have  “extremely destabilising, even catastrophic consequences for world peace”, he said.
‘Under duress’
The United States has signalled its willingness to recognise Russia’s annexation of Crimea, but there is a debate whether any deal would be legally valid — even if Ukraine signs.
“In principle, at least, treaties produced through coercion are void,” said Malksoo, warning that any agreement signed under pressure by Kyiv could spark a legal battle.
Before accepting Russian sovereignty over the peninsula, each country would assess whether Moscow coerced Kyiv into giving up Crimea. And Ukraine could  “use this argument to challenge the validity of any agreement it may have been pressured into signing”, said Erpelding.
Washington has not revealed details of its peace plan, but has suggested freezing the front line, effectively handing Russia the four regions it now occupies since launching its February 2022 invasion.

The joint appeal came from Japan’s atomic bomb survivors’ group Nihon Hidankyo, which won last year’s Nobel; 2017 laureate the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN); and the 1985 winner, International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War.
They sent a joint letter to the two leaders, ICAN said in a statement on Monday. “At this moment of extreme nuclear danger, we call on you to take urgent steps to de-escalate tensions and to engage in meaningful negotiations for nuclear disarmament,” they wrote to US President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
The two countries between them control 90 per cent of the world’s nuclear weapons. The groups said they were prompted to write their letter following Trump’s suggestion after returning to power in January that he wanted the world to  “denuclearise”, and the Kremlin’s expressed openness to the idea.
“The current climate surrounding nuclear weapons is the most volatile in decades,” they said, warning of potential  “catastrophic consequences for all humankind”. The Nobel laureates called in their letter on the two leaders to follow the example set by their predecessors Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev.

The man, Kai-Ji Adam Lo, was charged with eight counts of second-degree murder by prosecutors in British Columbia and  “further charges are anticipated,” according to a post on X by the Vancouver Police.
Lo appeared in court on Sunday, hours after police arrested him at the scene of the incident on Saturday evening. Authori­ties described Lo as having had a  “significant history” of interactions with authorities involving mental health. They said there was no evidence of terrorism.
“This is the darkest day in our city’s history,” Vancouver Interim Chief Constable Steve Rai told reporters at a Sunday press conference. Police said 24 people were injured, some critically, and warned that the death toll could rise in coming days and weeks. 
As of Sunday afternoon, Rai said he did not believe there were any ongoing threats to the community. More than 100 police officers joined the investigation, as local officials worked with provincial and federal authorities to provide support services. Messages of condolence and support came from across the globe.
“The community will feel this for a long time,” RJ Aquino, chair of the community advocacy group Filipino BC, told reporters.  “We want to tell everybody that we’re grieving. We want to tell everybody that we see and hear the support from around the world at this point.” 
The attack on Saturday evening took place two days before Canada’s federal election on Monday.

The blockade of the National Highway at the Sindh-Punjab border for the past 10 days due to protests over the canals issue has suspended all vehicular movement between the two provinces, severely impacting the transportation of essential goods such as petrol and food items, with trucks and trailers stranded.
Industry representatives have warned the government that the backlog from the ongoing strike by goods transporters and protests across Sindh against the proposed construction of canals on the Indus river is expected to take up to 25 days to clear, potentially causing millions of dollars in losses due to delayed shipments and the accumulation of imported containers.
Muhammad Shafqaat, CEO of the Pakistan Textile Council (PTC), explained that the four-day strike by goods transporters in Karachi had led to significant delays, with approximately 20,000 to 25,000 export containers unable to reach the port.
In a joint statement, Pakistan Textile Exporters Association (PTEA) Patron-in-Chief Khurram Mukhtar and Chairman Sohail Pasha emphasised that a grave crisis is unfolding, as persistent road blockages have paralysed trade and disrupted national supply chains. 
They revealed that approximately $400-500 million worth of textile goods have been stranded for the past 11 days, severely affecting Pakistan’s exports.
The textile industry, which is a cornerstone of Pakistan’s export economy, is suffering significant losses due to these disruptions. In Faisalabad, over 1,000 containers related to the textile industry are stuck because of the road closures, leading to a serious shortage of raw materials and interruptions to factory production, Mr Shafqaat said.
PTC Chairman Fawad Anwar said the prolonged transportation disruptions are inflicting severe damage on Pakistan’s economy, causing disruptions in supply chains, the loss of perishable goods, the deterioration of stranded vehicles, and rising costs for businesses.
The PTC has urged the federal and provincial governments of Sindh and Punjab to take immediate action to resolve these issues and restore normalcy.
Khurram Mukhtar said export orders are delayed or cancelled, jeopardising Pakistan’s credibility in international markets. Payment cycles have been disrupted, creating financial strain on businesses across sectors, he added.
He warned that the national exchequer would lose an estimated $800-900m if the situation continues unchecked.
Export facilitation scheme
Meanwhile, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Commerce on Monday expressed concern over the delay in finalising the export facilitation scheme.
The committee, chaired by MNA Muhammad Jawed Hanif Khan,  noted that the FBR had issued a draft SRO on April 12, but the final notification has yet to be issued. 
The members raised concerns about the negative impact of these delays, particularly the increased demurrage costs on containers held at ports.
The committee also passed ‘The Anti-Dumping Duties (Amendment) Bill, 2025’. The Ministry of Commerce informed the committee about the amendments imposed on imports of goods used in foreign grant-in-aid projects. These amendments are intended to provide retrospective relief from July 1, 2020.

A Power Division report on circular debt for the period ending March 2025 showed that payables to power producers increased by around Rs33bn to Rs1.633tr, up from Rs1.60tr on July 1, 2024. 
On the other hand, the payables of public sector generation companies (Gencos) to fuel suppliers declined to Rs79bn by the end of March, down from Rs110b at the start of the fiscal year. The stock of circular debt parked in Power Holding Limited (PHL), a shell entity of the Power Division, remained unchanged at Rs683bn. 
The federal government has also claimed over Rs223bn in receivables from K-Electric (KE) as of March 2025, which includes an overwhelming Rs186.5bn in markup on a principal liability of Rs36.5bn. 

Payables to power producers rise to Rs1.63tr

The report showed that total circular debt at Rs2.396tn had increased by about Rs15bn from Rs2.381tr as of end-November 2024. 
Of the three main components of circular debt, the report said, payables to power producers increased, payables to fuel suppliers decreased, and debt parked in PHL remained unchanged during the first nine months of FY25 compared to July 1, 2024. 
However, compared to the period ending March 2024, all three components showed a significant decline. For example, payables to power producers dropped by almost Rs300bn (15.5pc) from Rs1.929tr to Rs1.633tr. Gencos’ payables to fuel suppliers fell by Rs20bn (20pc) to Rs79bn from Rs99bn. 
Debt parked in PHL came down by Rs82bn (11pc), from Rs765bn to Rs683bn. Overall, total circular debt declined by 14pc or Rs398bn during the first nine months — from Rs2.794tr to Rs2.396tr. 
The report attributed the reduction primarily to over-collection of pending generation costs through quarterly tariff adjustments (QTAs) and fuel price adjustments (FPAs), as well as recoveries of prior year adjustments. 
This included an over-collection of Rs110bn on pending generation costs during the first nine months, compared to an increase of Rs145bn in the same period last year, and additional recoveries of Rs38bn under other prior year adjustments as of March 2025. 
The report further noted that KE’s total non-payments amounted to Rs10bn by March 2025, compared to Rs59bn by end-November 2023. Including past dues, total claims against KE stood at Rs223bn, built upon a principal amount of Rs36.5bn. 
Interestingly, KE has been claiming higher receivables from government entities, including provincial departments, and the two sides are engaged in negotiated settlements through arbitration. 
On distribution companies (Discos), the report highlighted that inefficiency losses rose to Rs143bn by end-March 2025, up from about Rs102bn in March 2024 — contrary to public statements by the power minister about improvements in Discos’ performance. 
However, it noted that inefficiency losses were still lower compared to Rs276bn at the close of the last fiscal year. 
Meanwhile, Discos’ under-recoveries were recorded at Rs78 billion during the first nine months of the current year, compared to Rs262 billion in the same period last year.
The amount of budgeted but unpaid subsidies came to an end as the Finance Division overpaid by about Rs3bn during nine months. As a result, no interest charges were paid to banks this year, compared to Rs63bn paid last year.
