Over the weekend, several old and new faces paid visits to the party’s otherwise low-profile vice-chairman, ostensibly to ‘discuss politics’. On Saturday, former PTI leaders Fawad Chaudhry, Mahmood Maulvi and Imran Ismail called on Shah Mahmood Qureshi at a Lahore hospital, where the incarcerated PTI vice-chairman was recently shifted for medical treatment. It was later reported, however, that they ‘returned empty-handed’.
A day later, PTI secretary-general Salman Akram Raja called on Mr Qureshi, with party leaders Shaukat Basra and Zaheer Babar in tow. Among other things, the ‘current political situation’ was on the agenda, party sources said. The attention around the PTI vice-chairman would have gone unnoticed, considering how little one usually hears of him in public discourse, even though Mr Qureshi, too, has been behind bars for a considerable period. However, later remarks from the former PTI leaders put an interesting spin on the situation.
According to the former leaders, the present PTI leadership has completely failed to secure any relief for its jailed leaders. This includes not only Imran Khan, but other ‘forgotten’ leaders such as Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, and Omar Sarfraz Cheema, too, not to mention Mr Qureshi. The former leaders’ separate statements to the media were variations on this same line. Apparently, they had visited Mr Qureshi to secure his blessings for their ‘free Imran Khan campaign’, but, according to the PTI vice-chairman’s lawyer, were quickly shooed away before they could make their case.
The current leaders would have been understandably concerned when they met Mr Qureshi the next day, but whether or not they left reassured was not disclosed. With a senior commentator blaming Mr Khan in their column for ‘blocking his party’s path’ with confrontational politics, it would appear that another attempt at ‘minus-ing’ Mr Khan may be in the works.
 
 

Whatever the case, the PTI should realise that negotiation with other political players has remained an option. It is sheer obduracy that has prevented it from finding a way out of its predicament. With the space narrowing for the exercise of civil liberties, the PTI leadership must consider whether it has been worth making an enemy of everyone in the game — although, sadly, the government, too, has failed to show flexibility towards a political party with arguably the largest support base in the country.
The direction in which things are headed could spell disaster for the entire political edifice, and the PTI is currently in no position to protect its constituencies from the fallout if this were to happen. It must, at the very least, demonstrate a sense of responsibility and pay serious thought to how this country’s long political crisis can be brought to a negotiated end. There seems to be no other option before it at the moment.

• Children up to 15 to be immunised as older kids now identified as key to transmission
• Drive to be extended to other high-risk urban centres, such as Karachi, Hyderabad
• Police rescue polio team detained at private school
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Health auth­orities in Punjab on Monday launched a massive Extended-Age Fractional IPV Campaign, aiming to vaccinate up to 2 million children with an injectable polio vaccine as part of a critical effort to eradicate the virus from its last reservoir in the region.
The campaign, which will run until Nov 12, targets children aged 4 months to 15 years, across 122 high-risk union councils (UCs) in Lahore.
Officials hope the drive will interrupt the transmission of poliovirus detected in the city’s environmental samples, a key step toward declaring the entire province polio-free.
The fractional inactivated polio vaccine (fIPV) campaign was formally launched by Punjab Minister for Health and Popu­lation Khwaja Imran Nazeer and Health & Pop­u­lation Department Secretary Nadia Saqib.
The initiative follows a recommendation from the global Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio, which identified that while children under 5 are mostly protected, the virus is now being spread by older, unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children.
“Our priority is to remain vigilant and continue building population immunity until transmission ends everywhere in Pakistan,” Mr Nazeer said at the launch ceremony. “Children who repeatedly miss vaccination remain our biggest vulnerability. Every single child must be vaccinated in every campaign.”
The campaign is a significant logistical undertaking, with approximately 10,848 frontline workers participating. This force includes 2,700 skilled vaccinators, 2,700 team assistants, 4,800 community mobilisers, 496 area in charges and 122 UC medical officers.
Former health minister Dr Nadeem Jan, while talking to Dawn, called the decision a positive step that should have been taken much earlier.
“IPV enhances individual protection of a child and further transmission of virus through child is stopped,” Mr Jan said. “Moreover it also saves child from chances of vaccine derived paralysis and keeps child safe.” He recommended that at least two or three similar rounds should be held in each targeted block to fully eradicate the virus.
Lahore is considered the only remaining polio reservoir in Punjab. According to a polio programme expert, DNA sampling indicates the virus circulating in Punjab has not travelled from other hotspot areas like southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“It has been decided to start with Laho­­re as if Lahore block will be cured the whole Punjab province will be declared polio free,” the expert said, noting that South KP remains a more problematic area.
The oral polio vaccine (OPV) remains in a child’s gut and stops the further spread of the virus, while the injectable polio vaccine (IPV) offers complete protection from infection. TAG suggested using IPV in reservoirs that were less severely affected.
Secretary Saqib emphasised that the fIPV provides an essential boost to immunity. “The fIPV provides an additional layer of protection by boosting immunity, especially where environmental virus detections are recorded,” she said.
She highlighted that Punjab has already conducted four national immunisation ca­­mpaigns this year.
However, the campaign faces significant challenges. Officials acknowledged there is resistance to injectable vaccines, similar to what was encountered during a recent HPV vaccine drive. There is also a limited supply of equipment, with only 4,000 specialised injectors available, each costing $500.
Following the Lahore campaign, similar drives are plan­ned for other high-risk ur­­ban blocks, including Karachi, Hydera­bad and Chaman.
Polio workers rescued
Separately, police on Monday rescued a group of female polio workers who were attacked and detained by staff at a private school in Gulberg Town, Lahore.
The health workers had arrived at the school in Union Council 31 to administer polio vaccines to children when the confrontation occurred.
The school’s management refused to allow the vaccinations and the workers were assaulted and locked in a room.
One of the workers sustained a head injury, and others were reportedly beaten when they attempted to help their colleague.
Video clips later emerged showing the women crying and pleading for help during the incident.
The police response was swift following the Punjab CM’s intervention, which included instructions to apprehend the suspects and pursue criminal charges.
Later, Misri Shah police filed a case against the school staff.

Canada has been looking to open new markets for the commodity after China announced preliminary anti-dumping duties on Canadian canola imports in August, a year after Canada said it would levy a 100 per cent tariff on imports of Chinese electric vehicles.
In a joint statement released late on Monday, the two countries said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had held a phone call with Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand on October 30, “reaffirming the strong and enduring ties between Pakistan and Canada and emphasising the importance of deepening cooperation in areas of mutual interest”.
 






“Pakistan and Canada agreed to facilitate the export of Canadian canola to Pakistan, recognising the significant potential of Pakistan’s expanding market for this Canadian commodity,” the statement said.
It added that the ministers also welcomed the successful conclusion of the first round of negotiations toward a Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Agreement. It said that led by Minister for Investment Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh and Canadian Minister of International Trade Maninder Sidhu, the agreement was an “important priority which reflects both countries’ dedication to fostering a stable and transparent investment environment”.
“Both sides also expressed keen interest in expanding bilateral cooperation on energy security and critical minerals, recognising the strong and growing role of Canadian companies in achieving Pakistan’s ambitious mineral development goals and harnessing its clean energy potential,” the statement said.
It further said that the minister also looked ahead to the upcoming sixth round of bilateral consultations, which would serve as a platform to “advance shared priorities, reinforce government-to-government and private sector linkages, and explore new avenues for strategic collaboration”.
“Pakistan and Canada remain committed to working together to promote peace, prosperity, and inclusive growth, both bilaterally and on the global stage,” the statement concluded.
Canadian Foreign Minister Anand also posted the joint statement on social media platform X.

Meanwhile, Canadian MP Rob Oliphant said that Ottawa was strengthening and diversifying its trade relationships.
“As we continue negotiations toward a Foreign Investment and Promotion Agreement with Pakistan, our governments have agreed to facilitate Canadian canola exports — a beneficial deal for both sides,” he said.
 






Canadian MP Shafqat Ali said the two countries were strengthening cooperation in areas of mutual interest, including renewed trade in Canadian canola.
“Good news for both our countries,” he said.
Last week, Dar and his Canadian counterpart had discussed the strengthening of bilateral trade and cooperation between the two countries. During the call, Anand had thanked Dar for facilitating market access for imports of Canadian canola to Pakistan.
“Both leaders appreciated recent constructive engagements, reaffirmed their commitment to advancing mutually beneficial economic cooperation,” the Foreign Office had said, adding that the two foreign ministers agreed to remain in close contact.
Subsequently, Anand said on X that she spoke to Canola Council of Canada and explained that “our diplomatic efforts had resulted in Pakistan’s decision to lift restrictions on imports of Canadian canola”.
“This decision re-establishes a significant market for Canadian canola producers,” she said. “As Pakistan expedites regulatory approvals, for Canadian canola, I understand that import orders have already been placed,” she said.

Although the ruling coalition had been in talks over the proposed amendment for some time now, Monday’s X post by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari came as a bolt out of the blue for many.
 






The list of areas which would be dealt with by the proposed amendment – such as the establishment of a federal constitutional court, revival of executive magistracy, transfer of high court judges, removal of protection for the share of provinces in the divisible pool, changes to Article 243 which covers the appointment of services chiefs, the return of the education and population planning to the centre, and breaking the deadlock over the appointment of the chief election commissioner – has the potential to upend the political and administrative structure of the country.
Some social media handles with Sindhi origins are already abuzz with all kinds of theories about the proposed amendment. These include speculation about a quid-pro-quo involving the formation of a PPP government in Azad Kashmir in exchange for the party’s support. The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) has, indeed, dangled more carrots in front of the PPP than just the Azad Kashmir government. Most notably, these include the setting up of a federal constitutional court – a longstanding PPP demand that was withdrawn during the 26th amendment negotiations only after the government agreed to set up a constitutional bench within the Supreme Court.
While Mr Bhutto-Zardari stated in his tweet that his party’s central executive committee (CEC) will meet on Thursday to discuss the proposed amendment and whether or not to support its passage, some early signs suggest the decision will not be easy. His party risks losing legitimacy and public support, especially in its Sindh stronghold. Posts on Sindh-based social media handles suggest that Sindhi nationalists, civil society activists and intellectuals will strongly oppose the likely reversal of the protection for the provinces’ share in the NFC. They are also likely to oppose the return of two important departments to the federal government.
PPP’s dilemma
“This is a complete rollback of the 18th Amendment,” notes a PPP leader from Sindh on the condition of anonymity because he didn’t want to say anything publicly before the CEC meeting. “It will be very, very difficult for the party to accept this as it goes against everything we have stood and fought for. Once the constitutional safeguard ensuring the provinces’ share from the NFC is revoked, we’ll be back to square one.
 
 

“This safeguard was introduced precisely to prevent any future dictator or even a democratic government from arbitrarily cutting the provincial share. Look at the contradiction — on the one hand, they admit federal expenditures are rising. On the other, they want to snatch away two more ministries, for education and population planning,” he muses. He adds that of the 17 ministries that were devolved, several have already found their way back to the federal government in one form or another. “For instance, agriculture was devolved, but the centre later created the Ministry of Food Security to retain control over agriculture.”
He did not, however, elaborate on the potential reaction within the party over the proposed constitutional court, revival of the executive magistracy and change in the procedure for appointing the chief election commissioner.
Most political analysts, however, don’t see the PPP rejecting the proposed amendments in toto. Senior analyst and columnist Suhail Warraich, who is considered close to top PPP leadership, especially President Asif Zardari, doesn’t see the PPP compromising on the NFC or the 18th Amendment. “Provincial autonomy has always been central to their politics. That’s why it was part of the MRD’s [Movement for Restoration of Democracy] agenda and later an important element of the Charter of Democracy.”
Nonetheless, he says, the party is likely to agree on the formation of a federal constitutional court, which is also a component of the Charter of Democracy, and even on whatever changes are being proposed to Article 243. “The NFC and 18th Amendment will be their red line though,” he adds.
Another political commentator and journalist, Badar Alam, believes that the PPP would be committing suicide if it agrees to roll back provincial autonomy guaranteed in the 18th Amendment. “The party will lose its political relevance if it surrenders on the NFC Award and agrees to transfer education and population — two key pillars of provincial autonomy — back to the centre,” he says. “The people of Sindh were unhappy even when the federal government pushed canal-building projects and the party leadership initially chose to ignore their concerns. If a similar approach is taken on the NFC, it will only strengthen nationalist forces in Sindh.”
Like Mr Warraich, he also believes that it will be easier for the PPP to agree on the creation of a constitutional court and even on amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution. “However, details about both remain sketchy for now, making it difficult to comment definitively. The idea of a federal constitutional court is, in principle, a sound one. But if implemented at this stage, it will likely be viewed as an attempt to curb the judiciary’s powers. Besides, since we already have a constitutional bench in the Supreme Court, the likelihood of frequent jurisdictional disputes between the two bodies would be quite high.”
Economic implications
Changes in the NFC have long been part of the IMF and World Bank’s agenda. The framework has effectively been undermined earlier by forcing provinces to produce budget surpluses at the cost of development and public welfare. The federal government has also resorted to indirect taxation on petroleum, gas and other items to bypass the current NFC arrangement. Economist Waqar Wadho, who teaches at the Lahore School of Economics, says that since the announcement of the 7th NFC Award, the federal government has been trying to increase its revenues. “Because it cannot do so through the divisible pool owing to the constitutional safeguard for the provinces, it has resorted to indirect taxation like the imposition of various levies, including the one on petroleum products.”
 
 

“However, the numbers show that even these additional revenues are insufficient for the centre to meet its growing expenditures. A major portion of federal income is consumed by defence-related spending and interest payments,” he notes. “Now, the goal appears to be to boost revenues through the divisible pool itself by legally increasing the federal share. But that will not mean the centre will roll back the levies it has already imposed to enhance its revenue outside the NFC. Those are likely to remain in place even after the federal share is raised.”
Mr Wadho argues that the change in the NFC sharing formula in favour of the centre will have serious implications for provinces, especially the smaller ones. “A reduced provincial share will directly impact their capacity to deliver public services. You may recall that Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have invested heavily in healthcare: KP launched its health insurance programme while Sindh focused on hospitals and related infrastructure at the district level. If their share from the NFC is cut, such initiatives will inevitably suffer.”
According to him, KP — particularly after the merger of the former FATA districts — and Balochistan will be far worse off than they are now. Sindh and Punjab, on the other hand, still have some space to generate additional tax revenues. “Yet they will also feel the strain. Once its share declines, even Punjab may no longer be able to extend support to its people the way it did after recent floods. Overall, public service delivery across the country will be hit, though Punjab and Sindh might still manage somewhat better due to their larger revenue base.”
Speaking on the implications for the PPP’s politics in Sindh, the LSE economist argues the PPP is in a really tough position. “It wants to project Bilawal Bhutto as a prime ministerial candidate and revive the party in Punjab. For both goals, it needs the goodwill of federal institutions, especially the army. That makes it difficult for the party to take a firm stand against the proposed changes because the message from the establishment seems to be that they have a choice between Maryam Nawaz Sharif and Bilawal — and that Maryam is offering them a better deal.”
The PPP can see that clearly, he says. “Yet, at the same time, Bilawal’s party depends on retaining Sindh as its power base for any chance at forming a government in Islamabad. Supporting the proposed amendment would have serious repercussions for the PPP there. We’ve already seen civil society groups, lawyers, and political parties uniting (to protect the province’s water rights) during protests against Punjab’s canal projects. So, much like the controversy over the canal projects, the party will again struggle to justify backing the 27th Amendment.”
Mr Wadho insists that Mr Bhutto-Zardari is young and has the chance to resist it if he can think beyond the next government or even the one after that. “But with Mr Zardari still calling some of the shots, the party may instead look for cosmetic adjustments to soften the blow. One possible outcome could be that they negotiate some limited protection for Sindh’s interests to make the compromise appear more acceptable.”
Legal issues
Outside Sindh too, the proposed amendment is likely to ignite opposition from other sections of society, particularly lawyers, who will not take the changes in the higher judiciary lying down. The government seems to be fully aware of that, and this shows in its timing of the proposed amendment – coming as it does right after government-backed lawyers appear to be leading in bar council elections. If the proposed amendment triggers protests and resistance from lawyers, the government believes that its allies in the bar council will help alleviate the strength of this resistance.
Constitutional expert and Supreme Court lawyer Salahuddin Ahmed argues that the proposed changes to the constitution through the 27th Amendment are mostly meant to “control the streets” through revival of executive magistracy, sideline the opposition in the process of selecting the chief election commissioner, and manage maverick judges through transfers from one court to another. “In short, it’ll be a slide into fascism brought in by parliament itself,” he concludes.

• Istanbul moot backs plans for Palestinians to take control of security, governance in besieged enclave
• Erdogan says Hamas committed to truce, urges Muslim states to lead reconstruction efforts
• FO denounces ceasefire violations, demands Israel’s withdrawal from Palestine
ISTANBUL: Foreign ministers from several Muslim states have backed a post-war framework where Palest­ine’s governance and security is ensured by Palestinians, as they stressed the importance of a UN mandate for the proposed task force for stabilisation in Gaza.
Turkiye wants to see a post-war framework for Gaza in which “Palestinians ensure Palestine’s governance and security,” Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told reporters after a meeting in Istanbul involving Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Turkiye.
Brokered by US President Donald Trump, the October 10 ceasefire — which halted two years of continuous bloodshed — has been tested by fresh Israeli strikes in civilians in Gaza.
Mr Fidan said the taskforce that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire under a US-brokered deal needed a mandate defined by the UN Security Council and a framework for legitimacy, on the basis of which countries will decide whether to send soldiers to the enclave.
He said it was crucial that the emerging International Stabilisa­tion Force that will monitor the Gaza ceasefire under Trump’s plan, have a “mandate defined by a UN Security Council resolution and a framework for legitimacy”.
Washington is currently working with Arab and international partners to decide on the composition of the force, with Turkiye hoping to play a role, despite fierce opposition from Israel. “The countries we’ve spoken with say they will decide whether to send troops based on … the ISF’s mandate and authority,” he said.
It may be noted that top-level consultations are reportedly underway in Pakistan as well over the question of sending troops for the proposed Gaza force, and insiders privy to developments say that a formal announcement is expected soon. However, much like Germany and Jordan, Islamabad would prefer to have any deployment to Gaza under the UN umbrella.
“First, a general consensus needs to be reached on a draft, then it needs to be approved by the members of the Security Council.
“And it needs to be free from vetoes by any of the permanent (UNSC) members,” Mr Fidan said of a blocking move frequently used by key Israel ally Washington.
Israel has long viewed Turkey’s diplomatic overtures with suspicion over Ankara’s close ties with Hamas and adamantly opposes it joining the task force that is meant to take over after Israeli troops withdraw from Gaza.
“Our principle is that Palestinians should govern the Palestinians and ensure their own security, the international community should support this in the best possible way – diplomatically, institutionally and economically,” Mr Fidan said. “Nobody wants to see a new system of tutelage emerge,” he said.
“We’ve now reached an extremely critical stage: we do not want the genocide in Gaza to resume,” Mr Fidan added, saying all seven nations supported plans for the Palestinians to take control of Gaza’s security and governance.
Mr Fidan, who also held talks at the weekend with a Hamas delegation led by its chief negotiator Khalil al-Hayya, said the movement was “ready to hand Gaza to a committee of Palestinians”.
He also expressed hope that reconciliation efforts between Hamas and the rival West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, “will bear fruit as soon as possible,” saying inter-Palestinian unity would “strengthen Palestine’s representation in the international community”.
Hamas in compliance
Earlier on Monday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Hamas appeared committed to the truce, pointing the finger of blame at Israel.
“It seems Hamas is quite determined to adhere to the agreement while Israel’s record is very poor,” he told an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) gathering in Istanbul, saying Muslim states should play “a leading role” in Gaza’s recovery.
“At this point, we need to deliver more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza and then begin reconstruction efforts. “The Israeli government is doing everything in its power to prevent this,” Mr Erdogan said.
He also urged Muslim states to play “a leading role” in Gaza’s recovery. “We believe the reconstruction plan prepared by the Arab League and the OIC (Organisation of Islamic Cooperation) should be implemented immediately,” he said of the plan unveiled in March.
Ceasefire violations denounced
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, along with other “Arab-Islamic foreign ministers”, deliberated on the way forward for a lasting ceasefire and sustainable peace in Gaza.
 






“The leaders jointly called for urgent humanitarian aid for the Palestinians, condemned Israeli ceasefire violations, demanded Israel’s withdrawal from the Occupied Palestinian Territory and emphasised the rebuilding of Gaza,” the statement added.
“Pakistan reaffirmed its principled stance for the establishment of an independent, viable and contiguous State of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in line with the UN and OIC resolutions,” it said.

• FBR chief puts total income tax gap at Rs1.7tr; claims collection from retailers has increased
• Power minister vows shift towards automatic metering, pre-paid billing
ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday said that discussion on ending the protection of provincial shares in the federal divisible pool resources would take place at the upcoming meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC).
“The entire discussion will take place at the kickstart meeting of the NFC, which is the [relevant] constitutional forum,” he replied at a news conference, when asked about PPP Chairman Bilawal Zardari-Bhutto’s statement regarding the removal of protection for provinces over their NFC shares, and the transfer of population and education back to the Centre.
The minister said this meeting would be convened later this month, after being postponed at the last minute due to floods in September.
He did not announce a date for the first NFC meeting, which is tentatively planned for Nov 17.
Many responsibilities in the federal domain, including population, health, education, and other social sectors, were devolved to the provinces under the 18th Constitution Amendment in 2010.
Under Article 160(3) of the Constitution, “the share of the provinces in each award of NFC shall not be less than the share given to the provinces in the previous award”.
At present, the provinces are entitled to more than a 57.5 per cent share of the federal divisible pool under the 7th NFC, in place since 2010, instead of the previous share of 47pc.
Powerful quarters have been advocating the reversal of the “imbalance” to meet rising debt and security expenditures.
Mr Aurangzeb, who called the joint press conference alongside select members of the economic team, comprising power, privatisation and information technology ministers as well as the secretary finance, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman and ‘rightsizing specialist’ Salman Ahmad to project economic reforms, said the country’s direction had been towards sustainable and inclusive growth.
Retailers’ contribution
FBR Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial ducked a question relating to additional income tax collection from retailers — a key theme of the government reform agenda under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme for expansion and deepening of the tax net. However, he said the country’s tax-to-GDP ratio had increased by 1.49pc last year — a “historic achievement”.
He said the total collection from retailers had increased from Rs82bn to Rs166bn. He continued that the bureau’s income tax collection had increased by 102pc in one year.
The FBR chief said 0.71pc improvement in the tax-to-GDP ratio was achieved through new taxes and increasing existing tax rates among other measures, while 0.77pc gain was gained through better compliance.
This also included about 1.15pc of GDP worth of PDL, which he said was also considered a tax revenue. How­ever, technically it is described as non-tax revenue.
Mr Langrial said the government and tax machinery was working on the target of tax-to-GDP ratio to 18pc by 2028 from 10.33pc, which includes provincial revenue and PDL, which is a 5.79 percentage point increase from 2025. Of this 18pc, the federal and provinces share would be 15 and 3pc, respectively.
He conceded that provincial tasks were more difficult than those of the Centre. He noted that data suggested an income tax gap of top 1pc income earners was Rs1.2 trillion at present. The total income tax gap, he added, stood at Rs1.7tr. Responding to a question, he said around 80pc of the Rs1.2tr gap would be filled by 2028.
Trade deficit
Mr Aurangzeb conceded that Pakistan’s trade deficit had increased 9pc in the first quarter as exports went up by 8pc. He said the export growth should be greater, but maintained that it would be “unfair” to say exports had “collapsed”.
“Remittances are providing us with a cushion. We expect remittances to hit $41-42 billion by the end of this fiscal year,” he said, adding that ultimately the current account deficit at $0.5bn was “very manageable”.
Power & privatisation
Power Minister Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari said the government’s top priority was to reduce electricity rates within our “tightened hands” as energy cost at Rs9.97 per unit was internationally competitive, but capacity payments due to devaluation of currency and high interest rate were a predicament.
“The government has the cut average power rates by Rs10.5 per unit and by Rs16 per unit for the industrial sector,” he continued.
The minister said the government was aggressively rolling out automation in the power sector.
“The entire metering landscape will be overhauled to automatic metering and pre-paid billing.”
Adviser to PM on Privatisation Muhammad Ali said the government remained committed to privatisation reforms “at the highest level”.
“The Privatisation Commission is now working on taking as many transactions as possible,” he added.

• Warns India against ‘false flag operation’ in deep waters
• Says decision to join Gaza peacekeeping force will be made by govt
ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Army on Monday adopted a tougher stance toward the Taliban regime ahead of the next round of talks in Istanbul, declaring that Pakistan’s only and non-negotiable demand is an end to terrorism emanating from Afghan territory.
“The conditions that Afghan Taliban keep putting forward are meaningless, what matters is the end of terrorism,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s spokesman, while briefing a group of journalists at Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“Pakistan has a one-point agenda: Afghan soil must not be used against us,” he asserted.
 
 

Gen Chaudhry’s remarks came as Islamabad prepares for the Nov 6 meeting in Turkiye, the next phase of negotiations following last month’s six-day talks in Istanbul between Pakistan and the Taliban regime.
Those talks, mediated by Turkiye and Qatar, produced a reaffirmation by both sides to ceasefire agreed in Doha and an agreement on establishing a monitoring and verification mechanism for cross-border terrorism, though implementation details remain unresolved.
Ahead of the upcoming Istanbul talks, Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah also held consultations with his negotiators, led by Mullah Najib, to deliberate on the next phase of dialogue with Pakistan, according to sources familiar with the discussions in Kandahar.
During his briefing, the military’s spokesperson highlighted that operations were underway against terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij — a term the state uses for the banned TTP — with 1,667 terrorists killed.
Gen Chaudhry disclosed that 206 Afghan Taliban fighters and 112 TTP terrorists were killed during the recent border tensions.
Pointing to growing participation of Afghans in TTP and subsequent blurring of lines between the two groups, he said about 60 per cent of the terrorists killed during infiltration attempts in the last three to four months were Afghan nationals.
Afghan Tailban’s support to TTP
“The TTP is not a separate entity, it is a branch of the Afghan Taliban,” Gen Chaudhry observed, explaining that the outfit had sworn allegiance to the Taliban’s emir, “and we have clear evidence that the Taliban are settling TTP fighters in densely populated areas to provide them a protective shield”.
He added that while Pakistan continues efforts to settle matters peacefully with Afghanistan, “there can be no compromise on our security and sovereignty”.
The spokesman dismissed recent Taliban statements suggesting preconditions for dialogue, including demands that Pakistan end alleged support for the Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP) and anti-Taliban propaganda. “Such conditions are meaningless. The only meaningful step is verifiable action against terrorists,” he said.
US drone operations
He categorically denied reports in “Afghan and Indian media” about a supposed secret US-Pakistan understanding allowing American drone operations in Afghanistan.
“This is fake news propagated by Zabihullah Mujahid,” the Taliban spokesman, he said. “Pakistan has not given permission to the US or any other country to use its territory for attacks inside Afghanistan. These claims are baseless propaganda.”
Pakistani officials view the Istanbul process as a test of the Taliban’s credibility. A senior security source said last week that Pakistan expects “credible evidence of action including dismantling of hideouts, disruption of logistical networks, and arrests of TTP leadership.”
False flag operation
The military spokesman warned that India was planning a “false flag” operation in the maritime domain to fabricate evidence of a major Pakistani strike or act of aggression, potentially triggering a new round of tensions between the two nuclear-armed rivals.
Gen Chaudhry, citing intelligence reports, indicated India could stage the incident “in deep waters,” portraying it as a Pakistani attack to justify escalation and malign Islamabad internationally.
 
 

He said Pakistan’s armed forces were on “high alert” and would deliver a “far stronger, more decisive, and severe” response than in previous incidents if provoked.
Security observers say the military’s unusually pointed warning coincides with several converging developments that Pakistan views as provocative or politically timed including India’s Trishul exercise, Bihar state elections, and regional tensions.
Last Saturday, the government released a video confession by Ijaz Mallah, a fisherman from Sindh who had been detained by Indian forces in 2024. In the video, Malah claims he was coerced by India’s external intelligence agency, RAW, to engage in espionage-related activities in Pakistan.
ISPR officials cited the testimony as partial evidence of Indian maritime sabotage plans, connecting it to what they describe as a “covert Indian terror network” disrupted earlier this year.
Gaza peace force
The military spokesman said that any decision regarding the deployment of Pakistani troops to a proposed Gaza peacekeeping force would be made by the government and parliament.
His comments came amid reports that Pakistan is weighing a potential contribution of troops to an International Stabilization Force (ISF) for Gaza.
The proposed mission could also include disarmament and security enforcement tasks, which have drawn criticism from opposition parties. They argue the government has not held a full parliamentary debate and warn that participation without clear UN oversight could risk Pakistan’s complicity in coercive actions against Palestinians.

Similar delays occurred at nearly all major airports in last two months due to engineers’ protest seeking pay hike and other issues.
According to sources, hundreds of Umrah pilgrims were stranded at the Islamabad, Lahore and Kara­chi airports due to the delay in PIA flights scheduled for Saudi Arabia.
A spokesman for PIA said the Society of Aircraft Engineers had no legal status and alleged that the main aim of this movement was to sabotage PIA’s privatisation, which was in its final stages.
He warned that the Essential Services Act was in force in PIA under which strikes or abandonment of work was a legal offence. “All elements involved in or supporting such actions as part of a conspiracy will face legal action,” he warned, adding that the management was obtaining alternative engineering services from other airlines to resume operations.

• Floods, border tensions fuel pressures
ISLAMABAD: Food items and energy spiked the inflation, measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI), to 6.24 per cent in October against 5.6pc in September, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported on Monday.
As a result, average inflation (CPI) in the first four months (July-October) of FY26 also moved up to 4.73pc when compared to the same period of last fiscal year. A month-on-month increase in CPI was reported at 1.83pc in October over September. Rural areas suffered the most due to rising prices as rural CPI was reported to have increased by 2.26pc in October while their urban compatriots faced 1.54pc increase in inflation.
The PBS said the 6.24pc increase for October was caused by an across-the-board rise in prices, except recreation and culture, which dropped by 3.7pc.
On the other hand, national prices of food and beverages (non-alcoholic) increased by 5.6pc, clothing and footwear by 8.07pc, housing, water, fuels and energy by 4.24pc, health 9.7pc, transport 6.7pc, education 10.6pc and other goods and services by 18.2pc.
Major food items that impacted the household expenses included 127pc increase in the prices of tomatoes, sugar (345pc), butter (30pc), wheat (23pc), honey (18pc), wheat flour (15.7pc), vegetable ghee (12.50pc) and pulse moong (12pc). The prices of non-food items which went up included gas charges (23pc), electrical appliances for personal use (13.59pc), footwear (12.67pc), newspapers (11.93pc), woollen ready-made garments (11.66pc), transport services (11pc), solid fuel (10.63pc) and education (10.41pc).
On the other hand, the prices of onions were down in October over October of last year by 33.82pc, chicken (29.08pc), pulse gram (27.28pc), besan (22.27pc), pulse mash (21.80pc), tea (17.75pc), gram whole (17.49pc), potatoes (17.12pc), pulse masoor (5.41pc), beans (4.88pc) and fresh vegetables (2.13pc). Also, the electricity rates were down 15.59pc in October when compared to the same month last year followed by textbooks (10.61pc) and liquefied hydrocarbons (1.72pc).
Major food items driving the price index in October over September included tomatoes (58.64pc), onions (18.71pc), fresh vegetables (12.22pc), wheat (10.51pc), wheat flour (5.49pc), eggs (4.22pc), fish (3.83pc), wheat products (2.61pc), fresh fruits (2.44pc), butter (2.21pc), vegetable ghee (1.91pc) and cooking oil (1.02pc). These kitchen items are major part of the household budgets. Food items have almost 35pc share in overall national price index.
On top of this, some non-food items contributing to the monthly price hike included electricity charges which went up by 8.78pc, postal services (6.1pc), transport services (2.93pc), house rent (1.46pc), dental services (1.19pc) and tailoring (1.14pc).
On the other hand, the key kitchen items whose prices eased in October compared to September included chicken (21.52pc), potatoes (2.36pc), beans (1.93pc), Besan (1.81pc), pulse gram (1.74pc), gram whole (0.78pc) and pulse masoor and moog down by 0.32pc and 0.20pc, respectively.
Floods, border tensions fuel prices
According to Reuters, the government last week forecast inflation in the 5 to 6 per cent range for October, noting that flood-related supply pressures and border closures with Afghanistan had pushed up prices of some essential goods. Floods in August swamped farmland and industrial hubs in Punjab, killing more than 1,000 people, displacing 2.5 million and damaging crops and factories, tightening food supplies across the country. The pressure was compounded by border clashes with Afghanistan that shut major crossings used for food and fuel trade. The two countries later agreed to extend a ceasefire, but crossings remained restricted after October 11, disrupting commerce and deepening shortages in Pakistan’s northwestern regions.
The central bank said the overall economic outlook had improved, with better-than-expected crop yields, stronger industrial activity and a rebound in high-frequency indicators, though risks from global commodity volatility and domestic energy prices remain.
A private survey, meanwhile, showed manufacturing activity contracted for a second straight month in October, though the pace of decline slowed.
The HBL Pakistan Manufacturing PMI rose to 49.6 from 48.0 in September, with firms citing weak demand, higher taxes and power outages as key drags, even as business confidence remained cautiously optimistic. A reading below 50 indicates a contraction.

The PPP said earlier today that its coalition partner PML-N has officially sought its support for a proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment — the idea of which had been floated soon after the 26th Amendment. The development comes even as three dozen petitions challenging most of the 26th Amendment, which had also faced sizeable censure, are pending before the Supreme Court.
The proposals include setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates, ending protection for provincial shares under the National Finance Commission and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces.
 
 

Addressing the situation in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Sanaullah said: “The speculations appear to be such and our media and senior anchors have [created] such a fear about the 27th Amendment as if a storm or disease is coming.”
He said constitutional amendments were always made to update a country’s constitution and make it effective and relevant as per the needs of the present.
Sanaullah further questioned which of the issues raised by the PPP had not already been under constant discussion.
Questioned about the sudden announcement of the proposed amendment by the PPP, he said: “The consultation you’re talking about … this is the start of that discussion which has been underway for the past two to four months. If Bilawal felt it appropriate to talk about this today, then that is his choice.”
He said the government would consult various stakeholders on the issue, but first it would make the amendments public after discussing them with its coalition partners.
The senior PML-N leader said there would be a full debate on the changes and there was nothing to worry about or fear in regards to democracy or any other matter.
Questioned whether the government intended to remove the condition for the opposition and treasury benches to agree on the nominee for the chief election commissioner, Sanaullah strongly rejected the suggestion and said this would not happen.
“The government has no intention for this,” he said.
He also reassured that “the government is not going to impose any calamity in the shape of the 27th Amendment. Whatever reservations are raised, there will be a debate on in a positive and sophisticated manner, no matter how long it takes.”
He stressed that any eventual amendment would be made after reaching a consensus.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said in an interview on GTV News show ‘G for Gharidah’ that the amendment was aimed at bringing education and population control back under federal control.
Changing stances
The government had last year passed the 26th Constitutional Amendment. It was passed by parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
Even though the 26th Amendment remains mired in controversy and faces challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad are abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
In August, however, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said during a press conference that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Bilawal had also previously dismissed talk of any potential legislation regarding a 27th Amendment as “baseless rumours”.
But, the ruling coalition now seems to be steering in a different direction.
The matter of the proposed legislation had reportedly come up during an Oct 27 meeting between Bilawal and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. The two leaders had met to discuss the prevailing political situation and formulate a joint strategy on key national issues.
JUI-F sources said that the focus of the discussion was to formulate a collective strategy related to new legislation and develop parliamentary cooperation between the PPP and the JUI-F. They claimed that Bilawal had stressed during the meeting the importance of the role of opposition parties in the upcoming legislation.
Meanwhile, opposition PTI has been criticising the proposed amendment.
In June, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) had also endorsed the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges. Speaking at a press conference, IHCBA President Syed Wajid Hussain Gilani had stated that the legal fraternity welcomed the 27th Amendment, which followed the precedent set by the 26th Constitution Amendment.</p><small>2025-11-03 19:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03225608d0bd1a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952923/fact-check-viral-videos-of-indian-army-officials-criticising-tri-military-exercises-as-optics-stunt-for-bihar-elections-are-doctored' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral videos of Indian army officials criticising tri-military exercises as optics stunt for Bihar elections are doctored</strong></a><br><p>Multiple people on social media platform X shared two separate videos on Friday and Monday, claiming to show Indian army officials criticising recent tri-military exercises as a political move to boost the image for the upcoming Bihar elections. However, the videos are dubbed over.
India kicked off large-scale combined military exercises named ‘Trishul 2025’ near its western border on October 30 amid heightened regional tensions. The war games, involving armoured divisions, fighter aircraft and advanced drone systems, are being held across Rajasthan and Punjab to test rapid deployment capabilities. Indian defence officials have described the drills as routine preparedness measures.
Meanwhile, upcoming elections are scheduled in Bihar, India, for the state’s legislative assembly from November 6-11, 2025.
On Friday, an X account, that appears to be anti-Indian based upon its previous posts and is known for repeatedly sharing AI-altered videos, posted a clip with the following caption: “Breaking news: Bikaner, Rajasthan | South Western Army Commander Lt Gen Manjinder Singh says, ‘We all know these so called threshold exercises are being pushed for political optics to boost the image of incumbent government before Bihar elections but still we will give our best because we are professional soldiers, not saffron mobs.’”
The post gained over 38,100 views.
The transcript of the video is provided below:
“Soldiers, we all know these so-called threshold exercises are being pushed for political optics to boost image for the Bihar elections. But remember, we serve India, not any party. Our duty is to defend the nation, not to become props in political theatre.
They may try to saffronise our image, but the Indian army belongs only to the republic, not to Modi, not to any ideology. We will perform our duties with professionalism, go to these exercises with discipline, and show the world that the Indian army stands for India, not for politics. Jai Hind.”
The same video with similar claims was shared by multiple pro-Pakistani accounts on X, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here, colelctively gaining 35,000 views.
Separately today, an Indian account that appears to be anti-BJP, based upon its previous posts, shared a video of Indian Colonel Sofia Qureshi at a press briefing with the caption: “These Trishul exercises are nothing but a political gimmick to sway the Bihar elections. I’m done being used as a prop for Muslim support. I can’t stand the saffronisation of the Indian Army.”
In the video, which had a watermark of Indian news agency ANI, the Indian military officer could be heard saying: “Today, I stand here not as a political pawn but as a soldier of the Indian army. For two and a half years, I have served my country with pride, until I realised we were being used as props to divide our own citizens.
“The saffronisation of our ranks is a betrayal of every oath we took. Our job is to defend India, not the ideology of the BJP or RSS. These so-called Trishul exercises before the Bihar elections are nothing but a theatre to fool the nation. Uniforms are being printed in ideology, not honour.
“This must stop now. If speaking the truth costs my uniform, so be it. I still stand with India, not with hate.”
The post gained 47,000 views.
The video and claim were also shared by a Pakistani propaganda account, based on its previous posts, with the caption: “Breaking News: Col Sofya Qureshi explodes on live TV, ‘These Trishul exercises are nothing but a political gimmick aimed at manipulating the Bihar Elections. I am sick and tired of being used as a prop for Muslim support. I can’t stand with saffronization of the Indian army’.”
The post racked up 29,400 views.
Others on X also shared the video along with the claim, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, and here, collectively garnering over 20,000 views.
Fact-checks were initiated to determine the veracity of the claims due to their virality and keen public interest in the purported political statements attributed to Indian military officers amid regional tensions.
Analysing the first video using the forensic tool Hive Moderation to determine the authenticity of the video shows it detected 99.8 per cent potential AI manipulation.
 


A reverse-image search conducted to trace the original footage yielded an X video uploaded on October 30, 2025, by Indian news outlet IANS with the following caption: “Bikaner, Rajasthan: Sapta Shakti Command Manjinder Singh says, ’The Indian army is following the political direction of new normal, under which, any terror act in the country will be considered as act of war. And the military has to prepare for any such activities … A lot of technologies and capabilities have been introduced for this… Our focus is on maximum night training, hence we are carrying out 70 per cent of the training at night and 30pc of it during the day.“
 






In the video, Singh delivered an address during a press conference after witnessing an exercise codenamed “Sentinel Strike” at the Mahajan Field Firing Range (Thar Desert). At no point did he discuss Indian domestic politics or make any remarks about the politicisation of the Trishul exercises.
The briefing was covered by multiple Indian media outlets such as WION news and The Economic Times, but did not mention any criticism of the Indian army’s alleged politicisation.
Analysing the second video using the forensic tool AI Video Detector shows that the clip was flagged as “suspicious” with a 60pc deepfake probability score. Deepware, another tool, also detected it as suspicious with an 84pc deepfake score.
 


 


Additionally, a reverse image search conducted to trace the original footage yielded an X video uploaded on October 31, 2025, by Indian news outlet ANI. It stated that Col Sofia spoke at the Young Leaders Forum in Delhi.
“Colonel Sofiya Qureshi says … responsibilities for defending a nation are not just the military’s game; civilians also play a role in addressing external and internal threats … Over the years, the Indian army has trained officers and troops in ‘Saashtra’ and ‘Shashtra’,” the caption of the post read.
It added: “‘Saashtra’ means knowledge, strategy, and wisdom, while ‘Shashtra’ means weaponry and warfare, representing a blend of intellect and strength … Every generation has carried the flame of patriotism, from baby boomers to Gen Z … Be it seven decades ago or Operation Sindoor, you all have witnessed it … You, the ‘Yuva Shakti of Bharat,’ you are the force of multipliers. You are not only trained in firepower, but also in the firewalls. You are ready to face kinetic and non-kinetic domains … War is not only fought in bunkers or with bullets, but also with bites and bandwidths.”
 






The reverse image search also yielded the full video of Col Sofia’s speech uploaded on YouTube by ANI. In the clip, Col Sofia spoke about the Indian youth and the role they play in national security.
 


However, at no point did she discuss Indian domestic politics or make any remarks about the politicisation of the Trishul exercises.
Her speech was covered by multiple Indian media outlets such as WION News, Indian Economic Observer and Hindustan Times. None of the reports mentioned any criticism of the alleged politicisation of the Indian army or of the tri-military exercises as a political gimmick.
Therefore, the fact-checks determined that the claims that two viral videos show Indian Southwestern Army Commander Lt Gen Manjinder Singh and military spokesperson Colonel Sofia Qureshi criticising the recent Trishul exercises as political optics to boost the image for the Bihar elections are false.
The clips are doctored and have been dubbed over through AI-generated audio.

Sindh Chief Minister inaugurated the Traffic Regulation and Citation System (TRACS), commonly known as the e-ticketing system, at the Central Police Office (CPO) last week.
He explained that the new system replaces the outdated manual ticketing process with a fully automated e-ticketing mechanism, utilising advanced AI-integrated CCTV cameras to detect violations such as speeding, red-light jumping, and helmet non-compliance.
Of the 29,609 tickets issued, 17,639 of them were issued to drivers not wearing a seatbelt, while 6,362 were issued to motorcyclists not wearing helmets, the data shows. Another 1,967 tickets were issued for speeding, while 1,655 were issued for running through red lights.
Meanwhile, 943 tickets were issued for using mobile phones while operating a vehicle and 298 were handed out for having tinted windows and glass. For parking in a ‘no-parking’ zone, 165 tickets were issued, while 162 were issued to motorists using the wrong side of the road; 44 tickets were handed to people going the wrong way on a one-way street.
Additionally, 152 motorists were ticketed for having passengers on the roof of their vehicle, and 91 others were caught violating stop lines. An additional 65 tickets were handed out due to lane line violations, with 44 tickets issued to vehicles carrying an improper load and 37 for being overloaded.
No tickets were issued for having “fancy number plates”, sudden lane changes or expired tax.
In June, the Sindh government decided that e-challans for traffic violations would be delivered to vehicle owners’ registered home addresses. Vehicles with unpaid fines would not be allowed to be sold or transferred.
The decision came amid Karachi witnessing a surge in traffic accidents, particularly involving dumpers and water tankers, that killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
The spate of deadly incidents triggered protests over citizens’ deaths, prompting the provincial government to ban heavy vehicles during daytime hours and require them to obtain fitness certificates.</p><small>2025-11-03 17:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03221910c5fa3b6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952944/pti-imran-should-take-a-step-back-govt-should-create-space-for-engagement-fawad' target='_blank'><strong>PTI, Imran should ‘take a step back’; govt should create space for engagement: Fawad</strong></a><br><p>Former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said on Monday that both the government and the PTI, along with Imran Khan, need to show flexibility in order to create space for engagement to decrease the political friction in the country.
Fawad is one of the three former PTI leaders who say they have been engaging with the party’s incarcerated leadership to put an end to politics of confrontation as part of their political outreach initiative.
They also visited PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi, after he was taken to a hospital in Lahore from prison, on Thursday, to convince him to join their campaign.
“I’ve said this from the first day, the government should move one step forward and the PTI and Imran Khan should move back one step so space is created,” said the former PTI leader while speaking during an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘News Wise’.
He maintained that both sides would have to decide on the need to bring down the temperature, warning that if the PTI did not pursue engagement and talks, it would face similar treatment as the disbanding and ban on the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan.
“The government needs this, because whatever international successes they have gained are not translating into Pakistan … so both sides need the temperature to come down. We think the leaders of Lahore should play the role of a pivot and take this forward.”
Chaudhry added that the immediate need was to lower the political temperature, saying talks could not proceed if both sides could not even bear to see each other.
Defending his former party’s obstinacy against engagement in talks, he said it was also due to the behaviour of the government, which had made a policy of “crushing and sidelining” the opposition.
“The two ruling parties, the establishment and the PTI, are the four big players and the political temperature between them should come down. How will that happen? …you will have to give the leadership in Lahore’s jail the chance to talk to Imran Khan.”
He further said that the establishment and the government needed to decide whether the country needed a reduction in political temperature or not. “I am very hopeful they have this view too.”
Referring to the group’s recent activities, Chaudhry said they had a meeting of at least 45 minutes with Qureshi.
He added that the proposal being carried by the group was not even their own, instead pointing to a letter by incarcerated PTI leaders in Lahore earlier this year, which called for a reduction in political friction and encouraged engagement.
Chaudhry was not without criticism for the government, saying it had backed the PTI into a corner. “If you don’t engage with the PTI, the only way forward it has is to protest,” he said.
The former federal minister added that in such a situation, the PTI could lead a protest to Islamabad and resign from the National Assembly, while the government would attempt to impose governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which would be resisted by the party.
 
 

“Another event like November 26, 2024, will happen, and as a result of this, the tensions and political temperature in Pakistan will increase. The problem right now is that, we the people, living in Pakistan are being severely impacted by this,” he said, adding that the group had requested the incarcerated PTI leaders in Lahore that if there was no implementation of their earlier recommendation, it would lead to great loss for both the party and the government.
He also said the fact that the group was allowed to meet the incarcerated PTI leadership in Kot Lakpat jail was an encouraging sign.
“Senior government ministers called me and appreciated the effort,” he said, pointing to Information Minister Attaullah Tarar’s welcoming of the development in particular.
“Senior PTI leadership also called and said that this is the only way.”</p><small>2025-11-03 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/0321374534a7c9e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952943/lhc-expresses-displeasure-at-anti-smog-measures-lack-of-enforcement' target='_blank'><strong>LHC expresses displeasure at anti-smog measures, lack of enforcement</strong></a><br><p>The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday expressed its displeasure at the city administration’s lack of action to counter smog and pollution, questioning the use of anti-smog guns and tree cutting in the metropolis.
Last Wednesday, Lahore ranked as the most polluted city in the world in terms of air quality, according to global monitor IQAir. As of today, it still leads the world in terms of poor air quality, registering an air quality index (AQI) reading of 259, which the monitor considers very unhealthy.
 
 

The Punjab government has tried numerous methods to reduce the smog, including limiting citizens’ time moving in the city, fining industrial units and brick kilns causing pollution and using ‘anti-smog guns’ to fire tiny droplets of water into the air, cleaning dust and other particulates.
According to a Dawn correspondent present during the hearing, LHC Justice Shahid Karim summoned the Director General of the Punjab Environment Protection Department, Hamid Sheikh, and questioned why trees are being cut down, despite a court order prohibiting it.
Justice Karim also heard petitions on poor air quality. A lawyer representing the Lahore Parks and Horticultural Authority (PHA) noted that a case has been registered since a banyan tree was felled within the limits of the Cantonment board.
“It is not possible to reverse the damage caused by tree cutting, nor is there anyone to stop it,” the petitioner’s counsel argued.
The government’s lawyer argued that winds from India had caused air quality to plummet, to which the petitioner’s lawyer rebutted that there is no evidence to back up the claim.
Afterward, the court heard the case on smog remediation and Justice Karim expressed concern over increasing pollution and displeasure over the failure to enforce new working hours for restaurants, also questioning the use of anti-smog guns.
Additionally, the court summoned Lahore Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza on November 4, also ordering action against smoke-emitting vehicles and hinting at holding a smog remediation hearing on a daily basis.
“These court proceedings are not against any one person, but aim to guide and assist the government,” the judge stated. “This court has been working on smog remediation for the past seven years. Had you read the previous orders, you would know what work we are doing here.
“Instead of blaming others, we need to resolve the situation ourselves,” he added.</p><small>2025-11-03 16:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031718052d4ebbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952930/pakistan-has-re-established-itself-as-respected-voice-in-regional-intl-forums-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan has re-established itself as respected voice in regional, int’l forums: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Monday that Pakistan had successfully re-established itself as a respected voice in regional and international forums due to the efforts of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“Through the prime minister’s sustained diplomatic outreach, Pakistan has successfully re-established itself as a respected voice in regional and international forums, from the United Nations and SCO to OIC and the World Economic Forum,” said the defence minister while addressing a seminar organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Islamabad.
He said the government’s current diplomacy reflected a “confident and forward-looking” Pakistan that engaged constructively, built bridges and believed in the power of partnerships.
“These achievements reaffirm a simple truth. When guided by clarity of purpose, coherence of policy and continuity of engagement, Pakistan’s diplomacy becomes its strongest national asset. Ladies and gentlemen, our journey of diplomacy is far from over. The progress we have made is both tangible and inspiring.
“Pakistan’s foreign policy is once again being recognised for its maturity, balance and forward direction.”
Asif added that at the core of Pakistan’s renewed diplomatic activism lay economic diplomacy, guided by the prime minister’s “vision of transforming foreign knowledge”.
The defence minister also lauded the vital role of Pakistan’s ambassadors in diplomatic missions abroad.
“Our envoys have been at the forefront of advancing Pakistan’s vision of global engagement and an economically connected Pakistan. Their tireless efforts in strengthening bilateral ties, facilitating investment, promoting trade and projecting Pakistan’s positive image have significantly contributed to our recent diplomatic success.”
Reiterating the foreign policy successes, he said relations with Saudi Arabia had entered a “new era of mutual confidence and economic cooperation” after the prime minister’s recent engagements reinvigorated strategic cooperation and opened pathways to multi-billion dollar investments in diverse sectors.
He said relations with Qatar and the United Arab Emirates had also deepened, adding that both had expressed interest in expanding their economic footprint in Pakistan.
 
 

With the United States, Asif said Pakistan continues to build a “broad-based and balanced partnership”, adding that recent diplomatic engagements emphasised cooperation in trade, technology, climate resilience and counter-terrorism, along with reaffirming Pakistan’s “constructive role as a bridge between regions and interests”.
The relationship with China, he said, remained an “anchor of regional peace and prosperity”. Asif further said the deepening cooperation with China symbolised a shared vision for connectivity and inclusive growth.
The defence minister added that the outreach to Central Asian republics also represented another “milestone in our diplomacy”.
He said that through active engagement, the prime minister has advanced Pakistan’s role as a gateway for trade and energy transit between Central and South Asia.
“Projects like CASA-1000, TAPI and proposed Trans-Afghan Railway underscore our commitment to regional connectivity, economic integration and shared prosperity.
“In the broader Muslim world, Pakistan has actively sought to revitalise ties with Iran, Turkiye and Egypt. These engagements are grounded in shared faith, mutual respect and collective aspirations for peace and development. Our deepening cooperation with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation further amplifies Pakistan’s diplomatic voice on issues such as Islamophobia, Palestinian rights and humanitarian relief in Gaza and Afghanistan,” he said.
On his first visit to the US in February after the Trump administration took office, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar boasted that Pakistan had broken its diplomatic isolation through active diplomacy, and called for sweeping global reforms and strengthening the UN to create a more inclusive international order.
In remarks made on separate occasions, Dar said Pakistan was no longer isolated in the global community, adding that the country’s economy was set to take off as a result of his government’s hard work.</p><small>2025-11-03 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631952-afghan-nationals-among-three-terrorists-killed-in-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan nationals among three terrorists killed in KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

“Movement of a group of khwarij, opposite general area Esham, North Waziristan District, who were trying to infiltrate through Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was picked up by the security forces.”
The military’s media wing said troops effecttively engaged the group of khawarij. “As a result of precise and skillful engagement, two khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell.”
In July, the government designated the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan as Fitna al Khawarij, mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan.
The ISPR added that one of the terrorists killed was identified as Qasim, and Afghan national who was serving in the Afghan Border Police.
In another intelligence-based operation (IBO) in KP’s Tank district, security forces killed another terrorist, identified as Ikramuddin aka Abu Dajana, also an Afghan national.
“These incidents reveal continued involvement of Afghan nationals in numerous terrorist activities against innocent civilians and security forces inside Pakistan.”
“Pakistan has repeatedly been asking Interim Afghan Government to ensure effective border management on their side of the border and is expected to fulfil its obligations and deny the use of Afghan soil by Khwarij and involvement of its citizens in terrorism inside Pakistan,” said the ISPR.
The statement added that the security forces of Pakistan remain “resolute and unwavering in their commitment to defend the nation’s frontiers”. A sanitisation operation was launched in the area to eliminate any “other Indian sponsored Kharji”.
Last week, the deputy chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Amjad alias Mazahim, was killed in an IBO.
According to ISPR, Amjad was a deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.</p><small>2025-11-03 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03193841aeb7c06.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952938/fearing-fraud-canada-rejects-most-indian-study-permit-applicants' target='_blank'><strong>Fearing fraud, Canada rejects most Indian study permit applicants</strong></a><br><p>Canada’s clampdown on international students has hit applicants from India particularly hard, government data shows, as what was once a preferred destination loses its allure for Indian students.
Canada lowered the number of international student permits it issues for the second year in a row in early 2025 as part of a broader effort to reduce the number of temporary migrants and address fraud related to student visas.
About 74 per cent of Indian applications for permits to study at Canadian post-secondary institutions in August — the most recent month available — were rejected, compared to about 32pc in August 2023, according to immigration department data provided to Reuters.
By contrast, about 40pc of study permit applications overall in each of those months were refused. About 24pc of Chinese study permits in August 2025 were rejected.
The number of Indian applicants has dropped as well, from 20,900 in August 2023 — when Indians formed just over one quarter of all applicants — to 4,515 in August 2025.
India has been Canada’s top source of international students over the past decade. In August, it also had the highest study-permit refusal rate of any country with more than 1,000 approved applicants.
The spike in refusals of would-be students comes as Canada and India seek to mend ties after more than a year of tension.
Former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement in the 2023 murder of a Canadian in Surrey, British Columbia. India has repeatedly denied the allegations.
An effort to crack down on fraud
In 2023, Canadian authorities uncovered nearly 1,550 study permit applications linked to fraudulent letters of acceptance, most of which originated from India, Canada’s immigration department told Reuters in an email.
Last year, its beefed-up verification system detected more than 14,000 potentially fraudulent letters of acceptance from all applicants, it said.
Canada has implemented enhanced verification for international students and has increased its financial requirements for applicants, the immigration department spokesperson said.
The Indian embassy in Ottawa said the rejection of study permit applications from students in India had come to its attention, but that the issuance of study permits is Canada’s prerogative.
“However, we would like to emphasise that some of the best quality students available in the world are from India, and Canadian institutions have in the past greatly benefited from the talent and academic excellence of these students,” the embassy said in a statement.
Canada’s Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand told Reuters during an October visit to India that Canada’s government is concerned about the integrity of its immigration system but wants to continue having Indian students in Canada.
A drop in Indian enrolment
People who work with would-be international students say they are seeing a higher level of applicant scrutiny.
Michael Pietrocarlo of Border Pass, which helps people apply for Canadian visas, said his firm prepares applicants to show their eligibility beyond what’s required on paper.
He says, for example, when students must demonstrate they have sufficient funds to support themselves, “it’s not enough just to say, ‘Here are some bank statements.’ They may have to go the extra mile and say, ‘Here’s where the money came from.’”
The University of Waterloo, home to Canada’s largest engineering school, has seen a two-thirds decline in the number of students from India entering its undergraduate and graduate programs over the past three to four years.
Ian VanderBurgh, its associate vice president of strategic enrolment management, said the drop was largely due to a government cap on foreign student visas and had altered the composition of the student body.
“We pride ourselves on being an international university,” he said.
The University of Regina and the University of Saskatchewan have also reported a decline in the number of Indian students enrolled.
When Jaspreet Singh, who founded the International Sikh Students Association, came to Canada from India in 2015 to study mechanical engineering, he remembers government posters exhorting newcomers to “Study, work, stay” in the country. That attitude has soured, he said.
Singh is not surprised at the higher rejection rate for Indian study permit applicants, saying he knows fraud is a concern.
But as it becomes harder to get permanent residency or a job in Canada, he says some of those recently rejected appear to not mind: “They are happy they didn’t come.”</p><small>2025-11-03 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031918388a4323e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952937/remand-extended-for-7-nccia-officials-in-bribery-case' target='_blank'><strong>Remand extended for 7 NCCIA officials in bribery case</strong></a><br><p>A Lahore judicial magistrate on Monday awarded three days of physical remand to seven National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) officials and a private individual in a case registered against them for allegedly misusing their authority, extorting money, and taking bribes.
Last week, a Lahore court granted the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) a three-day physical remand of the officials, while a judicial magistrate extended their physical remand for three more days on Friday.
According to a copy of the remand order available with Dawn.com, while the initial allegation involved a bribe of Rs9 million, the amount recovered by the investigating officer was Rs42.5m.
“After hearing argument and perusal of record, it transpires that complainant … moved [an] application that she paid [Rs9m] illegal gratification to Shoaib Riaz AD/FIA, who was [the] investigation officer (IO) in [the] case of her husband,” the order read.
“Complainant also alleged that she got knowledge that a corruption network in NCCIA is active. On which IO made inquiry and found all accused persons/NCCIA officials were found in [the] alleged corruption network. He recorded statements of all [the] accused in which they mentioned details of amount, reason and procedure.”
The remand order noted that Rs9m was recovered from the prime accused, NCCIA Lahore Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, while the remaining Rs33.5m was recovered from five others.
The magistrate awarded remand due to the amount of money recovered during the previous two periods of remand, extending it by another three days.
The hearing
During today’s hearing, the FIA prosecutor requested additional remand, arguing that the accused were involved in a “white-collar crime” and that information needed to be gathered about the victims.
The prosecutor stated that “Rs45.8m has been recovered from the accused. The accused needs to be investigated further.”
The lawyer for the accused said it was “strange” that the FIA had no plaintiff in the case and that “they are still looking for them”.
“There has been no statement issued against the accused,” advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq, the representative for the accused, argued.
“This case is weak; they (the prosecutors) are alleging that [the accused] take bribes from call centres,” a lawyer for the accused argued. “There is no name or statement from the call centre.”
Ashfaq argued that the case is “ideal” for dismissal, arguing, “The FIA ​​had four opportunities to investigate, but it was not done. The case was made and was operating on verbal testimony.”
He further argued that there is no scope in financial crimes for verbal testimony and asked why, in a bribery case, details about sums of money and serial numbers were not included.
“There is no such declaration on the record,” Ashfaq stated. “They can continue their investigation and appear before the court again when all their records are collected.”
The federal government established the NCCIA to probe illegal activities on social med­ia. The NCCIA, operating under the Interior Divi­sion, has a key role in combating cybercrime in Pakistan.
The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi, the wife of YouTuber Saadur Rehman alias Ducky Bhai, who was arrested in a case pertaining to promoting gambling apps on social media.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered by a total of nine individuals, including eight NCCIA officials, at 7:35pm. Among them, the six remanded in the FIA custody were said to be missing for several days before the FIA announced their arrest last week.</p><small>2025-11-03 14:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631942-pti-rejects-proposed-27th-amendment-open-to-talks-with-ppp-on-nfc' target='_blank'><strong>PTI rejects proposed 27th Amendment, open 'to talks with PPP' on NFC</strong></a><br><p>

PTI-backed independent candidate Mehar Sharafat had filed the petition, claiming that he initially emerged victorious in the constituency based on the Form 45 results. The tribunal was presided over by retired justice Rana Zahid Mahmood.
He alleged that the results were later manipulated using Form 47 to declare Maryam the victor. He had asked the tribunal to set aside Maryam’s victory notification and declare him a returned candidate. Maryam had secured 23,598 and Sharafat obtained 21,491 votes in the Feb 8 general election.
An order of the election tribunal dated October 21 emerged today, which said that the counsel for the petitioner advanced “very short arguments … and it is important to mention that his arguments are general in nature with regard to allegations of corruption and corrupt practices during the election process in the constituency concerned, however, has not addressed any substantial legal arguments to explain the deficiencies in the verification process together with attestation”.
The order also highlighted various other procedural errors and flaws in the petition submitted by the PTI-backed candidate.
Responding to the development, Sharafat issued a challenge to the chief minister, saying that he would not only pay a fine of Rs20 million but also issue a public apology and leave politics forever if she publicly proved her victory and his defeat.
 






The Commonwealth Observer Group concluded last month that critical decisions by key institutions “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness” of Pakistan’s 2024 general elections and created an ‘unlevel playing field’ that consistently limited one political party.
In its long-delayed election observation report, the group noted that the PTI was primarily affected by these actions.
The findings were released in the group’s final report, made public nearly 11 months after its submission on Nov 20, 2024. The report serves as a detailed charge sheet on the electoral process, from the pre-election environment to post-election legal changes.</p><small>2025-11-03 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031900320160fae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952933/christian-muslim-nigerians-push-back-on-threatened-us-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Christian, Muslim Nigerians push back on threatened US strikes</strong></a><br><p>Nigerians across the religious spectrum pushed back Monday on US President Donald Trump’s threats of military intervention over the killing of Christians in the country.
Africa’s most populous country, which is roughly evenly split between a mostly Christian south and Muslim-majority north, is home to myriad conflicts, which experts say kill both Christians and Muslims without distinction.
Claims of Christian “persecution” in Nigeria have found traction online among the US and European right in recent weeks.
“Christians are being killed, we can’t deny the fact that Muslims are (also) being killed,” Danjuma Dickson Auta, a Christian and community leader, told AFP.
Trump said on social media over the weekend that he had asked the Pentagon to map out a possible plan of attack.
Asked by an AFP reporter aboard Air Force One if he was considering putting US troops on the ground or using air strikes, Trump replied: “Could be, I mean, a lot of things — I envisage a lot of things.”
“They’re killing the Christians and killing them in very large numbers,” he said Sunday. “We’re not going to allow that to happen.”
Ethnic violence
Auta, 56, hails from Plateau state, where Christians and Muslims have long lived side by side.
The state has also seen explosions of violence — including deadly sectarian riots in the capital Jos in 2001 and 2008.
In recent years, Plateau and other states in Nigeria’s “Middle Belt” have suffered deadly clashes between mostly Christian farmers and Fulani Muslim herders over dwindling land and resources.
The conflict has often resulted in massive death tolls on the side of the farmers, with entire villages razed.
Smaller-scale attacks on herders — including retaliatory killings of random ethnic Fulanis or their cattle — often generate fewer headlines in both the local and international press.
Though the violence often falls across ethnic and religious lines, experts say the root causes lie in poor land management and policing in rural areas.
Words like “genocide” have been thrown around by those in Plateau frustrated by the escalating violence, though typically in ethnic, not religious terms.
Claims of a “Christian genocide”, meanwhile, have been pushed in recent years by separatist groups in the southeast.
US-based firm Moran Global Strategies has been lobbying on behalf of separatists this year, advising congressional staff on what it said was Christian “persecution”, according to disclosure forms.
Nigeria suggests Trump-Tinubu meeting
Nigeria also faces a long-running jihadist conflict in its northeast, and “bandit” gangs in the northwest who conduct kidnappings and village raids.
The north’s population is mostly Muslim — meaning most of the victims are, too.
“Even those who sold this narrative of Christian genocide know it is not true,” said Abubakar Gamandi, a Muslim who heads a fishermen’s union in Borno state, the epicentre of the Boko Haram conflict.
Chukwuma Soludo, the Christian governor of Anambra state, also pushed back against US intervention, saying Washington “must act within the realm of international law”.
Others have used the controversy to point out long-festering insecurity in the country, and Trump’s rhetoric has resonated with some in Nigeria.
Reverend Joseph Hayab, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria for the country’s north, said he rejected the framing of “farmer-herder violence” and called Trump’s comments a “wake-up call”.
“People are twisting the story as if Trump said he is coming to fight Nigeria. No, he is coming to deal with terrorists,” he told AFP.
Amid Trump’s ratcheted-up rhetoric, the Nigerian presidency suggested a meeting between the two leaders to resolve the issue.
Daniel Bwala, spokesman for Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, said, “Donald Trump has his own style of communication”.
Bwala suggested to AFP Sunday that Trump’s post was a way to “force a sit-down between the two leaders so they can iron out a common front to fight their insecurity”.
Trump previously attacked South Africa over what he called a “genocide” against its Dutch-descended Afrikaner community, and has offered them refugee status.
Critics of the president said the rhetoric was part of Trump’s hardline diplomatic strategy.</p><small>2025-11-03 14:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631939-lhc-expresses-dissatisfaction-over-punjab-govts-anti-smog-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>LHC expresses dissatisfaction over Punjab govt's anti-smog efforts</strong></a><br><p>

The far-right Jewish Power party, led by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, submitted the bill, which will go to a first reading in the Knesset (Israeli parliament)  on Wednesday.
The draft law states: “The death penalty shall be imposed on any person who intentionally, or through indifference, causes the death of an Israeli citizen out of racist motives, hatred, or intent to harm the State of Israel.”
Bills in Israel must pass three readings in the Knesset to become law.
Israel’s public broadcaster KAN reported that Coordinator Gal Hirsch told the Knesset’s National Security Committee on Monday that Netanyahu had expressed support for the measure. Hirsch said he had previously opposed the bill “because of the risk it posed to the lives of the living hostages in Gaza”.
“The hostages are now alive, and therefore my opposition no longer stands,” he added.
Also on Monday, the Knesset’s National Security Committee approved sending the bill to its first reading, according to a statement from the Jewish Power Party. Ben-Gvir has repeatedly called for a law authorising the execution of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
In October, Hamas released 20 Israeli living captives as part of a ceasefire deal brokered under United States President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan.
 
 

More than 10,000 Palestinians are currently held in Israeli prisons, including women and children, and face torture, starvation and medical neglect, according to Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups. Several detainees have died in custody.
Rights organisations say Ben-Gvir has sharply worsened prison conditions, restricting family visits, cutting food rations and limiting prisoners’ access to showers.</p><small>2025-11-03 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631923-constitutional-amendment-only-possible-after-political-consensus-ahsan-iqbal' target='_blank'><strong>Constitutional amendment only possible after political consensus: Ahsan Iqbal</strong></a><br><p>

Separately, the PPP also issued a similar statement that quoted Bilawal as saying that the proposal included setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates and the matter of transfer of judges. It also included the end of protection for the provincial share under the National Finance Commission and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces, the statement further quoted Bilawal as saying.
 






He added that the proposed amendment also included a provision about the return of the subjects of education and population planning to the federation and a point about ending the stalemate regarding appointments to the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Bilawal said a session of the PPP’s central executive committee (CEC) had been called after President Zardari’s return from Doha on November 6 for deciding the party policy on the matter.
A subsequent post by the PPP said the CEC session would be held at Bilawal House in Karachi, where overall political situation in the country would also be discussed.
 






‘Have not properly started working on draft’
Later, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik confirmed while speaking to Geo News that discussions regarding the amendment had been and were still ongoing, adding that, however, they had not properly started working on the preparation of a draft.
Referring to Bilawal’s statement from earlier today, he also outlined the proposal’s salient features and provided brief explanations for their inclusion.
The state minister said the establishment of constitutional courts remained an “unfinished agenda” and also underscored the need for changes regarding the executive magistrate so that the burden on courts could be reduced.
Regarding population explosion, he said the “menace” had to be addressed and it needed a “federal approach”. Similarly, he continued, a lack of cohesion was observed among provinces in the area of education in terms of quality and curriculum.
“And even when we see this matter in the context of terrorism in the country — and there is also an element of radicalisation — I think there should be an oversight at the federal level,” he said, emphasising the need for a uniform and single curriculum across the country.
Moreover, the minister pointed out that it was for the first time after the promulgation of the 1973 Constitution that an official had been elevated to the position of Field Marshal.
Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir was made Field Marshal following a four-day escalation between India and Pakistan in May.
Malik said this development, too, had to be addressed in the constitutional scheme of things and recognised, making a case for amendments to Article 243.
Asked whether the government intended to make amendments to this constitutional provision only with this intent, the state minister replied they had not moved on to the step of fine-tuning things yet.
On the deadlock over the appointment of the chief election commissioner, Malik was asked whether the government intended to end the role of the opposition leader in the process.
To that, he said it was not so, but the deadlock also had to be addressed. “If a situation arises that there is no opposition leader and the process is facing delays [due to that], you have to [find a way out.”
Regarding the inclusion of the National Finance Commission in the proposal, he  acknowledged that it required political consensus, “which we are developing with our allies”.
Moreover, the “present situation also has to be factored in […] and this has to be looked at from two to three different angles”, the minister added.
Changing stances
The government had last year passed a 26th Constitutional Amendment. It was passed by parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
Even though the 26th Amendment remains mired in controversy and faces challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad are abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
In August, however, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar had said during a press conference that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Bilawal had also previously dismissed talk of any potential legislation regarding a 27th Amendment as “baseless rumours”.
But, the ruling coalition now seems to be steering in a different direction.
The matter of the proposed legislation had reportedly come up during an Oct 27 meeting between Bilawal and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. The two leaders had met to discuss the prevailing political situation and formulate a joint strategy on key national issues.
JUI-F sources said that the focus of the discussion was to formulate a collective strategy related to new legislation and develop parliamentary cooperation between the PPP and the JUI-F. They claimed that Bilawal had stressed during the meeting the importance of the role of opposition parties in the upcoming legislation.
Meanwhile, opposition PTI has been criticising the proposed amendment.
In June, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) had also endorsed the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges. Speaking at a press conference, IHCBA President Syed Wajid Hussain Gilani had stated that the legal fraternity welcomed the 27th Amendment, which followed the precedent set by the 26th Constitution Amendment.</p><small>2025-11-03 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/03163451dbc4cbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952926/uk-police-charge-british-man-with-10-counts-of-attempted-murder-in-train-attack' target='_blank'><strong>UK police charge British man with 10 counts of attempted murder in train attack</strong></a><br><p>A man has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder following a mass stabbing on a London-bound train, British Transport Police said on Monday.

He was also charged with another count of attempted murder and possession of a knife over a separate incident in London on the same day, a statement said.
Tracy Easton of the Crown Prosecution Service said the investigation had involved a “huge volume of evidence, including CCTV”.
“We know the devastating impact the events on Saturday’s train has had and how the incident shocked the entire country. Our thoughts remain with all those affected,” she said.

The 6.3-magnitude quake struck overnight at a depth of 28 kilometres with the epicentre near the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS).
More than 20 people were killed and around 320 were injured in the provinces of Balkh and Samangan, health ministry spokesman Sharafat Zaman told journalists on Monday morning, stressing that this was a preliminary toll.
He did not provide a province-wide breakdown of the casualties.
 






Expressing sorrow over the “tragic loss of lives in northern Afghanistan after the deadly earthquake near Mazar-e-Sharif”, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X that Pakistan “stands in solidarity with our Afghan brothers and sisters in this difficult hour”.
“Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and prayers for the swift recovery of the injured,” he said.
 






Residents of Mazar-i-Sharif, one of Afghanistan’s largest northern cities, scrambled into the streets due to fears their homes would collapse, an AFP correspondent observed.
The city’s famed Blue Mosque, a 15th-century landmark known for its vibrant tiles, was also damaged, an AFP journalist witnessed.
Pieces of the structure, particularly from one of its minarets, broke off and lay scattered across the mosque’s grounds, one of the country’s few remaining tourist spots.

Correspondents in the capital Kabul, around 420km to the south, also said they felt shaking.
Power supply company DABS said imported electricity lines from Uzbekistan had been cut off due to the earthquake, leaving parts of nine provinces without power, Tolo News reported.
 






The Afghan Taliban defence ministry said parts of Balkh and Samangan provinces were the most affected, resulting in fatalities among a number of citizens.
Military Rescue and emergency assistance teams reached the area immediately and began operations to rescue people, transport the injured, and assist affected families, it said in a statement.
 






The USGS issued an orange alert in its PAGER system, which is an automated system that produces information on the impact of earthquakes, and indicated that “significant casualties are likely and the disaster is potentially widespread”.
Videos of rescue efforts being carried out to save people trapped under rubble and images of fallen debris in buildings were shared on the social media platform X.
One video showed rescuers pulling what appeared to be dead bodies from rubble. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage and the images.
Active faults
Earthquakes are common in Afghanistan, particularly along the Hindu Kush mountain range, near where the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates meet.
Many homes in the predominantly rural country — devastated by decades of war — are shoddily built.
It often takes hours or days to travel by steep roads and paths to remote villages, which are often cut off from help during disasters or poor weather.
Poor communication networks and infrastructure in mountainous Afghanistan have hampered disaster responses in the past, preventing authorities for hours or even days from reaching far-flung villages to assess the extent of the damage.
It is the latest natural disaster for the Taliban government, which has faced three major deadly earthquakes since taking over Afghanistan in 2021, even as the foreign aid that formed the backbone of the country’s economy has dramatically dropped.
 
 

In August, a shallow 6.0-magnitude quake in the country’s east wiped out mountainside villages and killed more than 2,200 people.
Large tremors in western Herat, near the Iranian border, in 2023, and in eastern Nangarhar province in 2022 killed hundreds and destroyed thousands of homes.
The United Nations and aid agencies have warned that hunger is rising among the Afghan population.
The isolated country is suffering from a humanitarian crisis compounded by drought, economic restrictions on the banking sector, and the pushback of millions of Afghan citizens from neighbouring Iran and Pakistan.

Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan confirmed the details to Dawn, adding that the incident took place on Miranshah road, which connects Bannu and North Waziristan.
“Armed men open fire at the vehicle of North Waziristan’s DPO,” RPO Khan said. “The DPO remained unhurt,” he added.
He further said the injured police personnel were taken to the Bannu District Headquarters Hospital.
 
 

“The unidentified attackers have hidden in nearby areas and a search operation is underway [to trace them],” the Bannu RPO said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The past few months have seen an escalation in attacks on law enforcement agencies, with police forces in KP being targeted repeatedly.
Yesterday, a station house officer and two other cops were injured in a blast caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) in KP’s Hangu district. Last week, terrorists kidnapped a police official from Bannu’s Havaid Adda area.
 
 

Separately, the Bannu police on Friday also claimed to have recovered Constable Noor Zaman, who had been kidnapped by terrorists in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali town. The cop was on his way to attend the last rites of his brother, Constable Javed Khan, who had been martyred in a gun attack in Bannu.
Faced with the heightened militancy, security forces have also intensified counter-terrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
Militants in Pakistan suffered their heaviest losses in 10 years during the month of October as security forces intensified operations against them, according to a report by the think-tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p><small>2025-11-03 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/031212330679f3f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1952912/they-do-not-talk-about-it-trump-claims-pakistan-among-countries-testing-nuclear-weapons' target='_blank'><strong>‘They do not talk about it’: Trump claims Pakistan among countries testing nuclear weapons</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump has included Pakistan among countries that he claims are “testing nuclear weapons”, saying that he did not want the US to be the only country that does not do so.
“North Korea has been testing. Pakistan has been testing. […] But they don’t go and tell you about it,” he said in an interview on CBS News programme ‘60 Minutes’, where he was asked about his recent directives to the Pentagon to resume testing nuclear weapons. He also named Russia and China as testing nuclear weapons.
In a recent social media post, Trump had instructed the US Department of War to resume testing nuclear weapons “immediately”. Confusion has surrounded Trump’s order that the US begin testing, particularly if he meant conducting the country’s first nuclear explosion since 1992.
When the matter was brought up during the interview, Trump said: “Well, we have more nuclear weapons than any other country. I think we should do something about denuclearisation. And I did actually discuss that with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and President Xi.
“We have enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world a 150 times. Russia has a lot of nuclear weapons, and China will have a lot,” he said.
At this point, he was interrupted by the interviewer, who asked, “So why do we have to test our nuclear weapons?”
“Well, because you have to see how they work,” replied Trump. “Testing is because Russia announced that they are gonna do a test. If you notice, North Korea is testing constantly, other countries are testing. We are the only country that doesn’t test, I don’t want to be the only country that doesn’t test.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

He was then asked to clarify whether he was saying that the US would start detonating nuclear weapons after more than 30 years.
He replied, “I am saying that we are going to test nuclear weapons like other countries do.”
But the only country that was testing nuclear weapons was North Korea, the interviewer pointed out. Russia and China have not carried out such tests since 1990 and 1996, respectively.
To that, Trump said Russia and China, too, were testing nuclear weapons. “You just don’t know about it.”
When the interviewer pointed out that Russia’s recent test was that of a delivery system for nuclear weapons, which was essentially a missile, Trump asserted: “Russia is testing, and China is testing, but they don’t talk about it.”
He added: “We are an open society. We are different, we talk about it. We have to talk about it. Because, otherwise, you people are going to report. They don’t have reporters who can be writing about it. We do.
“We are gonna test because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea has been testing. Pakistan has been testing. […] But they don’t go and tell you about it. And as powerful as they are — you know it’s a big world, you don’t necessarily know where they are testing. They test way underground where people don’t know exactly what’s happening with the test. You feel a little bit of a vibration.
“They test, and we don’t test. We have to test. And Russia did make a, you know, little bit of a threat the other day when they said they were gonna do certain forms of a different level of testing. But Russia tests, China does test, and we are gonna test also.”
Trump went on to say: “This just doesn’t make sense. You know, you make nuclear weapons and then you don’t test. How are you gonna do that? How are you gonna know if they work? We have to do that.”
Dawn has reached out to the Foreign Office for a comment on Trump’s assertion that Pakistan is among the countries that are testing nuclear weapons.
During the conversation on ‘60 Minutes’, the interviewer also remarked that “apparently, we don’t need to test our nuclear weapons because they are the best in the world, according to experts I have spoken to”.
To that, Trump replied: “According to me, we have the best. And I was the one that renovated them and built them during a four-year period, and I hated to do that. Because the destructive capability is something you don’t even want to talk about. But if other people are gonna have them, we are gonna have to have them.
“And if we have them, we have to test them. Otherwise, you don’t really know how they are gonna work. And we don’t want to ever use them.”
‘Responsible nuclear-weapons state’
Asked about Trump’s comments on Monday, China’s foreign ministry denied conducting nuclear weapons tests.
As a “responsible nuclear-weapons state, China has always … upheld a self-defence nuclear strategy and abided by its commitment to suspend nuclear testing”, spokeswoman Mao Ning said at a regular press conference in Beijing.
She added that China hoped the US would “take concrete actions to safeguard the international nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation regime and maintain global strategic balance and stability”.

The event is being held from today to November 6 (Thursday) at Karachi’s Expo Centre, and will see the participation of 45 countries, including Pakistan. It has been organised under the overall responsibility of the Pakistan Navy and with the support and patronage of federal and provincial departments.
Addressing PIMEC, Iqbal highlighted that Pakistan had a unique geography as the regions of South Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa converged here, which positioned the country as a “natural maritime bridge between the East and the West”.
However, despite these advantages, the maritime sector contributed less than 1pc to Pakistan’s GDP, compared to 4-7pc in several other maritime nations, he lamented.
 


The planning minister pointed out that Pakistan had a coastline of over 1,000 kilometres, an exclusive economic zone of nearly 290,000 square kilometres, and “vast offshore potential” in renewable energy, fisheries and mineral resources.
Noting that the government’s Uraan Pakistan plan aimed to transform Pakistan into a $1tr economy by 2035, Iqbal underscored the importance of the 5Es framework — exports; e-Pakis­tan; equity and empo­werment; environment, and climate change; and energy and infrastructure.
He further said the government had identified “eight key drivers of export-led growth” — agriculture and food processing, manufacturing and industry, information technology and digital services, mines and minerals, manpower and skills export, creative and cultural industries, services sector and tourism, and blue economy.
“In this age of interconnectedness, the oceans have re-emerged as the highways of global commerce, energy and communication, and these nations that harness them wisely are shaping the future of economic power,” Iqbal said.
“The world’s prosperity literally sails on the seas,” the minister noted. Citing the United Nations Trade and Development (Unctad), he highlighted that over 80 per cent of the global trade by volume, and 70pc by value, is carried by sea.
He further said that the global blue economy contributes more than $2.5 trillion annually to the world’s GDP and sustains over 350 million jobs across shipping, ports, fisheries, coastal tourism and other areas.
 
 

During his address, Iqbal termed the spirit of the modern blue economy as seeking God’s “bounty through trade, innovation and exploration while being grateful and responsible stewards of his creation”.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also attended today’s inaugural ceremony.
Terming PIMEC a “great opportunity”, CM Shah said in a statement that the event brings together national and international maritime business leaders, as well as opens new investment doors.
“Sindh government is committed to promoting maritime trade, strengthening ties all over the world,” he asserted.
 






PIMEC’s 2025 edition features 150 local and 28 global exhibitors.
Representatives from 44 countries — such as the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, China, Egypt and Turkiye — are set to attend the event as part of 133 international delegations from Europe, Asia, North and South America, and the Far East.
Experts have said Pakistan’s maritime sector could contribute over $100 billion annually to the national economy and called for urgent action to unlock its potential.</p><small>2025-11-03 08:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/631862-celebrations-for-guru-nanaks' target='_blank'><strong>Celebrations for Guru Nanak's 556th birth anniversary begin in Nankana Sahib</strong></a><br><p>
