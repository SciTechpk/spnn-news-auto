The public broadcaster CBC and other outlets projected the Liberals would form Canada’s next government, but it was not yet clear if they would hold a majority in parliament.
Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre fell short of becoming prime minister, but his party was on track to form a strong opposition in parliament
Trump’s trade war and threats to annex Canada — which he renewed in an election day social media post — outraged Canadians and made dealing with the US a top campaign issue.
 
 

Carney, who had never held elected office and only replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister last month, anchored his campaign on an anti-Trump message.
He previously served as central bank governor in both Britain and Canada and persuaded voters his global financial experience has prepared him to guide Canada through a trade war.
Carney, who also had a lucrative career as investment banker before joining Canada’s public service, promised to expand overseas trading relations to curb Canada’s reliance on the United States.
Carney’s descriptions of the Trump threat have been stark.
“Donald Trump wants to break us so America can own us,” he said during the campaign.
“They want our resources, they want our water, they want our land, they want our country. They can’t have it.”
When the CBC projection was announced, cheers of joy erupted at the Ottawa venue where Liberal supporters were watching the results.
“I’m happy in the sense that we’ve got somebody that can speak to Mr. Trump on his level,” said Dorothy Goubault, 72. “Mr. Trump is a business person. Mr. Carney is a business person, and I think they can both relate.”
Before Trudeau resigned, Trump had mocked him, calling the prime minister “governor” as he urged Canada to become the 51st US state.
Goubault said she expects that mockery to stop.
“It’s not the governor anymore, it’s the prime minister of Canada, and it’s not the 51st state anymore. It’s ‘We are Canada!’”
 


Liberal lawmaker and a member of Carney’s cabinet, Steven Guilbeault, tied the outcome to Trump.
“The numerous attacks by President Trump on the Canadian economy, but not just the economy, on our sovereignty and our very identity, I think have really mobilised Canadians, and I think they saw in Prime Minister Carney someone who has experience on the world stage,” he told the CBC.
Trudeau’s departure
The departure of former prime minister Justin Trudeau was also crucial to the Liberal win, which capped one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history.
On January 6, the day Trudeau announced he would resign, the Conservatives led the Liberals by more than 20 points in most polls, as voter anger over soaring coasts mounted after Trudeau’s decade in power.
But Carney replacing Trudeau, combined with nationwide unease about Trump, transformed the race.
Carney, 60, distanced himself from Trudeau throughout the campaign.
 
 

He said the former prime minister did not focus enough on growing Canada’s economy and scrapped a controversial Trudeau tax on carbon emissions that left many voters seething.
For Poilievre, a 45-year-old who has been in parliament for two decades, the outcome marks a stinging defeat.
He was criticised for the at-times muted anger he directed towards Trump, but said he wanted to keep the focus on domestic concerns that drove Trudeau’s unpopularity.
He tried to persuade voters that Carney would simply offer a continuation of the failed Liberal governance, an argument that fell short.
At the Conservative watch party in Ottawa, Jason Piche told AFP he was surprised by the result.
“I was hoping to have a big celebration tonight,” Piche said.
Nearly 29 million of Canada’s 41 million people were eligible to vote in the massive G7 country that spans six time zones. A record 7.3 million people cast advanced ballots.
Results were still pending on the shape of Canada’s 343 members of parliament, with 172 seats needed for a majority. The Liberals won a majority in 2015 but have governed with a minority since 2019.</p><small>2025-04-29 04:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/68101dffbe138.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907238/sindh-lawyers-refuse-to-end-protests-reject-cci-announcement' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh lawyers refuse to end protests, reject CCI announcement</strong></a><br><p>SUKKUR: The legal fraternity protesting against the controversial canals project on Monday evening decided to continue their sit-ins across Sindh till they receive a ‘clear’ notification regarding permanent cancelation of the plan to construct six canals on the Indus River.
The decision was announced after the meeting of the Council of Common Interests that endorsed the federal government’s move to halt the new canals initiative until “mutual understanding” could be achieved among provinces.
The leadership of lawyers held a meeting at Babarloi Bypass in Khairpur to discussed the outcome of the CCI meeting.
They unanimously rejected what they described as the ambiguous notification issued by the federal government and announced that their protests and sit-ins would continue across Sindh.
They said that they were not satisfied with unclear notification as they [Lawyers] needed a detailed notification stating permanent cancelation of controversial canals.

Demand ‘clear’ notification to permanently abolish six canals projects

They vowed to intensify their protests and said that they would consider other options including to block main railways tracks.
Earlier, lawyers’ sit-in at Babarloi bypass in Khairpur against controversial canals and corporate farming entered 11th day on Monday as their colleagues and different parties and groups staged protests across Sindh during ongoing agitation against the federal plans.
 
 

Karachi Bar Association president Amir Nawaz Warraich told media persons at the sit-in camp that their protest would continue.
He said the lawyers’ consultative committee would hold a huddle on May 2 to announce a future course of action. Negotiations would continue on the remaining three demands, he said.
Awami Tehreek’s central senior vice president, Noor Ahmad Katiar, told the media and party workers at the camp that Sindhi nation would continue its peaceful democratic struggle to protect its land and river.
He demanded immediate withdrawal of the notification allocating 52,713 acres of Sindh’s land to Green Corporate Initiative Private Limited under the guise of corporate farming and so-called Green Corporate Initiative.
He called for the rejection of the Board of Investment Ordinance Amendment Bill, 2023, and complete abolition of the Special Investment Facilitation Council, an institution created through this bill.
Advocate Sarfaraz Metlo, president of Sindh High Court Bar Association, said at a gathering of lawyers in the Jacobabad District Bar Association office that until the decisions to construct canals on Indus and sell Sindh’s land under corporate farming were withdrawn and a written order was issued, their movement would continue.
In Kandhkot, all the roads and highways leading to Punjab from Kandhkot remained blocked for the eighth consecutive day, Monday, due to a sit-in by lawyers and activists of nationalist parties. On Monday, delegations of PTI, journalists, doctors, teachers and students expressed solidarity with the participants of the sit-in against canals.
Lawyers agitating against the controversial canals for several weeks, held sit-ins at various spots in Larkana and Qambar-Shahdadkot districts on Monday. The participants also strongly condemned the aggressive police action against protesting lawyers in Karachi, Kandhkot, Jacobabad and certain other cities and towns.
They boycotted proceedings in high court, district and sessions courts and lower courts in Larkana and Qambar-Shahdadkot districts and blocked the entry of police personnel into the court buildings.
They expressed solidarity with their colleagues who have been holding a prolonged sit-in at Babarloi, Khairpur.
Led by senior lawyers including Mohammed Ismail Abro, Ghulam Mustafa Magsi, lawyers in Larkana started their march from their different courts and converged outside Jinnah Bagh to hold a sit-in to voice their rejection of the controversial canals project. They in strongest terms condemned the Sindh police for applying baton charge on their professional colleagues, lobbying teargas shells, resorting to aerial firing and uprooting the their protest camps in Karachi, Kandhkot, Jacobabad and other areas.
Separately, activists of different political parties and nationalist groups took out rallies and held demonstrations at various places in the two districts to express solidarity with the agitating lawyers
Dr Mazhar Mughal of the SUP, advocates Jawed Buledi of PTI, Siraj Kalhoro of JSM, advocate Saddam of SPSF and others led their respective entity’s rallies, which ended outside the local press club.
Another procession was taken out from Sir Shahnawaz Bhutto Memorial Library which was organised by the Shaheed Bhagat Singh Study Circle. It was led by Amir Chandio, Syed Imran Shah and others
In Umerkot, lawyers set up a protest camp and held a sit-in on the district and sessions court’s entrance.
Advocated Sharif Bheel, Liaquat Sehto, Mian Bakhsh Khoso, Islamuddin Rahimoon, Parshottam Khatri, Ejaz Halepoto, Ayub Sheikh, Lala Bheel and leaders of the district’s legal fraternity led the protesters.
Meanwhile, Umerkot’s Pharma Club organised a rally which started from Moti Chowk and ended outside the local press club. Later, the club’s leaders, including Jai Kumar Khetani, Abdul Jabbar and Raja Khetani joined the protesting lawyers outside the sessions court to express solidarity with them.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader and former Member of National Assembly Lal Malhi also joined the sit-in outside the Umerkot Sessions Court. He rejected the canals project and endorsed all the demands put forward by the agitating lawyers.

“There are two problems for our species’ survival — nuclear conflict and environmental endgame,” Chomsky warned in his 2013 book Nuclear War and Environmental Catastrophe.
The nuclear dimension of the threat is all too well known, but the reference to environmental catastrophe is less widely grasped. It, nevertheless, holds great relevance for South Asia, where rivers are facing the combined adverse consequences of urbanisation, big dams arresting the flow, and snow in the lofty mountain ranges losing cover with global warming. India and Pakistan are both facing the growing twin challenge of flood and drought. A water-sharing dispute would pose a mortal crisis for one or both.
 
 

Also, Kashmir, claimed by three and not just two countries, has increasingly been the venue for devastating floods, the season for which is not far away. The tragedy of Pahalgam is heartrending, but it cannot be redressed with war drums, weaponising water-sharing or spreading hate.
The wider world is grappling with a potentially devastating tussle between Israel and Iran, in which both sides claim to be prepared to inflict and absorb unspeakable damage. Between the two, Iran’s Achilles’ heel may not be the overwhelming firepower of the US and Israeli alliance.
Analysts say Iran has the military wherewithal to seriously damage Israel with conventional weapons. Iran’s less-discussed challenge lies in a crippling water crisis at home. In the event of peace winning the day in the ongoing talks with the US, Iranian rulers would be quickly combating an even more intractable predicament that could turn into a political blight for the rulers. A dispute over the Helmand river with Afghanistan lurks in the background. Water shortages have led to internal migration to northern provinces and cities around Tehran.

The tragedy of Pahalgam is heartrending but it cannot be redressed with war drums.

In the 1980s, an Indian diplomat of Persian origin was travelling from Tehran to Delhi when he coined a quaint description for Dubai, where I happened to be working with a newspaper: “What are you doing in this desalinated water economy?”
Akbar Khalili’s half-mocking comment flowed from Iran’s civilisational history and its neighbourhood boasting the Babylonian civilisation. Civilisations form around water. The two have fought bitter wars over their claims on Shatt al-Arab. Israel took care of its water needs in 1967 by defeating Arab armies and subsequently expanding its reach to Syria’s Golan Heights, a water-rich region that enables Israel to brazenly export its popular brand of ‘kosher wine’. Egypt, harking to another great civilisation, is locked in tense jousting with Sudan and Ethiopia over claims on the Nile.
 
 

“While a nuclear strike would require action, environmental catastrophe is partially defined by wilful inaction in response to human-induced climate change,” Chomsky said in his book. “Denial of the facts is only half the equation. Other contributing factors include extreme techniques for the extraction of remaining carbon deposits, the elimination of agricultural land for bio-fuel, the construction of dams, and the destruction of forests that are crucial for carbon sequestration.” India and Pakistan tick all boxes.
“As if the crisis in the cryosphere was not enough, now we have to deal with weaponisation of water and violation of an international treaty that will destabilise the region further. We need to address survival issues together and find solutions instead of creating new problems,” observed Pakistan’s leading environmentalist, Aisha Khan. She was commenting on X about India’s abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty with an implied intent to divert water from Pakistan-bound rivers.
Fortunately, the plan, if that is what it is, would not be fructifying anytime soon. Pakistan has responded by cautioning India that any diversion of its share of water, if it actually happens, would be deemed an act of war. India’s options, mercifully, remain theoretical until material conditions obtain — involving prohibitive costs and a lead time of at least two decades — to actually carry out the threat. In the meantime, it has left the door open to agreeable possibilities, which can be helped along only by a resumption of talks. A parallel view expressed in The Wire posits that Pakistan could challenge the abeyance of the treaty in the International Court of Justice.
A disturbing feature of the current India-Pakistan stand-off is the heavy use of religious idiom to underpin rivalries. Here they share similarities with two other theatres of war — one raging, the other shaping. The Ukraine-Russia conflict has witnessed the rupture of a historically common church. Ukraine passed a law in August last year to ban religious groups linked to Moscow in a move targeting the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which the government has accused of complicity in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu and his ruling cohorts have summoned biblical references for Palestinians as ‘Amaleks’, scriptural slur for enemies of Israel who deserved to be slaughtered. Netanyahu later offered unconvincing explanations for the hateful remarks.
 
 

The Indian clamour for revenge for the insane killing of 26 tourists, primarily Hindus, in Pahalgam by terrorists believed to be Muslims has targeted Indian Muslims and Pakistan virtually interchangeably. The Jammu and Kashmir assembly had to pass a resolution to condemn the media, chiefly abusive TV channels. Joining the religious fray was the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. He quoted the Ramayana to suggest that it was the duty of the king to protect his people from an evil rival.
Adding to the mix was the claim in Pakistan of an abiding incompatibility between Hindus and Muslims to live together. Had that been so, the Quaid wouldn’t have vehemently opposed the partition of Bengal and Punjab, whose non-Muslim population he envisaged as equal citizens of the Pakistan of his vision.

Published in Dawn, April 29th, 2025</p><small>2025-04-29 04:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/681027e2d7a3a.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907300/with-eyes-wide-open' target='_blank'><strong>With eyes wide open</strong></a><br><p>SIX years after Pulwama, India and Pakistan are back to doing what they do best — being ‘on the brink of a war’ or in an ‘eyeball-to-eyeball’ confrontation, whichever cliché one prefers.
Conflict looms as they trade blame, further scale down diplomatic presence and revoke visas, while skirmishes and troop movements are reported, and the mainstream media engages in a proxy shouting match which the two governments feel is beneath them.
In Pakistan, the question being asked is whether or not there will be another scuffle, dogfights or more, with the ever-present fear of escalation and something bigger. In India, it seems the ask is for Pakistan to be taught a lesson and more.
 
 

All this compels one to wonder if they learnt anything from Pulwama. In an ideal world, Pulwama should have led both countries to realise that limited conflicts can easily escalate into bigger ones. In those tumultuous days, it did seem as if the reality had sunk in.
There has been enough discussion on this side of the border for most of us to know that the decision to strike back after the Balakot attack was not an easy one, despite the fact that it was an exercise the military had prepared for. There were genuine concerns about how it may lead to a wider conflict and what that would mean. This is one reason the government made a quick decision to release the Indian pilot whose plane was shot down, in a bid to cool temperatures.
That the Indian government was also aware of the dangers became clear with revelations by the then US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, that he had been contacted by an Indian official who feared escalation, which was then ‘prevented’ by American intervention. One can only hope that the current crisis will also end in case there is an escalation to strikes or incursions, as is being predicted.

The absolutism of the two states no longer seems to allow any space for peaceniks.

But despite the awareness of the perils of escalation, in Pulwama, both sides walked into a conflict and then looked around for others to stop it. Indeed, even after many decades and wars, neither side has figured out how to avoid or de-escalate a crisis; for this, they count on calling up others to talk them off the ledge.
 
 

Indeed, if this pattern is followed this time too, it shows how difficult — or impossible — conflict management is in the subcontinent; where conflict does not happen because of miscommunication or unintentional escalation, but because the two adversaries walk into it. Unlike what we thought the theory of nuclear states and proxy wars was, little helps maintain peace; in fact, it is now leading to the opposite — for both accuse the other of supporting terrorist activity in each other’s territory and fomenting violence.
This is also why direct communication may not help — for neither side believes the other does not want war. For the moment, only outside intervention can guarantee de-escalation.
The second aspect of the India-Pakistan crises is the role of the media. It grows more hysterical as time goes on. The absolutism of the two states no longer seems to allow any space for peaceniks, only war cries. So much so, that it is hard to tell how much of it is orchestrated or encouraged by the governments themselves and how much of it reflects true public opinion. It is hard to say if journalism is even a sleeping partner to the jingoism that rules the airwaves.
 
 

On our side, recently, a minister congratulated the Pakistani media for ‘defeating’ the ‘propaganda’ of the other side. But such discussions or pressures take on a life of their own eventually, pushing the governments that encouraged the ‘hard talk’ to live up to expectations. It is here where there is room for misunderstanding — because no longer can journalists report what governments are actually thinking or weighing.
Instead, all that is being communicated or ‘reported’ is an intent to war. Eventually, this has and will end up reducing the options for the two governments. Those in India now expect that every incident will lead to something grander than Balakot; at home, every strike will lead to the expectation of a retaliation that will down an Indian jet or more.
As a Pakistani (and a sub editor), however, what is of equal concern is the language of some of the English-language opinion pieces from India. One spoke of the permanent extinction of the artificial state of play created by 1947, and then added details about the borders of an expanded Indian state. Another speaks of how the mood in India is of completing the logic of 1947 or undoing it.
Couple this with the rhetoric around the Indus Waters Treaty, and it seems as if Pakistan faces an existential threat; what else would it mean if the waters which nourish the country are diverted? And the warning takes on a more menacing colour in a world where other states, too, have opted for conflicts which are aimed at the extinction of the other — for example, in Palestine.
 
 

As the world order weakens along with those who set it up (and can no longer afford to hold it up), governments and their people are finding it easier to discard temperate language and policies, and even contracts and understandings reached under that order. The IWT is one of those.
It is worth asking in Pakistan at the moment what the World Bank or any other international institution can do if New Delhi does exit the treaty? And what options will then this leave Islamabad with? The warning that it will be tantamount to war needs sober reflection.

Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, a seven-judge constitutional bench had fixed Monday’s hearing for the AGP to apprise the court about government’s plan to provide right to appeal to the May 9 convicts, after Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman at the previous hearing had informed the bench that the AGP was busy in deliberations with stakeholders, which may take another couple of days.
The bench had taken up a set of 38 intra-court appeals (ICAs) moved by the federal government, provincial governments, Shuhada Forum Balochistan and others against the October 2023 judgement.

Attorney general cites canals controversy, regional tensions as reasons for delay

The next hearing date is May 5.
The AGP explained that the issue of giving the right to appeal to those convicted by the military courts was a policy matter and that he could place any submission before the constitutional bench only after taking proper instructions from the federal government.
Civil system failed?
During the hearing, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail observed that the court had to examine the matter only relevant to the case, though parliament could even take a policy decision that the civil system had failed and send all cases to military courts.
The AGP explained before the constitutional bench that he would advance arguments on three points since senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed who was representing defence ministry had almost covered other points related to the case. Mr Awan explained that he would first provide some details about the May 9 incidents, then dilate upon the assurances he had given to SC at the previous hearing, and lastly his arguments would be about the right to appeal to the May 9 convicts.
Explaining that extending the right to appeal to those who faced military trials was a policy matter, he apprised the court that he could only place the submissions before the court after taking proper instructions on it.
The AGP said the controversial canals issue cropped up and then everyone’s attention was on the prevalent faceoff between India and Pakistan in the wake of Pahalgam terrorist attack. He said he was scheduled to depart for the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Monday but the visit had been cancelled.
 
 

When Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar inquired how much time the AGP would take, he replied that he might take at least 45 minutes.
Earlier in 2023, the AGP had sought time to seek federal government’s instructions regarding provisions of right of appeal to the then accused civilians against the judgement issued in their trials before the independent court.
In addition, the AGP had also assured the bench then that no offence entailing death penalty or a lengthy sentence would be made against any detained civilians.
Also, he had said the accused would have the right to appoint private counsel of their own choice for their defence, family members and legal team of the accused civilians will be allowed to attend the trial proceedings, evidence will be recorded at the trial of the accused under the law and procedure applicable to the criminal courts of ordinary jurisdiction besides the judgment delivered in the trial of the accused will be supported by reasons.

• Beijing, Washington, Ankara and Doha urge measures to calm tensions as neighbours trade fire across Line of Control
ISLAMABAD: As friends in foreign capitals continue to advocate for a de-escalation of tensions in South Asia, Pakistan’s defence min­ister said the country was ready for any incursion by India.
The two neighbours have been trading fire across the Line of Control (LoC) for four days now, with each blaming the other for provocation.
“We have reinforced our forces because it is something which is imminent now. So in that situation some strategic decisions have to be taken, so those decisions have been taken,” Khawaja Asif told Reuters on Monday.
He said the military had briefed the government on the possibility of an Indian attack, but did not go into further details on his reasons for thinking an incursion was imminent.
His remarks follow New Delhi’s increasingly aggressive posturing following an attack in a tourist resort in India-held Kashmir, which claimed over two dozen lives.
Immediately after the Pah­algam attack, India clai­med two of the suspects were from Pakistan, albeit without proof. Islamabad has flatly denied any role and called for a neutral investigation.
In the interview, Mr Asif said Pakistan was on high alert and that it would only use its arsenal of nuclear weapons if “there is a direct threat to our existence”.
Later, in an interview with Samaa TV, he said, “We should be mentally prepared, there is a war looming on the horizon.”
The channel also quoted him as saying that there was a “vivid possibility” that “we can have war in the next day or two or three or four (sic)”.
 
 

However, he later had to clarify these remarks, telling Geo News: “They (the channel) asked me what the cha­nces of war are, so I said that the next two to three days were crucial.”
“If something has to happen, then it will occur in the next two to four days … otherwise the immediate danger will pass.”
Mr Asif also clarified that his statement should not be misconstrued as a categorical prediction that war would begin within the next two to three days, reiterating that he had only said the “upcoming days would be crucial.”
He reiterated that he had said there was a danger of war breaking out in the next few days but it could also be averted, as other countries in the region were working to avert any contentious situation and de-escalate the matter.
He said that Islamabad had approached friendly countries, including Gulf states and China, and also briefed Britain, the United States and others on the situation.
“Some of our friends in the Arabian Gulf have talked to both sides,” Asif said, without naming the countries.
Over the past week, leaders and officials from China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and the UK have been in touch with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy PM Ishaq Dar. All of them have urged a de-escalation of tensions.
De-escalation
Meanwhile on Monday, Beijing, Washington, Ankara and Doha also expressed the hope that India and Pakistan will exercise restraint and welcomed all measures that will help cool down the situation.
“China hopes that the two sides will exercise restraint, meet each other halfway, properly handle relevant differences through dialogue and consultation and jointly maintain regional peace and stability,” foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
“China welcomes all measures that will help cool down the situation,” AFP quoted Jiakun as telling a regular press briefing.
Beijing’s call for restraint added to the United States’ statement from Sunday, urging India and Pakistan to work towards what it called a “responsible solution”, as Washington said it was in touch with both countries.
“This is an evolving situation and we are monitoring developments closely. We have been in touch with the governments of India and Pakistan at multiple levels,” a US State Department spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.
“The United States encourages all parties to work together towards a responsible resolution,” the spokesperson added.
In public, the US government has expressed support for India after the attack but has not criticised Pakistan, while President Trump said last week he was confident that both countries would “get it figured out”.
Speaking after a cabinet meeting on Monday, Turkiye President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country also wants a de-escalation between Pakistan and India, Reuters reported.
Separately, speaking to Mr Dar, who also holds the foreign affairs portfolio, Qatar’s prime minister emphasised the importance of resolving  conflicts through dialogue and diplomacy.
Dar spoke with Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman  Al-Thani as part of Pakistan’s diplomatic outreach to inform allies  about what Islamabad describes as India’s “unsubstantiated allegations,  inflammatory rhetoric, and unilateral measures,” according to a  statement from the Foreign Office.
During the conversation, Al-Thani underscored the imperative of maintaining regional peace and  stability, highlighting the value of diplomatic engagement in addressing  disputes between countries.
Both leaders reaffirmed the strong  bilateral ties between Pakistan and Qatar and agreed to maintain close  coordination and consultations on the evolving regional situation.

The Indian authorities have demolished nine homes belonging to the families of suspected assailants as part of a crackdown after the April 22 killings of tourists.
“We should not do anything to alienate the people after their spontaneous reaction (against the attack),” Omar Abdullah said at a session of the legislative assembly in Srinagar.
“Guns can only control militancy, not finish it. It will only end when the people are with us. It seems people are now reaching that stage.”
Some Kashmir residents have spoken out against the move by the authorities to destroy homes, like that of Rifat Sheikh.
On Monday, she stood next to her razed kitchen, assessing the damage caused by explosives used by police to demolish the house.
Police say her brother Asif is with the Lashkar-i-Taiba, which New Delhi blamed for the attack.
 
 

Rifat Sheikh said her family had not seen or spoken with Asif after he left home one morning in 2022 on the pretext of going to a market. “Why are they punishing us by destroying our house this way for what they say he has done?” she asked. “We don’t know where he is or what he is doing. This is provocation, but I pray that people remain calm.”
Two police officials say they were acting against homes that “retained connections with militants”.
Nazir Ahmad Wani’s house in Khasipora village was one of the nine homes destroyed so far. Police say his son, Amir Nazir, is a member of the Jaish-e-Mohammed outfit.
Broken pieces of glass lay in the backyard of Wani’s home where he grew maize crops. The roof of the house came down due to impact of the explosives, his relatives said. Amir had left the home in April last year and didn’t return, they added.
“I was kept at the police station all night. They didn’t tell me anything at the time. I only learned of the damage the next morning when I came to the house,” said Wani.

The petitions have been filed a day before the Supreme Court is scheduled to resume hearing on the dispute over seniority of IHC judges.
Filed through senior counsel Muhammad Waqar Rana, the petitions contended that the transfers of Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar of the Lahore High Court, Justice Khadim Hussain Somroo of the Sindh High Court and Justice Muhammad Asif of the Balochistan High Court violated Article 200 of the Constitution.  The article requires that such transfers be made in the public interest and only after proper consultation with the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) and the respective high court chief justices.
On Tuesday, a five-judge constitutional bench headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar will resume proceedings on a broader dispute over the inter-se seniority of five sitting IHC judges.

Petitions say transfers lacked transparency

Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz have jointly petitioned the Supreme Court to argue that the three transferred judges should not be treated as IHC judges until they take a fresh oath under Article 194 of the Constitution, read in conjunction with Schedule III.
 
 

In rejoinders filed against the federal government, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) and the registrars of the Supreme Court and high courts, the petitioners argued that adequate consultation with the CJP and other judges did not take place. They noted that the chief justice of Sindh had explicitly rejected the geographical reasoning cited in the transfer summary, yet the transfers proceeded.
Moreover, the petitioners contended that the prime minister and president approved the transfers on the same day the summary was initiated, suggesting a rushed process without due deliberation.
“Such decisions required cabinet approval, not just the prime minister’s advice,” the petition stated.
The petitioners also noted that the transfers were predetermined, as the judges were asked for their consent before consultations were properly held. For instance, Justice Somroo gave his consent before his chief justice was consulted.
In the case of Justice Muhammad Asif, the petitioners argued that transferring an additional judge who had just been appointed to the Balochistan High Court was contentious. They asserted this move undermined the appointment process and deprived other eligible candidates from Balochistan of the opportunity to serve in the IHC.
Referring to the CJP’s concurrence about federal representation as reasons for the transfers, the petitioners maintained this ground conflicted with constitutional provisions and prior judicial precedents. They claimed the CJP did not consult senior judges or convene a full court meeting, reducing the required consultation to a “mere formality.”
 
 

The petitioners warned that the transfers set a dangerous precedent, enabling the executive to manipulate judicial appointments and eroding judicial independence.
The petitioners also urged the Supreme Court to intervene and declare the transfers unconstitutional in order to restore the integrity of the judicial process, ensuring that future actions are transparent, consultative, and driven solely by public interest.

India has pointed the finger at Pakistan — without any proof — and unleashed a raft of provocative actions, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty in the wake of the incident.
Meanwhile, police have launched a vast manhunt across held Kashmir and detained around 2,000 people for questioning.
They have announced a two million rupee ($23,500) bounty for information leading to each man’s arrest.

Residents of border villages fear getting caught in the crossfire if fighting breaks out

While several groups have protested the attack, the crackdown has also sparked warnings that the wider public is suffering during the search for the few.
Aga Ruhullah, a federal lawmaker from Kashmir, said: “Kashmir and Kashmiris are being given a collective punishment.”
Demolitions and detentions
The homes of men suspected of having links to the attackers have also been blown up at night.
Yasmeena, the sister of fugitive accused Asif Sheikh, said her family was being punished, with their home was demolished even though they had not seen him for three years.
 
 

“If my brother is involved, how is it the family’s sin?” she said. “This house doesn’t belong to him alone.”
Indian police have issued wanted posters for three men — one Indian and two men alleged to be Pakistanis. However, police are hunting for at least two local suspects, and the demolition of several homes in held Kashmir seems to contradict New Delhi’s claim that the attackers hailed from Pakistan.
Police are also sweeping up those they suspect may have information on the attackers.
“It’s a revolving door in police stations as part of the ongoing investigation,” said a senior police official told AFP.
“Some have already been let go, and more are being summoned to police stations,” the officer said, adding: “These are not arrests, just for seeking information that could lead to the terrorists”.
Fear grips border villages
In Daoke village on the Indian border, residents say nothing has changed on the ground yet — but there is a growing anxiety about the coming weeks.
“The barbaric attack on the civilians in Kashmir was tragic, but no matter what, the lives lost are not coming back,” says Hardev Singh, 65.
“Any war would push both our countries back by many years, and there would be an even bigger loss of human lives.”
He has lived through two conflicts — in 1971 and 1999 — and knows the drill if fighting erupts again.
A border fence patrolled by troops slices in two the farmlands near Daoke, home to around 1,500 people.
In the nearby border village of Rajatal, located between Amritsar and Lahore, residents remember the days when the golden farmland stretched without restriction.
“We used to go to the open ground on the other side to graze our cattle,” recalls 77-year-old Sardar Lakha Singh, sitting about 100 metres from fences topped with barbed wire.
Farmers can now obtain special passes to go close to the border, including beyond the fence but still within Indian territory, but they must always be accompanied by a soldier.
Panic gripped border villages last week after rumours suggested farmers would be stopped from accessing fields too close to Pakistan.
Sikh elder Sardar Lakha Sin­gh advised younger villagers to accept their fate and not to worry. “Whatever is going to happen will happen anyway,” he said.

Plans to build new canals on the Indus have been shelved till such time that all provinces can find themselves in agreement that they will serve the interests of the various claimants to the river’s waters.
The Council of Common Interests finally convened yesterday evening, following months of demonstrations and protests in Sindh over canals that were proposed to be built in the Cholistan region, to formally endorse the federal government’s policy, namely: “that no new canals will be built without mutual understanding from the CCI”. Thereafter, “It has been decided that the federal government will not move further until mutual understanding is evolved among the provinces”. The PPP will take the decision back to Sindh as a major triumph for the province’s people, many of whom had seen the proposed canal projects as a direct encroachment on their rights to a vital natural resource shared with another province, and had taken a strong position against the state’s plans.
 
 

According to the announcement, “the provisional Ecnec approval […] for construction of new canals and the Irsa water availability certificate […] [have been] returned. [The] Planning Division and Irsa are directed to ensure consultation with all stakeholders, in the interest of national cohesion and to address any and all concerns until mutual understanding is reached”.
This should be sufficient to address the suspicions that were being harboured by groups of protesters in Sindh, who had enforced a 10-day blockade of major logistical routes running through the province and had previously refused to disband despite the centre’s reassurances to the Sindh government that it would not proceed with the project. Now that the approval for the canals has been formally ‘returned’, the highways must be reopened and the thousands of goods transport vehicles that have been stranded for days allowed to proceed to their destinations. The economy has incurred major losses waiting for this breakthrough.
What is next? The press release issued after the CCI meeting suggested that the CCI would engage the provincial governments to chart out a long-term consensus on agricultural policy and management of the water infrastructure across the country. Furthermore, it has been announced that a committee is being formed to ensure food and ecological security with representation from the federation and the provinces. These are commendable steps, but perhaps should have been taken much earlier.
Nonetheless, it is encouraging that the provinces are being given a direct say in proposing solutions to challenges being faced at the provincial and national levels where agricultural policy and water utilisation are concerned. There is an urgent need for such high-level engagement and consultation, especially considering the climate-related crises Pakistan faces. Perhaps some good may have come out of this episode after all.

“The treaty is critical to regional stability and its sanctity must be preserved,” Mr Dar said while speaking at a high-level meeting convened to strategize Pakistan’s response to India’s suspension of the decades-old accord.
The meeting was attended by Law and Justice Minister Azam Nazir Tarrar, Attorney General Mansoor Awan, senior officials, technical experts, and former foreign secretaries.
On Monday, Mr Dar condemned India’s move as a “unilateral and illegal” action that contravenes international law, established norms of inter-state relations, and the treaty’s provisions. He warned that India’s attempts to “weaponise water” posed a serious threat to the region’s peace and stability.
“The waters of the Indus River System remain a lifeline for Pakistan’s 240 million people,” he said, underscoring the strategic and humanitarian importance of preserving the treaty.
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding its rightful share of water under the treaty and pledged to continue advocating for its full implementation to protect the country’s water security and the well-being of its people.

•  Irfan Siddiqui calls Pahalgam attack ‘false-flag operation’
• Senators warn New Delhi against changes to Indus treaty
ISLAMABAD: The main opposition, PTI, has demanded the release of its incarcerated leader Imran Khan so he can participate in national deliberations on escalating tensions with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The party also called for an immediate multi-party conference (MPC), with Mr Khan in attendance.
The demands were made in the  Senate on Monday, as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle slammed India for suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and fanning war hysteria following the April 22 attack.
Senator Ali Zafar, PTI’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, said political differences should be set aside for an issue of national importance.
He noted that a multi-party conference was the only “correct thing to do in the present circumstances”.
If Mr Khan is allowed to attend such a meeting, Mr Zafar said it would send a signal across the world that Pakistan is united and make the country’s case stronger.
He also criticised Indian PM Narendra Modi’s government and its “Nazi mentality” for fal­sely accusing Pakistan — which is itself a victim of terrorism.
“I want to tell the world that this is a blatant and baseless lie motivated by malice.”
He added New Delhi has a “habit of levelling such allegations” and also called the Indian government an “expert in carrying out false flag operations”.
PTI Senator Shibli Faraz said Mr Khan should be allowed to appear on TV to give a call to people for a public gathering at Minar-i-Pakistan and a march toward the Wagah border with India.
Mr Faraz, the opposition leader in Senate, expressed confidence that “over ten million people” will gather on Mr Khan’s call.
“Only a true representative of the people can give a strong message to India,” he said, warning the enemy “takes advantage of political instability”.
He demanded the release of all “political prisoners” and doing away with the practice of filing false cases against political opponents.
’False-flag operation ’
PML-N Senator Irfanul Haq Siddiqui said the Pahalgam incident was a “false flag operation carried out by the Indian authorities to defame Pakistan”.
!  .
He said India routinely accused Pakistan without any investigation or evidence. “India accused Pakistan within minutes of the Pahalgam incident, but the international community refused to accept their false narrative.”
Senator Siddiqui also raised critical questions about the security situation in India-held Kashmir.
He questioned how a major terrorist attack took place despite the “presence of army checkpoints at every corner and the deployment of one Indian soldier for every seven Kashmiris”.
Mr Siddiqui warned India against carrying out any attack in Pakistan, saying the people were “fully prepared and united to defend the motherland” despite internal political differences.
The PML-N senator also referred to growing internal dissent within India, noting that voices from within the country were now questioning PM Modi’s handling of the situation.
The BAP parliamentary leader in the Senate said the Pahalgam attack, which took place in an area with high military presence “clearly exposed that it was a false flag operation”.
He said India was involved in target killings in different countries and was responsible for various terrorist attacks inside Pakistan and there was “irrefutable evidence” of Indian funding to outlawed groups BLA and TTP.
Suspension of IWT
Talking about India’s move to suspend the IWT, Mr Siddiqui said New Delhi cannot unilaterally terminate the agreement.
“The Indus Waters Treaty involves the World Bank as an arbitrator along with several other international institutions. India cannot simply walk away from its obligations,” he stressed.
Senator Zafar of PTI also agreed with Mr Siddiqui saying that India has no right to unilaterally suspend, amend or cancel the treaty.
Mr Zafar, who is also a constitutional expert, said any such action by the Modi government will be “illegal and against the principles of international law”.
He said the announcement by India to suspend the treaty had no legal effect and Pakistan has rejected it.
Calling water a “basic human right”, he warned India that any disruption to the water flows of Pakistan would be “an act of war”.
“We will fight for each drop of water till the last drop of our blood.”

The truck was one of the vehicles that supplied Iranian petrol brought over by Zambad vehicles to local shops. The injured also included police personnel and several children.
Officials said the truck was parked in the main bus and truck stand, when the driver discovered a leak in its fuel tank. After trying unsuccessfully to stop the leakage, the driver moved the truck away from a densely populated area towards an open space.
The fuel tank was being welded when a fire broke out, leading to a big explosion that damaged a fire tender and injured several people gathered at the scene.
“As a result of the huge fire, the driver was burnt to death on the spot, while over 60 people present at the site received burns,” Noshki Deputy Commissi­oner Amjad Somroo said while talking to the media after the incident.
The injured were moved to the district hospital for treatment.
“We have received over 45 people, including police personnel and children in the hospital who had suffered burns,” Dr Zafar Ali Mengal, the medical superintendent of the hospital, said while speaking to Dawn.
He said the condition of at least 20 people was critical as they had sustained more than 40 per cent burns.
The critically injured were moved to the Civil Hospital Quetta, while some of the injured were shifted to private hospitals in Noshki as the district hospital did not have a burns ward.
“We have received 23 injured who received serious burn injuries,” Dr Abdul Hadi Kakar said, adding that 20 of them were shifted to the Bolan Medical College hospital for treatment.

The April 22 attack killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident. India’s defence forces have conducted several military exercises across the country since the attack. Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other.
Earlier today, Asif told Reuters in an interview at his office in Islamabad: “We have reinforced our forces because it is something which is imminent now. So, in that situation, some strategic decisions have to be taken, so those decisions have been taken.”
Asif said since India’s rhetoric was ramping up, the Pakistani military had briefed the government on the possibility of an Indian attack. He did not go into further details on his reasons for thinking an incursion was imminent.
After the Kashmir attack, India alleged that two suspected attackers were Pakistani. Islamabad has denied any role and called for a neutral investigation.
Asif said Pakistan was on high alert and that it would only use its arsenal of nuclear weapons if “there is a direct threat to our existence”.
In a separate interview on Samaa TV show ‘Red Line’, Asif said: “We should be mentally prepared there is a war looming on the horizon. The possibility is there, a very vivid possibility that we can have war in the next day or two or three or four.”
Questioned about his remarks in an interview on Geo News, Asif said: “I think it has been misinterpreted on some other channel, Samaa. I have already talked to them and I have not said anything like this. They (the channel) asked me what are the chances of war, so I said that the next two to three days were crucial.
“If something has to happen, then it will occur in the next two to four days … otherwise the immediate danger will pass.”
Asif clarified that his statement should not be misconstrued as a categorical prediction that war would begin within the next two to three days, reiterating that he had only said the “upcoming days would be crucial.”
He said the news channel was making the necessary corrections as well.
The defence minister said there was “absolutely no doubt” that danger was looming, but “I never said anything about its inevitability.”
Asif added that other countries in the region were working to avert any contentious situation and de-escalate the matter.
“Pakistan is 100 per cent ready to face any combat situation if the country’s sovereignty is threatened or war imposed on it,” he said.
He reiterated that he had said there was a danger of war breaking out in the next few days but it could also be averted.

Trump plans to sign an executive order on Monday directing top officials to identify within a month the cities and states failing to sufficiently comply with federal immigration laws, a White House official said.
Trump launched an aggressive enforcement campaign after taking office, surging troops to the southern border and pledging to deport millions of immigrants in the US illegally.
The Republican president — who made immigration a major campaign issue in 2024 — said the actions were needed after years of high illegal immigration under his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden.
At a press briefing, White House officials touted a steep decline in illegal crossings at the border during Trump’s first three months in office — even as concerns have emerged over the due process rights of immigrants and US citizens swept up in the dragnet.
 


US Border Patrol arrested 7,200 migrants illegally crossing the border in March, the lowest monthly total since 2000 and down from a peak of 250,000 in December 2023.
“We have the most secure border in the history of this nation and the numbers prove it,” Trump border czar Tom Homan said at the briefing.
Democrats and civil rights advocates have criticised Trump’s heightened enforcement tactics, including the cases of several US-citizen children recently deported with their parents, including one with a rare form of cancer, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
Homan blamed the parents for putting their children at risk of deportation by remaining in the US. “If you choose to have a US-citizen child, knowing you’re in this country illegally, you put yourself in that position,” he said.

In his first hundred days in office, Trump has moved to strip legal immigration status from hundreds of thousands of people, increasing the pool of those who can potentially be deported.
While arrests of immigrants in the US illegally have spiked, deportations remain below last year’s levels under Biden, when there were more people illegally crossing the border who could be quickly returned.
Deportations were down in Trump’s first three months in office from 195,000 last year to 130,000 this year, Reuters reported last week. Homan defended the figures and said it was not fair to compare them to Biden-era tallies.
 
 

US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facilities have been over capacity, with some 48,000 in custody as of early April, beyond the funded level of 41,500.
Homan said Texas military base Fort Bliss could be ready “in the very near future” to hold migrant detainees. The Trump administration has already been using the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
Photos posted on the White House lawn featured 100 people charged or convicted of serious crimes, including murder, rape and fentanyl distribution.
Numerous studies show immigrants do not commit crimes at a higher rate than native-born Americans.
Sanctuary standoff
Trump has criticised cities and states that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, labelling them “sanctuaries” and blaming them for releasing criminal offenders instead of coordinating their transfer to ICE.
 
 

Last week, a federal judge blocked Trump’s administration from withholding federal funding from more than a dozen so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that have declined to cooperate with Trump’s hardline immigration crackdown.
The executive order planned for Monday, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, would build on Trump’s early efforts to pressure the jurisdictions to cooperate.
“President Trump plans to sign an executive order on Monday, escalating his battle against Democratic-led states and cities that don’t fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities,” a White House official said.
US officials arrested a Wisconsin judge on Friday and charged her with helping a man in her court briefly evade immigration authorities. The arrest triggered backlash from Democrats and immigrant rights advocates who raised concerns that immigrant victims may not feel safe in courthouses.
Homan defended the arrest, saying the administration would enforce laws prohibiting harbouring a person in the US illegally.
“You will be prosecuted, judge or not,” he said.
Trump’s schedule calls for him to sign executive orders at 5pm Eastern Standard Time (2100 GMT, 1am PKT). Americans are split on Trump’s immigration approach, but he has a 45 per cent approval rating on immigration, better than on other major issues, a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in mid-April found.</p><small>2025-04-28 17:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28181942c037af3.png?r=182535' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907142/at-least-40-injured-in-noshki-as-oil-tanker-explodes-after-catching-fire-officials' target='_blank'><strong>At least 40 injured in Noshki as oil tanker explodes after catching fire: officials</strong></a><br><p>At least 40 people were injured when an oil tanker exploded after catching fire in Balochistan’s Noshki district on Monday, officials said.
“The oil tanker was parked at a truck depot when it caught fire, injuring at least 40 people,” Noshki Deputy Commissioner (DC) Amjad Soomro told Dawn.com, adding that the fire was caused by welding work on the tanker.
“The fire brigade was trying to control the fire when the truck exploded,” DC Soomro said, adding that fire brigade personnel were seriously injured as a result.
He said that four police personnel present a the scene to move citizens away were also injured, while those near the oil tanker suffered 70 to 80 per cent burns.
“Those with severe burns will be shifted to Quetta via helicopter,” DC Soomro said.
Speaking to the media later, DC Soomro said, “The fuel tank of the tanker caught fire due to a short circuit and exploded, consequently engulfing people standing around the tanker.
Soomro said that 28 of the injured were undergoing treatment, while more than 10 people with minor injuries were discharged after receiving treatment.
“Twenty-three people with serious injuries have been moved to Quetta, where an emergency has been declared,” he said
In a statement, Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind noted that over 30 people were burned in the incident.
“The fire was so intense it engulfed the fire brigade vehicle present at the scene,” Rind was quoted as saying. “There are reports of more than 30 people being burned in the accident.
“The injured are being shifted to the Civil Hospital and BMC (Bolan Medical College) after [receiving] first aid,” he said, adding that an emergency had been declared in hospitals.
“The incident is unfortunate … investigations are being conducted,” Rind was quoted as saying.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti expressed sorrow over the incident and directed officials to speed up relief activities.
He said that the injured should be provided with immediate and quality medical facilities, stating that the provincial health minister was effectively supervising all stages of the treatment of the injured.
“A complete and transparent investigation into the Nushki incident has been ordered,” Bugti said.
The CM directed to take immediate and comprehensive steps to prevent such tragedies in the future.
“All possible assistance and guidance should be provided to the injured and the attendants,” he said, adding that the government would not leave the victims alone.
Oil tanker explosions frequently result from high-impact collisions. Beyond crashes, explosions can stem from defective fuel tanks, overloaded tanks, faulty muffler systems sparking fires, or various other issues. Given that tankers transport highly flammable or hazardous materials, accidents are not unexpected.
Last year, a man was killed while five others were injured in an oil tanker explosion in Karachi’s Shireen Jinnah Colony near the terminals of the 20-bus route.  Police said some workers were welding under the oil tanker, which was empty of oil, but some gases had accumulated in it, leading to the explosion.
In 2017, 212 people were killed when a tanker carrying 40,000 litres of fuel overturned after trying to make a sharp turn while travelling from Karachi to Lahore on the main highway. The incident occurred when hundreds of residents of a nearby village gathered at the site of the overturned oil tanker to collect the leaking fuel.
According to initial investigations, a cigarette was suspected to have caused the massive blaze that engulfed the people collecting the spilled fuel.</p><small>2025-04-28 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/282141124e6b547.jpg?r=214820' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907108/cci-endorses-govt-move-to-halt-contentious-canals-project-until-mutual-understanding-among-provinces' target='_blank'><strong>CCI endorses govt move to halt contentious canals project until ‘mutual understanding’ among provinces</strong></a><br><p>A meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) on Monday endorsed the federal government’s move to halt the initiative of the much-contested six new canals on the Indus River until “mutual understanding” could be achieved among provinces in the wake of widespread blowback to the project.
Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz inaugurated the ambitious Cholistan project to irrigate South Punjab’s lands on February 15 amid public uproar and strong reservations in Sindh.

The decision came amid uncertainty created by India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) last week.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam and the four provincial chief ministers attended today’s CCI meeting, which was moved forward from its previous date of May 2.
A press release issued after the meeting said: “The CCI endorses the policy of the federal government as given below: Federal government has decided that no new canals will be built without mutual understanding from CCI. It has been decided that the federal government will not move further until mutual understanding is evolved among the provinces.”
The CCI also endorsed the government’s move to engage all provincial governments to chart out a long-term consensus roadmap for the development of agriculture policy and water management infrastructure across Pakistan and to form a committee with representation from the federation and all provinces to allay the concerns of all provinces and to ensure the country’s food and ecological security.
It added that the committee would propose solutions to Pakistan’s long-term agriculture needs and water use of all provinces in line with the Water Apportionment Accord, 1991, and Water Policy, 2018.
“Water is one of the most precious commodities and the makers of the Constitution recognised this, mandating all water disputes to be resolved amicably through mutual understanding and concerns of any province shall be addressed through due diligence amongst all stakeholders,” the press release said.
As a result, the statement said the CCI also decided that the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council’s provisional approval dated February 7, 2024, for the construction of new canals and the Indus River System Authority’s (Irsa) water availability certificate issued in its meeting dated January 17, 2024, be returned.
The Planning Division and Irsa were directed to ensure consultation with all stakeholders, in the “interest of national cohesion and to address any and all concerns until mutual understanding is reached”.
The statement said the CCI also strongly condemned India’s “unilateral, illegal and irresponsible actions after the Pahalgam attack”.
 
 

It said the CCI Council of Common Interests, while representing national aspirations, conveyed a message of unity and solidarity for the entire country and nation in the context of any “possible Indian aggression and misadventure”.
The CCI said Pakistan was a peaceful and responsible country that knew how to defend itself. The statement added that all provincial chief ministers also vowed to “stand shoulder to shoulder with the federal government against India’s illegal actions”.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said earlier today that the federal government convened the meeting for today. In a statement issued by his spokesperson Husain Mansoor, Memon said a decision on the canals’ matter would be made in the CCI meeting.
 


“A decision will be made as per the discussion between [PPP Chairman] Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and the prime minister, and the issue of canals will end,” he said, referring to Friday’s meeting between the coalition allies.
The meeting earlier amid increasing concerns of traders and the business community as protests against the project have paralysed interprovincial traffic by blocking national highways in parts of Sindh.
 
 

The legal fraternity has been staging a sit-in at the Babarloi bypass in Sindh’s Khairpur district since April 18.
Speaking to Geo News, Memon confirmed that the Sindh government had made the request for the meeting to be moved ahead due to the ongoing protests.
The minister noted that the CCI meeting was to be called on May 2, but despite that, “some groups refused to end the protests until the CCI meeting happens and its [decision’s] formal announcement” is made.
“In light of that, the Sindh government requested the prime minister to summon the meeting today, and it is set to take place in the evening in Islamabad,” Memon added.
 


Responding to a query, he said the provincial government had requested earlier as well to call the meeting “soon but considering the state of the country at the moment, it was difficult”.
“We had to appeal again as transport had come to a halt due to the protests, resulting in economic loss for businesses as well as farmers,” the minister stressed.
Asked about the Sindh government’s plan of action if the protests on highways continued even after the CCI meeting, Memon said: “We are hopeful that if we don’t give them an excuse, even though there was no excuse before either, but the government believes in dialogue.”
He highlighted, “The public interest is important to us at the moment as it was creating issues for the business community and the farmers.”
In a statement posted by the Sindh Information Department on X today, Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar said the government acknowledged the right to peaceful protest but requested the lawyers not to create difficulties for the public.
He asserted that no legal action would be taken against those protesting peacefully and urged the lawyers to “keep an eye on miscreants around them”.
 






Transporters to hold protest outside Sindh CM House today
To protest the continued blockade, the All Pakistan Goods Transport Alliance (APGTA) announced plans to hold a demonstration outside the Sindh CM House in Karachi at 4pm today (Monday).
Yesterday, Nisar Jafry of the APGTA said he had received a call from Memon — also Sindh’s transport minister — requesting him to call off today’s rally with the assurance that the roads will be cleared soon.
Jafry said that the movement of around 30,000 trucks and oil tankers was impeded. He said that on average, one vehicle carries goods worth Rs10 million, be they meant for import, export or locally produced.
 
 

In his statement, Memon had called on all political parties and the legal community to reopen the roads to ensure the smooth flow of goods transport, so that no one suffers any further financial or economic loss.
Manufacturers said they have been forced to halt production due to a shortage of raw materials, while port authorities also anticipate serious congestion.
The past few months have seen nationwide protests from political parties, including the ruling coalition ally PPP, and residents against the proposed project. The Sindh Assembly also passed a unanimous resolution against the project in March.</p><small>2025-04-28 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2820331327ac724.jpg?r=203928' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907157/death-toll-rises-to-65-in-iran-port-explosion-state-media' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll rises to 65 in Iran port explosion: state media</strong></a><br><p>A huge explosion at Iran’s largest commercial port has killed 65 people, the provincial governor told state media on Monday, revising earlier tolls for the blast.
“The death toll has reached 65 in this horrific incident” at Shahid Rajaee Port, said Mohammad Ashouri, governor of the southern Iranian province of Hormozgan where the port is located, adding that the fire caused by the explosion on Saturday has not yet been fully extinguished.
Iran’s minister of interior on Monday blamed “negligence” for the explosion, which occurred at the country’s largest commercial port, with firefighters still battling the blaze two days later.
The blast took place on Saturday at the Shahid Rajaee Port in Iran’s south near the strategic Strait of Hormuz, a waterway through which one-fifth of global oil output passes.
“The death toll in the Shahid Rajaee Port fire has reached 46,” the official IRNA news agency reported, quoting Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, the crisis management director for Hormozgan province.
Officials have said more than 1,000 people were injured, with Hassanzadeh noting most had since been released after treatment.
Only “120 wounded are still in hospital”, Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni, who is in the area, told state TV on Monday.
He added that “culprits have been identified and summoned”, and that the blast was caused by “shortcomings, including noncompliance with safety precautions and negligence”.

Iran’s state TV showed images of firefighters still dousing the flames Monday, and said the damage would be assessed after the fire was fully brought under control.
Heavy charcoal-black smoke continued to billow over low flames at part of the site, above which a firefighting helicopter flew, pictures from the Iranian Red Crescent showed.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has ordered a probe into the incident.
Smoke, then a fireball
It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, but the port’s customs office said it likely resulted from a fire that broke out at the hazardous and chemical materials storage depot.
CCTV images on social media showed it began gradually, with a small fire belching orange-brown smoke among a few containers stacked outside, across from a warehouse.
A small forklift truck drives past the area and men can be seen walking nearby.
About one minute after the small fire and smoke become visible, a fireball erupts as vehicles pass nearby, with men running for their lives.
President Masoud Pezeshkian visited hospitals treating the wounded on Sunday in the nearby city of Bandar Abbas.
Since the explosion, authorities have ordered all schools and offices in the area closed, and have urged residents to avoid going outside “until further notice” and to use protective masks.
The New York Times quoted a person with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, as saying that what exploded was sodium perchlorate — a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles.
Defence ministry spokesman Reza Talaei-Nik later told state TV that “there has been no imported or exported cargo for military fuel or military use in the area”.
Iran’s ally Russia has dispatched specialists to help battle the blazes.
Authorities have declared Monday a national day of mourning, while three days of mourning began Sunday in Hormozgan province, where the port is located.
The blast occurred as Iranian and US delegations were meeting in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, with both sides reporting progress.
While Iranian authorities so far appear to be treating the blast as an accident, it also comes against the backdrop of years of shadow war with regional foe Israel. According to The Washington Post, Israel launched a cyberattack targeting the Shahid Rajaee Port in 2020.</p><small>2025-04-28 16:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602242-driver-killed-over-40-injured-in-noshki-oil-tanker-blaze' target='_blank'><strong>Driver killed, over 40 injured in Noshki oil tanker blaze</strong></a><br><p>

The United States military has hammered the Houthis with near-daily strikes since March 15 in an operation dubbed “Rough Rider”, seeking to end the threat they pose to vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.
The Houthis launched strikes targeting Israel and Western vessels in the Red Sea, in what they describe as solidarity with the Palestinians, since Hamas conducted an unprecedented attack on Israel in October 2023.
On Sunday, the US said it had hit more than 800 targets in Yemen since mid-March, killing hundreds of Houthi rebels, including members of the group’s leadership.
Just hours later, Houthi media said the latest barrage by US forces had hit a migrant detention centre.
“The civil defence has announced that 68 African migrants were killed and 47 others wounded in the US attack targeting a centre for illegal migrants in the city of Saada,” the Houthis’ Al-Masirah TV said.
AFP could not independently confirm the veracity of Al-Masirah’s claim that the strikes had hit a migrant detention centre, or the toll.
AFP has contacted the US military for comment.
According to a statement cited by Al-Masirah from the Houthi administration’s interior ministry, the centre housed “115 migrants, all from Africa”.
The broadcaster showed footage of bodies stuck under the rubble and of rescuers working to help the casualties.
Each year, tens of thousands of migrants brave the Eastern Route from the Horn of Africa, seeking to escape conflict, natural disasters and poor economic prospects by sailing across the Red Sea towards the oil-rich Gulf.
Many hope for employment as labourers or domestic workers in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab countries, though they face a perilous journey through war-torn Yemen.
The UN migration agency (IOM) said it was closely monitoring the situation following the latest strike, but said the facility in question was not being managed by their personnel.
“It is imperative that all efforts are made to avoid harm to civilians and to protect those most vulnerable in these challenging circumstances,” the IOM said in a statement.
We will continue
The Houthis began targeting shipping in late 2023, preventing ships from passing through the Suez Canal — a vital route that normally carries about 12 per cent of global trade — forcing many companies into a costly detour around the tip of southern Africa.
In a statement that provided its most detailed accounting of the operation so far, the US military command responsible for the Middle East said: “Since the start of Operation Rough Rider, USCENTCOM has struck over 800 targets.
“These strikes have killed hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders. The strikes have destroyed multiple command-and-control facilities, air defence systems, advanced weapons manufacturing facilities, and advanced weapons storage locations,” Centcom (US Central Command) said.
Despite the strikes, the Houthis, who control large swaths of Yemen, have continued to claim attacks against both US vessels and Israel.
Centcom said that “while the Houthis have continued to attack our vessels, our operations have degraded the pace and effectiveness of their attacks. Ballistic missile launches have dropped by 69pc. Additionally, attacks from one-way attack drones have decreased by 55pc.
“Iran undoubtedly continues to provide support to the Houthis. The Houthis can only continue to attack our forces with the backing of the Iranian regime,” the military command said.
“We will continue to ratchet up the pressure until the objective is met, which remains the restoration of freedom of navigation and American deterrence in the region,” it added.
Strikes on Sanaa
Al-Masirah TV on Sunday reported that US strikes on the rebel-held Yemeni capital Sanaa had killed at least eight people and wounded others.
The channel also broadcast footage of the rubble of destroyed homes and cars, as well as blood stains on the ground, while rescuers collected what appeared to be human remains in white cloth.
Also on Sunday, Houthi media said earlier strikes on Sanaa had killed two people and wounded several more.
The United States first began conducting strikes against the Houthis under Joe Biden’s administration, and President Donald Trump has vowed that military action against the rebels will continue until they are no longer a threat to shipping.</p><small>2025-04-28 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28181704261aaca.jpg?r=182245' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907149/massive-blackout-hits-spain-portugal-france' target='_blank'><strong>Massive blackout hits Spain, Portugal, France</strong></a><br><p>A massive blackout hit Spain, Portugal and part of southern France on Monday, grid operators said, leaving millions of people affected.
The cause for the outage was not immediately reported.
Spain’s railway operator Adif said that the power cut halted trains across the entire country, while airports operator Aena said “several incidents” occurred in Spanish airports.
Mobile phone networks went down. AFP reporters in Madrid and Barcelona saw many inhabitants coming out into the streets, holding their smartphones up to try to connect to a network.
Many people had to use the radio instead of the inaccessible internet to get news
on the situation.
Many traffic lights had ceased to function, forcing vehicles to slow down to avoid collisions, while metros and trains were halted. Spain’s national road authority DGT urged motorists to stop using the roads.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was on his way to the headquarters of the state electricity network operator Red Electrica to be briefed on the emergency, his office said.
Portugal’s REN operator said in a statement to AFP that the entire Iberian Peninsula was affected by the blackout, as well as part of France, adding that the outage occurred at 11:33am.
Spain’s Red Electrica said it had managed to start restoring power in the north and south of the country but the problem was not yet resolved. “We are continuing to work to bring back power,” it said.
Spain’s El Pais newspaper posted photos on its website of stopped metro trains in Madrid, police directing traffic, and its own reporters working in a darkened office by the torchlight.
Power cut interrupts play at Madrid Open
Play was interrupted at the Madrid Open on Monday when the city lost power, after world number four Coco Gauff and rising Russian star Mirra Andreeva booked their quarter-final spots.
On Centre Court, the match between Bulgaria’s Grigor Dimitrov and British qualifier Jacob Fearnley was suspended when the Bulgarian was leading 6-4, 5-4 with his opponent serving to stay in the match.
“The outage is preventing the use of electronic line calling systems and also left a spider cam dangling over the court inside Monolo Santana Stadium,” the ATP said on its website.
Tournament organisers said on social media they were “working to restore” power “as quickly as possible”, without giving a timetable.

The April 22 attack killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
“China hopes that the two sides will exercise restraint, meet each other halfway, properly handle relevant differences through dialogue and consultation and jointly maintain regional peace and stability,” foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
“China welcomes all measures that will help cool down the situation,” Jiakun told a regular press briefing.
The statement came after Pakistan and India reportedly exchanged gunfire for a fourth night in a row across the LoC, after four years of relative calm.
“During the night of April 27-28… Pakistan Army posts initiated unprovoked small arms fire across the Line of Control”, the Indian army claimed in a statement.
 
 

There were no reported casualties, and Islamabad did not immediately confirm the gunfire.
India’s defence forces have conducted several military exercises across the country since the attack. Some of these are routine preparedness drills, Reuters quoted a defence official as saying.
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other.
India on April 23 unilaterally suspended the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) — a water-sharing agreement that was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.
The next day, Pakistan retaliated by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights. The National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad also called on India to “refrain from its reflexive blame game and cynical, staged managed exploitation of incidents like Pahalgam to further its narrow political agenda”.
 
 

On Thursday, Hindu nationalist Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to pursue the attackers to the “ends of the earth” and said that those who planned and carried out the attack “will be punished beyond their imagination”.
Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday said Pakistan was “ready to cooperate” in an international probe into the Pahalgam attack, but also warned of an “all-out war” if India carried out any attack on Pakistan.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint” so that issues can be “resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.
Separately, ex-foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal-Bhutto Zardari said today that if India was committed to combatting terrorism, “they should agree to talking and having dialogue with Pakistan”.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

In an interview with Deutsche Welle (DW), the PPP chairman said: “We want to combat terrorism. […] We can only work together to combat terrorism.”
Bilawal said that Pakistan had offered to be part of any impartial inquiry into the incident, stating that the country also wanted “the truth to get out”.
“Pakistan is sick and tired of the Modi government scapegoating Pakistan for every single security failure within India,” the former foreign minister said.
US in touch with India and Pakistan, urges work toward ‘responsible solution’
China’s call for restraint added to the United States’ statement from Sunday, urging India and Pakistan to work towards what it called a “responsible solution”, as Washington said it was in touch with both countries.
“This is an evolving situation and we are monitoring developments closely. We have been in touch with the governments of India and Pakistan at multiple levels,” a US State Department spokesperson told Reuters in an emailed statement.
“The United States encourages all parties to work together towards a responsible resolution,” the spokesperson added.
 
 

The State Department spokesperson also said Washington “stands with India and strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Pahalgam”, reiterating comments similar to recent ones made by US President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance.
In public, the US government has expressed support for India after the attack but has not criticised Pakistan. While Saudi Arabia and Iran have offered to mediate, Trump last week said he was confident that India and Pakistan would “get it figured out”.
India is an increasingly important US partner as Washington aims to counter China’s rising influence in Asia while Pakistan remains a US ally, even as its importance for Washington has diminished after the 2021 US withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and writer for the Foreign Policy magazine, said India is now a much closer US partner than Pakistan.
“This may worry Islamabad that if India retaliates militarily, the US may sympathise with its counterterrorism imperatives and not try to stand in the way,” Kugelman told Reuters.
Kugelman also said that given Washington’s involvement and ongoing diplomatic efforts in Russia’s war in Ukraine and Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, the Trump administration is “dealing with a lot on its global plate” and may leave India and Pakistan on their own, at least in the early days of the tensions.
Hussain Haqqani, a former Pakistan ambassador to the US and a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute think tank, also said that there seemed to be no US appetite to calm the situation at this moment.
 
 

“India has a longstanding grievance about terrorism emanating or supported from across [the] border. Pakistan has a longstanding belief that India wants to dismember it. Both work themselves into a frenzy every few years. This time, there is no US interest in calming things down,” Haqqani said.
Ned Price, a former US State Department official under the administration of former president Joe Biden, said that while the Trump administration was giving this issue the sensitivity it deserved, a perception that it would back India at any cost may escalate tensions further.
“The Trump administration has made clear it wishes to deepen the US-India partnership a laudable goal but that it is willing to do so at almost any cost.
“If India feels that the Trump administration will back it to the hilt no matter what, we could be in store for more escalation and more violence between these nuclear-armed neighbours,” Price added.
2,000 detained as Indian forces continue crackdown
Meanwhile, Indian soldiers have blown up nine homes of pro-freedom Kashmiris and detained nearly 2,000 people since the Pahalgam attack, sparking public anger and accusations of “collective punishment”.

Police have launched a vast manhunt and detained a long list of suspects for questioning, including nearly 2,000 residents across the territory, a senior police official told AFP.
“It’s a revolving door in police stations as part of the ongoing investigation,” the officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to talk to the media.
“Some have already been let go, and more are being summoned to police stations,” the officer added. “These are not arrests, just for seeking information that could lead to the terrorists,” the official insisted.
Security forces have searched nearly 1,000 houses and forests hunting for the attackers in India-held Kashmir, a local police official told Reuters on Monday.
 
 

Political leaders in the state have called for caution to ensure the innocent are not harmed in the government’s actions against terrorism.
“It’s time to … avoid any misplaced action that alienates people. Punish the guilty, show them no mercy but don’t let innocent people become collateral damage,” Omar Abdullah, the territory’s chief minister said on X on Saturday.
Another former chief minister made an appeal to the Indian government “to take care that innocent people are not made to feel the brunt as alienation aids terrorists’ goals of division and fear”.
Aga Ruhullah, a federal lawmaker from occupied Kashmir, said: “Kashmir and Kashmiris are being given a collective punishment”.

While no one has claimed responsibility for the blast, the security situation in KP has continued to deteriorate, particularly after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase its attacks against the security forces.
Wana City police Station House Officer (SHO) Usman Nazir told Dawn.com that seven people were killed and 16 others were also injured in the blast, which took place around 11am on Monday.
“Five of the injured are in critical condition,” he said. “The peace committee office was the target, as there was a meeting going on there at the time of the explosion.”
The SHO added that peace committee member Saifur Rehman was injured in the attack, “but his condition is not critical”.
KP Health Adviser Ehtesham Ali condemned the blast in a statement and said that seven bodies had been transferred to the hospital.
“Around 15 injured have been brought to the hospital,” Ethesham said. “The injured are receiving treatment and an emergency has been declared in the hospital. Staff leaves have been suspended.”
Meanwhile, the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) in Wana confirmed that seven bodies were brought to the hospital after the blast, but the list issued by the hospital stated that a total of nine people were injured.
Thick black smoke was visible in the photos from the scene posted on social media.
 






Senator Sherry Rehman published a statement on X condemning the blast, calling the attack “a cowardly act”.
“I am deeply saddened by the loss of six lives,” she wrote. “Targeting innocent civilians is a cowardly act and terrorists who target the innocent do not deserve any leniency.”
Sherry added: “No matter what the terrorists do, they cannot break the resolve of the security forces and the brave public.”
 






Peace committees have existed in the area since 2007, such as that led by Mullah Nazir which was assigned the task of evicting Uzbek, Tajiks and other foreign fighters from the area.
Mullah Nazir was killed along with his 10 associates in a US drone strike in the Birmil area of South Wazi­ristan Agency in January 2013.</p><small>2025-04-28 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28153912005f8ee.png?r=154448' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907126/security-forces-kill-17-more-terrorists-operating-at-behest-of-indian-masters-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 17 more terrorists operating at ‘behest of Indian masters’: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces have killed 17 terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, the military’s media wing said on Monday.
A day ago, the forces had neutralised 54 terrorists  while they were attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in the same region. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), this is the highest-ever number of terrorists killed by security forces in a single engagement throughout the campaign against terrorism.
According to an ISPR statement issued today, “a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in surrounding areas of Hassan Khel, North Waziristan District, along Pakistan-Afghanistan Border.
“During the conduct of the operation, seventeen more khawarij, who were operating [at] behest of their Indian masters, were hunted down and successfully neutralised,” ISPR said.
The ISPR added that a large cache of weapons, ammunition and explosives was also recovered from the slain khawarij, a term the state uses to refer to terrorists.
“The number of khwarij killed in three days anti [infiltration] operation has risen to 71,” it added.
The security forces remain committed to securing the nation’s frontiers and thwart attempts at sabotaging the peace, stability and progress of Pakistan, the statement said.
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the operation in North Waziristan.
According to Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), the president and the prime minister lauded the bravery of the security forces in separate statements.
The president reaffirmed to continuation of security operations until the complete eradication of terrorism.
“The successful operations by our security forces against terrorists are commendable,” the president said, vowing to uphold the unwavering commitment to the defence of the country and the elimination of terrorism.
The premier pointed out, “The killing of 71 Khawarij terrorists during the security operations in North Waziristan over the past three days clearly shows that our law enforcement agencies are fully determined and vigilant in their mission to eliminate terrorism.”
“We will continue to thwart the nefarious designs of these terrorists (enemies of humanity), in the same resolute manner,” he said, expressing the determination to continue the war against terrorism until the complete eradication of terrorists.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-04-28 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28170140758c134.jpg?r=171809' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907138/putin-announces-surprise-ukraine-truce-for-may-8-10' target='_blank'><strong>Putin announces surprise Ukraine truce for May 8-10</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered a surprise three-day ceasefire from May 8-10, coinciding with Moscow’s World War II Victory Day commemorations, the Kremlin said on Monday.
Moscow said it expected Kyiv to issue a similar order, and that it stood ready to respond to any violations of the possible halt in fighting.
Putin made a similar order to stop combat over Easter — a truce that both sides accused the other of violating hundreds of times, but did lead to a temporary reduction in fighting.
“The Russian side is declaring a ceasefire during the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, from midnight on May 7-8 to midnight on May 10-11. All combat operations will be suspended during this period,” the Kremlin said in a statement.

“Russia believes that the Ukrainian side should follow this example. In the event of violations of the truce by the Ukrainian side, the Russian armed forces will give an adequate and effective response,” it added.
Putin last month rejected a US proposal for a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire that had been accepted by Ukraine.
Kyiv and its European backers accused Putin of announcing the 30-hour Easter truce as a PR exercise and said he had little desire for peace.
Since launching its Ukraine offensive in February 2022, Russia has seized large parts of four Ukrainian regions and claimed them as its own, in addition to Crimea, which it annexed in 2014.
‘Tapping me along’
Putin’s order of a ceasefire comes at the beginning of what the United States indicated would be a crucial week for the chances of a ceasefire that could determine how long Washington keeps trying to broker a deal.
After a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Pope Francis’s funeral on Saturday, Donald Trump questioned whether the Russian leader was serious about peace.
“There was no reason for Putin to be shooting missiles into civilian areas, cities and towns, over the last few days. It makes me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along,” Trump had said on Truth Social.
 


Russian missiles have killed dozens of civilians over the last month in large-scale strikes on Zelensky’s home city of Kryvyi Rig, the northeastern city of Sumy and the capital Kyiv.
Russia had earlier on Monday said it was ready to negotiate directly with Ukraine, but that recognition of its claims over five Ukrainian regions, including Crimea, were “imperative” to resolving the conflict.
Ukraine has denounced the annexations as an illegal land grab and says it will never recognise them, while European officials have warned that accepting Moscow’s demands set a dangerous precedent that could lead to future Russian aggression.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview with Brazilian newspaper O Globo published  on Monday that “we remain open to negotiations.”
“But the ball is not in our court. So far, Kyiv has not demonstrated its ability to negotiate,” he said, adding Moscow’s position on the conflict was “well-known”.
“International recognition of Russia’s ownership of Crimea, Sevastopol, the Donetsk People’s Republic, the Lugansk People’s Republic, the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions is imperative,” he said, using the Kremlin’s names for the Ukrainian regions.
Zelensky said last Friday that Ukraine would “not legally recognise any temporarily occupied territories”, and has previously called the demilitarisation demand “incomprehensible”.
Kursk retaken
Trump, who boasted before his inauguration that he could halt Russia’s assault on Ukraine within “24 hours”, launched a diplomatic offensive to stop the fighting after taking office in January.
But the White House has voiced frustration with both sides, as the conflict that has devastated swathes of eastern Ukraine and killed tens of thousands of people drags on.
Russia and Ukraine have not held direct talks on the fighting since the start of Moscow’s offensive in 2022.
Early Monday, a Russian attack on a Ukrainian village near the frontline city of Pokrovsk killed a married couple and another local resident, regional prosecutors said.
Meanwhile, Russia over the weekend announced it had taken full control of its Kursk region with the help of North Korean troops, more than eight months after Kyiv launched a cross-border ground assault.
Putin thanked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Monday for help with the operation, which has denied Kyiv a key bargaining chip in future talks with Moscow.
The Russian army said on Monday it had taken control of the village of Kamianka in the northeastern Kharkiv region, in its latest battlefield advance.</p><small>2025-04-28 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28125916afbfcc2.png?r=132128' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907114/16-pakistani-youtube-channels-banned-in-india-after-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>16 Pakistani YouTube channels banned in India after Pahalgam attack</strong></a><br><p>The Indian government has banned 16 Pakistani YouTube channels on recommendations from its Ministry of Home Affairs, Pakistani and Indian media outlets reported on Monday.
Tensions have risen between the two Asian nations following a recent attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, and is one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000. Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).

India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
The YouTube channels blocked by the Indian authorities include those of Dawn News, Samaa TV, ARY News, Geo News, Bol News, Suno News and Raftar.
Journalists whose channels were banned included Irshad Bhatti, Asma Shirazi, Umar Cheema, Muneeb Farooq and Rizwan Razi.
Dawn.com confirmed that these YouTube channels could not be accessed in India.
No authority or official in Pakistan has commented on the matter so far.
The sites were blocked in India on Monday, with a message reading it was due to an “order from the government related to national security or public order”.
Even renowned former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar’s channel was not spared. Uzair Cricket was another commentary channel reportedly banned in India.
 


The Pakistan Experience, a podcast channel by content creator Shehzad Ghias, said it was also banned in India.
“Is our minor podcast a national security risk?” it quipped in a post on X, sharing a screenshot of a message by YouTube addressed to the podcast account.
“In my opinion, Uzair Younus and I did quite a sensible balanced discussion on the issue. There is nothing in this podcast that warranted us getting banned in India,” Ghias asserted on X, sharing a link to the video titled ‘Are India and Pakistan about to go to war? - The aftermath of the Pahalgam incident’.
The Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claimed that these YouTube channels were pushing “false narratives” against India, its army and security agencies.
The Indian authorities further alleged that these channels were spreading “provocative, communally sensitive” content aimed at “inciting communal tensions”.
Indian news agency ANI shared the list on its X account.
 


On April 24, a day after India announced a slew of measures, Indian media reported that the Modi-led regime had blocked the Pakistani government’s X account in the country as tensions escalated between the neighbours.</p><small>2025-04-28 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/28164558fde8d87.jpg?r=164707' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907131/fact-check-viral-video-of-massive-fire-at-lahore-airport-is-old-from-may-2024' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video of massive fire at Lahore airport is old from May 2024</strong></a><br><p>Multiple Indian media outlets and social media users have been sharing a video of Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport since Saturday, claiming that a missile battery of the Air Defence System exploded during installation, resulting in the suspension of all services at the airport. However, the incident is from May 2024 when a short circuit in the ceiling caused smoke and flight delays.
An attack took place in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in India-occupied Kashmir that draws thousands of visitors every summer, on April 22. Gunmen opened fire on visitors, killing at least 26 people — all men from across India except one from Nepal — and injuring 17 others. It was the region’s deadliest attack on civilians since 2000. A hitherto unknown group, named by several Indian outlets as ‘The Resistance Front’, is said to have claimed responsibility for the attack.
India followed suit by announcing a series of actions against Pakistan. Responding in kind, Pakistan’s top brass also announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect.
As diplomatic channels dry up and treaty frameworks teeter, analysts warn that relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours may be approaching a dangerous tipping point, with limited space remaining for de-escalation.
On Saturday, a known Indian propaganda account posted a 32-second long clip showing a crowd with suitcases standing at the airport covered with smoke.
The caption of the post said, “Allama Iqbal International Airport Lahore, Pakistan is burning after a missile battery of Air Defence System exploded during installation. Fourteen Pakistani soldiers died due to this incident. All services have been suspended at Lahore airport and the Pakistan Army has taken control.”
The post gained 479,400 views.
The same video with similar captions was shared by Indian as well Pakistani and Afghani accounts on X which can be seen here, here, here, here and here with 19,200, 52,600, 295,400, 54,700, and 6,200 views respectively.
Indian media outlets such as Financial Express, ABP News, News Arena India, Kalinga Tv and Lokmat Times also reported the same incident on Saturday.
The same clip was also shared by Facebook users as can be seen here, here, and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the events unfolding between India and Pakistan in the wake of the recent Pahalgam attack.
A keyword search to corroborate the alleged development yielded no news stories regarding any recent fire at the airport or the deaths of soldiers and the suspension of operations.
A reverse image search yielded a Pakistan Today report published on May 9, 2024, that featured a screenshot from the viral video.
According to the report, a fire erupted at Allama Iqbal International Airport due to a short circuit in the ceiling of the immigration counter, leading to delays in both Haj and international flights.
The screenshot was also featured in a YouTube news bulletin from Indian channel CNN-News18 on May 9, 2024.
 


Several other reports published by Pakistani, as well as Indian media outlets, were also found on the actual incident.
A keyword search also yielded a statement from the Pakistan Airports Authority, published by state news outlet The Associated Press of Pakistan, rejecting the reports about the suspension of operations.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a video shows a massive fire at Lahore’s Allama Iqbal Airport, resulting in flight cancellations, is misleading.  The clip actually dates back to May 2024, when fire and smoke from a short circuit in the airport’s ceiling led to flight delays.

“We have signed the deal for 26 Rafale jets,” a spokesperson for India’s defence ministry told AFP.
When delivered, the jets would join 36 French-made Rafale fighters already acquired by New Delhi as part of its efforts to rapidly modernise its military hardware.
 






The Indian government first announced its intention to procure 26 Rafales in 2023, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited France for the Bastille Day celebrations.
The jets made by French aerospace company Dassault Aviation are expected to operate from Indian-made aircraft carriers, replacing the Russian MiG-29K jets.
“The Rafale-Marine is a carrier-borne combat-ready aircraft with proven operational capabilities in a maritime environment. The delivery of these aircraft would be completed by 2030, with the crew undergoing training in France and India,” the statement by the Indian Ministry of Defence said.
Indian media reports suggest that the deal would include training, equipment, weapons and other related logistical support for the Indian military.
Despite historical ties with Russia as its key supplier for military equipment, India has diversified with key purchases including from France as well as from the United States and Israel.
It also marks another step in India’s long-standing reliance on French military hardware, including Mirage 2000 jets bought in the 1980s and Scorpene-class submarines ordered in 2005.

The World Bank had predicted Pakistan’s economy to grow by 2.8 per cent during the current fiscal year in its Pakistan Development Update (PDU), released in October last year. However, the Bank last week slightly lowered its growth forecast for the country to 2.7pc for the current fiscal year, citing continued economic stabilisation but persistent constraints from tight monetary and fiscal policies.
“After inheriting an economy facing significant challenges —from contracting GDP (gross domestic product) to depleting reserves—we have stabilised the fundamentals, restored confidence, and reignited growth,” the report quoted the finance minister as saying.
Speaking at length about the country’s economic growth, the finance minister outlined a few key achievements, including “a historic reduction in inflation to 0.7pc, the lowest in 60 years; doubling of foreign exchange reserves; a 3pc currency appreciation; and a current account surplus exceeding $1 billion in March 2025”, the report added.
He further said that in the current fiscal year, Pakistan saw a 44pc increase in foreign direct investment (FDI) along with a 24pc rise in IT exports. He also highlighted record-high remittances — currently projected at $38bn.
Aurangzeb noted that, following Fitch’s upgrade of Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating to B-, the country achieved its highest fiscal surplus in 24 years
He also highlighted Pakistan’s success in reducing its public debt-to-GDP ratio from 75pc to 67.2pc, adding that Pakistan planned to bring it below 60pc over the medium term via “prudent fiscal management, enhanced domestic financing, and tax reforms.”
With a focus on transparency, competitive processes, and investor confidence, he explained that rightsizing government expenditures and privatising loss-making state-owned enterprises will save up to 2pc of GDP annually.
As per the report, “He also laid out plans to build a deeper and more resilient system by expanding digital banking, capital markets and green finance.”
Emphasising that “stability is not an end but a means to an end, “ the finance minister outlined the government’s strategy, including maintaining fiscal discipline, controlling inflation, and pushing ahead with deep structural reforms in energy, taxation, governance, and the management of state-owned enterprises, the report added.
Stressing the need for strengthening human development, he identified opportunities in sectors such as the IT sector and green energy initiatives, maintaining that human development was “critical to sustaining high, inclusive growth”.
In his concluding remarks, the finance minister said, “Pakistan’s future will be shaped by bold, necessary choices. By investing in our people, modernising our economy, and staying committed to reform, Pakistan will emerge stronger, greener, and more competitive.”
The 2025 conference about Pakistan, titled “Bridging Divides, Building Tomorrow: Pakistan’s Path to Inclusive Growth and Governance,” is an annual Harvard event — the largest student-led conference on Pakistan in the United States — aimed at discussing the political, economical and social trajectory of Pakistan. The forum brings together policymakers, business leaders, academics and students.
“The conference serves as a vital forum to advance collaborative solutions, promote global engagement, and showcase the creativity and resilience of the Pakistani people,” as per the report.</p><small>2025-04-28 11:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602201-seven-killed-several-injured-in-blast-near-peace-committee-office-in-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll rises to nine in South Waziristan blast near peace committee office</strong></a><br><p>

The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed by 941.79 points, or 0.82 per cent, to stand at 116,411.13 from the previous close of 115,469.34 at 10:05am.
However, at 3:03pm, selling pressure ensued as the index decreased by 969.19 points, or 0.84pc, to stand at 114,500.15 from the previous close.
Finally, the index closed at 114,063.90, down by 1,405.44 points or 1.22pc, from the last close.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said, “Corporate results of heavyweight companies caused the index to fluctuate in today’s trading session.
“While investors remained cautious due to heightened tensions between Pakistan and India,” he added.
Mohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, said,“Though some buying was seen in the morning session amid no major development on Pak-India front, investors remained cautious fearing that coming few days seem crucial in the ongoing tension between the two neighbours.”
Yousuf M. Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, noted, “The market opened slightly higher today and then pulled back as initial excitement faded.”
On a positive note, Farooq said that market sentiment was supported by relief that “no major escalation” occurred between India and Pakistan over the weekend, along with the country’s monthly current account “in a comfortable position” and corporations “posting strong profits”.
In other positive developments, Farooq added that inflation was at a record low, and the real effective exchange rate (REER) stood at 101.
“The market opened slightly higher today, supported by relief that no major escalation occurred between India and Pakistan over the weekend [following the Pahalgam attack],” he added.
“With most market participants expecting interest rate cuts ahead, there is potential for a rerating of the market’s PE [price-to-earning] multiple,” he said.
“However, a significant upward move will likely require de-escalation between India and Pakistan.”
Last week, the April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000.
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations had unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
AKD Securities noted that the market had remained volatile last week due to escalating geopolitical tensions following the Pahalgam attack, and India’s subsequent suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan in the aftermath of the incident, undermining investor sentiment.</p><small>2025-04-28 10:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602194-security-forces-kill-71-terrorists-in-three-day-long-operations-near-pak-afghan-border' target='_blank'><strong>India-backed militants among 71 terrorists killed at Pak-Afghan border in last 3 days</strong></a><br><p>
