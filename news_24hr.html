<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/142316114512d9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961097/pia-dispels-fake-news-of-crew-disappearance-in-toronto' target='_blank'><strong>PIA dispels ‘fake news’ of crew disappearance in Toronto</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Sunday issued a statement denying that the entire crew of a PIA flight disappeared in Toronto, Canada, adding that it was “fake news” circulated by “anti-Pakistan quarters”.
“A tweet, circulated by certain anti-Pakistan quarters, claiming that [the] whole crew of a particular PIA flight is missing, is entirely baseless,” the flag carrier said in a post on X, adding that the purpose was to “malign PIA and Pakistan”.
“There has been no such incident, and the news is fake,” it added.
Meanwhile, a PIA spokesperson issued a separate statement denying the news, claiming that the information had been circulated by an “Afghan and anti-Pakistan account”.
“The misleading tweet is part of a well-conceived plan based on hostility towards Pakistan and is aimed at damaging the reputation of the national airline and the country,” the spokesperson said, clarifying that the news held no truth.
Missing PIA crew members, particularly in Canada, have been reported in the past, too.
On November 21, a PIA flight attendant reportedly went missing in Canada, prompting the airline to launch an inquiry into his disappearance.
​According to PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez Khan, the attendant did not report for flight PK-798 from Toronto to Lahore.
“When contacted, he cited ill health as an excuse,” the spokesperson said, adding that the matter is being investigated. “In case of illegal disappearance, departmental action will be initiated against the flight attendant.”
Last year in October, a cabin crew member was reportedly gone missing while on duty. The missing crew member, based in Islamabad, had disappeared during a layover in Toronto.
Similarly, a 47-year-old PIA steward was reportedly gone missing in Canada in March 2024.
In February 2024, another member of the airline’s cabin crew was reported missing while on duty. The member had arrived in Toronto on PIA flight PK-782 from Islamabad but failed to report for duty on the return flight, PK-784 to Karachi.</p><small>2025-12-14 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14224958a1af717.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961096/ukraines-zelensky-drops-nato-ambition-as-berlin-peace-talks-begin' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine’s Zelensky drops Nato ambition as Berlin peace talks begin</strong></a><br><p>Ukraine has relinquished its aim to join the Nato military alliance in exchange for Western security guarantees as a compromise to end the war with Russia, President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday as peace talks got underway in Berlin.
Zelensky aired the concession as he flew to the German capital, where he began meetings with US President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner in efforts to end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World War Two.
The move marks a major shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia’s war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.
Zelensky met the US envoys at talks hosted by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who, a source said, had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday.
Security guarantees from the United States, Europe and other partners instead of Nato membership represented a compromise on Ukraine’s side, Zelensky said ahead of Sunday’s discussions.

“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join Nato; these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” he said in answer to questions from reporters in a WhatsApp chat.
“Thus, today, bilateral security guarantees between Ukraine and the US, Article 5-like guarantees for us from the US and security guarantees from European colleagues, as well as other countries, Canada [and] Japan are an opportunity to prevent another Russian invasion,” Zelensky said.
“And it is already a compromise from our part,” he said, adding that the security guarantees should be legally binding.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its Nato ambitions and withdraw troops from about 10 per cent of Donbas, which Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country and that no Nato troops can be stationed there.
Russian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by major Western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards — shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.
Zelensky had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.
Under pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow’s demands, Zelensky accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities and Ukraine’s power and water supplies.
Sending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.
Zelensky said Ukraine, the Europeans and the US are looking at a 20-point plan and that at the end of it there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has no direct talks with Russia.
A ceasefire along the current front lines would be a fair option, he added.
‘Critical moment’
Britain, France and Germany have been working to refine the US proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its Nato ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.
European allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine’s future, and sought to shore up Kyiv’s finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.
Putin hosted Witkoff and Kushner at a meeting earlier in December that the Kremlin praised as “constructive”, although no major breakthroughs were reached.
Zelensky said hundreds of thousands were still without power after Russian strikes on energy, heating and water supplies across Ukraine.
“Russia is dragging out the war and seeks to inflict as much harm as possible on our people,” he said.

Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine caused relations with the West to plummet and has cranked up warnings from Nato and European leaders that Putin would not stop there.
Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a speech in Berlin on Thursday that Nato should be “prepared for the scale of war our grandparents or great-grandparents endured” and asserted that “we are Russia’s next target”.
The Kremlin has repeatedly dismissed such claims.
“This seems like a statement by a representative of a generation that has managed to forget what World War Two was actually like,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state television reporter Pavel Zarubin on Sunday.
“They have no understanding, and unfortunately, Mr Rutte, making such irresponsible statements, simply does not understand what he is talking about,” Peskov added.</p><small>2025-12-14 18:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14153319ce629ab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961076/suspect-involved-in-australia-bondi-beach-shooting-identified-police' target='_blank'><strong>Suspect involved in Australia Bondi Beach shooting identified: police</strong></a><br><p>One of the suspected shooters in a gun attack at Sydney’s Bondi Beach on Sunday has been identified by police, a senior law enforcement official told the public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).
Ten people were killed and around a dozen were wounded when gunmen opened fire during a Jewish holiday event at the beach, Australian officials said. New South Wales police said two people had been taken into custody, and the ABC said one of at least two gunmen was among those killed.
According to the law enforcement official, the suspect was identified as Naveed Akram, who lives in the Sydney suburb of Bonnyrigg.
ABC gave no information on his nationality.
“The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr Akram’s home … was being raided by police on Sunday evening,” ABC reported.
Australian police said an “improvised explosive device” had been found in a car linked to a suspect in the deadly shooting.
“We have found an improvised explosive device in a car which is linked to the deceased offender,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told a news conference.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the incident “shocking and distressing”, adding that “emergency responders are on the ground and working to save lives”.
“I saw at least 10 people on the ground and blood everywhere,” 30-year-old local Harry Wilson, who witnessed the shooting, told the Sydney Morning Herald.
According to The Sydney Morning Herald, 43-year-old fruit vendor Ahmed el Ahmed disarmed one of the attackers and wrestled his weapon away from him.
“Ahmed placed himself in the line of fire to take a rifle from the shooter, and was later hit by at least two bullets himself,” the newspaper reported, adding that Ahmed’s cousin told the media that he was shot in his hand and upper arm.
“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” the cousin, Mustafa was quoted as saying. “We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 per cent.”

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Jewish people who had gone to light the first candle of the Hanukkah holiday on the beach had been attacked by “vile terrorists”.
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said he was appalled by the shooting.
“These are the results of the anti-Semitic rampage in the streets of Australia over the past two years, with the anti-Semitic and inciting calls of ‘Globalise the Intifada’ that were realised today,” he alleged.
One of the world’s most famous beaches, Bondi is typically crowded with locals and tourists, especially on warm weekend evenings.
“If we were targeted deliberately in this way, it’s something of a scale that none of us could have ever fathomed. It’s a horrific thing,” Alex Ryvchin, co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, told Sky News, adding his media adviser had been wounded in the attack.
Videos circulating on X appeared to show people on the beach and nearby park scattering as multiple gunshots and police sirens could be heard.
One video showed a man dressed in a black shirt firing a large weapon before being tackled by a man in a white T-shirt who wrestled his weapon off him. A different man was seen firing a weapon from a pedestrian bridge.
Another video showed two men pressed onto the ground by uniformed police on a small pedestrian bridge. Officers could be seen trying to resuscitate one of the men. Reuters could not immediately verify the footage.
The attack came almost exactly 11 years after a lone gunman took 18 people hostage at the Lindt Cafe in Sydney. Two hostages and the gunman were killed after a 16-hour standoff.
Sussan Ley, the leader of Australia’s opposition Liberal party, said the loss of life in the incident was “significant”.
“Australians are in deep mourning tonight, with hateful violence striking at the heart of an iconic Australian community, a place we all know so well and love, Bondi,” she said.
President, PM express solidarity with Australia
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack and extended their condolences to the victims in separate statements.
In a statement from the Presidency, President Zardari expressed sorrow over the incident, praying for the victims’ families and wishing the injured a speedy recovery.
“Pakistan, itself a victim of terrorism, stands in solidarity with Australia and condemns violence against innocent civilians,” the statement read.







Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz extended his condolences and said Pakistan condemns terrorism in all of its forms.
“We stand in solidarity with the people and government of Australia in this difficult time,” he wrote.

According to a statement issued by the FIA on Saturday, the suspect was taken into custody during a major operation at the airport.
Initial investigations revealed that the suspect was involved in organised migrant smuggling and online fraud activities operating out of Cambodia.
The FIA said the suspect had travelled from Pakistan to Cambodia in September 2024, where he worked for an online fraud company. “He later began recruiting individuals from Pakistan as agents, allegedly facilitating their movement to Cambodia under false pretences,” the statement said.
During forensic analysis of the suspect’s mobile phone, investigators recovered passport photographs of several individuals, payment receipts and records of financial transactions.
The agency said the suspect received money through personal bank accounts as well as cryptocurrency accounts, indicating the use of multiple channels to move illicit funds.
The FIA said the suspect has been handed over to its anti-smuggling circle in Karachi for further legal proceedings.
“Further investigation is underway to identify other members of the network and potential victims,” the statement said.
In January, more than 30 officers of the FIA were booked and dismissed from service over their alleged collusion with human smugglers in sending Pakistanis abroad illegally.
The FIA began the purge following the capsizing of a boat carrying illegal immigrants near Greece in December last year. According to estimates, more than 80 Pakistanis drowned in the accident, and 36 were rescued. The remaining were presumed dead.
In response to the tragedy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered the authorities to take action against the human smugglers and officials aiding them. Since then, a countrywide crackdown has been launched against human smugglers, leading to the arrests of dozens of suspects.
Consequently, FIA Lahore arrested 177 human smugglers in the following months.

“On 12-13 December 2025, thirteen khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna Al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It said that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of the terrorists in KP’s Mohmand district.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven khwarij were sent to hell.”
It added that the second IBO was conducted in the province’s Bannu district, where security forces neutralised six more terrorists.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as a relentless counterterrorism campaign under [the] vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement said.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.
Last month, security forces eliminated 22 terrorists during an operation in the Bannu district.</p><small>2025-12-14 16:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14165032df73cd3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961078/christmas-lights-and-pakistans-colours-illuminate-a-message-of-love-harmony-in-washington' target='_blank'><strong>Christmas lights and Pakistan’s colours illuminate a message of love, harmony in Washington</strong></a><br><p>The hall at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington glowed in Christmas colours on Saturday evening.
Red and gold decorations framed the space, while green — the unmistakable green of Pakistan — appeared everywhere: in flags, ribbons and lapel pins. White lights shimmered softly, echoing both the season and the crescent-and-star that defines the country these guests continue to call their own.
The pre-Christmas gathering, hosted for Pakistani Christians and their neighbours, began and ended with a chant that left little doubt about that bond: “Pakistan Zindabad.” It was not a slogan offered for form’s sake. It was spoken with warmth, conviction, and an insistence born of long experience.
For more than a decade, speakers noted, such gatherings have brought together Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Sikhs and Jews — a quiet tradition of interfaith fellowship that has survived politics, violence and neglect.
A message from the Virginia governor praised the organisers’ work over the past twelve years and encouraged the embassy to continue supporting initiatives that unite people across faiths.







Dr Srilekha Palle, an advisor to the Virginia governor, spoke of India and Pakistan as neighbours “so much alike,” expressing a hope to visit Pakistan one day. Loving one’s country, she said, was inseparable from faith itself: to love your homeland is to reflect your love of God.
Several speakers returned to that theme — patriotism without exclusion, faith without hierarchy. Pakistan’s Deputy Ambassador Batool Kazim described the dinner as a long-standing tradition meant not only to celebrate Christmas but to welcome Christian brothers and sisters and their neighbours into a shared Pakistani space.
Visits to Pakistan by members of the Christian diaspora, she said, often become moments of rediscovery — “encounters that help them understand the country beyond headlines and fear, and help others see their place within it”.

This, she said, was a time for reflection: on what had gone wrong, and on how the coming year might be made better — for everyone.
Speakers stressed that pluralism and interfaith harmony were not borrowed ideas but a vital part of Pakistan’s national fabric.
The contributions of Christians to education, healthcare and defence were acknowledged repeatedly, described not as favours but as facts — a source of collective pride.
When Pakistani Christians live abroad, one speaker noted, they often become an unrecognised bridge between Pakistan and the West, carrying stories of both pain and belonging.
There were also references to law and responsibility: protecting minority rights, proposed legislation on minority commissions, and the need for a collective will to translate words into protection.
Pastor John Nuzum of Church of the Holy Spirit offered a simple prayer, blessing both Pakistan and the United States.

The Jewish-Islamic Dialogue Society of Washington also sent a representative, stressing the importance of sustained conversation across faiths, especially in times when identity is weaponised.
Throughout the evening, the mood remained warm — deliberately so. The reds and golds of Christmas blended with Pakistan’s green and white, mirroring the message speakers returned to again and again: faiths may differ, but citizenship should not.
That message carried an added weight because it echoed words written more than a decade ago, in moments of far darker national grief. This evening was not about charity, tolerance, or exception. It was about belonging.
When the final prayers were offered and the gathering drew to a close, the chant rose again — unprompted, confident, almost defiant: “Pakistan Zindabad.”
It came from voices that have known grief, accusation, and silence. It came from people who, despite everything done to them — and sometimes in their name — continue to claim the country as theirs.
Under red Christmas lights and Pakistan’s green and white, that claim felt both ordinary and extraordinary at once.
“Please, feel our attachment to Pakistan,” said the event’s organiser, Ilyas Masih. “Despite subzero temperatures, every seat in this large hall is occupied, and people are standing along the sidelines.”</p><small>2025-12-14 16:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14201053279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961094/pti-demands-cessation-of-imrans-solitary-confinement-following-un-experts-report' target='_blank'><strong>PTI demands cessation of Imran’s ‘solitary confinement’ following UN expert’s report</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Saturday expressed grave concern over a report issued by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Alice Jill Edwards, saying it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”
The report, released on Friday, claimed the PTI founder is being held in conditions that could “amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on authorities to comply with international norms and standards.”
In a statement issued by PTI’s Central Media Department, the party said the UN report unequivocally confirmed what it has consistently maintained for a long time: that Imran Khan was being subjected to “inhuman, unlawful, and degrading treatment motivated entirely by political vendetta.”







The PTI asserted that the report reaffirmed Imran’s 23 hours of solitary confinement, constant CCTV surveillance, isolation from the outside world, obstruction of meetings with legal counsel and family, denial of religious practice, and deprivation of basic human necessities, which constituted a blatant violation of prison rules and a flagrant breach of international human rights law.
“According to the United Nations, solitary confinement exceeding 15 days falls under the category of psychological torture, while Imran Khan has been subjected to this agonising process for months,” the PTI added in its statement.
The party said that subjecting a 72-year-old suffering from serious medical conditions, a spinal injury and wounds from a prior assassination attempt to such conditions, while denying adequate medical care, amounted to deliberate and calculated cruelty.
PTI demanded the immediate cessation of solitary confinement, the provision of detention conditions consistent with human dignity and international standards, unrestricted access to personal physicians and the removal of all barriers to meetings in strict compliance with judicial orders.
“This matter is no longer just about a political prisoner but has become a test of the credibility of law, justice, and human rights in Pakistan. If the treatment being meted out to Imran Khan is not stopped, it will be considered the worst example of state-sponsored violence,” the statement concluded.
However, Prime Minister’s aide Rana Ihsan Afzal dismissed the rapporteur’s findings and insisted that Imran is being treated “according to prison rules and the jail manual”.
“His children have access, and he should schedule [a call] and put in the appropriate request. There is no issue or obstacle from the government of Pakistan,” said the premier’s aide.
He added that the PTI founder is being provided facilities “greater than his rights” as a B-class prisoner.
“He has the facilities of exercise available, good food is available, and ample space is also available.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.</p><small>2025-12-14 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639364-security-forces-kill-13-terrorists-in-two-kp-ibos-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 13 terrorists in two KP IBOs: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases, with the highest number of cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 19.This will be the last polio campaign of the year, which will conclude on December 21.
“The success of the campaign depends on our collective responsibility, so we must ensure that every child under five years of age receives polio drops,” she said in a statement.
The campaign aims to vaccinate 45.4 million children nationwide, including 23.3 million in Punjab, 10.6 million in Sindh, 7.3 million in KP and 2.66 million in Balochistan, with the remaining children covered in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad Capital Territory.
The drive is being conducted in coordination with Afghanistan’s December polio campaign to curb cross-border virus transmission.
Recalling the legacy of late Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Aseefa said “Pakistan’s first nationwide polio eradication campaign was launched under her leadership in 1994, and her vision continued to guide national efforts to eliminate the disease.”
She shared that she feels a deep personal connection to the cause, remembering that her mother, as the former prime minister, personally administered the first polio drops to her.
“That moment marked the beginning of Pakistan’s national fight against polio and shaped my lifelong commitment to the effort,” she said.
Aseefa Bhutto shared that the campaign will follow a three-day house-to-house vaccination drive with one catch-up day. In high-risk areas, community-based vaccination and special mobile team strategies will be implemented, and the  five-day campaign will be conducted with two additional catch-up days.
A total of 408,484 frontline polio workers, including area in-charges, union council medical officers and mobile, fixed and transit teams, have been deployed across the country.
Aseefa also called upon elected representatives, local government officials, religious leaders and community elders “to stand with polio teams, facilitate access to communities and help counter misinformation and hesitancy.”She urged citizens to welcome vaccinators, report missed children and support frontline workers, saying that only united action can stop the virus and protect the future of Pakistan’s children.

Over the past several days, multiple media bodies came together and condemned the 13-month ban, which initially affected the newspaper but extended to DawnNewsTV and the radio channel City FM 89.
In its press release today, the PFUJ condemned the ad ban and called it “an attempt to control media and stifle free expression”.
“In a joint statement, PFUJ President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari expressed deep concern over the government’s decision, stating that it is an attack on freedom of expression and an attempt to financially cripple a respected media outlet,” the union said.
“Dawn was founded by the father of the nation, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and the paper is respected globally for its unbiased reporting,” it added, quoting its president and secretary general.
The PFUJ urged the government to withdraw the ad ban for the promotion of “free and responsible journalism” and emphasised the importance of traditional media’s role amid the ubiquity of fake news.
“[The] PFUJ views this as an attempt to force the media group to change its editorial policy, which is unacceptable,” the press release read, adding that the union would stand in solidarity with the Dawn Media Group and called on the government to “respect the principles of press freedom and freedom of expression”.
Earlier this year, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) noted in its ‘Islamabad Declaration’ that Dawn has been denied advertisements by the federal and Punjab governments since October 2024 “because of its professional and critical approach in reporting and editorials”.
The Sindh government, too, has periodically withheld its ads for arbitrary reasons.
This was not the only way in which authorities have tried to obstruct Dawn’s reporting – after the so-called ‘Dawn Leaks’ saga, the paper’s circulation was blocked in large parts of the country, especially the cantonment areas, on the orders of certain individuals.</p><small>2025-12-14 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/141904487dc8340.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961089/exhausted-from-socialising-recharge-your-social-battery' target='_blank'><strong>Exhausted from socialising? Recharge your social battery</strong></a><br><p>You may feel worn out after a busy weekend of conversations and appointments, as though your social battery has run out.
“The more we move around in large groups, engage in conversations or are exposed to conflicts, the more our energy levels drop, similar to a smartphone battery when used frequently,” says Dr Steffen Häfner, medical director of a hospital in Germany’s Bad Saulgau and specialist in psychosomatic medicine and psychotherapy.
Everyone feels exhausted after a lot of socialising, says British author Amy Arthur, whose book Pace Yourself: How to Have Energy in an Exhausting World is dedicated to the issue.
“The upper limit varies from one person to the next.”
Experts agree that everyone, even extroverts who often draw energy from social interaction, needs time out to recover.
“The key is to strike a balance between activity and relaxation,” says Dr Häfner.
Only by retreating, resting or engaging in relaxing activities can you recharge your social battery.
Good strategies for regeneration include:

Restful sleep: Getting enough sleep is the basis for recharging your social battery.
Exercise in nature: Walking helps to recharge your inner battery.
Creative activities: Painting, playing music, or other creative activities have a relaxing and regenerating effect.
Meaningful conversations: A good conversation in which you feel understood can also contribute to relaxation.

All these things help to recharge your inner battery in everyday life, Dr Häfner says.
Retreating is the most obvious method.
Being alone can help if it is the exchange and interaction with others that tires us, according to Arthur.
However, if social anxiety or depression makes being with other people so exhausting, being alone may also exacerbate the problems.
And if you still feel exhausted despite rest and relaxation, this could be a sign of mental illness, Dr Häfner says.
People suffering from burn-out also report that they find it difficult to recover, even after long breaks, “like a smartphone plugged into a power outlet, but with a broken charging cable”.
Warning signs that you should take seriously include:

Permanent overload: The feeling of being permanently overwhelmed does not go away.
Social withdrawal: You increasingly withdraw from social contacts.
Lack of recovery: Even after breaks, you do not feel refreshed.

If you notice these signs or warning signals, it could be “that there is more to it than just everyday exhaustion”, says Dr Häfner.
“In such cases, it is advisable to seek professional support”, and with help, work on strengthening your resources, mitigating stress reactions and finding a healthy balance between withdrawal and social activity again.

Afridi’s intimation came during a PTI rally in Kohat, where he reminded the crowd that incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, had delivered the message from jail of “freedom or death”.







“So if we go this time around, we will either return in shrouds or after getting freedom,” he said, adding that Imran had given the responsibility of making decisions — be it about talks with the government or protests — to Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas.*
The two leaders are part of the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) along with the PTI, which has also nominated them as the opposition leaders in the National Assembly and Senate.
“For my part,” Afridi said, “I met them and assured them of any kind of support.”
He added, “So whenever a call comes from them, you have to be ready. And we will together seize Haqiqi Azadi from them (country’s current rulers).”
The CM claimed that “all institutions and the government want to eliminate the PTI”.
Even the judiciary did not heed PTI’s grievances, he said.
Without naming anyone, the CM further stated: “Those supposed to protect us turn into out killers, and those raised to protect our mandate, stole it. Tell me then, what solution do we have?”
He said Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz had been issuing advice to him lately but she should focus on her province instead.
“I will listen to them now?” he remarked, adding that “our leader is Imran, and we will listen to only him. There will be only Imran’s policy and rule here”.
He said Maryam should focus on her province, where, according to a recent survey, police had turned out to be the most corrupt department in the country.
CM Afridi also urged the people to report corruption cases to authorities and his government in KP would take action on the complaints. He also asked the divisional and district administrations to keep their doors open and listen to public issues.
Provincial Minister for Law, Parliamentary Affairs, and Human Rights Aftab Alam Afridi lamented that Imran’s family and CM Afridi were not allowed to meet the incarcerated party chief.
He also condemned Imran being called a “security threat” to the country, saying, “Yes, Khan was a threat, but only to those who had owned business empires in this country.”
Referring to today’s rally, he said these were just “warm-up matches”.
“And this time, when we leave, we will not come back empty handed,” he said, seemingly implying the possibility of a protest.
Speaking to the participants of the rally, PTI’s provincial president and MNA Junaid Akbar said the workers of the party “could never be threatened with police cases or press conferences.”
He also said that the party and its workers were ready to protect CM Afridi’s government.
“If someone tries to impose governor’s rule in KP, you must reach and lay siege to the governor’s house. We protected our vote, and we will protect our government, too,” he said.
He also said that the PTI was did not expect that “bullets, purchased from funds meant for development”, would be fired on its protesters on November 26, 2024.
“But I assure you, this time, we will come to face bullets.”
Akbar also mentioned that Achakzai would make decision regarding any dialogue or call for a protest.
Special Assistant to the Chief Minister Shafi Jan warned that if CM Afridi was removed, powers that be would not be able to control the masses.
Meanwhile, MNA Shehryar Afridi said that the PTI will take Imran’s case to every corner of the country.
“No power on earth could challenge Pakistan if the country were united,” he said, adding, “Imran Khan is a matter of pride for us.”</p><small>2025-12-14 14:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/141627020171ded.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961077/8-suspects-part-of-extortion-network-arrested-during-raid-at-sunni-tehreek-chiefs-residence-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>8 suspects part of extortion network arrested during raid at Sunni Tehreek chief’s residence in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>Karachi police said on Sunday that eight suspects, “involved in running an extortion network” were arrested during a raid at the residence of Pakistan Sunni Tehreek (PST) chairman Muhammad Sarwat Ejaz Qadri in Karachi.
Special Investigation Unit (SIU) Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Imran Khan confirmed Saturday night’s development during a press briefing in Karachi today.
At the same time, he also clarified that Qadri was neither wanted by police nor had he been arrested. Moreover, the official said police had no evidence of the suspects’ association with any party.
The SSP also clarified that police had found no evidence of the involvement of the PST chief or any other member in the extortion network.
SSP Khan said multiple cases had been registered against the arrested suspects, who were associated with an extortion network run by two men, who he identified as Wasiullah Lakho and Abdul Samad Kathiawari.
These two “most-wanted” suspects were reportedly “in hiding abroad”, the official said, adding that three other suspects had been playing a key role in running the extortion network in Karachi. The official identified those three suspects as Mullah Shahzaib, Jawwad alias Waja Qadri and Rehanuddin.
The SSP said the Karachi additional inspector general had constituted a special task force for action against extortion last week. The team comprised west zone deputy inspector general (DIG), Crime Investigation Agency DIG, central SSP and SIU SSP, he added.
Two days ago, he continued, the SIU arrested suspect Rehanuddin in an injured condition. “He is named in a case of extortion and firing at a car showroom, which was registered at the Jamshed Quarters police station a month ago.”
“During initial interrogation, the suspect revealed the names of other members and heads of the [extortion] group,” the official said, adding that based on the information shared by him, the SIU and central police conducted a joint raid in the jurisdiction of Rizvia police station on Saturday night.
Seventeen people were detained during the raid, he said, adding that nine weapons, including G-3 rifles, submachine guns and pistols, were also confiscated.
Initial investigation showed that eight of the detained suspects had criminal records, including Mullah Shahzaib and Jawwad. Apart from them, three suspects accused of firing while carrying out extortion activities and three “facilitators” were arrested, he added.
Ten cases had been registered with the SIU against nine suspects involved in extortion, including Rehanuddin, the SSP said.
He said further investigation of the matter was under way.
Replying to a question, he said if it was established that anyone had provided shelter to the suspects or kept them in hiding, action would be taken against that individual as well.
He also confirmed that among the suspects, Rehanuddin had contested elections in 2024 as an independent candidate for an MNA seat.</p><small>2025-12-14 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639300-dsp-haider-confesses-to-killing-wife-daughter' target='_blank'><strong>DSP Haider confesses to killing wife, daughter</strong></a><br><p>

The ministry’s clarification follows reports of the government agreeing to 11 new targets, including additional tax measures and expenditure cuts from early next month, to make up for rising revenue shortfalls and to keep the $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on track.
This was revealed in documents released by the IMF earlier this week, according to which commitment to the new or revised structural benchmarks, together with completion of two “prior actions”, enabled the conclusion of a staff-level agreement on the second review of the EFF and its approval by the IMF Executive Board for the disbursement of about $1.2bn for Pakistan on December 9.
A press release issued by the finance ministry today said that it had “clarified the intent, context, and continuity of reform measures under Pakistan’s IMF Extended Fund Facility programme, particularly in response to recent commentary regarding so-called “new conditions”.

 

“The purpose is to reaffirm that the measures referenced are part of a phased, medium-term reform agenda agreed with the IMF, many of which are extensions or logical progressions of reforms already initiated by the Government of Pakistan,” the press release read.
It said that the EFF was designed to support countries in implementing medium-term structural reforms aimed at achieving agreed policy objectives.
“These reforms are implemented in a sequenced and step-by-step manner over the duration of the programme,” it said. “Each review builds upon prior actions to ensure that the ultimate policy goals agreed at the outset of the program are achieved.
“Accordingly, actions under the EFF are structured as logical steps, with additional measures incorporated at each successive review.”
The press release said the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) with the IMF finalised after the second EFF review supplemented the MEFP agreed during the first review and reflected this phased approach.
During IMF discussions and negotiations, the government presented its planned policy reform initiatives, it said. “Where the IMF assesses that these initiatives contribute to the agreed programme objectives, they are incorporated into the MEFP.
“As a result, many of the structural benchmarks and actions included in the latest MEFP are derived from reforms already undertaken or initiated by the government of Pakistan, rather than being externally imposed or newly introduced conditions.”







The ministry issued clarifications for each of the 11 measures characterised as “new conditions”.
Regarding the public disclosure of asset declarations of civil servants, it said that this reform had been part of the EFF programme since the initial MEFP in May 2024.
“The current structural benchmark represents the second step, following the successful legislative amendment to the Civil Servants Act, 1973,” it said.
Commitments to strengthening the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) operational effectiveness and independence were also agreed during earlier reviews, it said, including coordination with provincial anti-corruption establishments.
“The development of action plans for high-risk agencies is a continuation of this commitment and runs parallel to, rather than stemming from, the Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment Report,” the ministry added.
On empowering provincial anti-corruption establishments, it said that allowing these bodies access to financial intelligence aligned with the ongoing Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) reform agenda, which had been “integral to the EFF since its inception”.
The ministry further said that strengthening remittance inflows was “critical to Pakistan’s external stability”.
“Following measures to curb informal channels, remittances increased by 26 per cent year-on-year from FY24 to FY25, with a further increase of 9.3 percent projected for FY26.
“The government, in coordination with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), has been working to remove structural bottlenecks in cross-border payments. The IMF has built upon these efforts by incorporating them into the MEFP,” it added.
The ministry also said that the IMF staff report that had been published in May 2025 had recommended a comprehensive study to identify bottlenecks in the local currency bond market to broaden the investor base. This recommendation has now been formalised as a structural benchmark, according to the press release.
On the deregulation of the sugar industry, it said that the initiative originated from the government.
“A task force, notified by the prime minister’s office and chaired by the minister for power, has been mandated to recommend full liberalisation of the sugar market and propose a national policy in consultation with provinces. Given its alignment with the EFF objective of reducing government intervention in commodity markets, the IMF has included this initiative as a structural benchmark,” it said.
The ministry added that the development of a comprehensive roadmap for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) was part of a broader domestic resource mobilisation reform agenda led directly by the prime minister.
“Key actions already taken include approval of the transformation plan, establishment of the Tax Policy Office, and strengthening of compliance risk management. This structural benchmark builds upon commitments made with the IMF in May 2024 and March 2025,” it said.
Further, the ministry called the requirement to develop and publish a medium-term tax reform strategy “a logical extension of earlier reforms, particularly the establishment and operationalisation of the Tax Policy Office to separate tax policy formulation from FBR’s operational functions”.
It said that the privatisation of distribution companies (Discos) had also been a core component of the EFF programme since its inception, adding that it was “envisaged to occur in phases”.
“Finalising preconditions for private-sector participation in Hesco (Hyderabad Electric Supply Company) and Sepco (Sukkur Electric Power Company) represents the next step following initiation of the process for the first batch of Discos. Additionally, the signing of Public Service Obligation (PSO) agreements with the seven largest entities reiterates an earlier programme commitment,” it added.
Regarding regulatory reforms and corporate compliance, it said, “Amendments to the Companies Act, 2017 to strengthen compliance for unlisted firms are part of the broader regulatory reform agenda aimed at improving the business climate, an objective embedded in the EFF from the outset.”
It added that, similarly, the structural benchmark related to a concept note for amendments to the Special Economic Zones (SEZ) Act follows the successful completion of a prior benchmark involving an SEZ assessment study.
Finally, it said that contingency measures to address potential revenue shortfalls had also been part of the MEFP framework since May 2024, adding that the initial MEFP itself included a structural benchmark for introducing a 5 per cent Federal Excise Duty on fertiliser and pesticides.
“In conclusion, the measures outlined in the latest MEFP represent continuity, sequencing, and deepening of Pakistan’s agreed reform agenda under the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility, rather than the imposition of abrupt or unprecedented conditions,” the ministry said.</p><small>2025-12-14 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14120517aff365f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961074/nocs-to-binance-htx-not-blanket-approvals-but-first-step-under-supervised-entry-framework-bilal-bin-saqib' target='_blank'><strong>NOCs to Binance, HTX not ‘blanket approvals’ but first step under supervised entry framework: Bilal bin Saqib</strong></a><br><p>Chairman of the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) Bilal Bin Saqib has said that the no-objection certificates (NOCs) issued to global cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and HTX were not a “blanket approval” but the “first step under a risk-mitigated, phased, supervised entry framework”.

         View this post on Instagram            

Saqib’s video statement, televised on Sunday, comes after Pakistan gave initial clearance for Binance and HTX on Friday to register with regulators to set up local subsidiaries and begin preparations for full exchange licence applications.
The clearances allow the exchanges to register on the Anti-Money Laundering system, set up local units and prepare full applications.
Speaking about the development, Saqib said the issuance of the NOCs to Binance and HTX was the “first practical step” that reflected a “new mindset”.
He further said that the step was based on the “Pakistan-first” approach.
Saqib detailed that by working under a supervised entry framework, authorities had been able to establish “control” in three areas, namely money laundering and terrorism financing; transparency of ownership and fitness and propreitary checks; and paving the way for licensing through the enforcement of timelines.
“It is mandatory for every platform to register on the AML [system] and have direct linkages with the financial monitoring unit,” he said, further asserting that no platform would be allowed entry in the country without “disclosures and verification”.
Moreover, he said, the process of licensing would be initiated for entities after they would “move forward in line with Pakistan’s law and with its oversight”.
Saqib said this model was not unique to Pakistan and the world’s leading financial centres had been approaching new industries in a phased manner.
Reiterating that a “Pakistan-first approach” was being employed in the crypto sector, he said, “We will first control this industry and then scale it.”
He said Pakistan ranked among the world’s top three “crypto-adoption countries”, adding that it was estimated that there were 30 to 40 million crypto users in the country.
“They have adopted this industry without any regulatory framework, classroom and education,” he said. “The good thing here is that this shows that our youth is world class. But are our systems world class? Are our regulations world class?”
Saqib further questioned whether it would be wise for the state to stay out of a sector in which people were involved on an extensive scale.
“You cannot ignore innovation,” he said, stressing that not introducing the “right policies will weaken the country and make people unsafe”.
Keeping this in view, he continued, “our country’s leadership has tried to narrow this gap”.
Stressing the need for regulation, he said countries that would take an early initiative in this regard would be able to attract capital.
“Few countries have the opportunity that Pakistan has,” he said, adding, “We are not trying to promote crypto but to regulate it as people here have already adopted it.
“Our country is the fifth-most populous country with tech-savvy youth and where digital adoption is growing fast. But, the [country will be able to] benefit from this talent when they have a legal, structured path [to follow]. When they will have a framework. Otherwise, they will leave.”
He said it was the responsibility of the state to create an enabling environment for emerging technologies. “There needs to be smart regulation here so that capital from [around the world] flows into the country.”
He said that through the framework devised for the crypto sector, the government aimed to prepare for the “industries of 2035 and 2025”.
“We do not want the Pakistani youth to be just consumers but evolve into builders and global experts.”
Saqib emphasised that the country needed to prepare for the future and be globally trusted. “So that we are able to strengthen our sovereignty and economy through technology.”
He said his message to the international community was that Pakistan was open to business and welcoming innovation in the area of digital assets, but only from those entities who would follow the country’s rules, create opportunities for the youth here and operate in line with a “Pakistan-first approach”.
Coming back to the NOCs for Binance and HTX, he said while addressing the youth, “This is not our destination. This is the foundation of a building that you have to construct.”
“Pakistan’s future should not be imports. It should be built here, by your hands. Pakistan should emerge as a global case study in the area of global assets.”</p><small>2025-12-14 08:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/693d94ffba9de.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960913/smokers-corner-unprecedented-times' target='_blank'><strong>SMOKERS’ CORNER: UNPRECEDENTED TIMES</strong></a><br><p>The belief that history is a critical guide for predicting the future is facing a severe test. The enduring idea is best encapsulated by former British prime minister Winston Churchill’s 1944 observation: “The longer you can look back, the farther you can look forward.”
The Renaissance period thinker Niccolò Machiavelli argued that the people’s fundamental desires and behaviours remain unchanged across epochs, which is why a close study of past events can aid one to predict future political and social dynamics. The 19th century German ideologist Karl Marx famously noted that history repeats itself, “first as tragedy, then as farce.” The 20th century Spanish philosopher George Santayana warned that those who cannot remember mistakes of the past are condemned to repeat them.
While this concept remains a popular belief, its relevance as a reliable predictive tool has begun to struggle. This is driven by unprecedented shifts in geopolitics, technology and ecology, which are introducing challenges without direct historical parallels. For over a decade, many experts and political commentators have found their predictions consistently wrong. A major contributing factor is their heavy reliance on historical parallels to understand current events — a methodology that is proving insufficient for the new realities of the 21st century.
A powerful early example of this failure actually stretches back to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. The US failed to predict the revolution because CIA analysts could not accurately gauge the political traction of the religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini. The CIA’s analytical framework was largely based on studies of left wing revolutions, and those rooted in secular and nationalist movements since the French Revolution. The CIA lacked experts on the then-unique power of a new kind of radical religious movement that was emerging in Iran.

From Iran in 1979 to America in 2016 and Pakistan today, analysts continue reaching for historical parallels to predict the future. But these parallels no longer apply in a world being reshaped by new social, technological and geopolitical forces

The French philosopher Michel Foucault, however, observing the climate in Iran a year before the revolution, wrote extensively on an event that was challenging the Western understanding of revolutionary upheavals. It was a mass movement taking shape on the basis of religion; a phenomenon for which American analysts and the CIA could not find any suitable historical precedence. This led to flawed conclusions.
The failure to predict the game-changing 2016 US presidential election provides a powerful example of the limitations of relying on historical parallels in the 21st century. Before the election, most major political commentators ridiculed the idea of Donald Trump ever entering the White House. Their assessment was driven by historical precedents involving past charismatic American populists who ultimately failed to capture the presidency.

 

They compared Trump to figures whose popularity ultimately collapsed. These included the fiery governor of Louisiana Huey Long, who was a serious presidential contender but who became embroiled in political and financial scandals, before being assassinated in 1935.
Then there was the right-wing figure Barry Goldwater, who won the Republican nomination in 1964 but suffered a massive electoral defeat to Lyndon B. Johnson. Goldwater’s supporters mistook his regional popularity for national viability. There was also Ross Perot, dubbed “the billionaire populist”, who managed to secure nearly 19 million votes in the 1992 election but saw his support fade significantly in 1996, before his influence declined.
These were valid historical precedents of non-mainstream figures who failed to reach the White House. However, in 2016, these precedents did not account for the rapid, profound changes reshaping the American political landscape after the 2008 stock market crash.
The unique confluence of factors in the 2010s rendered old comparisons obsolete, marking the beginning of a new history that analysts failed to grasp. Intense distrust in mainstream politics following the 2008 economic crisis created fertile ground for an ‘anti-system’ candidate. ‘Cultural wars’ intensified and a more radical arm of the ‘new right’ began to gain significant traction among large sections of the American electorate.
Rapidly evolving digital technology was cleverly and effectively used, particularly by the radical right, to formulate new ways to construct perceptions of popularity and demonise opponents, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers. Analysts looked back, but the ground beneath them had moved, leading to flawed assessments and conclusions.



The tendency to rely on historical precedents remains particularly entrenched in Pakistani political analysis. This methodology has strongly influenced the discourse surrounding the political survival of former prime minister Imran Khan. Until the recent press conference by the DG ISPR, in which Khan was branded as “mentally unstable” and a “security threat”, only a few analysts or journalists were willing to predict Khan’s complete ouster from the country’s political scene.
The ‘predictions’ of Khan’s return were rooted in several historical assumptions about the power structure in Pakistan. These included the fact that the establishment has historically demonstrated a willingness to change its mind about opposed politicians, often ‘allowing’ them to return to power; and the perception that the establishment has never been as aggressively opposed to a leading politician hailing from Punjab than it has to non-Punjab politicians.
Conversely, Khan himself has consistently drawn upon the historical tragedy of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the former East Pakistani politician. Khan’s narrative suggests that the establishment’s refusal to allow Mujibur Rahman to assume power after his 1970 victory ultimately led to the breaking away of East Pakistan, implying similar dire consequences if his (Khan’s) ‘mandate’ is denied.
Despite the strong hold of these historical analogies on public discourse, current facts suggest that most of these precedents are struggling to remain relevant in the face of various new political realities. It is these realities that have fundamentally driven the creation of the current government in Pakistan and dictated the establishment’s current state of mind, making past dynamics a less reliable guide for the future.
The world is rapidly moving into unprecedented territory, necessitating political and state structures purpose-built to effectively address novel local and international challenges. The introduction of new technologies has compounded these challenges. Many of the new realities lack clear historical precedents. They are demanding innovative and unprecedented solutions rather than relying on past playbooks.
This line of thinking is being used to justify measures such as the controversial 27th Amendment to the Pakistani Constitution. The proponents of the amendment argue that it is a way to adapt to new internal and external realities. Critics of the amendment will continue to misfire, though, because their critiques are largely rooted in an understanding of politics that remains tied to historical precedents and traditional political norms that do not account for the unprecedented nature of contemporary challenges the state is facing.
The past remains essential for context but, in the 21st century, it has ceased to be the definitive teacher.

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had in 2016 filed a reference against the former petroleum minister and others for their alleged involvement in depriving the state of Rs462.5 billion from 2010 to 2013.
The accused were charged with causing financial losses of Rs450bn through a fertiliser scam, Rs9.5bn through land encroachment / fraud and Rs3bn through money laundering. However, the reference was transferred to the anti-corruption court after tweaks in the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO).
The ACE filed an investigation report before Judge Muhammad Aminullah Siddiqui of the special provincial anti-corruption court seeking cancellation of graft charges against Dr Asim and others.

Judge asks ACE Sindh to file report on Rs3bn money laundering allegations in relevant court; NAB transferred graft case to provincial anti-corruption court after accountability law tweaks

The IO filed the report under Section 173 of the criminal procedure code (CrPC) seeking disposal of the case in class C (cancelation).
In the report, the IO submitted that after holding a fresh investigation, the allegations were found within the domain of the provincial anti-graft body and being recommended for cancelation.
The judge in his order said, “Upon appraisal of the material so placed, it prima facie appears that the investigating officer has justifiable concluded that the ingredient of the offences related to corruption, misconduct, or abuse of authority, [which] offences triable exclusively by this court, have not been substantiated during investigation. Consequently, the classification of such allegations as C-class appears to be in consonance with the settled principles governing disposal of the cases where the foundational facts do not support prosecution.”
However, the court accepted the report to the limited extent of those allegations falling within the statutory jurisdiction of the court under the anti-corruption laws.
About allegations of money laundering, the judge noted that this court “has lacked jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same” while the “AML Act was a special law providing for a distinct mechanism, designated forums and exclusive jurisdiction”.
Therefore, the court directed the IO to prepare and submit a separate and independent report under Section 173 of the CrPC before the competent court under the relevant law without any undue delay.
NAB accused Dr Asim and others of getting plots allotted fraudulently and encroaching upon state land for expansion of his hospital, money laundering and commission through fertiliser cartel for illegal curtailment of gas for exploitative price hike.
After amendments to the NAB law, Dr Asim had approached the Sindh High Court seeking transfer of the reference from an accountability court to a court having jurisdiction.
In September 2023, the SHC had ordered an accountability court to return the corruption reference to the NAB chairman so that he could refer the matter to a relevant forum as per law. Thereafter, NAB had transferred the matter to the ACE.

Sources in the valley told Dawn that hectic deliberations had been taking place between the Tirah Bagh Brigade Headquarters and local elders since Wednesday (Dec 10) to develop a mechanism for the ‘willful’ relocation of families from the valley and an acceptable package for the new internally displaced persons (IDPs).
They said that while expressing satisfaction with the voluntary repatriation of families from different areas of Tirah in the last few weeks, officials posted to the Bagh Brigade Headquarters made it clear to local elders that those unwilling to vacate their houses would face “utter difficulties” after the launch of the operation.
A Malakdinkhel elder, who was part of the negotiating team, told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the launch of the military operation was a matter of time now while the security officials were now insisting on devising modalities which could minimise chances of collateral damage to residents and reduce their misery.

Security officials, elders discussing mechanism for families’ relocation

He said that security officials in Peshawar and Rawalpindi were pondering over the timeframe of the Tirah military operation as the General Headquarters and 11 Corps were insisting on the shortest possible duration in order to minimise the sufferings of local families.
The elder said that security officials agreed to give residents time for voluntary displacement and offered transport and other facilities to them.
“The security forces are showing the maximum restraint by not imposing curfews in different parts despite clear-cut instructions from high-ups, while avoiding indiscriminate shelling on troubled areas,” he said.
The Malakdinkhel elder further said that a warning was issued about the closure of most exit routes, including Dwa Theoye, Arhanga and Haider Kandaw, if the residents failed to avail the deadline for willful repatriation.
Security officials also told Tirah elders that the new IDPs would be allowed to return in the two months’ time at maximum on the successful completion of military operation, while a verbal assurance was given about the meeting of the “legitimate” demands of Tirah residents through the execution of development schemes.
The security officials also urged elders to form local peace committees on return following the military operation. However, as there was no mention of the committees’ responsibilities, the elders didn’t disapprove of the idea.
On Wednesday, the Tirah elders submitted a long list of demands to the officials of Brigade Headquarters, including advance payment of Rs500,000, provision of free transport, formal IDP status for the newly-displaced families and a firm assurance that no military operations and forced displacement will take place after the completion of operations and return of IDPs.
The elders also called for a written agreement about all decisions made during their meetings with security officials, with the Supreme Court chief justice, interior minister, Peshawar’s corps commander, the provincial chief minister and the 27 Brigade acting as guarantors.
Sources said that while agreeing to continue parlays, both sides failed to make a deal.
Both MNA Iqbal Afridi and MPA Abdul Ghani from Bara along with representatives of Bara Siyasi Ittehad and elders from Bara were kept out of Tirah deliberations. They have vehemently opposed any fresh military operation in Tirah and forced displacement of residents.
While Tirah elders and security forces were busy sorting out modalities for the operation and evacuation, the families in different parts of the valley continued to vacate their homes and departed for Bara and Peshawar.

The situation looks bad even in the coming days with no rain prediction that may bring some respite.
On Saturday, the city recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 527 at 8pm, classified as hazardous, following Delhi (710).
Lahore’s three-day average AQI hovered above 300. Some hotspots in the city such as Allama Iqbal Town (802), Bedian Road (674) and CERP Office (672) performed worst.
The air pollution crisis in the country extends beyond Lahore. Cities across Punjab reported AQI readings well above safe thresholds between December 11 and 13, prompting widespread health warnings.
Khurrianwala registered an AQI of 558, Faisalabad 547, Kahna Nau 350, Gujranwala 284, Gujrat 254, Islamabad 246, and both Bahawalpur and Sialkot at 244.
Health experts warned that such high concentrations of PM2.5 particulate matter that penetrates deep into the lungs and pose serious risks to public health, especially for children, the elderly and those with respiratory conditions.
Residents have been advised to avoid outdoor activities, keep windows closed, wear protective masks and use air purifiers indoors.
Pakistan’s average PM2.5 concentration in 2024 stood at 73.7 µg/m³, nearly 15 times higher than the World Health Organisation’s annual guideline of 5µg/m³. This places Pakistan as the third most polluted country globally, underscoring the scale of the environmental challenge.
Experts say the pollution is due to a combination of industrial emissions, vehicular exhaust, crop residue burning, biomass and waste incineration and domestic fires.
Winter conditions exacerbate the crisis with temperature inversions, low wind speed and reduced rainfall trapping pollutants close to the ground.
Trans-boundary pollution from India further compounds the issue, especially during the post-harvest stubble burning season.

BANGKOK: Cambodia shut its border crossings with Thailand on Saturday, after Bangkok denied US President Donald Trump’s claim that a truce had been agreed to end days of deadly fighting.
Violence between the Southeast Asian neighbours, which stems from a long-running dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) border, has displaced around half a million people on both sides.
At least 25 people have died this week, including four Thai soldiers, the defence ministry said were killed in the border area on Saturday.
The latest fatalities were followed by Phnom Penh announcing it would immediately “suspend all entry and exit movements at all Cambodia-Thailand border crossings”, the interior ministry said.
Each side blamed the other for reigniting the conflict, before Trump said a truce had been agreed.
Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said Trump “didn’t mention whether we should make a ceasefire” during their Friday phone call.
The two leaders “didn’t discuss” the issue, Anutin told journalists on Saturday.
Trump had hailed his “very good conversation” with Anutin and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet on Friday.
“They have agreed to CEASE all shooting effective this evening, and go back to the original Peace Accord” agreed in July, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.







The United States, China, and Malaysia, as chair of the regional bloc Asean, brokered a ceasefire in July after an initial five-day spate of violence.
In October, Trump backed a follow-on joint declaration between Thailand and Cambodia, touting new trade deals after they agreed to prolong their truce.
But Thailand suspended the agreement the following month after Thai soldiers were wounded by landmines at the border.
In Thailand, evacuee Kanyapat Saopria said she doesn’t “trust Cambodia anymore”.
“The last round of peace efforts didn’t work out… I don’t know if this one will either,” the 39-year-old said.
Across the border, a Cambodian evacuee said she was “sad” the fighting hadn’t stopped despite Trump’s intervention.
“I am not happy with brutal acts,” said Vy Rina, 43.
Trading blame over civilians
Bangkok and Phnom Penh have traded accusations of attacks against civilians, with the Thai army reporting six wounded on Saturday by Cambodian rockets.
Cambodia’s information minister, Neth Pheaktra, meanwhile, said Thai forces had “expanded their attacks to include civilian infrastructure and Cambodian civilians”.
A Thai navy spokesman said the air force “successfully destroyed” two Cambodian bridges used to transport weapons to the conflict zone.
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on Saturday urged both sides to “cease all forms of hostilities and refrain from any further military actions”.
Thailand has reported 14 soldiers killed and seven civilian deaths, while Cambodia said four civilians were killed earlier this week.
At a camp in Thailand’s Buriram, journalists saw displaced residents calling relatives near the border who reported that fighting was ongoing.
Thailand’s prime minister has vowed to “continue to perform military actions until we feel no more harm and threats to our land and people”.
After the call with Trump, Anutin said, “the one who violated the agreement needs to fix (the situation)”.
Cambodia’s Hun Manet, meanwhile, said his country “has always been adhering to peaceful means for dispute resolutions”.

At first glance, the idea feels compelling.
If machines can scrape information across multiple feeds in real time, summarise parliamentary proceedings, monitor political developments, crunch data, and respond to user queries in conversational language, why would end users still need traditional journalism outlets, or even digital platforms as intermediaries for news? The argument implies a future where individuals bypass traditional journalism outlets entirely and receive information directly from intelligent systems in a conversational, real-time format.

 

Those who make this argument often point to changing audience behaviour, especially among younger users. Consumers are steadily turning away from conventional news platforms and gravitating toward faster, more personal, and more direct sources of information.
And to be fair, the trend is clear.
The latest Reuters Institute Digital News Report shows a consistent decline in trust, viewership, and platform dependence on mainstream news outlets. Users, particularly young people, increasingly prefer to consume information from influencers, content creators, and niche commentators rather than from professional journalists. Their relationship with news is personal, interactive, emotional, and algorithmically curated.
Thus, many in the industry look at this shift and assume that AI-mediated information access will make journalism redundant faster than we imagine.
But this prediction misunderstands both journalism and technological disruption.
Journalism has never merely been about transmitting information from point A to point B. If journalism were equivalent to distribution, then journalists would already have become irrelevant when blogs, Twitter, and user-generated content exploded over a decade ago. Yet even as more voices entered the digital information space, the public’s need for verification, investigation, context, scrutiny, and accountability only grew stronger.
Every time a major national or geopolitical event unfolds, the world still turns to journalists to understand what actually happened, who benefits, who is responsible, and what it means.

How will journalism evolve to meet the challenges ushered in by AI?

AI does not eliminate the need for this work. On the contrary, AI multiplies it.
We are moving into a period where the volume of available information will exceed human comprehension by several orders of magnitude. Generative systems will not just surface facts; they will hallucinate, remix, misattribute, and infer things that never happened at all.

 

Political actors, commercial interests, and even the state authorities now possess the ability to manufacture narratives, emotional atmospheres, and public sentiments on an industrial scale, with minimal cost and high precision. The idea that ordinary users will be able to navigate that universe alone, without a professional class dedicated to verification, investigation, and ethical interpretation, is, to say the least, misplaced.
If AI is going to rewrite the information environment, then journalism is not becoming less necessary; it is becoming structurally essential. In five years, the hardest problems in public communication will not be about finding information. It will be about establishing what is real, what is synthetic, what is manipulated, and what is politically engineered for attention and outrage.
For me, the question was never whether journalists would become irrelevant. They won’t.
The real question is two-fold: how the profession will evolve to meet the challenges ushered in by AI, and whether journalists will be able to meaningfully integrate these technologies into their workflows, their verification practices, and their investigative muscle.
To begin with, journalists will need an expanded skillset that goes far beyond traditional verification or deepfake detection. As AI becomes embedded in governance, bureaucracy, law enforcement, welfare delivery, and public administration, journalistic storytelling will have to evolve as well.
In the past, governance reporting focused on the effectiveness of systems, corruption, procurement flaws, or regulatory gaps. In the future, many of those stories will be about data bias, algorithmic discrimination, opaque model assumptions, automated decision-making, and the ways poorly designed AI systems can harm citizens at scale. And journalists will only be able to report on these issues meaningfully if they understand how these systems work.
For instance, they will have to learn algorithmic auditing, network analysis, and the ability to interrogate opaque systems. Similarly, they will need to be able to trace financial and political incentives behind influence operations, scrutinise the training data that powers decision-making models, and investigate how platforms, corporations, and governments deploy automated systems to shape public sentiment, marginalise voices, or suppress inconvenient truths.
In an ‘automated’ information environment, human accountability must become more rigorous, not less. If, for example, a government uses predictive policing, automated welfare systems, or algorithmic surveillance, someone must investigate who designed the system, what assumptions it encodes, whose rights it affects, and whether its outputs reinforce bias or injustice. No machine can perform that function independently. It requires reporters with access, independence, courage, and analytical skill.
Thus, I believe one of the biggest democratic risks in the near future is not that AI will make journalists irrelevant, but that there will be too few trained journalists capable of interrogating AI-driven systems.
Which brings me to the second part of the issue: are we, the journalists, integrating AI into our workflows the right way? The answer is complicated. AI offers extraordinary efficiencies that can support research, transcription, analysis, visualisation, and verification at a scale that traditional newsrooms have never experienced. But integration without standards is risky.
If journalists outsource too much judgement to opaque systems, we risk importing algorithmic bias into editorial choices, eroding verification practices, and unintentionally weakening our core responsibility: the independent assessment of facts.
My take on the question of whether journalism as we know it will ‘survive’ the AI boom is simple: journalism will be just fine; it is the journalists who refuse to evolve who should be worried, not the craft itself.

Trade and industry have repeatedly urged the government to improve the investment climate by addressing political uncertainty and terrorism.
“How is it possible to invest in a country where uncertainty has a strong grip and is clearly reflected in declining foreign investment?” asked Aamir Aziz, a textile finishing manufacturer and exporter.
He said domestic textile groups have begun investing abroad, citing Interloop and Artistic Milliners as examples. As a result, jobs are effectively being outsourced. For the first time in the country’s recent history, domestic investors are actively securing their investments outside Pakistan.

Experts cite political uncertainty, terrorism as main barriers

A senior banker described the situation as grim for both the economy and the public, saying job creation is only possible through higher investment, both domestic and foreign.
The Investment Policy announced in 2023 set a target of raising the investment-to-GDP ratio to 20pc through local and foreign inflows. To attract foreign investment, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) was established, but so far it has failed to deliver tangible results.
“Look at the ground realities. Two provinces are facing severe terrorism, while tensions with India and Afghanistan persist along the borders. Under these circumstances, no government can convincingly attract domestic or foreign investors,” said an industrialist, explaining the low level of investment.
Pakistan’s investment-to-GDP ratio is almost half that of competing regional economies, where it ranges between 25pc and 30pc. The ratio fell to its lowest level in FY24 at 13.1pc, later revised to 13.8pc, and edged up slightly to 14.1pc in FY25. The long-term average from 1960 to 2024 stands at 15.9pc, indicating that conditions have steadily worsened.
Another major concern is the very high tax burden, with rates reaching up to 60pc, along with interest rates that remain elevated compared to regional peers. Industrialists are demanding tax reductions and a 100 basis point cut in the policy interest rate. The current policy rate stands at 11pc, while inflation was recorded at 6.1pc in November.
“We have yet to develop economic policies in line with the global economic shift. China is replacing the old model of global economic dominance.
Pakistan must read this change and revise its trade and industrial policies to remain connected to the new economic world order,” said S.S. Iqbal, an expert on the economy and money markets.
Pakistan’s trade with China has expanded significantly, making it the country’s largest trading partner. However, Pakistani exporters have struggled to gain meaningful access to Chinese markets.
Mr Iqbal said foreign investment typically follows domestic investment, adding that without local investment momentum, foreign inflows are unlikely.
An independent economist said Pakistan’s biggest economic failure is not inflation, debt, or even governance, but the lack of consensus on long-term direction, timelines, and measures of success.
This, he said, is what economist Atif Mian refers to as “Five-for-Fifty” — achieving 5pc GDP growth every year for the next 50 years. The concept was cited by Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, who said the goal is achievable but requires a collective national decision to prioritise growth, even when it clashes with comfort, ideology, or short-term political interests.

This presents a big challenge for the government in identifying individuals not paying their taxes, with 2.262 million out of 5.912 million filed up to Oct 31, potentially concealing their taxable income. This means that only 3.650m taxpayers declared incomes in their returns for tax year 2025 (TY25).
The pattern of nil-filers are across the three main categories — individuals, associations of persons (AoPs) and the corporate sector. The nil returns are submitted for one-time financial transactions or to take advantage of lower tax rates for placement on the Active Taxpayers List (ATL).
Concerns are mounting within the FBR that Pakistan’s income tax system is failing to capture the true wealth of its citizens, as approximately half of taxpayers continue to declare nil incomes far below the lavish lifestyles they maintain.

Zero income with lavish lifestyle exposes weak enforcement as millions stay on the rolls without paying a rupee

In TY25, the number of nil-filers, both salaried and non-salaried individuals, remained significantly high. Out of 5.805m total individual returns filed, 2.206m were nil-returns, declaring no taxable income.
This means 38pc of all individual filers fell into the nil-filer category, highlighting a growing trend of non-contributory filings and raising concerns about the quality of the tax base. In TY24, almost a similar trend of nil-filers was recorded, which shows consistency of the trend.
Despite being considered a highly documented segment, the corporate sector posted the highest proportion of nil-filers in TY25. Of the 17,873 corporate returns filed, 13,739 companies, accounting for 76.87pc, declared nil income.
This means only 4,134 companies reported any taxable income, raising concerns over underreporting and the effectiveness of enforcement within the formal business sector.
The second-largest category of nil-filers in TY25 was Associations of Persons (AOPs). Out of 89,510 AOP returns filed, 42,834, or 47.85pc, declared nil income. This indicates that only 46,676 AOPs reported any taxable income, highlighting significant underreporting within this segment of taxpayers.
This pattern appears to be continuing for the last few years owing to the government’s introduction of the higher rates for non-filers. It was also proposed that non-filers be prohibited from engaging in any financial or investment activities. As a result, the junk filing has become a routine practice, which gives a feel good figure of returns filing to FBR.
People are living in palatial houses, enjoying 24/7 air conditioning, riding fancy cars, wearing branded clothes, making multiple international trips, buying branded watches/jewellery and other luxuries but their income tax returns do not reflect their lifestyles. Income declared and tax paid is not reflective of their living standards, as pointed out after an internal analysis of the tax returns filed with the FBR.
A senior tax officer told Dawn that junk returns resulted from tax policy lacunas. He stated the existing policy encourages people to submit tax returns without paying taxes to benefit from reduced tax rates. He said the FBR would have to redefine the terms filer and non-filer and relate tax return filing exclusively to tax payment.
He went on to say that the present system suffers from data integration issues.
Pakistan’s cash-driven and largely undocumented economy continues to shield undeclared wealth from formal scrutiny. This undocumented economy continues to frustrate efforts to broaden the tax base.

NAROWAL: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday maintained that the deadly riots on May 9, 2023 was a ‘joint venture’ between ex-spymaster Faiz Ham­eed and PTI founder Imran Khan, vowing that the process of acc­o­untability for ‘enemies’ of Paki­stan, whether they were civilian or in uniform, would continue.
The minister also asserted there were still other charges against Hameed on which legal proceedings would be initiated soon.
He made these remarks after the former director general of Inter-Services Intelligence was sentenced to a 14-year jail term in a case related to violating secrecy laws, engaging in political activities, misuse of authority and causing harm to others.
Addressing a press conference in Sialkot, Mr Asif claimed both the ex-spymaster and the ex-premier were partners in the ‘plan to destroy Pakistan and its army’. “Faiz Hameed and Imran Khan were equally involved in planning what happened in Mianwali, Lahore, Peshawar, and in front of GHQ on May 9,” he said.
“Those who have put the country’s future at stake for power cannot be considered Pakistanis whe­ther they are in uniform like Faiz or in a waistcoat and Peshawari sandals like Imran,” he added.
Calling the May 9 riots an ‘attack on the sanctity of the armed forces’, he said the same institution had restored national pride through Operation Bunyanul Marsoos against India in May, earning Pakistan international acclaim.
“God forbid, if the Faiz-Imran nexus still existed, perhaps there would not have been a need for war at all since they would have ensured the country’s destruction from the inside,” he said.
Nawaz’s ouster, parliament’s role
The minister alleged Hameed was in charge of ‘Project Imran’, blaming him for the ouster of prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017. “The removal of Nawaz Sharif, the cases lodged against him, the allegations, and Imran’s [Khan] coming into power, this whole project was enacted under the supervision of Faiz Hameed. Nawaz Sharif was kept in prison during the 2018 elections. Imran [Khan] had put Nawaz Sharif, his family members and other politicians in jail through Faiz.”
He claimed Mr Khan was made the prime minister through rigging under Hameed’s supervision and alleged that they played a ‘dangerous game’ with the country during the next four years. He said the ex-spymaster facilitated the ‘imprisonment of political opponents’.
While terming the period a ‘shameful chapter’ in country’s history, the defence minister said parliament was converted into an ISI ‘subsidiary’. “During the Faiz’s tenure [as ISI chief], the agency used to dictate legislation to parliament.”
He claimed that after Hameed’s transfer, the ‘project’ started to slowly ‘unravel’, but as a corps commander he continued to facilitate Mr Khan. “Faiz used to plan mischief in Pakistan, and the PTI provided the manpower to execute those plans.”
‘Conspirators still active’
While admitting that the current system of governance a ‘hybrid system’ involving cooperation bet­ween the government and the military, the defence minister said the stability was brought through this.
But, he added, conspirators were again attempting to prop up the PTI founder and bring him back to power, adding that ‘all these seeds were sown by Faiz’. He said 3,000 to 4,000 Afghans were brought to and settled in Pakistan to cause mischief in the country. “These Afghans were accommodated in the homes of citizens.”
He accused PTI leaders of bribing the Taliban, alleging that party wanted to hold talks with Pakistan’s ‘enemies’.
About the recent conviction of the ex-spymaster, the minister noted that Hameed still had the right to appeal at relevant forums, including the army’s court of appeals and high court.

A ninth person was hurt by bullet fragments, the mayor said.
Streets around campus remained blocked and packed with emergency vehicles hours after the shooting and law enforcement officials heightened security around the city as police continued their manhunt.
“The individual responsible is still at large,” Mayor Brett Smiley told reporters at a 9:30pm (7:30am PKT) press conference. Deputy Police Chief Timothy O’Hara said the suspect had not been identified.
Officials said they are looking for a male dressed in black and were releasing a video of the suspect, who O’Hara said may have been wearing a mask. He said officials had retrieved shell casings from the scene of the shooting, but that police were not prepared to release details.
Officials said the gunman escaped after shooting students in Brown’s Barus & Holley engineering building, where exams were taking place at the time.
“We are a week and a half away from Christmas. And two people died today and another eight are in the hospital,” Smiley said earlier in the evening. “So please pray for those families.”
Brown is on College Hill in Providence, Rhode Island’s state capital. The university has hundreds of buildings, including lecture halls, laboratories and dormitories.
“This is the day one hopes never happens, and it has,” Brown’s president Christina Paxson told reporters, confirming all or nearly all of the victims were students.
As news of the shooting spread, the school told students to shelter in place.
Brown student Chiang-Heng Chien told local TV station WJAR he was working in a lab with three other students when he saw the text about the active shooter situation a block away. They waited under desks for about two hours, he said.
Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee vowed that the shooter would be brought to justice. “We’re going to make sure that we catch the individual that brought so much suffering to so many people.”
The search for the suspect was hampered in part because downtown Providence was crowded with holiday shoppers and thousands of people attending concerts, local media said. Federal law enforcement and police from surrounding cities and towns were assisting in the search, officials said. According to local news reports, venues across the city were bringing in extra security.
President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House that he had been briefed on the situation, which he called “terrible”.
“All we can do right now is pray for the victims and for those that were very badly hurt.”
Compared to many countries, mass shootings in schools, workplaces, and places of worship are more common in the US, which has some of the most permissive gun laws in the developed world. The Gun Violence Archive, which defines mass shootings as any incident in which four or more victims have been shot, has counted 389 of them this year in the US, including at least six such shootings at schools.
Last year the US had more than 500 mass shootings, according to the archive.</p><small>2025-12-14 03:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/14080833a56cb1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961026/afghan-girl-wins-relief-in-college-admission-case' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan girl wins relief in college admission case</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Pesh­awar High Court has temporarily restrai­n­­ed the admission committee for public-sector medical colleges from excluding an Afghan female student from the ongoing admissions process over her inability to produce an Afghan passport and visa.
A bench comprising Ju­­stice Ijaz Anwar and Jus­tice Wiqar Ahmad issued notices to the responden­ts, including the vice chancellor of Khyber Medical Uni­versity and the cha­­ir­­man of the admission committee, seeking their replies to a petition filed by the student, Ruby, an Afg­h­­an refugee holding a Proof of Registration card.
The petitioner has asked the court to declare the requirement to submit a passport and visa before admission as contrary to the admissions policy, illegal and discriminatory.
She has also sought court directives for the respondents to call her for an interview after the final merit list is displayed and, if she secures a place on merit, to grant her admission to the relevant MBBS or BDS programme.
She has also requested the court to restrain the respondents from altering the merit list on the basis of her failure to produce a passport and visa at this stage. The bench fixed Dec 30 for the next hearing.
Advocate Mian Zakir Hussain appeared for the petitioner and told the court that his client was an Afghan national regis­te­r­­ed with the Commis­sio­n­erate of Afghan Refu­ge­­es along with her family.
He said his client had completed her SSC and HSSC and then appeared in the MDCAT, securing good marks.

ISLAMABAD: Overturning a lower court order for a DNA test to ascertain the parentage of a petitioner, the Supreme Court has ruled that the right to privacy — recognised as an entitlement to personal sanctuary — requires protecting individuals from undue intrusion into their private lives.
“The unnecessary public challenge to the paternity of a person inherently res­ults in societal embarrassment, humiliation, and severe psychological stigma,” observed Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar while accepting an appeal filed by petitioner Khalid Hameed.
On Nov 3, 2022, a special judge of the Anti-Corruption Court, Pakpattan, had ordered the respective circle officer to conduct DNA tests of the petitioner and one Mohammad Haneef, holding that the real dispute in an inheritance matter centred on the petitioner’s paternity.
The directive was challenged through a revision petition before the Lahore High Court, which rejected the plea on Dec 6, 2022.
The controversy involved several res­pondents allegedly involved in forgery and corruption pertaining to a material alteration of the petitioner’s parentage in educational records, purportedly to deprive him of his rightful inheritance.
The Supreme Court said challen­ges to paternity must not be taken light­­ly, as compelling a DNA test without ade­quate grounds inherently casts serious aspersions on the character and moral integrity of the mother — a course the top court has previously declared impermissible.
Such judicial directives, when lacking proper legal basis, amount to an unwarranted intrusion into the sanctity of family life and a woman’s reputation, which should never be tolerated under the gui­se of legal process, observed Justice Kak­ar, who was heading a two-judge bench.
“This protection extends to personal data, communications, family life, and all facets of the personal sphere against un­­w­arranted interference by the state or pri­v­a­te entities,” the six-page judgement said.
Justice Kakar observed that any de­­m­and for a DNA test, particularly to determine parentage, encroaches upon fundamental privacy rights, as genetic information contains comprehensive data about lineage and physical characteristics. These fundamental rights, the jud­gement said, safeguard bodily integrity and ensure an individual’s autonomy to refuse unsolicited medical procedures.

 

The right conferred under Article 14 does not concern any premises, home or office, but the person — the man or woman wherever he or she may be, Justice Kakar underscored. He said that obtaining someone’s DNA without due process fundamentally violates rights to privacy, autonomy, and liberty, as it involves extracting extre­mely sensitive personal information.
While intrinsically linked to the rig­hts to existence and autonomy, the right to privacy has evolved into an independent fundamental guarantee under Article 14, representing the ultimate honour of the human person and the essence of individuality, the judgement stated. It protects a zone of choice and self-determination, enabling individuals to make intimate decisions without fear of surveillance or unauthorised disclosure.
“The inviolability of privacy is direc­tly linked with the dignity of man,” Jus­tice Kakar remarked, adding that preserving human dignity requires safeguarding privacy from invasion and unlawful intrusion. The judgement warned that such encroachment carries the serious risk of misuse or unauthorised dissemination of an individual’s genetic blueprint, potentially causing grave personal and professional harm.
The right to liberty under Article 9, it said, goes beyond protection from physical detention and encompasses freedom from arbitrary or purposeless restraints on personal autonomy that are inconsistent with public interest or statutory provisions.
A judicial order for DNA testing without consent or legal justification, therefore, is not a mere procedural flaw but one that causes profound adverse effects on an individual’s life and dignity.

A division bench comprising Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan will take up the matter for further proceedings on Monday (tomorrow).
In a detailed written order issued on Dec 9, the IHC held that the question regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree fell squarely within the scope of a writ of quo warranto — his right to hold public office.
The two-member bench ruled that the petition was maintainable and set aside the office objection earlier raised by the registrar.
The bench had also gra­nted Justice Jahangiri thr­ee days to respond to the facts unearthed till date.
The registrar’s office served the notice at the judge’s chamber due to time constraints. Sources said court staff of Justice Jahangiri received the notice and submitted it to his chamber. They added that Justice Jahangiri dec­ided to appear before the bench at the next hearing.
While Justice Jahangiri along with four other IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — had earlier app­eared before the Sup­reme Court as well on the same matter, it is not yet clear whether his fellow judges will accompany him in the IHC on Monday.
However, lawyers are expected to attend the proceedings to express solidarity with him. According to for­­mer president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association Riasat Ali Azad, he, along with scores of lawyers, will be present in the courtroom during the hearing.
Fake degree controversy
The petition, filed by Advocate Mian Dawood under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a judicial determination on whether Justice Jahangiri lawfully holds the office of a high court judge in view of allegations concerning his LLB degree obtained from the University of Karachi (KU).
According to the order, the bench observed that the petitioner had challenged the judge’s eligibility to hold office rather than alleging misconduct.
As such, the matter did not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of Article 209 of the Constitution, which governs proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council.
During the hearings, IHC Chief Justice Dogar consistently observed that the petition raised a direct question of qualification, whether the respondent fulfilled the statutory requirements to hold judicial office, which could be examined through a writ of quo warranto. The bench also noted that the SC had already directed the IHC to proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
The court order referred to a report submitted by KU through the Higher Education Commission (HEC), which highlighted several discrepancies in the academic record of the degree in question.
According to the report, a candidate named “Tariq Mehmood” obtained an LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, university records showed that the same enrolment number had already been issued to another student, Imtiaz Ahmed, in 1987.
The report further stated that the transcript for LLB Part-I was issued in the name “Tariq Jahangiri”, while the inquiry revealed that the judge had also been assigned a separate enrolment number (7124) for the same degree programme. The committee observed that this violated university rules, which allow only one enrolment number for the entire duration of a degree.
According to the inquiry findings, the existence of multiple identities, duplicate enrolment numbers, and conflicting transcripts rendered the academic credentials “invalid”, although the committee stopped short of declaring the degree “bogus”.
The report also noted that the candidate had been debarred for three years in 1988 on grounds of using unfair means but later appeared in examinations under a different name.
The university alleged collusion with staff and impersonation of other enrolled students, following which the results were cancelled and a three-year ban was imposed, effective until 1992.
In its order, the IHC bench reproduced and relied upon several SC judgements — including Abrar Hassan vs Government of Pakistan, Malik Asad Ali vs Federation, and Sindh High Court Bar Association vs Federation — to conclude that a writ of quo warranto could be issued against a judge in matters relating to eligibility.
The bench also referenced the SC’s direction in Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri vs Mian Dawood.
It noted that the apex court had explicitly ordered the IHC to proceed with Mr Dawood’s petition. “Keeping in view the stance of the petitioner that Respondent No. 1 [Justice Jahangiri] possesses an invalid/fake LLB degree, as well as a careful perusal of the report submitted by the University of Karachi through [the] HEC, we deem it appropriate to issue notice to Respondent No. 1 to submit his reply within three days,” the order stated.

Soon after the crash, rescue and security personnel reached the site as locals reached the spot. Security forces cordoned off the area and launched an investigation to ascertain the nature and origin of the drone.
Police claimed the Sheikh Landik police post had been targeted repeatedly, with at least 14 terrorist attacks within a month.
Afghan girl killed in blast
A minor Afghan girl was killed and a bridge was destroyed after a powerful IED blast occurred on the Wana-Karikot Road in Lower South Waziristan on Saturday, police officials said.

 

Lower South Waziristan DPO Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir said the explosion took place near a bridge, causing severe structural damage.
According to sources, the bridge collapsed due to the intensity of the blast, disrupting traffic in the area. The explosion also caused partial damage to a nearby house and a private vehicle parked close to the site.
Police said that at the time of the blast, the minor Afghan girl was present on the roof of her house. The force of the explosion caused a portion of the roof to collapsed, leaving her critically injured.
Local residents rushed to the scene and shifted the injured girl to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Wana for emergency treatment. Hospital officials said she was in a critical condition upon arrival and later succumbed to her injuries despite efforts by doctors to save her.
Following the explosion, police cordoned off the area, collected evidence from the site, and launched an investigation to trace the perpetrators and determine the nature of the explosive device.

Chundrigar Road in a “joint operation” declaring it a federal trust property.
In a joint statement, the FIA and ETPB said that the Karachi Cotton Exchange Building is a trust property as per federal government’s gazette notification and hence the title of this property is vested in the federal government. 
During the operation, the statement said, it was found that the Karachi Cotton Association had been illegally occupying the premises, keeping multiple tenants inside the building and charging them rent without any lawful authority.
The two agencies said the premises were secured in the presence of FIA and ETPB officials and representatives of the Karachi Cotton Association (KCA).
“All occupants and tenants were afforded an opportunity to safely retrieve their personal belongings before the premises were sealed under their lock and key,” the statement said, adding that arrangements have been made to facilitate retrieval of remaining valuables and records through a formal application and verification process.

Association terms operation by FIA, Evacuee Trust ‘illegal’

The FIA and ETPB reiterated that they are “fully cognisant that valuables and records may be lying inside” and reaffirmed their commitment to protecting federal assets and taking action against illegal occupation.
However, the KCA strongly condemned the operation, terming it illegal and without lawful authority.
“An unlawful raid was conducted on the Cotton Exchange Building jointly by the Evacuee Trust and the FIA despite the fact that KCA is in lawful possession of the property under a valid lease issued by the Karachi Municipal Corporation, extending up to the year 2081,” said a KCA statement.
The association rejected the classification of the building as an evacuee or trust property, asserting and claimed that the property was purchased by the Karachi Cotton Association Ltd through a registered conveyance deed on in May 1936, prior to 1947, and therefore cannot be treated as abandoned or evacuee property under the law.
“The KCA takes serious objections to the unlawful act of the Evacuee Trust and the FIA and calls upon them to forthwith withdraw the sealing notice if any, and to de-seal the building immediately, failing which the KCA reserves the right to take appropriate action against them as provided by law for the unlawful action, losses to them,” added the KCA statement.
